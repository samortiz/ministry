[1]  The Ministry of God s Word CONTENTS Section One: The Minister
[2]  The Content of the Word and the Transmitting of the Word
[3]  Acts 6:4 says, But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.
[4]  The phrase ministry of the word can be translated as service of the word.
[5]  Ministry refers to the work, while minister refers to the person.
[6]  The ministry of the word occupies a very important place in God s work.
[7]  The Bible shows us that the most important work of God on earth is the speaking out of His word.
[8]  We must be clear before the Lord that God s work is conveyed through His word and His word is released through man.
[9]  The Lord Jesus was the Word becoming flesh on earth.
[10]  He put on the flesh and became a man of flesh.
[11]  In Him, God s word was released in an entirely different way than it was released through the Old Testament prophets.
[12]  In the Old Testament God merely used man s voice to deliver His word.
[13]  We could say that here was a man, and we could also say that here was God s word.
[14]  But when the Lord Jesus came, the word no longer came upon a man, with the word remaining the word and the man remaining man.
[15]  No longer was God s word released through man s voice as a carrier, but the word put on a man.
[16]  There is another kind of minister of the word in the New Testament the apostles.
[17]  The ministry of the word in the Lord Jesus was completely subjective.
[18]  In the Old Testament the ministry of the word was realized when the word came upon a man and the man s voice was used as a carrier.
[19]  In the Lord Jesus the ministry of the word was not through the visitation of the word but through the embodiment of the word as a man.
[20]  Everything that belonged to this man was being employed by the word, because every aspect of this man was in harmony with God s word.
[21]  The difference between the New Testament ministry of the word and the Lord s ministry of the word is this: In the case of the Lord Jesus, who was God s word becoming flesh, first there was God s word and then there was flesh to match this word.
[22]  In order for this flesh to become a minister of the word, it has to be transformed to match the requirement of God s word.
[23]  Today God does not want His word to remain His word alone; He wants His word to be spoken through man s mouth in a way that it is seen as man s word.
[24]  The Bible shows us that God transmits His word in a way that transcends all human concepts.
[25]  According to our concept God can spread His word and make His speaking known in at least two ways.
[26]  First, He could create something in nature similar to a tape recorder that would convey His word to man.
[27]  If man can invent a tape recorder, God certainly can create something in the universe which would faithfully convey His word verbatim.
[28]  Then every so often, it could be turned on and God s word could be played back to man.
[29]  If God used something like a tape recorder to transmit His word, there would be very little chance of error, and God could continually repeat His word.
[30]  As far as content is concerned, the Bible is full of human elements.
[31]  If we remove the human elements from the Bible, not much is left of it.
[32]  Human elements occupy a crucial place in the word of God.
[33]  For example, the book of Galatians speaks of God s promise by referring to the story of Abraham.
[34]  If we removed Abraham s story from the Bible, we would not understand what God s promise is.
[35]  The Lord Jesus is the Lamb of God that redeems man from sin John 1:29 , and the Old Testament speaks of men repeatedly offering sacrifices of bulls and goats.
[36]  Since God s word is full of human elements, God cannot use a tape recorder, thunder, lightning, or angels to communicate His word.
[37]  Human elements must be involved in the communication of His word.
[38]  Because the content is so full of human elements, God must convey it through human elements.
[39]  It is not a matter of receiving a voice from God and then sending this voice out.
[40]  God s word has to pass through our spirit and even our mind, feelings, and understanding and then be converted into our own words before it can be released.
[41]  If we receive a word from God and send out the same word verbatim, we are acting merely as a recording machine.
[42]  The ministry of the word is God s word coming into us and then flowing out from our innermost being to quench others thirst.
[43]  The word remains eternal, excellent, transcendent, divine, holy, and pure.
[44]  We have also seen that the ministry of the word consists of the release of this human-impregnated word through human faculties such as the memory, understanding, thoughts, heart, spirit, and utterance.
[45]  Let us turn our attention to Paul s Epistles to the Corinthians, in particular to the manner in which he fulfilled his ministry of the word.
[46]  A brother once said that of all the books of the Bible, the Corinthian Epistles, and in particular 1 Corinthians 7, show us the peak of human experience.
[47]  Let us turn to 1 Corinthians 14:29-32, which says, And as to prophets, two or three should speak, and the others discern.
[48]  But if something is revealed to another sitting by, the first should be silent.
[49]  For you can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged.
[50]  Prophethood is the highest ministry among all ministries of God s word.
[51]  The Holy Spirit gives the word to the prophets, and the same Spirit is within the prophets.
[52]  It is the spirits of the prophets which enable the prophets to speak God s word.
[53]  But something else is also mentioned: A speaker has to watch to see if others have also received God s word.
[54]  Here we find a basic principle: In releasing God s word, the Holy Spirit decides what should be spoken, but the prophets decide when and how the word should be spoken.
[55]  In principle, the Old Testament ministers were completely objective in nature; they did not have any subjective experience of their own.
[56]  Although Jeremiah, Isaiah, and many other Old Testament prophets had many subjective experiences, these experiences pertained to their personal history only; they were not experiences in the principle of the ministers of the word.
[57]  First Corinthians 7 shows us that Paul was chosen by God to be a minister of His word.
[58]  God perfected him to such an extent that his ministry became the very utterance of the divine inspiration.
[59]  His speaking was so accurate that not a single word missed the mark.
[60]  His word not only contains God s word, but it is so accurate that every sentence and phrase hits the mark.
[61]  God worked on him to the point that his thoughts, words, decisions, and opinions were all approved by God; they were all right and accurate in His eyes.
[62]  With Paul, we can see how God puts His word in man and how He releases it through man.
[63]  Let us again consider Paul s condition in 1 Corinthians 7.
[64]  Verse 6 says, But this I say by way of concession, not by way of command.
[65]  Paul was saying that even though he agreed with the proposition, the matter did not originate from him as a command.
[66]  He was very clear concerning the degree of activity within him.
[67]  When we come to verse 40, we see that this was the word of the Spirit of God.
[68]  This leads us to an important question which needs our attention.
[69]  What is the work of the Holy Spirit within man?
[70]  What do we know about His engraving work in man?
[71]  We must realize that the Spirit of God not only resides in man but is doing an engraving and constituting work in man.
[72]  This constituting work of the Holy Spirit is something that can never be erased.
[73]  Nor are we saying that a man can receive a revelation or introduce a ministry that is not found in the Bible.
[74]  Yet at the same time we have to realize that a knowledge of the Bible alone does not qualify one to preach God s word.
[75]  We must condemn all independent revelations and independent ministries.
[76]  Second Peter 1:20 says, No prophecy of Scripture is of one s own interpretation.
[77]  The word own also can be translated as private.
[78]  This means that God s prophecy cannot be interpreted just according to its immediate context; it cannot be interpreted from just the passage itself.
[79]  In order to speak God s word, we have to realize first of all that it is an undivided whole.
[80]  Psalm 68:18 speaks of the Lord Jesus dispensing gifts at the time of His ascension.
[81]  This is the Old Testament basis of Paul s development in chapters one and four of Ephesians.
[82]  Ephesians 1 tells us that the Lord Jesus ascended to the height and is seated at the right hand of God the Father v. 20 . Then chapter four tells us that in His ascension, the Lord Jesus led captive those who were taken captive by His enemy and gave gifts to men v. 8 . If we look back a little, we will find that this is exactly what Peter said on the day of Pentecost.
[83]  He said, Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He has poured out this which you both see and hear Acts 2:33 .
[84]  Both Peter s word concerning the outpouring at Pentecost as well as Paul s word in Ephesians concerning the ascension and the giving of gifts for the building up of the church were based on a knowledge of the light revealed in Psalm 68.
[85]  Let me repeat: other than the mystery of the Body of Christ, which is composed of Jews and Gentiles, and which is depicted in Ephesians, the New Testament contains nothing new.
[86]  Everything in the New Testament is a further development of the Old Testament.
[87]  The basic principle to remember is that God s light is contained in His Word.
[88]  In order to learn to serve the Lord and be a minister of His word, we have to learn to know His Word.
[89]  Not everyone who is familiar with the Bible can serve as a minister of the word, but those who are not familiar with the Bible will have less of a chance to become a minister of the word.
[90]  We have to take note, for our own sake as well as for the sake of others, that the word released by ministers of the word today cannot be independent from those that are found in the Bible.
[91]  All of the words of the New Testament are based on the words of the Old Testament.
[92]  Hence, all of our speaking today must be based on the speaking of the New Testament and the Old Testament.
[93]  If a man claims that his word is independent, separate, and distinct from the New Testament and the Old Testament, that it bears no correspondence to God s past words, and that it is not based upon them, we can say with certainty that this is heresy; it must be the doctrine of the devil.
[94]  The words released by the ministers of the word must be based on God s previously spoken words on the one hand; however, God must explain and interpret these words to the ministers on the other hand.
[95]  Hence, not everyone who bases his speaking on God s word is a minister of His word.
[96]  God must explain His word to His ministers before they can have the ministry of His word.
[97]  Let us take the Gospel of Matthew as an example and consider how Matthew served as a minister of God s word.
[98]  The Holy Spirit took full control of Matthew when he related the story of the Lord Jesus.
[99]  Matthew 1:23 is a quotation of Isaiah 7: Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel.
[100]  While Matthew was writing his Gospel, the Holy Spirit was enlightening him.
[101]  First Timothy speaks of the history of Adam and Eve in 2:13-14: For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived; but the woman, having been quite deceived, has fallen into transgression.
[102]  Satan did not deceive Adam directly; his deception was aimed at Eve.
[103]  He tempted Eve first, and then Eve tempted Adam.
[104]  First Eve fell as a result of Satan s deception, and then Adam fell as a result of Eve s temptation.
[105]  But in the New Testament, the Holy Spirit opens up this fact to us and shows us that the woman should not be the head in the church; she should not dominate over the man.
[106]  Both prophecies and history require the interpretation of the Holy Spirit.
[107]  There is a third kind of interpretation interpretation by synthesis.
[108]  God assigns a special place for this kind of interpretation for His minister of the word.
[109]  Neither Matthew, Paul, Peter, nor any of the other ministers of the New Testament spoke their own words.
[110]  All their speakings were based on the Old Testament.
[111]  Yet not everyone who reads the Old Testament can speak like Matthew, Paul, or Peter.
[112]  One must have the interpretation of the Holy Spirit before he can have the ministry of the word.
[113]  It is the Holy Spirit who enlightens, who explains the meaning of a word, who finds the facts in the Old Testament, who points out the highlights in these words, and who affords a person the basis for speaking.
[114]  He must also have the Holy Spirit to interpret God s word for him.
[115]  Now we have to go on to consider another, even more important, matter.
[116]  If he does not have a spirit of revelation, he cannot serve as a minister of the word.
[117]  He must have revelation concerning God s Word and must possess the anointing of the Spirit concerning this Word.
[118]  One outstanding characteristic of this book is that it is made up of words spoken by men, yet it is God s word in every sense.
[119]  It was through God s inspiration of and His breath upon Paul that he wrote Romans.
[120]  When God breathes His breath upon His word a second time, when we find light again through the Holy Spirit and the anointing upon His word to see what Paul once saw, we have revelation.
[121]  It is not how much of the Scriptures we understand, how many biblical truths we have seen, or how many verses we can quote.
[122]  These will not constitute us as a minister of the word.
[123]  We need to see the biblical truth, and we need to quote and understand the Bible.
[124]  If we have this basic ingredient, we have the ministry of the word.
[125]  In looking back at church history, we find that God has been taking the way of recovery from the time of Martin Luther.
[126]  God raised up Luther and his contemporaries to usher in the work of recovery.
[127]  There is one thought in the mind of many lovers of the Lord: How far will the Lord go in the way of recovery?
[128]  John 1:1-2 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[129]  Just like the seven deacons in Acts 6 who served by dispensing food to the saints, a minister of the word is one who serves by dispensing the word to others.
[130]  Yet this word is not merely words per se; this word is a person.
[131]  Our Lord taught many things when He was on the earth, and many heard Him.
[132]  In John 8 the Lord Jesus said many things.
[133]  Later He told the Jews that the truth would set them free and that they did not have to remain slaves but could be free instead.
[134]  Yet the Lord Jesus said something very peculiar: He who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God v. 47 . Hearing something involves more than just hearing the voice.
[135]  Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus said that those who are of God hear God s words but that the others did not hear because they were not of God.
[136]  It is related to the things behind the outward words.
[137]  A man can only see these things when his condition before God is proper.
[138]  Brothers, a man can touch the Bible, but that does not mean he is touching God s word.
[139]  A minister of God s word is one who has received the revelation of Christ.
[140]  One must not only be able to speak the word with his mouth but must know in an inward way that Jesus is indeed the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[141]  Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[142]  This statement only takes a few minutes to memorize, but the Lord said, Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens Matt 16:17 .
[143]  He is a man to whom God has chosen to reveal His Son; he has a basic revelation that enables him to know who Jesus of Nazareth is.
[144]  What does it mean for God to reveal His Son in us?
[145]  We cannot describe this; no one can describe it.
[146]  Some people can say that they have seen the revelation, whereas others are unable to say this.
[147]  The basic issue is: Are you simply ministering to others from this book, the Bible, or are you one who has met Christ and who has a revelation of Christ?
[148]  Are you one who has met and encountered the Lord fundamentally?
[149]  If you do, you will spontaneously say, Thank God, many things in the Bible are clear to me now.
[150]  Once you have the subjective knowledge, you will find God s word understandable and self-harmonizing when you study it again.
[151]  In order to be a minister of the word, we must begin by having a knowledge of Christ.
[152]  Only after we have known Christ will we know the Bible, and only then will we be able to serve as a minister of the word.
[153]  Anything short of that will not qualify us to be a minister of the word.
[154]  We can say that a minister of the word translates Christ into the Bible, that is, he takes the word of the Bible and uses it to tell others about Christ.
[155]  In the end the Holy Spirit translates the words of the Bible back into Christ within those who have received the word.
[156]  This is what it means to be a minister of the word.
[157]  You must know Christ, and you must have a basic revelation and fundamental knowledge.
[158]  We have seen that God s speaking, both through the Old Testament ministry of the word as well as through the New Testament ministry, contains human elements.
[159]  But there is a danger: If a man does not have an ear and tongue of an instructed one Isa 50:4 , he will project himself into God s word.
[160]  If a man has not been dealt with and has not gone through the molding work of the Holy Spirit, it will be very easy to inject his own thoughts and feelings into God s word.
[161]  When this happens, God s word is contaminated and defiled by man.
[162]  Therefore, in order to secure a pure ministry of the word, God has to work on man; the outward man must be broken.
[163]  A minister of God s word must come under severe restriction and divine discipline.
[164]  Because the Holy Spirit had done such a deep constituting work in him, however, his speaking became God s speaking, his judgment became God s judgment, and his approval and disapproval became God s approval and disapproval.
[165]  In speaking of ministry, we have to realize that there are two kinds of revelations.
[166]  The first is a basic revelation that is once for all.
[167]  After receiving such a revelation, we will find what we have already seen of the Lord whenever we open up the Bible.
[168]  When you receive your basic revelation for the first time, you realize that the Bible is living.
[169]  For example, you may see that Christ is your holiness, with emphasis on the word is.
[170]  Christ is your holiness; it is not a matter of Christ making you holy.
[171]  We must realize that there are two different realms.
[172]  In this realm a man only needs to convey to others what he has learned from school, books, and Bible expositors.
[173]  In this realm a man can do nothing unless he has God s revelation.
[174]  If God does not speak, we cannot force any word out of our mouth.
[175]  The starting point of the ministry of the word is revelation.
[176]  Once revelation comes, God shines in us, and we feel that we have a little light within.
[177]  However, even though we seem to see something within, this light does not seem to remain for long.
[178]  It seems as if we have seen something, and yet we cannot say what we have seen.
[179]  To deny that we have seen anything is wrong because we clearly have seen something.
[180]  This brings us to our second subject translating light into thoughts.
[181]  The starting point of the ministry of the word is God s shining and enlightening within us.
[182]  The shining disappears in a moment; then we forget about it after a while.
[183]  No one can make this fleeting light the basis of his ministry of the word.
[184]  Some may ask, Does not 1 Corinthians 2:13 teach us that spiritual things require no human wisdom?
[185]  We have to realize that this verse refers to the breaking of the outward man.
[186]  If our mind can be like a servant standing at the door of God s light, waiting for its shining and looking for the interpretation of its meaning, it is the best servant of all.
[187]  But if the mind is not employed in the interpretation of light and instead is being used to devise one s own thoughts, it is the worst master of all.
[188]  We have to treasure and conserve every bit and every drop of our mental energy.
[189]  The more powerful and enriched our thoughts are, the higher we will climb.
[190]  We should never waste our thoughts on useless things.
[191]  If a man wastes and squanders his thoughts on vain things, how can he have any capacity for thoughts pertaining to God?
[192]  Burden in Hebrew is massa, which is used in two ways.
[193]  One way is found in the Pentateuch, which means a bearable load cf.
[194]  After we receive light from God and after we have the thoughts, we only have enough material to have a burden, but this is not enough to discharge it.
[195]  Light and thoughts can only become our burden; they cannot serve to discharge our burden.
[196]  Light and thoughts must first become words to us; the thoughts must first become words before we can release these words through our voice to the outside world.
[197]  When God gives us a revelation in our spirit, we have the shining.
[198]  However, the shining does not stop with God s revelation in our spirit.
[199]  We have to retain the light with our thoughts.
[200]  We have to ask God for further shining, not for a shining in our spirit which communicates its meaning to us, but for a shining that conveys words which translate the meaning of the light into words.
[201]  Since the discharge of a burden is related closely to the inner words, how can we receive the inner words?
[202]  Most of the time, we receive the inner words through reading the Bible and in our moments of waiting upon God.
[203]  Suppose we receive some intense light, and the Lord mercifully grants us an active, creative, and energetic mind to capture the light.
[204]  God s revelation has already generated some benefit in us; it has become permanent, specific, and tangible thoughts in us.
[205]  We have mentioned previously that sometimes light is accompanied by God s word when it is translated into thoughts, and that it is this word which enables us to be a minister of the word.
[206]  Three necessary steps constitute the ministry of the word: light, thoughts, and word.
[207]  There are two aspects of the word: the inner words and the outer words.
[208]  In order to simplify things, we should say that there are four steps: light, thoughts, the inner words, and the outer words.
[209]  When God s word was spoken through Peter, the teaching was God s, but the flavor was Peter s. When God s word was spoken through John, the teaching was God s, but the flavor was John s. When God s word was spoken through Paul, the teaching was God s, but the flavor was Paul s. Human elements are present in the ministry of God s word.
[210]  In preparing the outer words, we have to pay attention to the words of the Scripture.
[211]  When we have the inner words and try to release them to others, we often find that we are short of words.
[212]  For the most part, we aim our utterance in a particular direction and exhaust our words in a few minutes.
[213]  If we repeat the same word once, twice, or ten times, others will be bored by our speaking; they will not appreciate it.
[214]  How do we know whether our speaking is on the right track?
[215]  As we speak, we have to be attentive to whether our burden is being reduced or whether it is becoming heavier.
[216]  We do not have to wait until we step down from the platform to find out whether or not we are speaking on the right track; we can sense this as we are speaking.
[217]  Whenever a word goes out from our mouth, our burden should be reduced a little.
[218]  Three things God s word, His light, and our thoughts constitute a burden.
[219]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE SPIRIT S DISCIPLINE AND THE WORD
[220]  A minister of God s word does not just use his mind to think of words to say; his words must come from another source.
[221]  Let us now examine the source from which he derives his speaking.
[222]  Once we know the source, we will realize that many things should not come out of our mouth; they cannot be considered as God s word.
[223]  We should also remember that in the function of the ministry of the word, God first gives man a word or two, which he then develops into many further words.
[224]  When a minister of the word stands up to speak, he uses his own words, yet he is speaking the word which God has spoken within him.
[225]  When the Lord was on the earth, He was the Word becoming flesh; God was speaking through the flesh.
[226]  Today God is again manifesting His word in the flesh; He is still embodying His word in a person.
[227]  This is why God has to deal with our flesh today.
[228]  He has to deal with our flesh to such an extent that the release of a word from our flesh is the release of the word of God.
[229]  A minister of God s word must allow the Spirit to constitute him to such an extent that the word is no longer objective, but subjective.
[230]  What is the goal of ministering to others with the word?
[231]  The purpose of ministering to others is not merely to deliver them out of their dire situations or to bring them through their trials.
[232]  We must have a specific goal in ministering to others: The goal is that they would know the Lord.
[233]  We should realize that the ultimate goal of the ministry of the word is to lead men to know Christ.
[234]  When God puts us in a certain environment or allows us to face certain difficulties, we are faced with a great sense of need; we find that we are forced to seek the Lord.
[235]  In fulfilling the ministry of the word, a man s memory occupies a very important place.
[236]  Its significance goes far beyond what men ordinarily imagine.
[237]  This is another matter in which we should exercise ourselves before the Lord.
[238]  First, our spirit sees something; second, our thoughts capture it; and third, we have a word within us.
[239]  This word contains thoughts, and it also contains light.
[240]  We can say that it is a word, yet this word is an inner seeing, an inner revelation; it is not merely a word.
[241]  But sometimes the Lord does not want to use our outward memory.
[242]  Sometimes we have the word within; we have the word of God s revelation, and we also have the memory of the Holy Spirit.
[243]  We should also pay attention to the matter of quoting the Scripture.
[244]  In delivering God s word, we have to follow the example of the apostles who quoted from the Old Testament.
[245]  When we speak on a certain subject, we should quote from the Old and New Testaments.
[246]  If we do not have God s present word, we would do just as well if we came together and studied the Scripture together without any special speaking.
[247]  In previous chapters we have said that a minister of the word needs four things.
[248]  Two of these things, light and the inner words, are of God, while the other two, thoughts and memory, are of the minister himself.
[249]  Before a minister of the word opens his mouth to speak, he needs to have two things available to him his own thoughts and his memory.
[250]  While he is speaking, he also needs two more things proper feelings and a proper spirit.
[251]  In reading the Bible, we find one outstanding feature in all the writers of the books: Their feelings were never a hindrance to them in their ministry of the word.
[252]  While a minister of the word is speaking, it is not enough for him to release words alone.
[253]  If the obstacles mentioned above are not dealt with, nothing will happen even if one has light, thoughts, the inner word, the memory, and the outer words; all of these will be vain.
[254]  It is a big problem for our feeling to be different from the feeling in God s word.
[255]  Today we should not try to touch the feeling of the Bible in an outward way.
[256]  Rather, we should speak with our feelings when we exercise our inner being to speak from the Bible.
[257]  We should not merely know how to apply our feelings.
[258]  We also should know how to take the right way to acquire feelings that are proper and usable.
[259]  This leads to a consideration of our basic experience, which is the breaking of our outer man.
[260]  In the previous discussion of the minister as a person, we paid special attention to the breaking of the outer man.
[261]  Unless the outer man is broken, the Lord s word cannot be released.
[262]  We need to see how the Lord breaks our outer man and how He prepares our feelings for the ministry of the word.
[263]  Now let us turn to the matter of the word and the release of the spirit.
[264]  Whether or not the spoken word is received as revelation or merely doctrine depends very much on whether the minister is releasing his spirit.
[265]  Whether or not others hear just words or hear the words and see the light depends on whether the minister s spirit is released.
[266]  Whether or not a person falls on his face at the word or remains unchanged depends on whether the minister can release his spirit.
[267]  It is something that they can understand, but they do not touch God s word.
[268]  The exercise of the spirit of a minister of the word depends on two things.
[269]  First, there is the training of the spirit; second, there is the willingness on the part of the minister.
[270]  Whether or not a minister can exercise his spirit to minister to the church and the extent to which and the areas in which he is able to exercise his spirit depend entirely on the amount of experience he has related to these two things.
[271]  First, let us speak of the training of the spirit.
[272]  A minister of the word cannot release his spirit more than what he has learned to release.
[273]  The extent to which his spirit is released is determined by the amount of training he has received from God in his spirit.
[274]  But if he has received strict and repeated trainings in his spirit, it will be easy and spontaneous for him to exercise his spirit in the ministry of the word.
[275]  The exercise of a minister s spirit is something that demands his life.
[276]  He has to put his life on the line.
[277]  When a person serves as a minister of the word, he must not only have a useful spirit, but he must be willing to sacrifice and expend his spirit.
[278]  Every time a person serves as a minister of the word and ministers the word to others, he has to exercise his spirit by pouring out his life, just as the Lord Jesus did when He poured out His life.
[279]  The night the Lord prayed in the garden of Gethsemane, He said to the disciples, The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak Matt 26:41 .
[280]  Every genuine minister of the word knows what it means to push out the spirit.
[281]  As he speaks, he has to exert his strength, not his fleshly strength, but another kind of strength.
[282]  It seems as if he has to exert all his energy to press out his spirit.
[283]  When the word goes out, the spirit is pushed out and released at the same time.
[284]  Whether his audience hears a doctrine or God s word depends on how he pushes out his spirit.
[285]  The release of the spirit means the release of the Holy Spirit.
[286]  His intention is for the church to be the innermost being out of which will flow rivers of living water of the Spirit John 7:38 .
[287]  The release of the spirit is also the release of power.
[288]  Whether or not a stubborn man will be subdued depends on the amount of spiritual power that is released.
[289]  If our spirit is strong, he will be subdued.
[290]  As long as a person is not completely closed which makes it impossible to do anything , he will be subdued when your spirit is released in a powerful way, even if such a person is very stubborn by nature.
[291]  There are underlying principles to the release of the spirit.
[292]  The amount of spirit that is released by a person depends on two things: the amount of his willingness and the amount of pressure that he sustains.
[293]  As we come to the meeting, God may give us a certain amount of pressure.
[294]  If the pressure is heavy and abiding, we can be certain that God wants our spirit to burst forth.
[295]  Our word must be backed up by the spirit.
[296]  But in order to release a spirit that is pure and clean, we have to go through dealings.
[297]  One thing is certain: The kind of spirit that we have determines the kind of expression of the Holy Spirit that we bear.
[298]  The kind of nature that we have dictates the aspect of the Holy Spirit that we express.
[299]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN A FEW THINGS TO PAY ATTENTION TO
[300]  Serving as a minister of the word is an altogether new thing to us; we have never done such a thing before in our life.
[301]  We are like newborn babes who have never learned to speak.
[302]  We have lived on this earth for many years and have been speaking for all these years.
[303]  In learning to be a minister of the word, we should forget about our previous speaking and preaching experience.
[304]  THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD NOT BEING OUT OF TOUCH
[305]  When a minister of the word opens his mouth, he may have four or five passages he wants to cover.
[306]  He may have four or five verses he wants to speak or four or five things he wants to say.
[307]  The order of the verses matters a great deal in the release of the spirit.
[308]  The Spirit may want to place a passage at the end of his speaking, while he may put it at the beginning of his speaking.
[309]  Some words should be spoken at the beginning, but we speak them at the end. Some words should be spoken at the end, but we speak them at the beginning.
[310]  The first way is to put the spirit into the word and then to push out the word with the spirit.
[311]  The second way to speak is to follow the anointing.
[312]  The spirit takes the lead, and the word follows the anointing.
[313]  When the spirit and the word are joined together, there are these two different ways to release them.
[314]  In our speaking, we must also pay attention to our mind.
[315]  Whether a word should be spoken first or last is a decision that rests with the mind.
[316]  In our service as a minister of the word, our mind occupies a very important place.
[317]  If our mental faculty is versatile, we can place a word at the beginning of our speaking or at the end. Either place will fit, and the spirit will be released during the speaking.
[318]  In such a case, whether the word comes to our mind at the beginning of the speaking or at the end, the spirit is not released in our speaking.
[319]  In our speaking, it is easy for us to know the climax of our speaking because our mind easily can identify it, but it is not easy to know the climax of the spirit.
[320]  The climax of the spirit is something that is unknown to our mind.
[321]  This is the reason that it is not easy to tell the climax of the spirit.
[322]  While we are standing on the platform and speaking, how do we know how far God wants to go?
[323]  In his speaking, a minister of the word has to pay attention to the difference between the climax of the word and the climax of the spirit.
[324]  If our condition is right, we should clearly know the particular word that God has given to us whenever we open our mouth to speak for the Lord.
[325]  When we speak as a minister of the word, we have to exercise our mind.
[326]  We typically speak whatever comes to our mind; whatever we think of, we speak.
[327]  Yet our mind must have some substance; it must not be full of vanity or aimless thoughts.
[328]  The raw materials from which we formulate our speaking come from whatever we have learned previously, whatever our mind is occupied with, whatever we have experienced and seen in the past, and whatever breaking work we have experienced.
[329]  When we stand up to speak for the Lord, God s Spirit will direct our mind to search through our memory to put all the things we have acquired to use.
[330]  We must realize that the spirit flows out of us only when our feelings match our words.
[331]  If there is a little reservation in our feelings about the word we have received from the spirit, the word will not come out, and the spirit will not be released.
[332]  We may discount our words or hold back the feelings we should have concerning our word.
[333]  Once they learn this, they will know under what circumstances God will use them.
[334]  Even a blind man will not be lost and a lame man will not be put out of joint by God s word.
[335]  If God s word were a riddle, it would mean that it was not written for man to understand.
[336]  Therefore, every minister of God s word should learn to speak in a plain way.
[337]  It is harder for us to speak today than for those who spoke one hundred years ago, and harder still than for those who spoke four or five hundred years ago.
[338]  It is harder for us to speak than it was for Martin Luther, because the release of God s word is always advancing onward and upward.
[339]  The more we speak God s word, the more profound it becomes and the higher it gets.
[340]  Today God s speaking has reached the present stage, and we cannot go back to His former speaking again.
[341]  Now we come to the fourth section, the audience.
[342]  Speaking involves not only the minister but the audience, that is, those who listen to the word.
[343]  The minister of the word has much to do with the speaking, but the audience has something to do with it also.
[344]  While the minister of the word bears more than half of the responsibility, the audience bears at least some of the responsibility also.
[345]  Whether or not the word can be released depends largely on the ministers, but the audience has its responsibility also.
[346]  First Corinthians 1:19 says, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of those who understand I will set aside.
[347]  The purpose of doing this is that no flesh may boast before God v. 29 . Simply put, God does not want us to be proud.
[348]  God does not want anyone to be wise or understanding.
[349]  On the one hand, we have our own wisdom; on the other hand, we need power.
[350]  Romans 11:8 says, As it is written, God gave them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes to see not and ears to hear not, until this very day.
[351]  This verse says that God has given the Jews a spirit of deep sleep.
[352]  They have eyes, but they cannot see; they have ears, but they cannot hear until this very day.
[353]  The situation in Matthew 13 is more serious than the situation in Matthew 11.
[354]  We should go to the Lord and beg like those who beg for bread.
[355]  We should never presume that we have it already.
[356]  If we are willing to be a proper audience of the word, that is, if we are willing to receive the word and not give resistance to God s word, we will touch something in the ministry, and God s blessings and light will shine on us.
