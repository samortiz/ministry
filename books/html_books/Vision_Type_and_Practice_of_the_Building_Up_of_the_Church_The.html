<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in the service meetings of the church in Taipei from November 1958 to January 1959. According to a report in <em>Church News,</em> Brother Lee gave a series of messages concerning the building of God in a conference for the island of Taiwan from October 26 to November 4, 1958. These messages were published in the book entitled <em>The Building Work of God.</em> Then in response to an invitation from the church in Taipei, he fellowshipped with the responsible saints concerning the relationship between building and service. There were sixteen service meetings. The eighth meeting involved fellowship concerning how to lead the young people and is published in the booklet entitled <em>How to Lead the Young People,</em> and the fourteenth meeting involved fellowship concerning the practice of preaching the gospel by the church. The remaining fourteen meetings are included in this book. These messages were originally published in Chinese in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> magazine from 1959 to 1960.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEED OF A VISION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:11-13, 15-16</h1>
<p>In this book we will see how to be built up and how to build up the church. How to be built up emphasizes our being built up, and how to build up the church emphasizes our serving for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>A person&rsquo;s service is governed by his spiritual knowledge. In other words, our service is governed by our vision. Our service before the Lord will match our spiritual knowledge. For example, 1 John 1:2 says, &ldquo;The life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life.&rdquo; Eternal life was John&rsquo;s vision. Hence, when he preached the salvation of God, he brought people to know and to receive eternal life. The extent of our service is determined by the extent of our knowledge concerning spiritual matters. Our spiritual knowledge always   governs our service. Hence, we will first speak of the vision concerning the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S INTENTION</h2>
<p>The Lord is leading us to see that His intention is not merely to save thousands of individuals. He wants to gain a corporate Body, the church. According to Ephesians, the church that God intends to gain is a Body, a dwelling place, the new man, and a counterpart (3:6; 2:22, 15; 5:31-32). The Body, dwelling place, new man, and counterpart are all corporate. A body is an entity composed of many members coordinated together. A dwelling place is a structure built with different materials. Concerning the church as the new man, God has not only saved the Jews and Gentiles; He has also created the two into one new man. No matter how many Jews and Gentiles are saved, in God&rsquo;s eyes they are one new man. In chapter 5 this new man is the wife, the counterpart, of Christ. Of course, Christ has only one counterpart. Although the Bible uses other titles besides these four in reference to the church, these four titles clearly portray the church as a corporate entity.</p>
<p>Due to the inadequacy of our vocabulary to define the church, we borrowed a common expression and say that the church is a corporate entity. However, we should never think that the church as a corporate entity resembles a human organization. The church is not an organization; it is a group of persons who have received the Holy Spirit, God&rsquo;s life, and all the fullness of the Godhead in Christ and who are being coordinated as the Body of Christ, built up as a dwelling place, and produced as the new man. This new man is the wife, the counterpart, of Christ. In God&rsquo;s eyes the church is composed of all the saints. The entire Bible shows that, universally speaking, the church is the totality of all the believers.</p>
<p>In time, however, the church needs to be expressed in the places where people live. Thus, there are churches in different localities. Since the people who constitute the church live in communities when they are saved by God, they cannot detach themselves from their communities after they are saved. Therefore, in His wisdom God has caused His church to be expressed in place after place. In a large city, where many people are saved, the expression of the church is large. In a small village, where fewer people are saved, the expression of the church is smaller. However, regardless of the place and of whether the expression of the church is large or small, there can only be one expression. In a small place the expression cannot be less than one, nor can the expression be more than one in a large place. No matter how large a city may be or how small a village may be, the expression of the church in that place is always one. There is one church in the universe, and there is also one expression of the church in any one place.</p>
<p>When the apostles were alive and the church was not divided or in confusion, there was only one expression of the church in any given place. A person could not find more than one church in Jerusalem. Similarly, there was only one church in Antioch. Locally there is only one church in one place, and universally there is only one church. Unlike today, when there are many congregations with different names, the early church was not a special organization, nor did it have a special name. In the apostles&rsquo; time a person could find only one church wherever he went, and that church was the local expression of the universal church in that place.</p>
<p>Later, the church fell into confusion and was divided. The more the church divides, the more confused the situation becomes. It seems as though God has no intention to solve the problem of division. He does not like division, but He seems to tolerate it and allow it to continue. God will always desire to have a group of people who care for His intention and take the way that He ordains, that is, to be overcomers. This means that although God tolerates confusion, He still desires to have a group of people who care for His heart and who rise up to serve Him and bear His testimony according to His original intention. He wants His believers to be overcomers, to return to the original position and condition of the church. He still desires to gain a group of people, who love Him with a pure heart, to be the church bearing the proper testimony of Christ His Son in every place.</p>
<p>If we see this revelation, our service will not consist merely of having a zeal for the gospel and of helping others to love the Lord fervently and consecrate themselves to live for the Lord. Even helping them to pursue spirituality and to live an overcoming and sanctified life are not adequate. The earth is filled with sects, confusion, and division, but the Lord has commissioned us to rise up to be the overcomers in this age of desolation, that is, to be the testimony of the church in every place.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HUMAN EMPHASIS</h2>
<p>Orthodox Christianity focuses on the following three matters: zeal for the gospel, loving the Lord and living for Him, and pursuing spirituality in order to live a holy, overcoming life. These are the three main lines in today&rsquo;s orthodox Christianity. Those who emphasize zealously preaching the gospel feel that nothing is more important than saving souls. Those who emphasize loving the Lord and living for Him have taken a further step. They feel that since they have received the Lord&rsquo;s grace, they should love Him fervently and live for Him. Everything they have is for Him. Those in the third group have taken another step. They want to learn to live in the spirit in order to live a holy, overcoming life.</p>
<p>These three items are correct and good. However, the vision that we have seen is not merely to preach the gospel zealously, to love the Lord and live for Him, or to be spiritual and live a holy and overcoming life. The vision that the Lord has given us is for us to be built up together in His life and in the Spirit to be His Body, the church. We cannot be individualistic and just preach the gospel zealously and save sinners, or love the Lord and live for Him, or pursue spirituality and live a holy, overcoming life. We must be built up together in the life of Christ in order to be one Body as His corporate vessel, and we must be built up together in the Spirit in order to be the temple of God as His dwelling place.</p>
<p>Some people are indeed zealous for the gospel and are willing to pay the price by spending their time and effort to save souls. However, because they have not consecrated themselves to the Lord nor allowed Him to touch certain areas of their being, they feel that their service of preaching the gospel is the unique need. As a result, they can see only this point. Furthermore, although their conduct has changed such that they are moral and good persons, they do not let the Lord be their Lord, they do not allow Him to touch them, nor do they care for His intention. Believers in this category zealously preach the gospel, but they have not consecrated themselves to the Lord.</p>
<p>The second category of brothers and sisters not only preach the gospel zealously but also love the Lord and consecrate themselves willingly. They surrender their rights to the Lord and let Him touch everything in their life and living. Although they testify that they live for the Lord, they still live by the self because they do not yet know the flesh. It seems as if they do not live for themselves, but actually they live by the self because they do not live in the spirit. They do not know the meaning of walking and living according to the spirit.</p>
<p>The third category of believers not only preach the gospel zealously and consecrate themselves to live for the Lord; they also learn to live in the spirit. In everything they ask whether it is what the Lord wants or what they want, whether it is His doing or their doing, and whether their conduct is according to the self or according to the Spirit. In every situation they learn to live before the Lord and in the Lord. However, their spirituality seems to be individualistic, and their living is personal. They are in the church, but they live an isolated and individualistic life. They have contact with other brothers and sisters and may even give a message, but they are not blended and cannot coordinate with others. Such believers can be compared to a drop of oil in water. Although the oil is in water, it is not blended with the water. These believers may be very spiritual and live before the Lord, but they do not know the meaning of coordinating in the Body of Christ. Hence, they are not built up together with others in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER SITUATION</h2>
<p>Through the Lord&rsquo;s light we have seen that these three situations cannot match the standard of God&rsquo;s intention. According to His intention, the service that God desires is not merely zealous preaching of the gospel. In many places there are some believers who constantly preach the gospel. These believers are content to preach the gospel so that people can hear the name of the Lord Jesus and receive salvation, but they do not care for God&rsquo;s desire. It is right to preach the gospel zealously, but we cannot be satisfied with this, because the vision of the church has been made manifest to us.</p>
<p>It is still not adequate for us to take a further step and consecrate our lives and all that we have to the Lord. We still must learn to live in the Lord and in the spirit. Before we do anything, we must have a sense of whether or not our doing is of the Lord.</p>
<p>Even though the third situation seems to be spiritual and quite acceptable, we should not be satisfied with it; we must advance further. The light we have received and the vision we have seen are that God desires to gain a group of believers who are built up into a dwelling place and coordinated to be the Body. God does not want us to merely preach the gospel zealously and save souls, or to merely consecrate ourselves to live for Him, or to merely be spiritual and live an overcoming life. He wants to have a group of believers who are built up together to be His spiritual house and are coordinated together to be the Body.</p>
<p>We know that we should preach the gospel, but we are not satisfied with merely preaching the gospel, because God is not satisfied. We know that we need to love the Lord, live for Him, and have a thorough consecration, but we cannot be satisfied or at rest in our spirit with this, because God is neither satisfied nor at rest. We should go further and learn to be spiritual, to live in the spirit, and to have a spiritual living. However, we still cannot be satisfied or at rest with this, because God is still not satisfied and cannot rest. The vision that God has shown us is that we should be built together in the spirit and in life with all those who love Him with a pure heart to be His spiritual house so that we can be coordinated together to express the Body of Christ. When this vision is fulfilled, we will be satisfied and have rest because God will also be satisfied and have rest.</p>
<p>If we read from Genesis to Revelation with the view of God&rsquo;s intention, we can see that God desires to gain a city, not merely thousands of saved individuals. He does not want to display to the universe many beautifully carved precious stones. He wants a city that is built with many precious stones. Just as God does not want many materials but a building, so He does not want many spiritual people but a Body, a dwelling place, the new man, and a counterpart.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no place for personal zeal or personal consecration in God&rsquo;s intention, nor is there a place for personal spirituality. Instead of asking whether there are gold, silver, and precious stones, or wood, grass, and stubble, we should ask whether the gold, silver, and precious stones are separate or built together, whether they are scattered or built up, and whether they are the issue of individual spirituality or of built-up spirituality. The Lord has given us the vision of the church; hence, we have seen that having proper conduct and being spiritual are not adequate. Not only is there no place for wood, grass, and stubble, but there is also no place for gold, silver, and precious stones unless they are built up.</p>
<p>This vision should capture and control us so that instead of being individualistic in our zeal, our love for the Lord, our consecration to live for Him, or our spirituality, we would be built up together. We must be built up together.</p>
<p>We rejoice and worship the Lord when we see a brother zealously preaching the gospel, distributing gospel tracts, and exhorting people to believe in the Lord, and we are sorrowful when we see a brother arguing with other people. Nevertheless, we must be clear that zealously preaching the gospel is not up to the standard of God&rsquo;s vision concerning the church.</p>
<p>Similarly, we rejoice to see brothers and sisters serving and laboring for the Lord and letting Him control their time, energy, and money. These believers do not care only for themselves, nor do they put the Lord aside and labor for themselves. However, we cannot be satisfied with this service, because the vision that we have received does not stop with consecrating ourselves to live for the Lord.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we rejoice and give thanks to the Lord when we see a brother who not only loves the Lord fervently and willingly gives everything to Him but also has his being and living in the spirit. Nevertheless, the vision that we have received does not stop with such a living. Can such a brother be built up with others? A person may be spiritual yet individualistic; he does not blend with others, nor can he coordinate with others. Such a person has learned spiritual lessons and is careful to live in the spirit. He is not offensive, does not speak casually, and does not voice his opinions, but like a drop of oil in water, he is unable to blend with other believers. It is not a matter of being in harmony with others but of blending with them. Such a person is individualistic and cannot blend with anyone.</p>
<p>Perhaps such a person does not think that he is individualistic, because he still meets with the brothers and sisters in the church. He may meet with the saints but not be blended with them in the spirit. Instead of arguing with others or criticizing them, he may express his so-called spirituality, saying, &ldquo;I dare not say anything with regard to this matter. If you feel that this is of the Lord, go ahead and do it.&rdquo; If he is asked to intercede for a certain matter, he might pray, &ldquo;Lord, if this matter is of You, bless it. If it is not of You, please intervene.&rdquo; This brother holds the attitude of a spectator. The affairs of the saints, whether right or wrong, do not have anything to do with him. Hence, even though he may express a certain degree of spirituality with the brothers and sisters, he does not blend with them, nor is he built up with them.</p>
<p>The more spiritual such a believer is, the more individualistic he becomes. He may even think that his individualism is acceptable, because others have not achieved his spiritual height and thus neither understand nor appreciate him. He may say that all spiritual people take the lonesome path, which only the Lord knows. He may think that the brothers and sisters are his cross and that he should pray for those who cannot keep up with him and do not understand him and, hence, do not know the Lord. Such reasoning causes him to be isolated and to despise the other saints. As a result, his isolation, not the Body, is built up. This isolation becomes a stronghold that cannot be torn down, and this makes it impossible for him to be built up in the church.</p>
<p>We need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to see that such a condition is abnormal and does not match the standard of the building. Being spiritual should not result in being individualistic; it should rather result in being built up with all the saints. Being spiritual should not result in living individualistically before the Lord. Being spiritual should result in our apprehending the breadth, length, height, and depth with all the saints (Eph. 3:18). The more genuine our spirituality is, the more we will lose our individualism and enter into the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONDITION THAT BRINGS IN THE BLESSING</h2>
<p>We should ask ourselves about whether the church is being built up, and about the condition of our service. Do we merely have a zeal for the gospel? Have we consecrated ourselves to the Lord? Are we learning to be spiritual? We also need to consider before the Lord whether we are content with being spiritual and whether we are blended with others. To be blended is not merely to be in harmony in a fleshly way, like people in the world. To be blended involves being one with others in the spirit, in our service, in the church, and in the Lord&rsquo;s work. Can the elders, the co-workers, and the district responsible ones be one with one another? I am concerned that our spirituality is not blended.</p>
<p>Whether or not the church can be blessed hinges on this vision. If we, the co-workers, elders, and district responsible ones, focus on individual spirituality and do a work of individual spirituality, we will not bring in much spiritual blessing. If we are not built up to be a dwelling place, there will not be a vessel that can contain and keep the blessing that descends from heaven. We have the materials, but they are scattered. Christians who love the world and also those who are spiritual are scattered materials. Christians who love the world are not blended, and the so-called spiritual Christians are not blended. Just as the Christians who love the world are not built up, cannot bring in the blessing for the church, and cannot bear the testimony of the church, so also spiritual Christians are not built up, cannot bring in the blessing for the church, and cannot manifest the testimony of the church.</p>
<p>Ephesians is not the only book that says all spirituality should be for the coordination of the Body and the building up of the church (4:11-12). For example, Romans deals with the spiritual stages of the Christian life, but after speaking of justification (ch. 4), sanctification (6:19), and the Spirit of life (8:1-2), it also presents the Body of Christ (12:1-8). A genuinely consecrated person, who presents his body as a living sacrifice, should live in the Body of Christ and coordinate together with all the saints as members of one Body.</p>
<p>May the Lord show us our real situation and cause us to be those who are controlled by this vision so that our service and our work will be for the building up of the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">BUILDING AND BLESSING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:11-13, 15-16; 1 Cor. 12:13-14, 22-25; Rom. 12:1-8</h1>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-13 says, &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&rdquo; According to the original language, the phrase <em>a full-grown man</em> refers to a perfect, complete, and mature man. This full-grown man is the Body of Christ in the preceding verse. Hence, the growth implied in the word <em>full-grown</em> is the building up in verse 12.</p>
<p>Verses 15 and 16 say, &ldquo;Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; The word <em>itself</em> refers to the Body, the church. The church must endeavor to build itself up in love.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:13-14 says, &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit. For the body is not one member but many.&rdquo; Ephesians 4:16 says that the Body builds itself up in love, whereas 1 Corinthians 12:13 says that we become the Body by being baptized in one Spirit.</p>
<p>Verses 22 through 25 say, &ldquo;The members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. And those members of the body which we consider to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor; and our uncomely members come to have more abundant comeliness, but our comely members have no need. But God has blended the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked, that there would be no division in the body, but that the members would have the same care for one another.&rdquo; These verses say that God has blended, coordinated, the Body together.</p>
<p>Romans 12:1-8 says, &ldquo;I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service. And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect. For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think so as to be sober-minded, as God has apportioned to each a measure of faith. For just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another. And having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; or service, let us be faithful in that service; or he who teaches, in that teaching; or he who exhorts, in that exhortation; he who gives, in simplicity; he who leads, in diligence; he who shows mercy, in cheerfulness.&rdquo; Our consecration and functioning in the church are for the building up of the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S CHILDREN LACKING<br />
THE CONCEPT OF BUILDING</h2>
<p>These portions of Scripture show that the goal of God&rsquo;s work in this age is the building. God gives the church various gifts, such as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers for this building up (Eph. 4:11-12). He pours out the Holy Spirit upon the saints also for this building up. Even His giving some saints the small service of having the heart and the ability to give to the needy in the church is for the building up of the Body (Rom. 12:8; 1 Cor. 12:28). In other words, not only the work done by the gifts&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers&mdash;is for God&rsquo;s building, but even the activities in our ordinary spiritual life, including exhorting, giving, showing mercy, and helping, are for the building up of the Body.</p>
<p>For a long time I have had the feeling before the Lord that although God&rsquo;s children are touching many spiritual things, they do not have any consciousness related to building. For example, many people zealously preach the gospel, but they do not have a consciousness of the need for building up the Body of Christ. They simply feel that they must preach salvation in order to save sinners, who are destined to be in the lake of fire. These believers do not sense that God wants them to preach the gospel in order to prepare materials for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>In the book of Haggai God commanded the people of Israel to &ldquo;go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house&rdquo; (1:8). Hence, when the Israelites cut down trees, they were clear within that what they were doing was for the building of the holy temple. Likewise, Ephesians 4 shows that the various God-given gifts are for the building up of the Body of Christ. The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers all work to build up the Body of Christ. Hence, if someone were to ask why we are preaching the gospel, we should reply, &ldquo;We are finding materials for God. Through preaching the gospel, we are gathering stones and cedars as material for God&rsquo;s building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All God&rsquo;s children should have such a vision. We should not consider this to be a small matter. We are not merely disputing over certain terms and expressions. Saving sinners is not the same as gathering materials; it is not merely a matter of saving people. A person&rsquo;s work is controlled by his concepts. If we have the realization that obtaining materials for God&rsquo;s building is the goal of preaching the gospel, we will not be satisfied merely with seeing a person get saved. We will understand that it is not sufficient for him to merely be saved; he must become material for God&rsquo;s building. We will know that God saves persons for the purpose of building them into the church. Being built into the church is the primary matter, and all other matters are secondary. Hence, our purpose in preaching the gospel should not be merely for people to be blessed but for materials to be collected for God&rsquo;s building. As long as we have this concept, we will focus on making those whom we lead to salvation into building material for the church. The concept of building is a great matter.</p>
<p>People do not have the concept of building up the Body of Christ when they preach the gospel or do the work of edification; they aim only at making believers proper. This is a shortcoming. The saints who serve are willing to help others, but do they have the concept that they are doing a building work? I am afraid that most of us do not have such a realization. Perhaps some feel that a brother needs to be visited because he has not been meeting for a few weeks, and his condition is poor. Such a concept is merely to make the brother a &ldquo;meeting&rdquo; Christian by bringing him back to the meetings. However, we should have the concept that this brother has not yet been built up. He is a stone that is still lying by the wayside and has not been built up into God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Hence, we should spend the time and the effort to bring him back so that he may be built together with all the saints in the church. We need to have the understanding that edification and visitation are related to building.</p>
<p>We should have such an understanding of building not only when we preach the gospel and visit the saints but also when we give messages for the edification of the saints. Our purpose in giving a message concerning the cross is not merely because the saints do not know the flesh. Our purpose is not for the saints to be edified and willing to receive the dealing of the cross. Rather, we should give such a message with the thought of building up, hoping that the fleshly saints would know the cross and receive the breaking of the cross so that they may be built into the church.</p>
<p>If we are enlightened by God to see the vision of the church, we will also have the goal of building when we offer something for the needy saints. The reason we help a brother, love him, and make up his lack with a material offering is not merely that he would be a good believer but that he would be built up in the church and be a functioning member in the Body of Christ. In this way our service will help the saints to see that although believers are members of the Body of Christ, there is a difference between being a believer and being a member. A believer can do a number of things on his own, but a member cannot do anything individualistically. Every member must be built up into the Body and coordinated together with others.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-12 is of great significance in the Scriptures. &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints...unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; When I saw the light in this portion, I wrote the following sentence in my Bible: &ldquo;May the Lord have mercy on me that henceforth all my work would be for the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; May the Lord cause all of us to see this light. God desires that our gospel preaching and messages would be for the building up of the Body of Christ. It is also for the building up of the Body of Christ that He pours out the Holy Spirit and gives various ministries and gifts. We need to have God&rsquo;s concept. Everything is for His building, that is, for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR SERVICE NEEDING<br />
TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>A person who does not have the consciousness of building may do the same work as a person who is controlled by a vision of the building, but the results of their work will be very different. Perhaps some would say, &ldquo;When we save a soul and gain one more stone by preaching the gospel, are we not doing the work of building? When we give a message of edification that causes those who were formerly cold to become zealous and those who were spiritually sick to be recovered as useful material, are we not doing the work of building? We might not declare it, but we are building.&rdquo; I would like to point out that without a consciousness of the building, our work will not issue in the building. If we have the vision of the building, the light of this vision will govern us. Wherever we go, this light will shine and control our walk and our work. As a result, the building of God will be brought in.</p>
<p>We should never think that the building is an insignificant matter. Those who do not know the building may preach the gospel with zeal, consecrate themselves to live for the Lord, and learn to live a spiritual life, but they will not be built up. Such ones do not sense the importance of being built up, nor do they regard the building as something important. As such, they cannot produce the building that God desires. A person will always consider his experience as being important. A person who has experienced salvation will consider salvation to be important. A person who has consecrated himself to live for the Lord will consider a consecrated living to be important. A person who has learned spiritual lessons and lives in the spirit will consider spirituality to be important. Likewise, a person who has been built up will consider being built up to be important. We must have a realization of the building, and we must also be genuinely built up. Then our work will not merely lead people to salvation, to love the Lord, or to live for the Lord, nor will we merely lead them to learn to be spiritual and live before God.</p>
<p>This can be likened to building a house. Building a house requires many workers involved with different tasks. Even though every person may have a different task, they share the same goal and know that their various tasks are all to build the house. It is not sufficient to cut the wood properly or to gather materials; the house needs to be built. Do we have such an understanding of the building in our service? Is our service controlled by the building? This is a serious matter.</p>
<p>If we are controlled by the building, our spiritual experiences and our service will be different. If we see the need for the building, it will be easy for us to be subdued and to receive the breaking of the cross. For example, it is helpful to exhort two responsible brothers who are not in harmony to learn the lesson of bearing one another, of being broken, and of dealing with the self. However, if these two brothers see the vision of God&rsquo;s building and see that their discord opposes and destroys God&rsquo;s plan, they will be subdued. They will be broken without someone speaking to them about being broken. They will be put to death by the cross without someone speaking to them about the killing of the cross, and they will bear one another. Instead of destroying the building, they will be subdued&mdash;in spite of their opinions, personal views, and inability to coordinate with others&mdash;when they see that what God wants to do today is the building.</p>
<p>We are not contending about the use of a certain expression, nor are we insisting on a certain matter. Our burden is that we all need to know and see this crucial vision. The vision of the building must shine continually on us like a great light. This vision must also restrict us so that we would always take the building as our goal in whatever we do. Our service does not matter, nor does the responsibility that we bear in the church matter. Whether we speak a few words in the meeting or visit the saints in their homes, our goal is the same&mdash;God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING AND BLESSING</h2>
<p>We need to be controlled by the building and to experience the benefits of being built up. Only those who have experienced the building up will have a zeal that lasts. Those who are not willing to be built up will become cold or backslidden, even if they were initially zealous. Those who are individualistic will eventually become cold and indifferent, even if they were full of love in the beginning. A person who is built up has everything; he not only has love and power but also the presence of God. Hence, it does not matter whether the church in a certain place has brothers who can give messages. The bringing in of God&rsquo;s blessing does not depend on having brothers who can give messages but on the saints being built up together. Ephesians 2:22 says, &ldquo;In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s dwelling place depends on our being built up together. God cannot dwell in us if we are not built up together. But once we are built up together, He will come and dwell in us. When He dwells in us, we will lack nothing.</p>
<p>Some of the district meetings in the church in Taipei are very good. These districts do not have brothers who can give messages, but the number of saints in the meetings has increased. These districts have increased because there is coordination in harmony and in oneness and because there is an atmosphere of loving one another. In other words, there is building up. This proves that as long as we have the building up, we will have God&rsquo;s blessing. If we would be built up, the number in every district would double after a year. Once we are built up together, the blessing will come.</p>
<p>In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed to the Father, &ldquo;That they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me&rdquo; (v. 23). People in the world will know the Lord and believe in Him when they see the believers built up into one. On the day of Pentecost there were about one hundred and twenty of the Lord&rsquo;s disciples who came together as one man (Acts 1:14-15). Therefore, when they spoke, people were pricked in their hearts and repented (2:37). This repentance was the result of the power of Christ and the reality of the church being with the disciples.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the saints in a church or a district meeting may be filled with opinions, murmuring, and criticism, even if they do not utter anything out loud. For example, a brother may purse his lips while listening to a message, or he might shake his head while a sister is praying and then utter a prayer in subtle opposition after her. In such situations that lack building up, people cannot be saved. The gospel preached in such a situation will not be effective. However, if the saints are built up, there will be a different outcome. We may stutter when we preach the gospel, but people will sense a power that constrains them to repent. This is a wonderful situation.</p>
<p>I must solemnly testify that the blessing among us was brought in because of the harmony among the saints. It is wrong to think that the blessing among us was brought in by those who give good messages. Even if the brothers can give the best messages, there will not be any blessing if they are always in discord. It is also wrong to think that the blessing among us was brought in because the brothers are capable of administrating the church. Rather, the blessing was brought in through the harmonious coordination among the brothers. If there would be more harmony and more building up among the brothers in all places, the number of saved ones would increase, and the saints would receive more help. These blessings are the result of having God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>After the Israelites worshipped the golden calf in the wilderness, Jehovah said to Moses, &ldquo;Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in your midst&rdquo; (Exo. 33:3). However, Moses said, &ldquo;If Your presence does not go with us, do not bring us up from here. For how then shall it be known that I have found favor in Your sight, I and Your people? Is it not by Your going with us, so that we, I and Your people, are distinct from all the other people who are on the face of the earth?&rdquo; (vv. 15-16). Moses seemed to be saying that God had to be with them and to go with them no matter the circumstance and that they would not go up unless He went with them. Therefore, what matters among God&rsquo;s children is His presence, not how right or good something may be. If the Lord&rsquo;s presence is with us, everything will be good. His presence is a real test. Having His presence proves that the Spirit has built us together into God&rsquo;s dwelling place. God&rsquo;s presence is in the building. This is a great blessing, and we serve in the church in order to obtain this blessing.</p><h2 class="head1">MEASURING OUR SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES<br />
BY THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>I hope that the responsible saints will see the vision of the building of the church. The building must be in our loving the Lord, our consecration, and our spirituality. Everything is for the building. If a brother is so spiritual that he cannot be built up with others, his spirituality is not genuine and should be thrown away; he is better off without that spirituality. If a brother claims that he is receiving the breaking of the cross but becomes more individualistic and isolated and eventually cannot coordinate with anyone, his &ldquo;breaking&rdquo; is false. Our loving the Lord and living for Him and our spirituality and brokenness can be genuine only when we are built up.</p>
<p>All our spiritual experiences must be measured by the building. Only the experiences that can bring in the building up are proper. Even if our experiences are very good, they are not proper if they cannot bring in the building up. Many Christians know how to pray, but some may prefer to pray alone because they think that others are not as advanced in the matter of prayer. Such prayers are surely improper and may cause problems. We should be able to pray with anyone. If we can pray only with those who have received spiritual training, we have a problem.</p>
<p>Can we ask a brother who loves the world and a brother who is quick-tempered to pray with us for the gospel? Can we simply pray with them for the gospel, while avoiding any teaching related to not loving the world and not losing one&rsquo;s temper? Many so-called spiritual saints cannot do this. If our spirit is closed and we cannot pray with those who love the world or with those who are quick-tempered, then we are not broken. If we are really broken, we would be able to pray with Demas, who loved the present age (2 Tim. 4:10). A person who has learned the lesson, loves the Lord, fears Him, and lives before Him would be able to pray with a weak brother without thinking that this brother is weak. If we would pray with a weak brother for the gospel, he would be revived without our exhortation. This is the building up; this is the Body. The Body clothes the uncomely members with more abundant honor. God is pleased to give more honor and comeliness to such members (1 Cor. 12:23-24).</p>
<p>God does not necessarily hear our prayers when we pray with those whom we highly regard. We may pray for the revival of the church, but the church falls into a low situation instead. However, He hears our prayers when we pray with the saints who are considered to be weak. If we ask for the revival of the church, the church will be revived. Those who are experienced know not to seek to pray only with so-called spiritual saints. We should look for the saints who are considered to be uncomely and pray with them. Then the gospel will be powerful, and sinners will be saved. If we are built up, we will treat everyone the same, whether or not they are comely. We cannot be individualistic; we must pray with the saints. We should not pray only with those who match our taste; we should be able to pray with any saint.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OBJECT OF GOD&rsquo;S BLESSING</h2>
<p>The more we are built up, the more we can fellowship and pray with any saint, and the church will be blessed. If two responsible brothers cannot pray with other saints, that church will &ldquo;close its doors&rdquo; after a few years. God&rsquo;s blessing depends on His presence, and His presence depends on the building up of the church. He will not bless our individual spirituality; He will only bless the Body that He is building. We may consider someone to be unacceptable, but God would say, &ldquo;This one is in the Body.&rdquo; We may consider someone as unsatisfactory, but God would say, &ldquo;I have blended him in the Body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God cannot bestow His blessing on the earth, because we are not willing to be built up. We hope to receive God&rsquo;s blessing individually, but He is not focused on blessing individuals. His desire is to build up the Body of Christ. We want to be spiritual individually and to read the Bible. However, regardless of how much effort we exert, we cannot read the Bible well if we are not built up.</p>
<p>If a brother decides to stay home and read the Bible by himself instead of meeting in a district with brothers who work as janitors or have limited education, he will not understand much in his reading, and he will eventually stop reading the Bible after a few months. However, if he reads the Bible with those brothers, the Holy Spirit will speak to him, and he will be enlightened to understand what he could not understand when he read by himself. This is marvelous. We pay attention to being blessed individually, but God does not focus on blessing individuals. His blessing is upon His house, the Body of Christ. I speak often to God&rsquo;s children, but I can testify that my speaking would be greatly reduced without the children of God. My speaking is for God&rsquo;s children. God&rsquo;s focus is not to bless individuals but to bless the church.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we can neglect our spirituality. Every serving one should learn to live before the Lord, follow Him in the spirit, and fellowship with Him. However, we need to remember that God does not bless individual spirituality. This is according to His ordination. If we see this vision, we will fall down before Him and say, &ldquo;Have mercy upon me. Regardless of the condition of the brothers, I must be built up with them. Whether or not they are spiritually advanced, I must coordinate with them. I will accept the Body that You have blended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our common problem is that we often feel that what God has arranged for others is better than what He has arranged for us. For example, Mrs. Chang may say that Mrs. Lee&rsquo;s husband is better, and Mrs. Lee may say that Mrs. Wang&rsquo;s husband is better. The brothers may also say that others have a better wife. Similarly, the saints in the church in Taipei think that the church in Kaohsiung is better, and those in the church in Kaohsiung think that the church in Taipei is better. However, it is not a matter of being good or bad; everyone and everything is arranged by God. We need to trust Him, for He cannot make a mistake. Whatever He arranges is the best situation. If we do not accept His arrangement, we will forsake and reject the building, and our condition will match Haggai 1: &ldquo;Is it time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled-up houses, while this house lies waste?...You have sown much, but you bring in little; you eat, but there is no satisfaction; you drink, but there is no being filled with drink; you dress yourselves, but there is no warmth in doing so; and he who earns wages, earns wages to put them into a bag with holes&rdquo; (vv. 4, 6). This means that we will labor much, but the harvest will be little or nothing at all. However, when we are built up together with the saints, the Lord&rsquo;s blessing will flood in and be poured out among us.</p>
<p>While we are serving, we want the church to be blessed, and we also want to bring in the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. The unique condition for bringing in the blessing is for the saints to be built up together. When we are built up, His blessing will come.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NATURE AND GOAL<br />
OF THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The nature of the work of the Holy Spirit is building, and the goal of His work is also building. The goal of His preaching the gospel through us is to have the building. We may not appreciate the building when we preach the gospel, but the Holy Spirit is working for the building. The Spirit does not allow a believer to be detached from the Christian community. The life a person receives at salvation requires him to be related with other Christians and to attend Christian meetings. This is the nature of the work of the Holy Spirit, and it is for the building. The Holy Spirit always joins every new believer, without exception, to other Christians. Hence, the goal of the Spirit&rsquo;s work in us is the building.</p>
<p>In church history the mystics were a group of believers who highly regarded spirituality. However, because they did not know the nature or goal of the Spirit&rsquo;s work, they focused on personal spirituality and came to an end. They went to mountains and caves in pursuit of God; they forsook everything and spent all their time to read the Bible, pray, meditate on God&rsquo;s Word, and exercise to be spiritual, but they did not have any results. This indicates that their way was not effective; the Holy Spirit was not working in their pursuit of spiritual cultivation. The nature and goal of whatever the Holy Spirit does in us are the building.</p>
<p>If the Holy Spirit enlightens us in our personal Bible reading, He will require us to fellowship what we see with the other saints. However, the Holy Spirit will not confirm our desire to display the flesh. If we disobey the urging of the Holy Spirit by not fellowshipping with others and by keeping the light we have received to ourselves, we will feel uncomfortable, and the light will diminish. However, if we fellowship the light we have received with the saints, the light will become brighter, because the Holy Spirit is working for the building so that we would be joined with the saints. If we would obey His urging and fellowship more, we will be enriched. The Holy Spirit urges and compels us to be joined with the saints by fellowshipping with them regarding all our spiritual experiences, including the breaking of the cross, the knowledge of resurrection, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. This is a law.</p>
<p>Although in the past we did not emphasize the building up, there was still some building up among us, because this is the nature of the work of the Holy Spirit. We received God&rsquo;s blessing because of the building carried out by the Holy Spirit. However, we restricted the Holy Spirit because we did not see the matter of building and did not take the building as our goal. We need to actively cooperate with the Holy Spirit for the building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING A RENEWED CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>We need to renew our consecration to the Lord for the building. The book of Romans speaks of consecration in chapter 6 and in chapter 12. In chapter 6 consecration is for us to experience dying with Christ and being released from sin (vv. 6-13). In chapter 12 consecration is for the coordination of the Body, for our being built into the Body (vv. 1-8).</p>
<p>We must consecrate ourselves again if we want to receive the vision of being built up in the Body. We must say, &ldquo;Lord, I give myself to You again. I am offering myself once again for the vision that You have shown me. I want to be built up, so I consecrate myself for Your building work. I have consecrated myself for other things, but now I consecrate myself for You to do Your building work in me. I want to be built up together with all the saints in the church.&rdquo; May the Spirit lead us to have a renewed consecration for the building, and may He have the freedom to do the work of building in us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BUILDING AND BREAKING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:21-22; 4:15-16; Phil. 2:1-4; 4:2-3; 1 Cor. 1:10; Rom. 12:16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH AND THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>God desires to obtain a built-up house in this universe. The special and unique work that He is doing in the New Testament age is to build up His church. Immediately after being revealed to His disciples as the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord said to Peter, &ldquo;You are Peter [a stone], and upon this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). This means that the Lord wants us to know that He is the Christ, the Son of the living God, and that He wants to build the church. Everything that the Lord has accomplished in the New Testament age is not merely to be known, received, and obtained by us. His ultimate goal is that we would become stones for the building of His church.</p>
<p>Very few people know what the church is. We have said that the church is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23), the dwelling place of God (2:22), and a corporate new man (v. 15). These three expressions indicate that the nature of the church is related to building and that her condition is related to coordination. Hence, whenever we speak of the church, we should have the deep understanding that the church is coordinated and built. Just as the Body cannot exist without coordination, the church cannot exist without coordination. Just as there is no dwelling place without building, there is also no church without building.</p>
<p>It is not easy to find genuine coordination and building up among Christians in Christianity. There are various organizations with committees, boards of directors, boards of deacons, and boards of elders, but it is not easy to see coordination. There are opinions and disputes, but it is not easy to see a group of believers who are coordinated and built up together. Once in a meeting of a board of deacons, one member threw a Bible at another member. Some Christians may not throw the Bible at anyone, but they use the words in the Bible as weapons to attack one another. I am not being too much; these are real situations. These negative situations show that most Christian groups are not coordinated or built up. Hence, they do not have the reality of the church.</p>
<p>Concerning building and coordination, Ephesians 4 contains two excellent phrases: <em>being joined together</em> and <em>being knit together</em> (v. 16). Let us consider the structure of the meeting hall as an example. The wooden frames, window frames, and doorframes are firmly knit together because they are fitly joined together. At the end of 1955 Brother Angus I. Kinnear accompanied Brother T. Austin-Sparks to Taiwan and was amazed when he saw our meeting hall, because although there were many doors and windows, he did not see the posts that supported the meeting hall. I told him that the posts, windows, and door frames were all fitly joined together; hence, although there had been many typhoons and earthquakes, the meeting hall was able to withstand them.</p>
<p>The meeting hall was able to withstand the typhoons and earthquakes because its components were fitly joined together and firmly knit together. If the meeting hall had only one wooden pillar, the meeting hall would have fallen even without typhoons or earthquakes. Although the meeting hall was constructed with wood, the beams and posts were all joined and knit together into one structure. Every piece of wood on its own appears to be insubstantial and weak, but as a whole they are firm because they have been fitly joined. Hence, the meeting hall will not fall when the wind blows or collapse when the earth shakes.</p>
<p>Similarly, many people are amazed that although the brothers among us are ordinary and are not famous preachers or pastors with doctor of divinity degrees, we nonetheless have been greatly blessed by God. I often use the human body as an illustration. A human being is solid because he has a skeletal frame that does not consist mainly of big bones but of small bones. These bones are worthless when they are separated, but when they are coordinated together and built up into one single structure, they become functional. This is the reason that we have God&rsquo;s blessing. We are all very ordinary, but we have the blessing because we are coordinated together.</p>
<p>Our meeting hall may not be impressive, but it is functional. If this meeting hall were to be taken apart, the individual pieces of wood would have little usefulness and would be considered waste material. However, when these pieces of wood are coordinated, joined, and built together, they become a very useful meeting hall. This is the preciousness of being coordinated and built together.</p>
<p>Many years ago all the halls in the church in Taipei participated in preaching the gospel. A number of ministers, who came from the denominations to observe, wondered how so many people could come to hear the gospel, even though we had not advertised the speakers in the newspaper. I laughed and told them that our speakers were not famous and did not have theological degrees; hence, they were not worthy of advertising. Sometimes the saints, including the ushers and those distributing gospel tracts, did not know who would be speaking, even when the meeting was about to start. This was amazing to others, but to us it was the coordination of all the &ldquo;useless&rdquo; pieces of wood together so that they could become a useful house.</p>
<p>These examples should help us to see that we have God&rsquo;s blessing because there is building among us. Of course, our coordination and building up are still inadequate. If we were more solidly built, God would definitely pour down more blessing. It is true that in our gospel meetings most saints do not know who will speak until a brother goes up to the podium. Instead of caring for who is going to speak, we should focus our attention on whether or not we are coordinated and built up together. It is the building that brings in the blessing, not the speaker.</p>
<p>The overseas saints think that I am the only person who gives messages in the church in Taipei. However, there are many brothers who speak in coordination in the different halls. Not only so, the various services in the meetings are carried out by all the saints coordinated together. I once attended a gospel meeting in one of the halls. While I was not too far away from the hall, a brother with a gospel vest gave me a tract and invited me to hear the gospel. He did not recognize that I was a brother, so he accompanied me all the way to the hall and handed me over to one of the ushers at the door of the meeting hall. I rejoiced at this experience because it proves that we are coordinated. People can see a situation in which I am not serving alone, but several brothers are serving together. This service rendered by all the saints coordinated together is the building.</p>
<p>The Lord does not need spiritual giants in His church. He needs every member. Hence, instead of being concerned about whether the members are small, our concern should be whether they are built up together. Once the members are built up, even the smallest ones will be useful. First Corinthians 12:23 says that &ldquo;those members of the body which we consider to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor,&rdquo; and verse 22 says, &ldquo;Much rather the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.&rdquo; Medical doctors know that the small members of our body, which we consider to be of little use, are often the most indispensable. I hope this word will strengthen us to see that in this age spiritual giants cannot satisfy God&rsquo;s desire; rather, it is the built-up church that He desires and that brings in His blessing and presence.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TIME FOR THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Most Christians have the mistaken concept that the church will be built after the Lord comes again, not in this age. In their consideration the present time is merely for the Lord to prepare materials. They say that according to Old Testament typology, David, who typifies Christ as the Warrior-King, merely prepared materials for the temple but did not build the temple (1 Chron. 29:3). Instead, David&rsquo;s son Solomon, who typifies Christ in His second coming, was the one who built the temple (2 Chron. 3:1; 6:2). Hence, they conclude that the building of the church will be carried out at the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. We will look at this matter in order to see that this concept is not accurate.</p>
<p>It is correct to say that David typifies the crucified Christ and that Solomon typifies Christ in resurrection. However, it is too arbitrary to say that David typifies Christ in His first coming and that Solomon typifies Christ in His second coming. While He was on the earth, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Behold, something more than Solomon is here&rdquo; (Matt. 12:42). This means that even while He was on the earth, He was the real Solomon. Hence, David and Solomon do not typify the Lord in two stages; rather, they typify two aspects of the Lord: His suffering and crucifixion and His resurrection and glorification.</p>
<p>To say that the building materials were prepared by David means that all the materials for the building of the church are prepared through Christ&rsquo;s sufferings and crucifixion. However, the spiritual house will be built up by the Lord in resurrection. The building up of the church will not be carried out after the Lord&rsquo;s second coming; it is to be carried out in His resurrection. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (John 2:19). <em>Three days</em> signifies resurrection. Therefore, the building is accomplished in resurrection. In typology this refers to Solomon building the temple. David typifies the Christ who suffered in battle and won the victory and thus obtained the materials and the ground for the building up of the church. Solomon typifies the Christ who resurrected from among the dead and is building up His Body with the materials, the saved persons, obtained through His death. This means that the building is the issue of the life that has passed through death and resurrection and that the building is carried out on the ground that He obtained. Hence, the church will not be built after the Lord comes again. The building of the church began after the Lord resurrected.</p>
<p>The New Testament says that the building of the church is in this age. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I will build My church&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18), and the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;We are God&rsquo;s fellow workers; you are...God&rsquo;s building&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:9). In other words, Paul and his fellow workers were building the church as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Paul, a wise master builder, laid the foundation of the building (v. 10). This foundation is Jesus Christ, and no one can lay another foundation (v. 11). We are now building upon this foundation, but each of us should be careful with our work. Some of us are building with gold, silver, and precious stones, and others are building with wood, grass, and stubble (v. 12). When the Lord comes, He will judge our building work (v. 13). These words indicate that the building is taking place today; it will not wait until the Lord returns. When the Lord returns, He will judge the work that we are doing today for the building.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-12 says that the Lord &ldquo;Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers...unto the building up of the Body of Christ,&rdquo; which is the church. First Peter 2:5 says that we, &ldquo;as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house.&rdquo; These matters will not take place in the future; rather, they are happening today. In Ephesians 2:22 the apostle Paul says that we &ldquo;are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; Hence, to say that the church will be built only after the Lord returns in the future is not according to the Bible.</p>
<p>On the one hand, God has overcome the enemy and thus obtained the ground for His building in this age through the death of His Son, and He has also rescued men through the death of His Son. On the other hand, through the divine life and the Spirit, God is building all His redeemed ones together in resurrection. In typology, as David, Christ obtained the materials, and as Solomon, Christ is building these materials into the temple. These two matters are being carried out in this age by the crucified and resurrected Christ through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We are fellowshipping concerning these points because some among us are still spreading inaccurate teachings. I am concerned that there is still an uncertain sounding of the trumpet among us, which says, &ldquo;We do not need to care for the building up of the church. It is good enough to zealously preach the gospel and earnestly love the Lord. We should wait until the Lord comes back and then speak about the building up of the church.&rdquo; The saints who hear such a speaking do not need to debate, nor should they be troubled. As God&rsquo;s army, we have one sounding of the trumpet, and we are marching together in the same steps; hence, we should not be distracted. We have seen that God is building His house in this universe. The age of the church is the age of God&rsquo;s building. We should ignore other trumpet sounds and receive only this call of the Holy Spirit from the Bible. We desire to learn to be built by God and to do the work of the building by His grace.</p><h2 class="head1">BUILDING IN RELATION TO GOD&rsquo;S BLESSING</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s presence and His blessing are related to the building. The church must be built up for the spread of the gospel and for the edification of the believers. When we are built together, it will be easy to spread the gospel, and people will be edified when they come into our midst.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost Peter and over one hundred twenty brothers and sisters were gained as materials through Christ&rsquo;s death (Acts 1:14-15), as typified by the spoil gained by David in the battle. Furthermore, Peter and the disciples were built up in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, as typified by the temple built by King Solomon. They were built by God in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection through the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the people who saw the building among the disciples on the day of Pentecost repented and turned to God. The disciples did not advertise prior to their gospel preaching, as Christianity does today. People repented because they sensed God&rsquo;s presence when they came into the midst of the disciples. People were not only saved and edified but also built up because of the disciples (2:37-47).</p>
<p>Where is the spiritual power among Christians today? Some Christians advertise to promote a gospel campaign, but how many are saved? Some Christians always have revival meetings, but how many are revived? This is not God&rsquo;s way. It is not the way for the gospel to be spread, nor is it the way to edify people. God&rsquo;s way is to preach the gospel and edify people through the built-up church. When the church is built up, it will be easy for us to spread the gospel and easy for people to be edified when they come into our midst.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BREAKING ISSUING IN JOINING AND KNITTING<br />
AND PRODUCING THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>The practical way to build the church is for all the saints to be fitly joined and firmly knit together. But this is not easy. As saved persons, we have God&rsquo;s life, and the Holy Spirit lives in us. Moreover, His constraining love has given us a desire to serve Him and to live for Him, and the supply of grace has given us a desire to serve in the church. However, we have discovered that our outer man is still a problem; our opinions frustrate our coordination in the service. This is our common problem.</p>
<p>With such a problem, how can God blend us and build us up together practically? We should not think that we can have the building simply by putting a few brothers together. Nor should we think that one accord can be achieved through discussions and negotiations or by adjusting the opinions of the saints. Discussions only issue in more opinions. Hence, such meetings cannot solve our problems, nor can they issue in the genuine building up.</p>
<p>A person who desires to be built up must be willing to accept the breaking. To be broken means to no longer be whole. This is the basic requirement for the building up. If we are not willing to be broken but remain whole, we cannot be built up. In order for a tree to become part of a house, it must be broken; it cannot keep its original appearance. Some pieces of wood will be made into boards with sockets, and other pieces will be made into boards with tenons. The tenons need to be inserted into the sockets in order to be connected together. Some pieces of wood are too thick and need to be trimmed, and other pieces are too long and need to be cut. If a piece of wood were to say, &ldquo;You can use me but do not trim me; I want to keep my appearance,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am large and complete; it would be a pity to make me shorter,&rdquo; how could a house be built? There is no way to have the building up if we insist on remaining whole and are unwilling to be broken. In order to be built, we need to be broken. This is the requirement for building. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace we must learn to accept the breaking; otherwise, we have no way to be built.</p>
<p>Euodias and Syntyche were two sisters in the church in Philippi who loved the Lord and labored in the gospel with the apostle Paul, but both were in dissension, not thinking the same thing in the Lord (Phil. 4:2). The saints in the church in Philippi probably did not know how to solve this problem, so the apostle exhorted the brothers, &ldquo;I ask you also, genuine yokefellow, assist them&rdquo; (v. 3). These two sisters loved the Lord and zealously preached the gospel, but they did not think the same thing. In the church it is inevitable to have brothers and sisters like Euodias and Syntyche; they love the Lord and zealously serve Him but are in dissension. If the saints neglect such a situation, the dissenting ones will not have proper coordination, and the church will not be built up.</p>
<p>Opinions are the main cause of dissension among serving ones who love the Lord. Their opinions may be spiritual, good, and out of their love for the Lord, but opinions are nevertheless opinions. For example, a &ldquo;Euodias&rdquo; may say, &ldquo;The messages given in the meetings should be simple,&rdquo; but a &ldquo;Syntyche&rdquo; may say, &ldquo;The messages should have many details so that people can understand.&rdquo; A &ldquo;Euodias&rdquo; may say, &ldquo;Thursday night is not suitable for the Bible-reading meeting,&rdquo; but a &ldquo;Syntyche&rdquo; may say, &ldquo;Thursday night is the best time for a Bible-reading meeting; it is not suitable for any other meeting.&rdquo; If the elders decide to have a Bible-reading meeting on Thursday night, &ldquo;Euodias&rdquo; should not say anything. When it is time to arrange the chairs for the Bible-reading meeting, a &ldquo;Euodias&rdquo; may suggest that the chairs should face the same direction, but a &ldquo;Syntyche&rdquo; may say that the chairs should face the center. This may cause an argument. A person who is not broken always has an opinion regardless of the time or occasion. Without breaking, there is no building. Hence, either &ldquo;Euodias&rdquo; or &ldquo;Syntyche&rdquo; should be the first to be broken and not insist on her opinion but fully accept the fellowship from the brothers. This should not be a grudging acceptance but a willing and cheerful submission, which issues from being broken.</p>
<p>If three responsible brothers insist on their opinion and are not willing to submit to one another regarding the time for a meeting, no building up will be manifested among them. One person must be the first to submit and be broken. If a brother is broken, he will not insist on the time that he suggested, even if it is the most appropriate time. As a result, the meeting might be held at an inappropriate time, but there will be an atmosphere of building up. If we are willing to take the lead to submit, to accept the breaking, the saints whom we coordinate with will follow and also be willing to be broken. If we are commissioned by the Lord to go to a place for the work, we should not advertise the work. Instead of making a show of ourselves, we should attend the meetings, pray in the prayer meeting, and praise in the bread-breaking meeting. After the meeting we can fellowship with the saints who are open or seek an opportunity to fellowship with them. If we have been broken and have learned lessons of life, the saints will realize that our prayers are weighty, and they will receive the life supply when they contact us. Then they will be willing to receive the help. As a result, the work will spontaneously be carried out. This work will cause the church to be built up.</p>
<p>However, if we arrive in a place and announce that we are there for the work, the saints will not taste the building. A person who has been broken and built would never serve in this way. On the one hand, we are laboring, but on the other hand, we are not laboring. We are there to offer our portion spontaneously. The work should still be carried out by the local brothers, and they should still bear the responsibility. However, after a period of time the messages that they give will be our messages, and the brothers will receive the help in administrating the church. If we have been broken, we can accommodate others and supply them. We should not change their way of doing things or their arrangement. Nothing in a locality should change when we arrive. From this perspective it seems that we are not laboring. However, the church will be influenced and receive the help from us, and the saints will be coordinated and built up. Hence, we have done a great work.</p>
<p>All the responsible brothers should also serve according to this principle. We should learn to be responsible and yet not be responsible. This does not mean that we should be irresponsible but that we should learn to be broken. If our service bears the flavor of our being the most responsible ones and of the saints needing to submit to our authority, we will tear down the work. We cannot be so responsible that we take away the function of the saints. This is a tearing down, not a building up. We should let the saints function according to their portion, and instead of correcting the responsible ones, we should encourage them to coordinate. We should say Amen when they function. This is building.</p>
<p>A person who is built up is a broken person and is subdued when he serves with others. It does not matter whether he is a responsible one in a district or in a group. He simply knows that he is serving together with the other brothers and must be built with them. If he has learned the spiritual lessons, he will grasp the opportunity to supply them when they coordinate in a harmonious and cordial atmosphere. He will not have the flavor of correcting others, but he will follow the leading of the Spirit to supply them with the divine life in a harmonious atmosphere. If we have a spiritual supply, we can always supply others regardless of the place. As long as we have a spiritual supply, the saints will be built up. This is the way to bear responsibility.</p>
<p>Hence, in order to coordinate with others, we must first be broken. If we are broken and have learned genuine spiritual lessons, we can lead the brothers into genuine fellowship with the Lord. Furthermore, in such an atmosphere of harmony and oneness, people will sense that God is among us. However, if we think that we have special authority as a responsible one, the church will be finished, and there will not be any building. If we are a broken person, when the brothers want to preach the gospel, instead of adjusting them, we will agree and be built up with them. This is the way for the church to be blessed.</p>
<p>Whether a person&rsquo;s idea is good or bad, we should be the first to submit. As long as the saints do not lead people to worship idols, we should follow their proposals. We must learn not to insist on our ideas and not to remain whole. I thank the Lord when the brothers want to shape me into a board with a tenon, and I also thank Him when they want to carve me into a board with a socket. I am willing to be made shorter, and I am also willing to be trimmed. Every situation is acceptable to me. This is the way to be built with others.</p>
<p>Those who want to preserve their greatness will eventually become the smallest. Those who always argue with others about being right or wrong or about their opinions will not have God&rsquo;s presence. This is because those who desire to remain whole by insisting on their opinions damage the building and destroy the spirit of oneness. The Lord&rsquo;s presence will be with us if we are always willing to accept others&rsquo; proposals and are open to be built up with them.</p>
<p>We need to see that being built up with others and coordinating together are the most precious things to the Lord. It does not matter whether our method is right or wrong or good or bad. What matters is the spirit of oneness, the spirit of harmony. All the blessings depend upon the atmosphere of building. Hence, the apostle Paul says that we should think the same thing, have the same love, and speak the same thing (Phil. 2:2; 1 Cor. 1:10; Rom. 12:16). In order to speak the same thing, we need to be broken. As serving ones, we need to learn to be built up with others. Then others will want to be built up with us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">BUILDING AND BREAKING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Kings 4:29-30; 6:1, 7</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BUILDING,<br />
SERVICE, AND WARFARE</h2>
<p>When we serve in the church with the saints, we are not merely serving together; we are being built up together. We should not only build up others; we need to be built up first. The extent of our being built up determines the extent of our service.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the people of Israel did not serve God individually. Their service was corporate, involving all the people, and the center of their service was the tabernacle. Before the tabernacle was built, the Israelites did not have a corporate service. When the tabernacle was erected in Exodus 40, they became a coordinated unit of service. The Israelites were a priesthood serving God together, and the Tent of Meeting was the center of their service. This means that the corporate service, the coordinated unit of service, the priesthood among God&rsquo;s people, was based on the building among them. Without being built by God, they could not be a coordinated unit of service. This corresponds to 1 Peter 2:5: &ldquo;You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood.&rdquo; When we as living stones are built up into a spiritual house, this spiritual house becomes the priesthood. Then we can offer up spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God. Hence, the genuine service in the church is based on the building up among the saints.</p>
<p>In the wilderness the Israelites were not only a priesthood corporately serving God; they were also His army. In Numbers 2 the twelve tribes were encamped as an army on each of the four sides of the tabernacle (v. 2, footnote 1, Recovery Version). They were not only priests serving God but also an army fighting for Him. This reveals that genuine building enables God&rsquo;s people to have a corporate service and to become warriors fighting for God&rsquo;s kingdom. Our spiritual service and spiritual warfare depend on our being built up.</p>
<p>When the saints in a local church are not in harmony or one accord because they lack spiritual building, they are defeated before the enemy and cannot fight the spiritual warfare. They may meet together, but they will not have genuine service. Likewise, the responsible brothers may not argue, but if they hold unpleasant feelings toward one another and are not in one accord, they will not have genuine service, nor will they be able to fight for God, because there is no building among them. Our experience confirms this matter.</p>
<p>When a group of serving ones is in harmony, one accord, and is built up together, that is, fitly joined and firmly knit together, they will be able to have spiritual service and fight the spiritual warfare. Furthermore, Satan will have no ground among them, because they are priests of God and His warriors. The priesthood and spiritual warfare depend on the one accord and the building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BREAKING AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>In order to be built up together by being fitly joined and firmly knit together, we need to be broken. First Kings 6:7 says that the Israelites built the temple &ldquo;of finished stone, cut at the quarry, so that neither hammer nor ax nor any iron tool was heard in the house when it was being built.&rdquo; All the stones were cut at the quarry; hence, no iron tool could be heard in the temple while it was being built. This means that the materials did not need to be dealt with or broken during the building. Because they had already been dealt with, the materials could be fitly joined and firmly knit together.</p>
<p>If the stones had not been cut and carved but had retained their original form, they could only have been piled together, not built together. Stones that are merely piled together cannot be joined together or knit together. In order to be knit, they need to be joined, and in order to be joined, they need to be dealt with and broken. No stone can remain in its original form.</p>
<p>We can apply this clear picture to ourselves. God created us from a lump of clay (Rom. 9:20-21); hence, we are earthy. However, when we received the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit entered into us (John 1:12; 20:22); thus, we have God&rsquo;s nature (2 Pet. 1:4), and our nature is being changed. In God&rsquo;s eyes we are spiritual living stones (1 Pet. 2:5). Peter says that every saved person is a living stone, because on the day that he received the vision of the Christ as the Son of the living God, the Lord called him Peter (Matt. 16:16, 18). In Greek the name Peter means a &ldquo;stone.&rdquo; Stones are used for building. Peter was deeply impressed and understood that every person who knows Christ as the Son of God is regenerated and will have a change in nature to become a stone for God&rsquo;s building. Therefore, the purpose of salvation is to be built up into the spiritual temple of God. Our ultimate destination is an eternal habitation built up by God.</p>
<p>As living stones, it is inevitable for us to be dealt with and broken in order to be built. We need to be touched by the Lord. If instead of being dealt with and broken we retain our natural form, we can at most be piled together but never built up into the temple of God. May the Spirit give us the vision that a regenerated person has become a living stone. If, as living stones, we do not allow God to cut us through dealings and breakings, we will only be piled together with other Christians but not built up together with them into the house of God.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Harmonious</h2>
<p>The outstanding characteristic of a person who has been dealt with and broken is that he does not have many opinions, nor does he like to express his opinions. The desire to express one&rsquo;s opinions is a sign of a lack of dealing. For example, a stone that has not been cut has many sharp edges, indentations, and protrusions. Some brothers bring their opinions with them when they serve in the church. They are like stones with many sharp edges; hence, no one can touch them. A stone that has been cut and worked on is smooth and does not have sharp edges. Some brothers have been dealt with by God and therefore do not express their opinions when they serve. This does not mean that we should be closed and keep our opinions to ourselves by not expressing them. We cannot pretend. We may be able to temporarily hide our opinions, but one day they will be expressed. We need to be dealt with in God&rsquo;s hand. Only those who have been dealt with by God do not have opinions.</p>
<p>The more lessons we have learned in the Lord and the deeper we are in Him, the fewer opinions we will have when we serve. It will not matter whether we clean the benches with a dry cloth or a wet one, nor will it matter whether we do it in the morning or in the evening. Those who have learned lessons and been dealt with do not have opinions about such things. However, when a matter is related to God&rsquo;s interest, they have a proper measure. They can maintain and protect God&rsquo;s testimony because they are stones that have been properly measured and cut. The measure of God that is with them is according to the pattern shown in the mountain (Exo. 25:40; 26:30). In contrast, some saints are so contentious over matters such as cleaning benches that they even stop serving. Such saints are weak and shrink back, and they easily give in to the enemy in matters related to God&rsquo;s interest. This is evidence that they lack a proper measure because they have not been broken and dealt with by God.</p>
<p>This situation is rather common in the churches. We have received God&rsquo;s grace, and we are willing to serve Him and please Him, but we often have different opinions, even over small matters. As a result, we lack the oneness, are not in harmony, and cannot be fitly joined or firmly knit together. We must keep in mind that the Holy Spirit leaves when we argue. In the Bible the Holy Spirit is typified by a dove (Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:22; John 1:32). A dove is very sensitive and easily frightened. If we are gentle, it will come to us, but as soon as we are somewhat violent, it will fly away. When we insist on our ideas, the Holy Spirit will leave. Brother A may win an argument, but Brother B will not say Amen within. Not only so, the other saints will perceive the argument, and as a result, their spirit will be affected. Furthermore, Brother A will not be able to touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and the saints will not be edified.</p>
<p>Many years ago in the church in Shanghai a newly saved brother saw two elders discussing a certain matter. The younger elder suggested a way that was cumbersome, but surprisingly the other elder joyfully accepted the suggestion. Later, the new brother testified that he was edified in the first meeting he attended when he saw the building among the elders. He said that there was a harmony among the elders that did not exist among people in the world. That picture was etched in his heart. Hence, even a small matter can greatly edify people.</p>
<p>A person who has been dealt with will refrain from arguing not only when he is wrong but even when he is right. We must let the Lord break us to the extent that we can refrain from arguing even when we are the only person who is right. Very few disputes among us in the past were concerning God&rsquo;s testimony. Most of the disputes and discord among us were related to minor things. Even if a dispute seems to be related to an important matter, we still should not argue, because by arguing we will lose the taste of sweetness, and we will lose the presence of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The sense of harmony in the spirit of the saints is delicate and tender. Therefore, whenever there is an argument, we will lose the sense of harmony in our spirit. We need to keep the harmony in our spirit and not damage it. It takes only a slight discord for us to lose the harmony in our spirit. Even if we win an argument, God&rsquo;s presence will not be in our actions. Only when there is harmony in the spirit of the saints will God&rsquo;s presence and blessing be with us.</p>
<p>Hence, it does not matter whether our reasoning is right or wrong. When there is harmony and God&rsquo;s presence, we are right. Without harmony and God&rsquo;s presence, whatever seems right is wrong. His presence is what matters in our service. This is the tree of life, not the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In everything that we do, including our service, we should not be concerned about methods; we should be concerned only with how to have God&rsquo;s presence. We should take care of a matter in such a way that the harmony in the spirit of the saints is not damaged but rather upheld. Our experience testifies that a person who is broken and dealt with does not express his opinions but brings in harmony.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Broad in Receiving Others</h2>
<p>A person who has been dealt with and broken is also wise. Solomon was a wise man: &ldquo;God gave Solomon wisdom and very much understanding and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the seashore. And Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the children of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt. For he became wiser than all men&rdquo; (1 Kings 4:29-31). This means that his wisdom could not be matched by the wisdom of any person on earth; his wisdom was God-given. This wisdom was not for Solomon to be crafty and sly but for him to have largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the seashore. The sand is the limit, the boundary, of the sea; hence, the sand is greater than the sea. The sand on the seashore is a picture of the largeness of Solomon&rsquo;s heart. This is to have wisdom. A person who has been broken and dealt with by God has a large and broad heart. He can accept any suggestion and any kind of person.</p>
<p>Some people may worry that it is dangerous to have such a broad heart. We must remember that regarding God&rsquo;s building, a broken person will never depart from the pattern shown in the mountain but rather will insist on taking the pattern as his standard (cf. Exo. 25:40; Heb. 8:5). He would never abandon the principles in the Bible but would insist on keeping them. He can accept any suggestion that does not oppose the principles in the Bible or affect God&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
<p>The Bible does not tell us when we should preach the gospel or study the Bible or whether we should use a dry or wet cloth to clean the benches, because such things do not affect the pattern shown in the mountain. Anything that is related to God&rsquo;s testimony has a standard, the pattern shown in the mountain. If the suggestion of a brother or sister is contrary to the clear teaching in the Bible, the manifested revelation of God, or the pattern shown in the mountain, we should not accept it. For example, a brother may suggest that we rent the meeting hall to a social club on the days that we do not have meetings in order to collect some rent every month. We should stand against such a proposal for the sake of guarding the testimony of God.</p>
<p>Regrettably, the atmosphere of disharmony among us has mainly been due to saints insisting on differing views and ideas. This proves that we are not broken and have not been dealt with enough and that we are narrow and our heart is small. As a result, we are not willing to accept the views of others. A person who has been broken does not have opinions, is wise, and has a large and broad heart. Hence, he can accept any suggestion and any kind of person as long as it does not involve God&rsquo;s glory or affect His testimony. Only such a person can be proper material for the building. When such material is being built up, the sound of hammers, axes, or iron tools will not be heard. But this is not our situation. Sometimes when the brothers are serving together, the sound of different tools is heard in their coordination, because each has a different opinion; that is, there is the sound that comes from the lack of breaking and dealing, because the materials being used for the building have not been dealt with.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DEALT WITH IN OUR DAILY LIVING</h2>
<p>Some people say that the situation described in 1 Kings 6 is a picture of the situation at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s return. They say that it is not time for the building because the Lord has not returned. They also say that we are stones that are still in the process of being dealt with by God. In their view, when all the believers have been fully dealt with, the Lord Jesus will return to build us together, and then the sound of a hammer or an ax will not be heard, because we will no longer need to be dealt with. Such speaking is not according to the teaching in the New Testament. The New Testament says that we need to be built up, that is, to be joined and knit together (Eph. 4:16). The preparation of the stones at the quarry in 1 Kings 6:7 refers to our being dealt with by God in our daily living. If we are dealt with by God in our daily living, there will not be any sound when we come together as the church. Conversely, if we do not accept God&rsquo;s dealing in our daily living, we will be loose and full of opinions. As a result, it will be inevitable for there to be sounds when we are together.</p>
<p>God desires that we experience dealings in our daily living. For many their family life is a &ldquo;quarry.&rdquo; If we can accept the breaking in our family and not be stubborn, we will not need further dealings, and there will be no sound when we are being built up in the church. A sister whose head is properly covered and has a quiet demeanor in the meetings may be above her husband at home. She may have the last word in every situation, and she may be like a tigress toward her maids. This condition indicates that she has not passed through God&rsquo;s breaking in her &ldquo;quarry.&rdquo; Hence, when she coordinates with others in the church, there are still many sounds. She may utter wonderful prayers in the prayer meeting and give excellent praise in the table meeting, but her stubborn attitude will come forth as soon as she discusses matters with the brothers in the service meetings. The saints who have not been chiseled and cut in their daily living will maintain the sound of their &ldquo;tools,&rdquo; their opinions, when it is time for the building.</p><h2 class="head1">SPIRITUALITY NEEDING THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>This fellowship concerning the building is not doctrine. I have closely observed the condition of God&rsquo;s children. In many places there are good Christians who zealously love the Lord and are spiritual; however, very few Christians are built up. I have seen Christians who zealously preach the gospel criticize those who focus on reading the Word, and those who focus on reading the Word disapprove of those who preach the gospel with zeal. There is no harmony among Christians, and as a result, there is only tearing down, not building up. The views and ideas that Christians argue over do not concern God&rsquo;s testimony on the earth, but because they are not broken, they dispute with one another and destroy the harmony.</p>
<p>The most disheartening thing is that even many spiritual believers are not in harmony with one another. They are spiritual as individuals, but there is no harmony when they come together. For this reason, others cannot touch the presence of the Holy Spirit among them. Their meetings can be compared to a sunset that is full of gloom. They give their opinions, but they are not built up. There is no value in being spiritual if there is no building up. Such spirituality is not genuine. A person who is genuinely spiritual has been built up. The genuineness of a person&rsquo;s spirituality can be tested by the building. Only those who can be built up are truly spiritual, and those who cannot be built up are not spiritual.</p>
<p>After seeing such situations in different places, I have a heavy burden, and I am determined to speak concerning the building wherever I go. Merely being spiritual has no value. Such spirituality will destroy and tear down God&rsquo;s testimony and cause the church to lose the blessing. We do not want a type of harmony that comes from being fleshly or from having false spirituality. May the Lord have mercy upon us so that we would always keep the harmony and participate in His building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CORRECTION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>If we want harmony, we need to be broken by accepting the breaking in the &ldquo;quarry&rdquo; of our daily living. Then there will not be any sounds when we come together. The presence of opinions, different speaking, criticisms, and being judgmental proves that we have not been broken and hence cannot be built up. We must understand that as soon as there are sounds in our coordination, everyone, including those who are not opinionated, will lose God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>The requirement for being built up is to accept the breaking. Then we will have the largeness of heart to receive others. As long as a suggestion does not damage the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, we can accept it, and as long as a person does not damage the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, we should accept him. The more we accept one another&rsquo;s suggestions and are tolerant toward one another, the brighter our inner being will be, and the more we will be able to accept being adjusted by others. If a few brothers make an inefficient suggestion, and we accept it without arguing, the Holy Spirit will have the way to enlighten those brothers. They will sense that they were wrong without our adjusting them. Hence, if we can give up our personal views for the sake of keeping the harmony, the Lord will enlighten them at the right time. If their suggestion does not damage the Lord&rsquo;s testimony or cause His name to suffer loss, we should keep the oneness. Then the Holy Spirit Himself will have the way to correct them. The correction of the Holy Spirit is a correction in harmony that results in mutual trust and building up. If we insist on our ideas instead of giving in to one another, we will lose the harmony and the presence of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The more we try to force others to listen to us, the more they will not listen, but the more we learn to listen to others, the more they will listen to us. In our service we cannot assume a high position, put on airs, or demand that others listen to us. Such conduct is the source of many arguments. When we force others to listen to us, there will not be harmony. A forced listening does not build up; rather, it tears down the building. Hence, a co-worker should not have the attitude that the church and the elders must listen to him. Such an attitude indicates that he does not know how to build up others, because he has not been broken or built up by God. The work that he does with this attitude is not pleasing to God. The co-workers who can serve with others, listen to the brothers, and not be hasty to correct others can build up the saints.</p>
<p>Hence, we must learn to be broken, to drop our opinions, to be broad, and to not correct other people&rsquo;s methods of doing things. Only those who are broad can accept the methods that other people use to accomplish things. It is a great skill to be built up together with others without the sound of iron tools, and only those who have been dealt with by God have such a skill. No matter what others say, the atmosphere of our service should be such that &ldquo;neither hammer nor ax nor any iron tool was heard in the house&rdquo; (1 Kings 6:7). This atmosphere proves that we have learned the lesson well. We cannot fathom the degree to which God&rsquo;s presence will be with us if such an atmosphere were among us. The people who come into our midst would sense that there are no opinions among us and that we correct ourselves without arguing. Thus, whoever comes into our midst would be edified.</p>
<p>God wants a group of people who receive His breaking, have a large heart, and do not assume a high position, that is, a group of people who are being built up by Him. Those who are narrow-hearted think that others are narrow-hearted, and those who are crooked think that others are crooked. It is shameful for a believer to assume a high position, to lord it over the saints. It is despicable for a believer to desire to be first, to be the leader, so as to be above others. We must have a vision of the building and desire to be the same as the other saints. As long as a suggestion does not harm the Lord&rsquo;s glory or affect His testimony, we should not only accept it but also follow it. This should be the attitude not only of the younger saints but also of the older ones and especially of the leading brothers. In the church we do not rule others or lord it over them. The church is entirely a matter of being broken and being built up.</p>
<p>The more we are willing to be broken and built up and to follow the saints and accept their suggestions, the more they will follow us and trust us. The Holy Spirit will operate in the saints to confirm that we are living in God and that we have His presence. However, if we argue to prove our case and fight to prove that our idea is reasonable and right, the Holy Spirit will not confirm us in the saints. As a result, the saints will not approve of us, they will not say Amen to us, nor will they support us in their spirit. May the Lord have mercy on us that we would be serious to learn the lessons in this matter.</p>
<p>May we all accept God&rsquo;s dealing and breaking in our daily living. The more we accept the breaking, the fewer opinions and ideas we will have. Furthermore, we will have God&rsquo;s measure. Having been dealt with by God, we will be broad-minded and able to accept others and coordinate with them. We will be built up, and we will also build up others. We may not agree with all the situations in the church, but if we do not argue concerning these situations, the Holy Spirit will work within the saints and bring all the matters onto the right track. We do not need to correct the situations; let the Holy Spirit do it. We must learn to always accept the saints and to reject the self; we must allow the Holy Spirit to build us up with the saints. The Holy Spirit will correct any inappropriate situation among the saints. The correction by the Holy Spirit is the building up that issues in the church being fitly joined and firmly knit together as the dwelling place of God in spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BUILDING UP AND<br />
THE MANIFESTATION OF FUNCTIONS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:4-5; Eph. 4:11-13, 15-16</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we said that to be built up is to be fitly joined and firmly knit together with others. In this chapter we will consider the relationship between building up and the manifestation of our function.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEMBERS OF CHRIST AND THEIR FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p>Most of the saints feel that they do not function, even though they are saved. Their condition seems to confirm such a feeling, and they even speak of their uselessness. Whether in relation to their feelings or their condition, it appears as though they do not have any function.</p>
<p>We should believe in God&rsquo;s Word and not our feelings. We should believe what He says and not in our condition. The Word says that every believer is a member of the Body of Christ and that every member has a function (Rom. 12:4-5). Our function can be considered as a gift or a ministry. No matter how we feel, God&rsquo;s Word says that every saved person has a function. Hence, we should believe what God says rather than our feelings or condition.</p>
<p>If we look at our condition, sometimes we even doubt whether we are saved. However, in the Bible God tells us, &ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life&rdquo; (John 3:36). Based on this word, we should believe that we are saved. Likewise, we should also believe that as a member in the Body of Christ, we have a function. If we acknowledge that we are saved, we should also acknowledge that we are a member of the Body of Christ. As a member of the Body of Christ, we have no reason to say that we do not have a function.</p>
<p>In Matthew 24:35 the Lord said, &ldquo;Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away.&rdquo; According to our view, heaven and earth are concrete and real, but the Bible says that one day both heaven and earth will pass away. Hence, heaven and earth are transient and vain. In the universe only God and His word are eternal and real. If heaven and earth are not real, how can our feelings and condition be real? Therefore, we should not believe in our feelings or our condition.</p>
<p>Romans 12:4-5 says, &ldquo;Just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another.&rdquo; These verses say that we are members and that we have a function. We believe the phrase <em>individually members one of another,</em> but we doubt the phrase <em>members...have...function.</em> Every saint can say Amen to the fact that every saved person is a member of the Body of Christ. We can all declare affirmatively that we are members of the Body of Christ. At the closing of a letter many Chinese-speaking saints like to refer to themselves as &ldquo;the least member.&rdquo; Some refer to themselves as &ldquo;a weak member&rdquo;; others more humbly refer to themselves as &ldquo;an insignificant member.&rdquo; Whether we refer to ourselves as the least member, a weak member, or an insignificant member, we acknowledge that we are members of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Even though God&rsquo;s Word says that every member has a function, we say that we are useless. We acknowledge that we are members of the Body, but we do not acknowledge that we have a function. This shows that although we believe God&rsquo;s Word, we also doubt it. When God says that we are members, we believe Him and acknowledge His Word, but when He says that we have a function, we have doubts.</p>
<p>Do we believe in our feelings and our condition or in God&rsquo;s Word? We should believe in His words, because there is reality behind every word of God: God &ldquo;spoke, and it was; / He commanded, and it stood&rdquo; (Psa. 33:9). God said, &ldquo;Let there be light; and there was light&rdquo; (Gen. 1:3). God Himself is the supporting basis of His word. There is truth and reality in every word of God. If God says that every member has a function, He will surely make His word real. He will work until every member&rsquo;s function is manifested. Hence, we must believe in God&rsquo;s words.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MANIFESTING FUNCTIONS AND<br />
BEING JOINED AND BUILT UP TOGETHER</h2>
<p>In terms of our condition, many of us do not function. If we all functioned, many new believers would be added to the church, and the condition of the church would improve. In reality, however, there are not many new believers in the church, and not many of those who are baptized can be sustained. These situations indicate that we are in oldness; we are not fresh, and we are not growing. They also indicate that we do not function adequately.</p>
<p>How can God&rsquo;s Word say that every member has a function, and yet we do not function? Some believers might say that we do not love the Lord enough, we are not spiritual enough, or we do not pray enough, and as a result, there is no manifestation of our functions. On the one hand, this statement is true, but on the other hand, we need to be delivered to see that it is not that hard to manifest our function. The simple way to manifest our function is to be built up.</p>
<p>Romans 12:4 says, &ldquo;Just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function.&rdquo; This means that every member has a function and that the functions of the different members are not the same. The next verse says, &ldquo;So we who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another&rdquo; (v. 5). Here <em>function</em> and <em>individually members one of another</em> indicate that the manifestation of function depends on the mutual joining of the members. The manifestation of our function in the church does not depend on whether we love the Lord, on how spiritual we are, or on how much we pray; rather, it depends on whether we are joined together with all the members. When we are joined together with all the members, we will surely love the Lord, be spiritual, and pray. However, loving the Lord, being spiritual, and praying do not guarantee that we can be joined together with all the members. Hence, the manifestation of our function does not depend on our loving the Lord, our spirituality, or our praying but on our being joined together with all the members.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>individually members one of another</em> means to be built up. Only when we are built up can we be fitly joined and firmly knit together. Joining together is the state of being built up. Our physical body is an example. In order for a member of our body to function, it must be fitly joined together with the other members in our body. For example, a hand is useful in a body, but it immediately becomes useless if it is cut off and put aside. Even an arm that is out of joint, not being fitly joined with other members, will not manifest its function. Therefore, the primary condition for a member to manifest its function is to be fitly joined together with other members in the Body. This joining is the building up.</p>
<p>Some saints say that they are of little use because they do not have any gifts. But I would like to point out that, on the one hand, some believers have the gift of giving messages and of fellowshipping with others, but they do not have much function in the church, because they are not built up by being joined and knit together with the saints. On the other hand, some believers do not have the gift of giving messages, and their fellowship is confusing, but they have much function in the church because through them people are gathered together. Some people are very good at giving messages, but their speaking scatters people. The more they speak, the more people are scattered. This shows that building is a matter of function.</p>
<p>We often feel that we do not function because we are not spiritual enough. However, we have seen many spiritual people who lived before the Lord but did not have much function. Such a person can be compared to a fruitless branch. The longer he remains in a place, the drier and colder the place becomes. On the contrary, another person may not seem to be spiritual, but the longer he stays in a place, the more there is an atmosphere of the life and warmth of spring.</p>
<p>Some believers think that they are of little use because they are short of Bible knowledge, have little understanding of the truth, and have insufficient spiritual light. However, I have seen people who speak from the Old Testament and the New Testament with much light, have a clear knowledge of spiritual principles, and understand the truth, but when they speak, people&rsquo;s hearts become cold, and the people are scattered. There are also brothers who seem unclear concerning the light of the truth and concerning spiritual principles, and they lack a thorough knowledge of the Bible, but when they speak even a few words in a meeting, people are drawn closer together. The people whom these brothers contact are gathered together, stirred up, and become burning within.</p>
<p>In the same principle, I have seen many people who pray much but to little avail. Some even fast and pray for the church where they serve, but the more they fast and pray, the colder the condition of the church becomes. It seems as if God does not hear their prayer. There are also those who do not pray that much, but they have a drawing force that brings people closer together and a burning power that makes others burning.</p>
<p>Hence, all spiritual matters should be measured by the building. Our spirituality is abnormal if it cannot be measured by the building. There is a problem with the light we have received if it cannot be measured by the building. Our prayers will not be answered by God if they cannot pass the test of the building. Even the matter of being broken needs to be measured by the building. We all need to see this. It is not easy to be broken. Some believers seem to be broken, but others fear them and dare not to touch them. This is not breaking. Others do not advertise that they are broken, but they are able to perfect other saints and to serve the Lord and live for Him.</p>
<p>Hence, gifts, spirituality, knowledge, light, prayer, and brokenness do not cause us to manifest our function. Some believers do not seem to be gifted or spiritual, they do not have much light or knowledge, nor do they pray much or pay much attention to being broken, but their function before the Lord is manifested. This is the result of being fitly joined and firmly knit together with others.</p>
<p>Being fitly joined is a great test to every one of us. Can a very spiritual brother be joined to another brother who is not so spiritual? This is an effective test. A brother who cannot be joined together with others thinks too highly of himself. He thinks that their gifts are not as great as his, that the light they have cannot compare to his, and that they cannot fast or pray as he does. He cannot be joined together with others, because he feels that they cannot properly match him.</p>
<p>Some saints pray too much and therefore cannot be joined together with others. Even though they pray often, they pray in an individualistic way. A sister who prays individualistically might say, &ldquo;Those who do not pray much know only how to be busy in the outer court; they do not know how to draw near to God in the Holy of Holies. I cannot be with them. I want to serve God in the Holy of Holies; I will not serve with them in the outer court.&rdquo; Such a sister cannot be joined with others simply because she prays too much.</p>
<p>Some brothers are so &ldquo;broken&rdquo; that they cannot be joined together with others. Christians should not be peculiar. They should be balanced, and this balancing is for building up. A gift that cannot pass the test of being built up with others is a problem; spirituality that cannot be measured by the building is also abnormal; and light and knowledge that cannot pass the test of being measured by the building are also problems. A person who cannot pass the test of being built up is not broken; rather, his brokenness makes him stubborn.</p>
<p>Many so-called gifted persons in the church cannot be joined together with others. The so-called spiritual persons appreciate and admire only themselves. The so-called enlightened and knowledgeable persons ignore others. These believers cannot attain to the building up that God desires. Some people feel that only the apostle Paul is qualified to talk with them. They think that it is pointless and meaningless to speak about the Bible or the truth with the ushers or the saints who clean the meeting hall. Other believers feel that they can pray like Moses on Mount Sinai and that they are better than Aaron, Hur, Peter, James, and John. They compare themselves to the Lord Jesus at Gethsemane. They pray much, but they pray by themselves without companions. Other believers seem to be broken, but they are aloof and isolated. Instead of praying in the meetings, they criticize others for being fleshly and emotional. They consider only their prayer to be spiritual and broken. Because they are not joined or knit together with others, they are unable to manifest their function in the church.</p>
<p>The first condition for manifesting our function is to be joined and knit together with others. Some believers can coordinate with anyone. They are gifted, but they can be fitly joined with an insignificant brother. They know the Lord and are spiritual, but they can be fit together with those who are fleshly. They have received much light and pray much, but they can be joined together with foolish ones who do not know how to pray. In other words, they can be built up with any person. Such believers are useful and manifest the greatest function.</p>
<p>The ones with the greatest function in the church can be joined with others. It does not matter whether others are spiritual or fleshly, know how to pray, have received light, or understand the Bible; those who are useful can be joined together with anyone.</p>
<p>The only reason our function is limited in the Body of Christ is because we are not joined together with other members. The manifesting of function is strong proof that one is built up with others. When saints come together to serve the Lord, their hearts are full of joy, thanks, and praises, and they have love feasts and fellowship frequently. They have a fresh and sweet taste. With time, however, it is easy to have conflicts. This can be likened to a newly-wed couple who enjoy a short time of sweetness before a sour and bitter taste enters their marriage. Conflicts cause people to scatter and prevent their functions from being manifested. Some people are quiet; they seldom talk. They do not get involved or get into trouble, but they also are not built up with others. Those who cause trouble do not manifest their functions, nor do those who do not get involved. As a result, the church meetings become cold and desolate, and the fresh and sweet taste disappears.</p>
<p>Hence, in order for us to function, we need to be built up together with others. We need to be built up with the elders and the district responsible ones, as well as with the saints we are shepherding. We need to be built up with every saint. Those who are fitly joined, built up, with others have the greatest function. May the Lord open our eyes to see that the key to being a Christian is to be built up. Being built up depends on our being joined together with others.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING BROKEN BY BEING JOINED TOGETHER</h2>
<p>Some serving ones struggle to drop the self but to no avail. The easiest way to leave the self is to be built up. When we are built up, we are out of the self. Those who struggle individually to get out of the self will remain in the self. Individualism is the strongest expression of the self. It is impossible to get out of the self when we are in the self. However, if we are willing to be joined together with other saints, we will immediately be freed from the self. The easiest way to be freed from the self is to be joined together with the saints.</p>
<p>We have said repeatedly that in order to be built up, we must be broken. The reverse is also true: as soon as we are built up, we will be broken. Those who are built up and joined with others have no choice but to be broken. If we aspire to spirituality, we will become spiritual as soon as we are built up and joined with others. This is very simple. Some desire to know how to pray. If the believers who desire to know how to pray would be willing to be joined with others and pray together, they would spontaneously know how to pray.</p>
<p>Perhaps a brother envies the spiritual merits and strengths of other Christians. As soon as he is put in the building, joined and knit together with the saints, he will experience these merits and strengths. Some serving ones read the Bible every day but do not receive any light. If they would be willing to be joined together with others and read the Bible together with other saints, they would receive light. The serving ones who are willing to be fitly joined with other saints will be empowered. Some think that they do not know how to visit people, but if they would be willing to join themselves to other saints in the visitation, they would immediately experience the blessing in visitation. As long as we are willing to put ourselves in the Body and be joined to other saints, there is no need to talk about being broken, for we will surely be broken. We will also be freed from the self. All our problems and difficulties can be resolved in the Body of Christ. As long as we stand as individuals, our problems and difficulties will remain. When we are placed in the Body, our problems disappear. It is a powerful experience to be placed in the Body, to be placed among the saints, that is, to be fitly joined together with others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING JOINED AND BEING INDIVIDUALISTIC</h2>
<p>God cannot build His house and build up the Body of Christ through individualism. God desires that we be joined together with others so that the individualistic element in our nature would be broken. Some saints pray well at home, but they never pray in the meetings. This is the result of an individualistic element in their nature. We may not want the saints to know our spiritual problems or needs, but our problems should be brought up in the Body and made known to others. If we learn the lesson of allowing others to pray concerning our weaknesses, we will no longer be weak. It is useless to fast and pray if we are afraid to let others know our problems. We merely need to place our weaknesses before the saints and allow the Body to deal with our weaknesses. Then our problems will vanish even without our praying. It is regrettable that we still like to hide our problems and yet resolve to pursue spirituality, to be overcoming, to be enlightened, and to be empowered. On our side, our thoughts are related only to our desires, but God does not give us what we desire, because His grace is given to the Body, not to those who are individualistic.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BLESSING OF GOD</h2>
<p>If we are built up together, God&rsquo;s blessing will be manifested among us. When we put ourselves in the Body by being joined with the saints and being members individually one of another, we will be spiritual and full of light. We can receive and enjoy all the riches of God and of Christ only in the Body.</p>
<p>Haggai 1:6 speaks of the children of Israel sowing much but bringing in little because they were concerned only about themselves; they were not concerned about the house of God. This means that they labored much but reaped little. Let us consider our situation. We must admit that even though we have many meetings every week, have a heart for the Lord, and pray, we bring in very little because we have neglected the building up of God&rsquo;s house. Most Christians pursue personal spirituality, personal power, and personal enlightenment, but they neglect the building up of God&rsquo;s house. We need to be delivered. We are not asking for personal spirituality, personal power, or personal enlightenment. We want God&rsquo;s house to be built up. We do not want to be isolated members, individual Christians. We should serve together with the saints no matter where we are placed and should commit ourselves to them. We should be joined together with all the saints as well as with the elders and the responsible ones in the church. If we are willing to be built up in such a way, we will be the first to be blessed, and we will also become a channel of blessing through which many blessings will be brought into the church.</p>
<p>May God open our eyes to see that He is not focused on our being spiritual, powerful, or enlightened but on whether we are being built up as the house of God. Hence, we should seek nothing other than the building up of His house. When we are willing to allow His house to be built up in us, we will experience genuine spirituality, power, and enlightenment. We will also touch the presence of God in the church.</p>
<p>We must remember that the manifestation of our function depends on whether we are fitly joined with other saints. If we are joined together with all the members of the Body, we will spontaneously manifest our function. We may not know what our function is, but when we are fitly joined together with the other members, we will have a function, and the blessing of God will be with us. The way to manifest our function is to put ourselves in the Body and be fitly joined with the other members. We must never be individualistic or pursue personal spirituality. May we be built up together in the house of God, fitly joined and firmly knit with one another, so that we would spontaneously manifest our function.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">BUILDING UP IN LOVE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 15:9-10, 12, 16-17; 1 Cor. 8:1-3; 12:31&mdash;13:10, 13; Eph. 4:15-16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP AND<br />
THE MANIFESTATION OF FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider how the Body of Christ builds itself up in love (Eph. 4:16). Every member in the Body of Christ has a function. Being properly joined with other members is the condition necessary for a member to manifest his function. This means that the function of a member depends on being joined. Any member who is individualistic or detached from other members will not be able to manifest his function. Therefore, the most accurate way to determine whether there is a problem with our function is to measure our function against our being joined to others and built up. If there is a problem with our function, it must be because we have a problem with being joined or with being built up with other members in the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>It is possible for a Christian to seemingly be spiritual, full of light, or spend much time in prayer yet not have much function. The primary cause for such situations is a lack of joining and building. Spirituality, enlightenment, and prayer need to be measured against being built up. The properness of a person&rsquo;s spirituality depends on how much he is joined with other saints. If a person seems spiritual but is individualistic and cannot be joined with other believers, his spirituality must be improper. Proper and normal spirituality causes a person to be joined with other saints. Nothing places a stronger demand on our spirituality, on our being dealt with by the Lord, and on our living before Him than being joined together with other saints. We can never have genuine spirituality without being joined and built up together with all the saints.</p>
<p>A saint may have proper conduct, be pious, fear the Lord, and not do anything inappropriate, yet he may be individualistic before the Lord and unable to be joined together with other believers. Such a saint seems to be spiritual, but he has never been broken; his self is still strong. No one can find fault with him because he seems to be perfect. Although he has no conflicts with other saints, he cannot be joined with them. This indicates that he is not broken and that his spirituality is not proper. Because of his eccentric spirituality, he does not bear fruit before the Lord. When such a saint is broken by the Lord, he will be able to be joined with other saints and built up together with them. Then he will no longer be individualistic. He will also bear fruit and manifest his function.</p>
<p>We do not want the saints to be fruitless and barren even if their condition before the Lord is good. Such saints neither bring people to salvation nor help others pursue the Lord. Instead of taking care of younger believers, they care only about their welfare and integrity before God. There also are saints who do not seem to be outstanding, spiritual, or perfect, nor do they seem to have learned many lessons, but they bear much fruit and take care of new believers and of those who seek to serve the Lord. These saints are like begetting and nurturing parents; they have many children and are full of function. If we evaluate these examples before the Lord, we must say that the first category of saints does not have genuine spirituality, but the second category of saints bears much spiritual weight, because they bear fruit, and their functions are manifested.</p>
<p>In John 15:5 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit.&rdquo; If anyone abides in the Lord, he will bear much fruit. Bearing much fruit is the manifestation of the function of a branch. The branches of a vine have only one function, which is to bear fruit. They cannot be used as building material, nor are they suitable for fuel. Therefore, the branches of a vine that do not bear fruit are useless. Only when they bear fruit is their function manifested. The more fruit they bear, the more their function is manifested.</p>
<p>Every believer is a member of the Body of Christ and a branch of the Lord, the vine. As branches, our function is to bear fruit. To bear fruit is to bear clusters of grapes, that is, many saints. The elders, deacons, and responsible ones should all bear a few saints. The saints whom they bear are their fruit. Such fruit is the manifestation of our function in the church.</p>
<p>Regrettably, we do not have the situation of bearing much fruit. The spiritual condition of many serving ones is good, but they do not bear any saints. Such serving ones can be compared to good-looking but fruitless branches. Their function is not manifested practically in the church. This situation is the result of being individualistic, isolated, and not built up with other believers.</p><h2 class="head1">PROBLEMS IN BEING BUILT UP</h2>
<p>If we want to be fitly joined with the saints as members of the Body of Christ and be built up together, we need to see that we have many peculiarities that keep us from bearing with one another. There is no building up if we draw near to those who suit our taste but stay away from those who do not suit our taste. However, the Lord has put us together with other saints, without regard to their origin, and He requires that we be joined and built up together with them as members of His Body. For this reason, we need to learn the lesson of dealing with our peculiarities.</p>
<p>I have had much contact with the children of God; hence, like a doctor who has much clinical experience, I know the symptoms of many spiritual peculiarities among God&rsquo;s children. Doctors know that a fever can have various causes, such as a cold, scarlet fever, or tuberculosis. Likewise, there are also many different problems that can keep those who serve the Lord from being joined and knit together with others. These problems are our peculiarities.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Inclination to Be with Fellow Countrymen</h2>
<p>In order to be coordinated with the saints in the church, we first need to deal with our inclination to be with our fellow countrymen. The prominent characteristic of this inclination is language, which is a problem to building up. A brother from Shantung Province is drawn closer to another brother who speaks the same dialect. Suppose there are four elders in a locality, and three are from Foochow. During the elders&rsquo; meeting the three from Foochow might speak in their dialect at a crucial juncture in their fellowship, leaving the other elder out of the fellowship. After the three discuss the issue in their dialect, they might use Mandarin to summarize their conclusion with the elder who does not understand their dialect. In this situation there is no way for these elders to be built up. The inclination to be with one&rsquo;s fellow countrymen is an indication that a person has not been dealt with and has not learned the lesson. The Body of Christ is the new man, where there cannot be Jew nor Greek (Gal. 3:28). We must see that human distinctions must be eliminated in order to have the building up of the Body.</p>
<p>A brother who has learned the lesson will avoid speaking the Foochow dialect when he is in a meeting with saints who do not understand it. In the same way, a Taiwanese saint will avoid speaking Taiwanese when he is in a meeting with saints who do not understand Taiwanese. The use of dialects is to meet a need rather than to satisfy our particular taste and preference.</p>
<p>An inclination to be with fellow countrymen that cannot be broken will become an obstacle that prevents the church from being built up. Although a sister may know how to pray and read the Bible, her inclination to be with her fellow countrymen makes it hard for her to be built up with other saints. We are all brothers and sisters, but when we exhibit an affinity for our fellow countrymen, we are tearing down instead of building up. We should not have any distinctions in the house of God or in the Body of Christ. If we have learned the lesson in this matter, we would rather be slightly cold toward those who are our fellow countrymen and warm toward those who are not. Our relationship with the saints is not based on compatriotism; it is in the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord brought us from mainland China to Taiwan with the purpose of spreading the gospel, the truth, and His testimony among the local people. We earnestly desire that they would grow strong and eventually take this commission that we have received from the Lord so that if one day He leads us to leave here, the gospel, the truth, and His testimony will be able to go on. For this reason, we increased the gospel work among the local people and established more Taiwanese-speaking meetings in Taipei and Kaohsiung. However, I am concerned that this practice can give rise to problems, even though it does have benefits. In the church there cannot be Jew nor Greek, but for practical needs we have a Mandarin-speaking meeting and a Taiwanese-speaking meeting. Hence, the meeting of the local saints can bear a local flavor. However, such a practice might actually damage the practical building up of the church. Our meetings are divided by language for the convenience of communication. However, while we are taking advantage of this convenience, we should never approve of the distinction of languages. In the church there cannot be Jew nor Greek, that is, there cannot be Mandarin, Taiwanese, the Foochow dialect, or the Shantung dialect. Although we speak a certain language for the convenience of communication, we are not building up the testimony of a particular language; we are building up the testimony of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">The Inclination toward Being Spiritual</h2>
<p>In order to be coordinated and joined together with the saints in the church, we also need to learn to deal with the inclination to be spiritual. Some serving ones enjoy being around spiritual persons but show no interest in immature or fleshly saints. Although being fleshly is indeed hateful, the fleshly saints are still members of the Body of Christ; hence, we need to love them. A person&rsquo;s spirituality is a test to us that proves whether we have learned the lesson of building up. The spiritual brothers are lovable, but the weaker brothers deserve more of our love. A parent&rsquo;s heart often goes first to the children with shortcomings or problems. The more problems a child has, the more his parents care for him. The more rebellious a child is, the more his parents care for him. This is the heart of a parent. In 1 Corinthians 12:24 Paul says, &ldquo;Our comely members have no need. But God has blended the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked.&rdquo; This verse shows that the Lord cares for the immature, weak, and uncomely members more than for the comely ones.</p>
<p>A person&rsquo;s spirituality and ability to fellowship and pray with us are a serious test. If we can love only spiritual believers, our joining with the members of the Body of Christ is problematic, and it will be hard for our function to be manifested. Proper spirituality does not cause a person to be more individualistic or isolated, nor does it cause him to compare himself with Moses on Mount Sinai or the Lord Jesus in Gethsemane. Proper spirituality will not cause a person to think that he is higher than everyone else and hence has no choice but to live alone before God.</p>
<p>On the contrary, proper spirituality prevents a person from living in isolation and from caring only for himself. It causes him to willingly contact the weak, care for the stumbled, seek the backslidden, carry the immobile, and love the unlovable and those with problems. If we are truly broken, the inclination toward spirituality will be discharged from our being, and we will be able to love those who do not live before God. We will be able to set our mind on the spirit and walk according to the spirit and still be able to love those who set their mind on the flesh. If we have learned such a lesson, we will be a fruitful branch that bears clusters of fruit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Inclination Only to Read the Bible</h2>
<p>We need to learn to deal with the inclination only to read the Bible. Some serving ones are so passionate about reading and studying the Bible that they do not need to eat or sleep. They can drop everything else for the Bible. They do not care whether others love the Lord, are saved, fall, or stand. They care only to read the Bible. When such believers meet people, they can talk only about the Bible. When they read the Bible, they forget about heaven and earth. Although reading the Bible is a spiritual matter, this kind of Bible reading is a problem, a peculiarity. It shows that such believers are not yet broken and cannot be built up with other saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Inclination Only to Pray</h2>
<p>We need to deal with an inclination only to pray. Believers with this obsession cannot do anything without prayer. The Bible tells us to &ldquo;unceasingly pray&rdquo; (1 Thes. 5:17), but we cannot drop everything else and focus only on prayer if we want to be built up with others in the church life. Suppose a saint is gravely ill in the hospital, and his family asks us to visit him. Should we say, &ldquo;Let us pray first to see if the Lord wants us to go&rdquo;? It might already be too late by the time we finish praying. If there are people in difficulty who need our support, it is not right for us to insist on praying before assisting them. This is an example of turning prayer into an obsession.</p>
<p>A farmer who prays throughout the year but does not sow, cultivate and fertilize the land, or water the plants cannot reap a harvest. It is God who causes the growth of the harvest, but He requires people to carry out outward activities such as cultivating and fertilizing. In the church some saints focus only on prayer and despise other services as being the work of Martha. When such saints visit the needy or fellowship, they will encourage others only to pray and trust in the Lord. It seems as though they do not live on earth. They are fully ignorant of the needs of the saints. Hence, they cannot be joined or built up with others. This indicates that they have not been adequately broken.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING JOINED IN LOVE</h2>
<p>A broken person can easily be built up with others. Even though two disciples went down to Emmaus after the Lord was crucified and resurrected, the Lord Jesus still walked with them (Luke 24:13-15). It was wrong for them to go down to Emmaus, but the Lord Jesus walked with them. The ability to love people with different origins, languages, and accents, people who are not spiritual, who rarely read the Bible or pray, who are worldly, and who do not know how to trust in God requires that we be broken. We love them because they are children of God. A broken person can be joined with the saints who are weak or strong, inexperienced or experienced, and falling or standing. This is not socializing but being joined in life. When we love others in such a way and are joined with them, we will immediately manifest our function, and we will also bear clusters of fruit and take care of many saints. This is the love spoken of in the Bible. This love is out from God, and it is the love of God.</p>
<p>God not only loves those who are like Him; He also loves those who are not like Him, those who are far below the standard. He loves those who fail, fall, are backslidden, are weak, and even commit sins. The Bible charges us to love one another even as the Lord has loved us (John 15:12). The Lord loves us, not because we are like Him; He loves us even though we are absolutely not like Him. He wants us to love others with His love, to love those who are worse than us and who are backslidden or weak.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should not fellowship merely with those who suit our taste and ignore those who do not. Frankly speaking, those who need the most fellowship are the ones who are fallen, backslidden, and stumbled. If we do not fellowship with those who need fellowship, there is something wrong with our love. This means that our love is a human love that will not bear fruit; our love is not the divine love. If we can love those who are unlovable, who are worse than us, and who are stumbled, we will bear many saints, and there will be clusters of fruit hanging on us. This is our function.</p><h2 class="head1">LOVE AND BEARING FRUIT</h2>
<p>In John 15 the Lord said, &ldquo;I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit...These things I command you that you may love one another&rdquo; (vv. 16-17). We must remember that bearing fruit is based on loving one another. If we do not love others, we will never bear fruit. The Lord&rsquo;s command to love one another does not apply only to those who are equal to us but even more to those who are weaker and backslidden. We love them because God loves them and because they are members of the Body of Christ. If we love one another, we will bear fruit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LOVE AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>True joining is true love for one another and true building up, which issue in bearing fruit. The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up&rdquo; (1 Cor. 8:1). A building that is built of concrete and steel is sturdy and firm, because the concrete joins the stones, steel, and other materials together. The joining force in the Body of Christ is the love of Christ. Without the joining force of concrete, the materials in a building cannot be sturdy and firm. Likewise, if there are only knowledge and doctrine in the church but not the love of Christ, people will be scattered. The more doctrine we have, the more scattered the believers will be. Knowledge cannot build up; only love builds up. Love can pull together those who are falling away, unite the scattered ones, and cause the backslidden to move forward and the stumbled to stand. Love can join people together.</p>
<p>The church in Corinth was full of knowledge; hence, the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;In everything you were enriched in Him, in all utterance and all knowledge&rdquo; (1:5). However, the church in Corinth did not have the building up. On the contrary, there were divisions, strifes, criticisms, and judgments among them (vv. 11-12). The apostle seems to say that they were not short in knowledge or gifts but in love (13:2, 8). First Corinthians 13 is the only chapter in the whole Bible that speaks so specifically about love. The apostle speaks about all kinds of gifts in chapter 12, but in verse 31 he says, &ldquo;Earnestly desire the greater gifts. And moreover I show to you a most excellent way.&rdquo; Every gift requires a proper way in order for it to be used. Hence, we not only need the gifts, but we also need the way to use the gifts. The apostle presents love as the most excellent way to use the gifts.</p>
<p>For this reason, he speaks specifically about love in chapter 13, saying, &ldquo;If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. And if I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing&rdquo; (vv. 1-2). No matter what kind of gift we have, apart from love it will be rendered useless. The apostle also speaks concerning the true meaning and significance of love. If we read these verses carefully, we will see that every item is a lesson to us. Suffering long and covering all things are lessons that require us to be broken (vv. 4, 7).</p>
<p>Gifts are not foremost. Rather, love is foremost. If in any church there is a group of saints who genuinely love one another, cover one another, endure, care for, and support one another, that church will still be living even if no one has a gift of giving a message. In some places there are several believers who have the gift of giving messages, but the more they speak, the colder and drier the meeting becomes, the number of saints in the meetings gets smaller, and the saints become detached and scattered. This is because knowledge does not build up. Only love builds up.</p>
<p>May the Lord show us that if we want to afford Him a resting place, a dwelling place, and to allow Him to carry out His will in this age, we must prostrate ourselves before Him and be broken. We need to let Him remove many problems from within us, and we need to learn to be persons who can be joined together and built up with others. The problems in us must be removed so that we may love every brother and sister, regardless of their condition. We love all men because our love is of the Lord. This is the way for us to be joined with the saints as members of the Body and to be built up together. This is the way for us to be fruitful and full of function and to cause the Body of Christ, the church, to build itself up in love.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
AND ELIMINATING DISTINCTIONS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 3:9-11; Eph. 2:11-16, 18-22; 3:19</h1>
<p>Colossians 3:9-11 says, &ldquo;You have put off the old man with his practices and have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; The Greek words for <em>old man</em> and <em>new man</em> are singular, because in the eyes of God there is only one old man and only one new man. There are not many old men and many new men. All who are in Adam are one old man, and all who are in Christ have put off the old man and put on the new man.</p>
<p>Verse 11 mentions four kinds of distinctions. The first distinction is according to race, indicated by <em>Greek and Jew.</em> The second distinction is according to religious background, indicated by <em>circumcision and uncircumcision.</em> The third distinction is according to culture, indicated by <em>barbarian</em> and <em>Scythian.</em> A barbarian is an uncultured person, and Scythians were considered the most barbarous. The fourth distinction is according to social class, indicated by <em>slave</em> and <em>free man.</em> These four distinctions encompass all the distinctions in human society. However, these distinctions are in the old creation; they do not exist in the new man. In the new man there is only Christ; only Christ is all and in all.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:11-16 says, &ldquo;Remember that once you, the Gentiles in the flesh, those who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh made by hands, that you were at that time apart from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who were once far off have become near in the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our peace, He who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace, and might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity by it.&rdquo; The phrase <em>you who were once far off</em> in verse 13 is translated &ldquo;you who were once far off from God&rdquo; in the Chinese Union Version. For this reason, many people understand this phrase to mean that we were apart from God and that Christ reconciled us to God, thus causing us to be one with God. However, in addition to this meaning, this passage deals with the problem in the building up of the church, which is the problem of distinctions that are based on the old creation. Hence, <em>far off</em> in verse 13 refers to the uncircumcised Gentiles being far off from the circumcised Jews.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>middle wall of partition</em> in verse 14 speaks of the separation between the circumcised and the uncircumcised. These distinctions, separations, and problems were abolished by Christ on the cross. Christ has become the peace between the Jews and the Gentiles; He created the two into one new man, so making peace. Not only so, He reconciled both in one Body to God through the cross (vv. 15-16).</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:18-22 says, &ldquo;Through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father. So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone; in whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; According to this crucial passage, our being saved and having access to the Father are not a personal matter but a matter of the building up of the church. Being reconciled to God refers to the Jews and Gentiles being made one Body and thus reconciled to God. Having access to the Father refers to the entire Body having access in one Spirit unto the Father. This is the way that we can be built up. The apostles and prophets are the foundation of the building, and Christ Jesus is the cornerstone, which connects the two walls of the building together. One wall is the wall of the Jews, and the other is the wall of the Gentiles, both of which are connected in Christ. Thus, in Christ all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord. Furthermore, in Christ we also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will cover the practice of the building up of the church from a different angle. We will see our need to be filled with Christ. We have said repeatedly that in order to be built up, one must be broken. Only those who are broken can be joined and built up together with others. However, it is not sufficient to focus on the negative aspect of being broken. Breaking only focuses on eliminating the self and the old creation. In order for the church to be built up, we must also allow Christ to fill us inwardly; this is the positive side. In relation to the building up of the church, from our point of view, we need to be broken, but from Christ&rsquo;s point of view, we need to be filled with Him (3:19).</p><h2 class="head1">THE FALL AT BABEL<br />
BRINGING IN THE DISTINCTION OF LANGUAGES</h2>
<p>As a result of man&rsquo;s fall, differences gradually emerged among people in the old creation. The further man fell, the greater the differences became. In the garden of Eden the man created by God was pure, without the mixture of sin. But after man&rsquo;s fall in Genesis 3, complicated elements were gradually added into the human race, and man continued to fall step by step. Through every step of man&rsquo;s fall another complicated element was added. The further man fell, the more complications there were in the human race.</p>
<p>After man&rsquo;s fourth fall in Genesis 11 the complicated element of different languages was added into the human race. Language is the strongest element that divides mankind. Although skin color, race, and cultural background are also dividing factors, they are not as strong as language. There is a good example in Acts 6. Initially, the believers in Jerusalem were Jews, but among them there was a distinction based on speaking Hebrew and speaking Greek (v. 1). The disciples were all Jews, but there were problems among them: the Jews who spoke Greek murmured against the Jews who spoke Hebrew. We probably have the same feeling about the distinction of languages. The Chinese are mostly Han descendants but speak many different dialects. Some of the saints speak the Foochow dialect, some speak Shantungnese, and some speak Taiwanese. This is not a difference of race but a difference of language. From this example we can conclude that language is the strongest factor that divides mankind.</p>
<p>The difference of language is the issue of man&rsquo;s rebellion and fall at Babel. The descendants of Adam fell to the uttermost in Genesis 11. At that time they were united, and they built a city and a tower in order to make a name for themselves (v. 4). The entire Bible reveals that God&rsquo;s ultimate intention in the universe is to build a city, the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21&mdash;22). However, before God&rsquo;s building could be completed, Satan came in to produce a counterfeit. Satan not only entered into mankind but also mingled himself with mankind in order to build the city of Babel and the tower of Babel, whose top was in the heavens (Gen. 11:4), thus declaring that mankind and Satan were united to overthrow God&rsquo;s authority. This action was a great offense against God. Therefore, God came to judge men and confounded their language so that they would not be able to work together. As a result, they were scattered by God over all the earth, and the building of that city and tower was terminated (vv. 6-9). The issue of this fall was the confounding of languages. God judged them and confounded their language so that they would not be united together against Him.</p>
<p>Hence, language is altogether related to building. Satan took advantage of the original one language among men to build a city in order to oppose and rebel against God. God judged men and confounded their language so that they would not understand one another. From then on, every ethnic group developed its own language and even multiple languages. Although there are numerous dividing factors among men, the strongest dividing factor is language.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF GOD ELIMINATING<br />
THE DISTINCTION OF LANGUAGES</h2>
<p>The building up of the church began on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2). The day of Pentecost is the fulfillment of Jacob&rsquo;s pouring oil upon the stone. Genesis 28:18-19 says, &ldquo;Jacob... took the stone that he had put under his head, and he set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it. And he called the name of that place Bethel.&rdquo; In verse 22 Jacob said that the stone would be God&rsquo;s house. On the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the believers. Oil signifies the Holy Spirit, and stones signify the believers. The living stones, which the Holy Spirit has been poured upon, are built up into the church of God, the house of God, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In Genesis 11 Satan was united with man at Babel and built a city to oppose and rebel against God. In Acts 2, however, God was united with man on the day of Pentecost in order to build His holy city, the New Jerusalem. These two buildings are in direct opposition to one another. The issue of the building of Babel was God&rsquo;s judgment on man, which brought in the curse of the confounding of languages. As a result, different languages became the strongest factor that divides mankind. However, through the building on the day of Pentecost, God also eliminated the difference of languages. We can say that on the day of Pentecost the distinction of languages was done away with in the Holy Spirit (vv. 1-11).</p><h2 class="head1">NEVER BRINGING THE DISTINCTION OF LANGUAGES INTO THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In the fallen old creation a language is almost representative of a race. If the distinction of languages is eliminated, the distinction of races will also be eliminated. God wants to build up the church, but in the church there are not only Jews but also Gentiles, consisting of all nations, peoples, and tongues. In Acts 2 more than ten different tongues are mentioned (vv. 9-11). When the Holy Spirit was poured upon the disciples, the difference of languages, the curse brought in at Babel, was eliminated. If the distinction of languages had not been eliminated, it would have become a great problem to the building up of the church. If the distinction of races had remained in the church, the building up of the church would have been frustrated. On the day of Pentecost, however, the Holy Spirit resolved this problem.</p>
<p>This problem, which is attached to the flesh in the old creation, arose again in Acts 6. The disciples were multiplying in number, but there occurred a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Jews who spoke Hebrew (v. 1). This was the curse of Babel hindering the building up of the church. We need to see that the building up of the church is altogether in Christ; it is a matter of the new creation. We must be thoroughly delivered from the old creation by putting off the old man and putting on the new man so that the church may be built up. Thus, in the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew; in the new man there is only Christ (Col. 3:9-11).</p>
<p>I have no intention of encouraging everyone to speak the same language, but I hope that we would understand this principle in the Bible. The distinction of languages represents the fallen old creation. For example, the Chinese always feel that other languages are somewhat inferior in matters related to poetry or the description of scenery and sentiments. We must admit that such an appreciation of the Chinese language belongs to the old creation. The distinction of languages represents the fallen old creation and, hence, cannot be brought into the Body of Christ, which is the church. Although a built-up person will not despise his own tongue, he must not bring his tongue into the church by giving it any place in the church. Whoever brings the tongue that he treasures into the church by giving it a place is bringing the greatest hindrance into the church. To bring a tongue into the church is not according to the principle of the day of Pentecost. Rather, it is the situation of Babel. The distinction of languages is not a blessing in the Holy Spirit but a curse under God&rsquo;s judgment. We should never bring the curse of Babel into the church. To do so is to damage the building up of the church.</p>
<p>Every person has a language that he feels comfortable speaking. A person born in a Chinese family feels comfortable speaking Chinese, just as a person born in a British family feels comfortable speaking English. In the church, however, we must not allow any language to have a particular place. We use a language only for convenience at a certain time or location. In the church we cannot consider any language to be higher than other languages. If we think that a language is more important than other languages, we will damage the building up of the church. There is nothing wrong with having a Taiwanese-speaking meeting for the convenience of communicating. But it is wrong for the brothers to have the intention of forming a Taiwanese church. Doing so does not build up the church but rather tears it down. Such an action is not according to the principle of the day of Pentecost but according to the principle of Babel, and it brings the things that are judged and cursed by God into the building of God.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should never have the concept of building up an assembly based on a particular language. In China we should speak in Mandarin, because it is commonly spoken in that country. In the United States we should speak in English, because it is spoken by the vast majority of people locally. The church in New York City has a Chinese-speaking meeting because there are some Chinese who are unable to understand the messages in English. All the fellowship, prayers, and testimonies in this meeting are in Chinese. However, the brothers in New York City have no intention of building up a Chinese church. There should not be any emphasis on a certain language in the church. Whatever language is commonly used in a place is the language that we should use. We should never build up a church based on a particular language.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN<br />
AND PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>For the church life we need to put off the old man and put on the new man (vv. 9-10). Even in the matter of language we should completely put off the old man and not give him any place. In the church of God everything of the old creation should be completely put off. Although the matter of language is often neglected, it is the strongest dividing factor in the old creation. It is easy for us to say that a brother with a bad temper has not yet put off the old creation. But we might never consider that the preference for a certain language is also a strong indication that the old creation is not yet put off. We must remember that the strongest manifestation of the old creation is human languages. If we are saved in this matter, we will eagerly desire all the saints to utter such universal expressions as <em>Hallelujah.</em></p>
<p>Someone once asked what language we will speak when we go to be with the Lord. I believe that we will use words like <em>Hallelujah. Hallelujah</em> is a word that everyone understands in the Lord. On that day, when we meet brothers from Denmark, we will be able to fellowship with them both in spirit and verbally. Likewise, when we meet saints from South America, we will be able to fellowship with them both in spirit and verbally. We will be able to fellowship both in spirit and verbally with saints from any part of the earth. May we be those who put off the curse brought in by Babel.</p>
<p>We should not treasure our own language. When we realize that the origin of differing tongues is Babel, we will no longer treasure our language. The curse from Babel is a great hindrance to our fellowship with the brothers and sisters. Sometimes we can fellowship only with hand motions. Suppose I go to fellowship with the brothers in Denmark, but there are brothers of different nationalities among them. Some may be from Switzerland, some from Sweden, some from Norway, and others from England. I can fellowship with those who understand English, but with those who cannot understand English I can only communicate with hand gestures. What a blessing it would be to be freed from differing languages! Only when we are in situations in which we cannot communicate do we realize that language is something of the old creation. Therefore, we should not consider language as something wonderful. Rather, we need to be saved and completely put off the old creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING EVERYTHING IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>If the church is to be built up among people of so many different languages, every saved person must put off the distinction of languages in the old creation. We must put off the old man and put on the new man. In the new man there is no distinction of races, such as the distinction between Greek and Jew; no distinction of religious backgrounds, such as the distinction between circumcision and uncircumcision; no distinction of cultures, such as the distinction between barbarian and Scythian; and no distinction of social classes, such as the distinction between slave and free man. If we still have feelings toward any kind of distinction, we are at best a pious, spiritual Christian but not a Christian who is built up in the church. In order to be built up in the church, all the distinctions in the old creation must be shut outside the church. No one should say that a brother who is a business owner or university professor cannot fellowship with a brother who does hard labor or is uneducated. No distinction must be brought into the church; hence, even the distinction of social classes has no place in the church. In the church there is only Christ. Only Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:11).</p>
<p>For this reason, the brothers with a higher social standing or rank should have much fellowship with the brothers who have a lesser standing or rank in society. We desire to contact all the brothers and sisters, but in order to turn the traditional, degraded situation in Christianity around, we try not to focus on those with social standing or treat them preferentially. We would rather distance ourselves from those with social standing and have more contact with those who do not have any standing. This does not mean, however, that we despise the saints with social standing. Our love for all the brothers and sisters is the same; they are all dear to us. From the human perspective, we respect those with social standing. But we need to see that the church is the one new man. Everything of the old creation must be put off, and all the distinctions of the old creation must be kept outside the church. In the church there is only Christ. There is no Greek or Jew, no circumcision or uncircumcision, no barbarian or Scythian, no slave or free man. There is only Christ who is all and in all.</p>
<p>Even though we are all different, may we truly see that there is no distinction in the new man, and by the grace of God may we learn to put aside all the distinctions of the old creation so that God may build us up into the church, His dwelling place.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">BUILDING AND CONSECRATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 3:1-15; Rom. 6:19; 12:1, 4-5</h1>
<p>Several key points are presented in 1 Corinthians 3:1-15. Verse 2 says, &ldquo;I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it. But neither yet now are you able.&rdquo; In this verse Paul speaks to the Corinthian believers concerning feeding. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Ministers through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to each one of them.&rdquo; Here Paul speaks concerning guiding people to believe. In verse 6 he says, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered.&rdquo; This verse is concerning planting and watering, both of which are in relation to plants. Paul seems to be saying that the believers are &ldquo;God&rsquo;s cultivated land&rdquo; (v. 9) because they have the divine life; hence, they need planting as well as watering. In verses 9, 10, and 12 Paul says, &ldquo;We are God&rsquo;s fellow workers...I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it. But let each man take heed how he builds upon it...If anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble.&rdquo; These verses are concerning building.</p>
<p>This passage contains four key points: feeding, guiding, planting and watering, and building. These four points reveal how the apostles built up the church. Paul fed people as much as they were able to receive. The apostles guided people to believe, even as the Lord gave to each one. To believe is to have faith. This faith refers not only to the faith that enables people to be regenerated; it also refers to the faith that enables people to touch every spiritual matter. Our faith enables us to receive spiritual things from the Lord, and we need to be guided into this faith. Paul says, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth&rdquo; (v. 6). Paul considered himself as a planter and Apollos as a waterer. Both Paul and Apollos worked together with God to take care of God&rsquo;s cultivated land (v. 9). Paul was also a wise master builder who laid a foundation, and others were building upon that foundation (v. 10). The foundation is Jesus Christ (v. 11), and the building materials must be gold, silver, and precious stones (v. 12)</p>
<p>In the Bible gold signifies the nature of God the Father, silver signifies the redemption of Christ the Son and the principle of the cross, and precious stones signify the constituting and transforming work of the Holy Spirit. Hence, gold, silver, and precious stones signify the threefold work of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Gold is of God the Father, silver is what the Son accomplished on the cross, and precious stones are what the Spirit is producing in us. We received God&rsquo;s nature when we were regenerated. Since then, the cross has been working in us to remove the old creation and bring in the new creation. At the same time, the Holy Spirit is working to constitute and transform us by disciplining us outwardly and by operating within us. The issue of this threefold work is our possessing the image of God. This is the work of gold, silver, and precious stones.</p>
<p>Paul also speaks of another kind of work, the work of wood, grass, and stubble. Wood is in contrast to gold, grass is in contrast to silver, and stubble is in contrast to precious stones. According to typology, wood signifies the nature of man. In the Old Testament the Ark and other furniture in the tabernacle were made of wood overlaid with gold (Exo. 25:11-14, 23-24, 28). Here gold signifies the divinity of the Lord Jesus, and wood signifies His humanity. Wood overlaid with gold signifies that the Lord Jesus possesses both divinity and humanity. He is God entering into man and putting on humanity. In the Lord Jesus there is humanity, signified by wood, and divinity, signified by gold. In the Bible grass, which is in contrast to silver, signifies the flesh. Hence, 1 Peter 1:24 says, &ldquo;All flesh is like grass.&rdquo; Silver signifies the work of the cross. The cross of Christ terminates, deals with, and eliminates man&rsquo;s flesh. Therefore, grass is in contrast to silver. Stubble signifies the earthly condition, that is, the absence of a heavenly condition. Stubble is worthless. It neither illuminates nor shines and hence has absolutely no value. It is in contrast to the transparent and invaluable precious stones.</p>
<p>Feeding, guiding, planting and watering, and building are the four key points in the work of the apostles. However, feeding people, guiding them to believe, and planting and watering are for the purpose of building. Feeding is for building, guiding people to believe is for building, and planting and watering are also for building. There are various aspects to the work of the apostles, but there is only one purpose&mdash;building.</p>
<p>I sense that we have all seen the vision of God&rsquo;s building, and we are willing to be built by God and participate in His building. In other words, we are willing to be built up, and we are also willing to build up others. However, according to my observation, we are still unclear concerning how to practically be built up. We do not know how to begin, because we have not touched the way of building. Hence, in this chapter we will fellowship concerning the practice of building.</p>
<p>Building is not a simple matter. Sweeping the floor and cleaning are simple and do not involve many techniques, but building a house is not simple. A house cannot be built by a layman. Building a house requires a professional who is experienced in the field of construction. The building up of the church is even more difficult and complex than building in the physical realm. We cannot merely speak about building without having the reality of the building. We must see the blueprint of the building as well as the details, such as how to lay the foundation, how to use the materials, and how to set the beams, build the walls, place the roof tiles, install the doors and windows, and decorate the interior and the exterior. We must know the details related to the practice of building.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF ALL OUR SERVICE AND WORK<br />
BEING TO BUILD UP THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>As serving ones in the localities, we can be compared to ones working in a construction company. In a construction company some people are engineers, some are master builders, some are skilled workers, and others carry sand and wood. We have different functions, but there is only one goal, which is to build up the mutual dwelling place of God and man in the universe.</p>
<p>We must see that all the work in the New Testament is for the one goal of building up the church, the dwelling place of God. When Peter recognized that the Lord Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord immediately told the disciples that He would build His church (Matt. 16:16, 18). When the apostles later went out to work, they were building up the eternal dwelling place of God. The apostle Paul says that they were God&rsquo;s fellow workers in order to build up His dwelling place. Eventually, when the work of God is consummated at the end of the Bible, the New Jerusalem will be manifested as the eternal dwelling place of God (Rev. 21:2-3). Therefore, we need to see that all of God&rsquo;s work, especially His work in the New Testament, is for the one goal of building His house.</p>
<p>Even our preaching the gospel and saving souls are for the building up of God&rsquo;s house. Proper gospel preaching will not hinder the building; rather, it contributes to the building. Preaching the gospel can be compared to cutting trees and mining stones, that is, to gaining the materials for the building. It would be a gross error to talk about building while our numbers decrease, that is, while the building materials are being stolen by the devil. It is useless to merely talk about building. On the one hand, we need to preserve the existing materials from being lost or stolen by Satan, but on the other hand, we also need to fight the battle in order to rescue more building materials, precious souls, from under Satan&rsquo;s usurpation. Preaching the gospel is simply to obtain materials for the building. We need to have such an understanding.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING NOT BEING A SIMPLE MATTER</h2>
<p>Those who have built a house know that it is not a simple matter. Although there is one common goal, there are numerous minute details; none of which are easy. I have participated in several projects for building meeting halls in the past. The most difficult thing is to acquire a site. More than ten years ago we wanted to build a meeting hall in a certain locality. We spent much time and effort to find a piece of land. When we were ready to purchase the property, other parties came to compete with us. They used various ways to frustrate us. Through much prayer and the exercise of wisdom, we finally acquired the land. After purchasing the land, however, we found out that a portion of the land in the center of our property belonged to someone else. It was through more prayer and negotiations that we finally obtained the entire property.</p>
<p>When we wanted to build a meeting hall in Shanghai that could hold three thousand people, we put much effort into buying the land. We spent about nine months looking for the site, and we considered at least twenty to thirty properties before we finally found the one that we wanted. However, the buying process was long and complicated. The same thing happened in Manila. Although we purchased a piece of land a few years ago in order to build a meeting hall, we have to wait because the site is currently occupied. Therefore, the first step in building a house is to obtain the site, but this step is not easy. Likewise, if we want to build up the church, we must first obtain the proper ground as the site of the building. Concerning the proper ground, we have suffered Satan&rsquo;s severe attacks and interferences.</p>
<p>After obtaining the site, we need to gather the materials for the building. Sometimes the material that we need is not available because others do not want to sell it. Besides obtaining the material, the contractors may not be very cooperative. Sometimes the contractors are cooperative, but when the work begins, the weather is not suitable. Sometimes the weather is suitable, but the building cannot proceed because the workers cannot coordinate.</p>
<p>Hence, in the physical realm building can be very difficult. It is even more difficult to build in the spiritual realm. God desires to gain a building site, building materials, and fellow workers from a fallen, mixed, and chaotic human race. He also desires to gain the cooperation of all kinds of environments so that He may build His eternal dwelling place. How difficult this must be! For the past two thousand years He has not completed this building. Although Bible students have seen a glimpse of the blueprint of God&rsquo;s building, too many problems have hindered the practical building. We should not consider the building of God to be an easy task or consider that we can build up the church simply by encouraging people to attend a conference, study the Bible, or fellowship with one another. This is not the way. God&rsquo;s building requires extraordinary work and extraordinary effort.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NECESSITY OF WARFARE IN BUILDING</h2>
<p>Building calls for grueling warfare. In the Old Testament there was the need of fighting every time something was to be built. The children of Israel came out of Egypt to enter into Canaan and build the temple of God. Before the children of Israel left Egypt, the battle had already begun. Therefore, God said to Moses, &ldquo;I will...bring forth My armies, My people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt&rdquo; (Exo. 7:4). In order to get out of Egypt, they had to fight the Egyptians. After they left Egypt and arrived in the wilderness, they fought with Amalek (17:8). When they reached the border of the good land, the children of Israel needed to fight again in order to enter the land (Num. 21). They also needed to destroy the seven nations that occupied Canaan before they could take the land (Deut. 7:1-2). The way for the Israelites to enter into and occupy Canaan was a way of warfare. They were not carried into Canaan on a palanquin but fought their way into the land. After they crossed the river Jordan, they waged war with Jericho (Josh. 6) and fought again and again until they conquered the entire land of Canaan. This warfare lasted until the time of David. It was not until David became king that all the enemies were completely subdued (2 Sam. 8:1&mdash;10:19). Only at this time could the matter of building the temple be considered. Hence, the site for the building can be gained only through much warfare.</p>
<p>The materials that David collected for building the temple were the spoil gained in his victory in battle. For example, the gold for building the temple was part of the spoil that David gained. Therefore, even the building materials can be gained only through warfare (8:10-11; 1 Chron. 22:14). When the children of Israel returned from their captivity, Ezra, Nehemiah, and others rose up to rebuild the holy temple and the holy city through intense warfare. They did the work with one hand and held a weapon in the other (Neh. 4:16-17). This means that with one hand they did the work of building and with the other hand fought to defend themselves against the repeated attacks of their enemies. While they were restoring the walls of Jerusalem, there was the attack of their enemies from without (vv. 7-8) and also discord and opinions from within the midst of the children of Israel (5:1-5). Hence, the building of God&rsquo;s house is not a simple matter.</p>
<p>We need to put in a great deal of effort and patiently carry out the building up of God&rsquo;s house one step at a time. We must exercise patience, be fine, and work slowly instead of rushing, being rough, and doing a quick work. To be slow does not mean that we are passive; rather, we are actively carrying out the building work step by step.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NECESSITY OF CONSECRATION<br />
IN THE PRACTICE OF BUILDING UP</h2>
<p>There are numerous details related to the practice of building up. The first item is to consecrate ourselves. Doing something is not more important than consecration. After a person is saved and becomes material for God&rsquo;s building, he needs to be worked on. Building a house is an example. A piece of raw material must be shaped before it can be built with other material. Likewise, after a person is saved, God must work on him before he can be built up. However, in order for God to work on a person, that person must have a thorough consecration. The responsible brothers and the serving ones in every locality must deal once more with the Lord concerning their consecration. If we neglect the matter of consecration, our efforts to build up the church will be in vain no matter how many messages we give. Everyone who desires to be built up must be a consecrated person and must also help others to consecrate themselves.</p>
<p>In order for God to work on us, we must consecrate ourselves, hand ourselves over to Him. It is true that a person becomes material for the building as soon as he is saved. However, if he does not put himself into the Lord&rsquo;s hand, he is not properly situated for the building. No matter how many messages he hears, without consecration he has no way to be built up. Thus, in order to be built up, we must be consecrated.</p>
<p>If we truly see the need of God&rsquo;s building, we will be constrained to consecrate ourselves to the Lord again concerning this matter. Even if we consecrated ourselves many years ago, we must consecrate ourselves again. The burnt offering was offered every day in the morning and in the evening (Num. 28:3-4). It was also offered on every Sabbath day (vv. 9-10), at the beginning of every month (vv. 11-15), and in every feast (vv. 16-19, 26-27; 29:1-2, 7-8, 12-13). The burnt offering was offered whenever there was an important event. The burnt offering typifies our consecration. Hence, we should consecrate ourselves every morning and every evening. We should consecrate ourselves when we leave the house and when we return. We should consecrate ourselves at every critical juncture of our human life, such as when we begin our education, graduate, get engaged, get married, and find employment. We should also consecrate ourselves when we visit the saints or go out to preach the gospel. In short, every occasion is a time for us to consecrate ourselves again.</p>
<p>Since we have seen the need for the building up of God&rsquo;s house and are willing to allow Him to build us, we must have a thorough consecration to commit ourselves into His hand once more. Unless we renew our consecration, we cannot be built up.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CONSECRATION OF THE MEMBERS AND<br />
THE CONSECRATION OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>The first Epistle in the New Testament, the book of Romans, is concerning the spiritual progress of a believer. The first two chapters reveal that every person, whether Jew or Gentile, is a sinner before his salvation. Chapters 3 and 4 reveal how a sinner is redeemed and justified by the blood of Christ. Chapters 5 and 6 reveal that prior to redemption, a sinner is of the old creation in Adam, being in Adam by nature. Hence, a sinner can never please God. A sinner can be accepted by God in Christ because the old creation was terminated by Christ on the cross. After being accepted by God, reconciled to God, and delighting in God, a believer needs to cooperate with God by presenting his members to God as weapons of righteousness (6:13) so that what Christ accomplished on the cross may be applied to him.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 covers the presenting of our members in detail. Formerly, we committed sins with our members, but now we should present our members to God. If we want God to apply the work of the cross in us and nullify the effects of the old creation in us, we need to cooperate with Him by presenting our members one by one. We need to say, &ldquo;Lord, from today onward I present my eyes to You, I present my ears to You, and I present my mind to You. I will no longer use my eyes to look at things carelessly, my mind to think about inappropriate things, or my ears to listen to gossip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is difficult for some saints to pray; they can utter only a few words. But they are very fluent and eloquent when they gossip. Their mouths are very adept at gossiping but not at praying. There are other saints who do not seem to hear the message given in a meeting, but they can clearly hear every word of gossip that is whispered in the back rows. The mouths and ears of these saints are neither consecrated to God nor ruled by Him.</p>
<p>Many saints might have yet another problem. They do not forget what they read in the newspapers, but they either do not understand, are confused about, or do not remember what they read in the Bible. The verse that they managed to memorize in the morning is forgotten by breakfast time. They know that they read the Bible but cannot recall which verses they read. According to a Chinese saying, their heart is somewhere else, and they look but do not see. Hence, their heart and eyes are not consecrated. If we consecrate our heart and eyes to God, we will concentrate on the Bible, the Word of God, instead of the newspapers. This is to present our members according to Romans 6.</p>
<p>If we present our members one by one to God, our hands will not be free to do what God does not allow. Our feet will not be free to walk on the path that God does not allow. Our mouth will not utter words that the Lord does not allow, and our ears will not listen to words that He does not allow. Paul says, &ldquo;Just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness...so now present your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification&rdquo; (v. 19). If we genuinely experience consecration, our members will become very functional because they will serve God and be used by Him. I have seen people who were clumsy in speech, but after their consecration they gave messages, prayed, and testified eloquently.</p>
<p>There is a dear co-worker who could not speak in a clear way and whose prayers did not make sense when I first met him. However, he loved the Lord very much and had a strong consecration. Because his mouth was consecrated, he would not open his mouth to talk carelessly. When he began to serve the Lord full time, his living condition was difficult. Nevertheless, he remained in the position of his consecration and would not shrink back. A few years later, I heard him give a message and could hardly believe that he was the person speaking, because he was very eloquent. However, it was not a common eloquence but the eloquence that comes with the utterance of the Holy Spirit. He was able to speak for God because he had consecrated his mouth. He was a person who had presented his members to God.</p>
<p>God wants to work in us extensively so that He may bring us into the building up of the Body of Christ. But we first need to consecrate ourselves to Him. Our consecration should not be general; rather, we should consecrate our members one by one in a detailed way (Rom. 6). Many people are troubled by a chaotic and wild mind. For such a saint the way of salvation is to consecrate his mind to God in a definite way. Just as his mind was presented to chaotic thoughts, he now needs to present his mind to God. As soon as we pass through the door of presenting our members, we will be delivered from the old creation in Adam and live in the reality of Christ in our practical living. Hence, we need to have a thorough consecration.</p>
<p>Chapters 5 and 6 say that we were formerly in Adam, but we are now in Christ. After we see this truth, we need to present our members one by one to God. If a particular member is weak, we need to consecrate that member to God. If a sister has a tendency to gossip, she needs to consecrate her mouth and tongue in a particular way to God. If her eyes like to look at inappropriate things, she needs to thoroughly consecrate her eyes to God. If her heart is not broad, not willing to forgive others and forget their offenses, or if her heart harbors hatred because of something insignificant, then she needs to consecrate her heart to God. She needs to say, &ldquo;Lord, my heart is a captive of Satan. It is narrow; it hates, envies, blames, and condemns others, and it is not willing to forgive others. No matter how I struggle and strive, I cannot overcome. By Your grace I consecrate my heart to You.&rdquo; If she is willing to consecrate herself in such a way, her heart will change from being narrow to being broad, from hating people to loving people, and from not forgiving others to forgiving them. We need a detailed and specific consecration in order to experience Romans 5 and 6 in a practical way.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 speaks of being in the flesh, and chapter 8 speaks of being in the Holy Spirit. These two chapters show that we cannot live by the flesh. Whenever we try to please God by our flesh, we will fail. We must learn to be in spirit and walk according to the spirit, that is, to be freed by the law of the Spirit of life in Christ (8:2). We need to set our mind on the spirit, mind the things of the Spirit, and walk according to the spirit (vv. 4-6). This is deeper than consecration because it involves cooperating with the Holy Spirit in the deepest part of our being. Then we will be freed from our flesh and live in our spirit in our daily living. This is the way to be spiritual.</p>
<p>Chapters 9 through 11 do not continue the matter of spiritual experience. Rather, these chapters are an insertion and speak of God&rsquo;s selection and calling. From the standpoint of experience, chapter 12 follows chapter 8. Chapters 1 and 2 are concerning sinners. Chapters 3 and 4 are concerning the justified. Chapters 5 and 6 are concerning those who have been transferred out of Adam into Christ and have presented their members to God. Chapters 7 and 8 are concerning those who are freed from the bondage of the flesh to live in the spirit and walk according to the spirit. A person with these experiences is spiritual and lives before God.</p>
<p>Chapter 12 is concerning the Body, which is the matter of building. We who are many are members one of another in Christ as one Body. This is building (v. 5). Therefore, there is a great turn in chapter 12, and the apostle speaks about consecration again. However, this time he is not asking us to present our individual members, such as our mouth, eyes, and ears; rather, he is exhorting us to present our body. The presenting in chapter 6 is for a living that is transferred out of Adam into Christ in order to live Christ. In order to have a living that is sanctified and justified, we need to present our members. The presenting in chapter 12 is not for us to be delivered from sin in order to live a proper life but for us to become building materials. Hence, we need to present our body. In chapters 3 and 4 we are justified by God and accepted by Him, in chapters 5 and 6 we are transferred out of Adam into Christ, and in chapters 7 and 8 we are delivered out of the flesh to live in the Holy Spirit in our practical daily living. Now we are good material for God&rsquo;s building. Hence, at this critical juncture we need to consecrate our whole being again and give our entire being to God for His building. This is the last station, the last level, in our spiritual progress. To present ourselves for God&rsquo;s building in such a way is our reasonable service. Such a consecration will cause us to understand God&rsquo;s good, well-pleasing, and perfect will (12:2). Chapters 13 through 16 provide supplementary points regarding how we should conduct ourselves in the church life while we live in the spirit and are built by God into one Body. This is the line of thought that runs through the book of Romans.</p>
<p>Romans reveals that in order to be built by God, we must be consecrated persons. The first step of consecration is to overcome sins, but the second step of consecration is to be built by God. We first need to be consecrated persons with experiences of consecration, and then we can lead others into this matter.</p>
<p>After we pass through the gate of consecration, we will have many dealings, such as dealing with sins, dealing with the world, and dealing with the flesh. If we are not consecrated, we cannot experience the practical dealing, nor can we be built practically. Just as raw materials must be cut and polished before they can be used to build, so also we believers need to consecrate ourselves and surrender to God so that He may deal with the problems in our being in order to build us.</p>
<p>If as serving ones we would have extensive and adequate experiences of these things, we would be able to discern whether feeding, guiding, or cultivating and watering is the proper way to build up a person. As soon as we contact someone, we will know his spiritual condition. If he is not clear concerning his salvation, we will help him to be clear. If he is clear concerning his salvation but has not consecrated himself, we will help him in the matter of consecration. After a period of time, those who are helped and led by us should be able to be built up with others in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF A RENEWED, THOROUGH CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>We need to reconsider our consecration before the Lord and ask ourselves whether we live in the position of our consecration. We also need to consecrate ourselves to God once again for His building. If a brother consecrated himself in a general way in the past, he now needs to be definite and thorough to present his members according to Romans 6, presenting his eyes, mouth, hands, and heart. Then he must consecrate his body according to chapter 12. The consecration in chapter 6 is the consecration of our members so that we can have a proper living, but the consecration in chapter 12 is the consecration of our body so that our whole being can become building material in God&rsquo;s hand. The more thorough these two steps of consecration are, the better. There is nothing wrong with consecrating ourselves many times. Every renewed consecration will refresh our spiritual condition.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">NEEDING TO CARE FOR THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S HOUSE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 2:17; 2 Cor. 11:28; 1 Cor. 3:16-17; Hag. 1:2-11</h1>
<p>We will begin this chapter by considering two portions in the Scriptures. The first portion, John 2:17, says that the Lord was devoured by the zeal of God&rsquo;s house. The second portion, 2 Corinthians 11:28, says that the crowd of cares that daily pressed on the apostle Paul was his anxious concern for all the churches. When the Lord was on the earth, the center of His work was to build a house for God. Hence, He was devoured by the zeal of God&rsquo;s house. Likewise, when the apostles were working for the Lord on the earth, the center of their work was to build up the house of God. The apostles labored for the building up of the house of God, and their hearts were anxious for all the churches; they daily bore the burden of all the churches. In 2 Corinthians the apostle Paul was not referring to the cares of individual saints but to the cares of all the churches. He had an anxious concern for all the churches. Although caring for the churches includes caring for the saints, there is a great difference between caring for the churches and caring for the saints individually.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARING FOR GOD&rsquo;S NEED</h2>
<p>According to my observation, most of God&rsquo;s children listen to His words in the same way that unbelievers listen to the gospel. Most believers take care of their personal needs and consider themselves to be the center and the starting point. They happily receive messages concerning God&rsquo;s comforting, visitation, deliverance, peace, and prosperity. They also respond to messages concerning how to overcome, be spiritual, be sanctified, be well pleasing to God, or grow in life. However, not many respond to or are interested in a message concerning God&rsquo;s need for a house or for men to be built up as His resting place. This is because human beings always care for their personal needs. Concerning both the material realm and the spiritual realm, human beings are selfish and always want to gain something for themselves instead of considering what God desires.</p>
<p>Hence, rarely in Christian meetings is a message spoken concerning the need of God. Rarely is there a message that says God needs man, requires something of man, and wants to gain something from man. Nearly every sermon and Christian book takes care of man&rsquo;s need of God&rsquo;s salvation, deliverance, blessing, grace, and visitation. We agree that these needs are real. From the negative point of view, God&rsquo;s work and His speaking are concerning man&rsquo;s need, but from the positive point of view, they are concerning His need. God needs man, and He needs to gain something constituted of man. God&rsquo;s need is greater than man&rsquo;s need and has existed in the universe since eternity past. Our need simply reflects God&rsquo;s need. Our dissatisfaction reflects His dissatisfaction, and our need for rest and joy reflects His need for rest and joy.</p>
<p>Both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament there is a picture that portrays the principle of man&rsquo;s need reflecting God&rsquo;s need. The picture in the Old Testament is in Genesis 28, where a wandering man met a God who had no resting place. The picture in the New Testament is in John 4, where a thirsty Savior met a thirsty sinner. These two pictures show that man&rsquo;s condition reflects God&rsquo;s condition.</p>
<p>As God&rsquo;s redeemed people, we need to realize that our suffering pain within indicates that God is also suffering and that our being satisfied and joyful mean that God also feels satisfied and joyful. Therefore, our spiritual condition is a measure and reflection of how much of God we have gained. By looking at our condition, we can know God&rsquo;s feeling. It is regrettable that we often take care of only our needs, not God&rsquo;s need. If we want to be Christians who match God&rsquo;s desire and meet His need in this age, we cannot be trapped in ourselves. We must come out of ourselves to care for God&rsquo;s need; otherwise, we will never be built by God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARING FOR THE BUILDING UP OF GOD&rsquo;S HOUSE<br />
TO RECEIVE THE BLESSING</h2>
<p>God desires that we come out of ourselves and our selfishness in order to care for the building up of His house. Those who are spiritually experienced know that God will care for us if we are willing to take care of others for His building. But if we do everything for ourselves and take care only of ourselves, we will not be built up in God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Strong instead of Weak</h2>
<p>A brother who prays continually to the Lord for victory and strength but does not care for others will get weaker and have more failures. If, by the mercy of God, he learns to set aside his weaknesses and failures in order to care for the needs of others, he will gradually find that he will be supplied and strengthened regardless of whether others receive help from his visitation. By caring for others, he takes care of the building up of God&rsquo;s house; therefore, God will care for him. This is a spiritual principle.</p><h2 class="head2">Loving the Lord Fervently</h2>
<p>Some people are concerned that they might become cold and stop loving the Lord. Those who constantly hope to love the Lord fervently are more likely to become cold. It is a common occurrence among Christians for those who hope to become zealous and love the Lord to eventually become cold and backslidden. However, we will surely be burning if, instead of focusing on our being fervent, we would care for others and visit them. We might wonder how we can visit others if we are not meeting regularly. If we would wait until our love for the Lord is burning and until we meet regularly before visiting people, we might need to wait a few years. Instead of caring about our cold condition, we should go visit a brother and say, &ldquo;Brother, I have not been meeting for a long time, but the Lord wants me to visit you.&rdquo; We may also tell him that we have not prayed for half a year. If we would be willing to say this to a brother, our praying will be recovered, and we will begin meeting regularly.</p>
<p>Haggai 1:9 says, &ldquo;You looked for much, and yet it amounted to little; and when you brought it home, I blew on it. Why? declares Jehovah of hosts. Because of My house that lies waste while you each run to your own house.&rdquo; Those who hope to eventually rise up and become spiritual and zealous are in principle the same as those who run to their own houses. Such people will not receive the blessing of God. This is the principle by which God deals with those who care for their own houses. If we can set aside our condition and can care for God&rsquo;s children who are the house of God, His blessing will be upon us. We should consider it to be of no consequence whether we are cold, zealous, spiritual, holy, or overcoming and instead have an anxious concern in our heart for the brothers and sisters and be devoured by the zeal of God&rsquo;s house. We should be like the apostle who had an anxious concern for all the churches and longed for the churches to be built up. Then we will become zealous, spiritual, holy, and overcoming. If we would care for the house of God in such a way, many blessings will be poured upon us.</p>
<p>However, we must not live a defeated life. I am burdened for us to see that the building up of God&rsquo;s house is what matters, not our personal victory, holiness, or spirituality. We are blessed when we are willing to set aside our personal benefit and spirituality and instead focus on the building up of God&rsquo;s house, the church. We may not have time for our personal pursuit, but we will grow at a rapid pace. We may not pray much, but our prayers will be answered. We may read only small portions of the Bible, but we will be fed and satisfied.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving Light from the Bible</h2>
<p>Some people have a pure desire to read the Bible in a proper way and, hence, spend much time to read the Bible. They do not have the purpose of becoming a teacher or of acquiring more understanding than others. However, it is possible that the more diligently they read the Bible, the more confused they will become. Such ones should learn to help others read the Bible and to read the Bible with others. Then they will be enlightened when they read the Bible.</p>
<p>People who think that they are capable of teaching others because they have a better understanding of the Bible are in darkness. Hence, they will not receive much blessing when helping others read the Bible. If we long for the Word of God, have a desire to read it, and feel the need to be enlightened but are willing to drop our pursuit in the Word in order to visit the believers who do not have a heart for the Word, we will be full of light when we read even one verse with them. We will even receive light when they utter a sentence from the Bible. Suppose we plan to fellowship with a brother concerning John 1:14 but do not have much light. The light will come as soon as we begin to speak. Such light is more precious than the light gained by studying concordances, reference books, encyclopedias, and Bible commentaries by ourselves.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on ourselves, we must care for the house of God. I enjoy reading the Bible, and if I had the time to do so, I could spend my whole life reading the Bible. However, I cannot do this and also take care of the needs of the saints. There are so many believers who need to be ministered to; hence, I cannot shut myself up in a room in order to read the Bible. I can testify that the light I have received from God far surpasses what I could have received in my personal study. If I had done nothing but read the Bible for the past thirty years, I do not believe that I would know the Bible or that I would have received any light. But by the grace of God I am much clearer concerning the Bible than I was thirty years ago. Such clarity has nothing to do with my mental capacity; it is entirely God&rsquo;s blessing. If we are for the house of God, His blessings will be ours. But if we are for our personal benefit, His blessings will be taken away from us.</p><h2 class="head2">Our Messages Being Empowered</h2>
<p>I have often noticed that I receive more light from the Bible when I am giving a message. Therefore, the younger co-workers should not think that they can receive more light in their personal study time. Suppose a co-worker who is preparing for a message is asked to visit a brother. If the co-worker refuses and says, &ldquo;I need to give a message tomorrow, so I cannot go,&rdquo; he will be closed to the needs of the saints. Even if he is able to give the message, it will be a dead message, lacking God&rsquo;s blessing. Even though the co-worker needs to prepare for the message, there are saints who need visiting. If he has a burden for the building up of God&rsquo;s house, he would care for the needs of the saints instead of his preparation. Perhaps he will not know what to speak about on the podium, but that message will be living and full of God&rsquo;s presence. There might not be anything high or profound in the message, but that message will touch the saints and open them. The saints will be encouraged to attend the meetings regularly, their problems will disappear, and they will gain understanding. This is the result of having God&rsquo;s blessing in our speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Prayers Being Answered</h2>
<p>The same principle applies to prayer. Sometimes we should leave the work and spend time with God in a quiet place. Even the Lord Jesus often set everything aside when He was on earth to spend time privately in prayer to God (Luke 6:12; Matt. 14:23). However, we cannot ignore the saints who have needs in order to focus on prayer for our personal spirituality. If the children of God express their need and request our ministering and help, we cannot ignore them. We must care whether they are stumbled or backslidden. Otherwise, our prayer will not be effective, heaven will be closed to us, and our fellowship with God will be interrupted. Even an hour spent in prayer would be a waste of time.</p>
<p>If, instead of caring for our personal prayer, we would care for the needs of the saints, the Holy Spirit would answer our prayers before we pray. In other words, because we care for the house of God, we will bring in much even though we have sown little, we will be satisfied even though we eat little, we will be warm with little clothing, and the little we earn will not be wasted. This is the blessing of God.</p>
<p>If we take care of God&rsquo;s house, heaven will be open to us. If, however, we care for our personal needs instead of caring for God&rsquo;s house and build paneled houses for ourselves while His house lies waste, then we will sow much but bring in little (Hag. 1).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Missing the Blessing</h2>
<p>God will not bless a work that is apart from the building up of the church, even if the work is with the young people or the local saints. God only blesses the one work of building up the church, His house. Suppose the serving ones who work with the young people do not care for the matters in the church, that is, whether the young people are in the Lord&rsquo;s Day ministry meeting or in the table meeting. If the serving ones are more interested in having a lively and presentable young people&rsquo;s meeting with many in attendance, they are pursuing the young people&rsquo;s work while God&rsquo;s house lies waste. As a result, they will sow much but bring in little. The few souls who are gained will quickly fall away.</p>
<p>Likewise, if the serving ones involved in the work among the Taiwanese saints care only for a strong Taiwanese-speaking meeting without any regard for the other districts, these serving ones are pursuing the work with the Taiwanese saints while God&rsquo;s house lies waste. As a result, they will miss God&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>If the responsible brothers care only for their own districts but do not regard the church, their service will not be blessed by God. Eventually, such ones will have the weakest districts. However, if a responsible brother is concerned for the other districts and bears the church on his heart, his district will become strong, and his service will be blessed.</p>
<p>Of course, a responsible brother should consider his district, but this is not a simple matter. If he does not care for the entire church, his considerations will not have God&rsquo;s blessings. If he cares for his district and for the entire church, he will have God&rsquo;s blessings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARING FOR THE HOUSE OF GOD<br />
BEING A PRINCIPLE</h2>
<p>John 2:17 says that the Lord was devoured by the zeal of God&rsquo;s house. In 2 Corinthians 11:28 the apostle Paul says that besides the outward problems, the crowd of cares that pressed upon him daily was an anxious concern for all the churches. These are positive statements concerning God&rsquo;s house. The Bible, however, also contains negative statements concerning destroying the house of God. In 1 Corinthians 3:17 Paul says that God will destroy persons who destroy the temple of God. It is possible that a person who seeks to do well in his own work but does not care whether the church can be built up is destroying the house of God. If this is true, God will destroy, not bless, such a work. This is very serious. This principle can be applied to our overall situation and to the details of our work. It can be applied in a general sense and in a narrow sense.</p>
<p>This principle can also be applied to material things. If we hope that God will give us material blessings to enjoy but do not care for the church of God, His house, we may not gain what we desire. On the contrary, when we give materially to the house of God more than to our own houses, we will discover that God cares for us. If, instead of caring for the house of God and the building up of the church, we focus on our personal joy and peace, we will have a miserable ending. If we set aside our own joy and peace to care for the house of God, we will eventually be full of joy and peace. Every blessing is God Himself. We have no good beyond God, and God is the portion of our cup (Psa. 16:2, 5). If we can learn to be devoured by the zeal of God&rsquo;s house and have an anxious concern for all the churches, we will be blessed people. We will also grow and have joy, peace, light, and be empowered. We will also have God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>We should pour ourselves out for the building up of the house of God until our whole being is exhausted. We must desire to be built up, and we must also build up the saints. We must be willing to consecrate ourselves to the Lord because we have learned the lessons. We must be willing to visit the saints, fellowship with them, and help them to walk on the way of the Lord, because we have been dealt with by Him. Then we can help the saints to consecrate themselves, we can help them to deal with sin, and we can help them to deal with the world. We can help them to be stripped, restricted, pressed, and ruled by God under His hand because this is our experience. By serving in this way we will experience growth, victory, joy, peace, and light, and the Bible will be opened to us. It may seem as though we do not work much, but the result of our labor will be rich and full of blessings. It may seem that we have gained little, but we will accumulate much.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM SELFISHNESS<br />
TO CARE FOR THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2>
<p>We must not focus on anything other than the work of God to build His house in the universe. Although we work with the young people, our goal is the building up of the house of God, not the young people. Although we work with the Taiwanese saints, our eyes are set on the building up of the church, not on the work among the Taiwanese saints. Although we lead the districts, our eyes are set on the building up of the church, not on the districts. We should not do anything that will mar or damage the building up of the church. We must be in fear, lest we sin against God and destroy His temple (1 Cor. 3:17).</p>
<p>We need to learn this lesson thoroughly. We must be delivered from material things, our living, spirituality, work, gifts, and service so that we would not pursue these things for ourselves. We must also be saved from the principle of selfishness so that we can take care of the building up of the house of God. We are joyful for anything that causes the church to be built up, and we reject whatever causes the church to suffer loss, even though it may be beneficial to our work. We only want the blessing from God. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would be devoured by a zeal for the house of God and so that we would be concerned for all the churches (John 2:17; 2 Cor. 11:28). May we also take heed to this warning so that we would not destroy the house of God (1 Cor. 3:17). May God bless His church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TYPE OF THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
AS SEEN IN THE TABERNACLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 38:1-20; Num. 16:35-38; 21:4-9; Exo. 27:1-8; 30:17-21; 40:29-33</h1>
<h2 class="head1">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>After the children of Israel had come out of Egypt and were at the foot of Mount Sinai, God told them to make a tabernacle for Him, a sanctuary, so that He might dwell in their midst (Exo. 25:8). This sanctuary was God&rsquo;s dwelling place in the midst of His people. The tabernacle, including the temple that was built later, signifies the children of Israel becoming God&rsquo;s dwelling place. God did not build the tabernacle or the temple to be His ultimate dwelling place; rather, He built up the children of Israel to be His spiritual dwelling place. It seemed as though the tabernacle and the temple were His dwelling place, but in reality the children of Israel were His dwelling place. Therefore, when God charged the children of Israel to build the tabernacle, His desire to obtain a dwelling place among His people was revealed.</p>
<p>Bible scholars know that the important matters explicitly revealed by God in the New Testament are either typified or portrayed with pictures in the Old Testament. These pictures are often more detailed and comprehensive than what is explicitly stated in the New Testament. This principle also applies to God&rsquo;s building. The building of the tabernacle, including the temple, in the Old Testament age is a complete picture of the building up of the church in the New Testament age. Hence, we will carefully consider the building of the tabernacle in order to know how God intends to build His church through us today.</p>
<p>From God&rsquo;s perspective, the building of the tabernacle was from the Holy of Holies to the outer court, but from man&rsquo;s perspective, it was from the outer court to the Holy of Holies. The Holy Place was between the outer court and the Holy of Holies. There were three noteworthy items in the outer court: the hangings of the court, the altar, and the laver. We will now explain each item.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HANGINGS OF THE COURT</h2>
<p>The hangings of the court refer to the fine linen that surrounded the tabernacle. When the tabernacle was pitched, it looked like a house enclosed by a court. The wall of the court was not made of wood or stone but consisted of fine linen hanging from silver hooks on bronze pillars. The bronze pillars stood in bronze sockets and were connected by silver rods (Exo. 38:9-17). The hangings of the court were the outer boundary of the tabernacle. Spiritually speaking, the items of the hangings of the court indicate how God sets the boundary of His building and how the building begins.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Bronze Sockets</h2>
<p>The most noticeable feature in the outer court was bronze. Apart from the hooks, the connecting rods, and the capitals of the pillars, which were all silver, almost everything else in the outer court was bronze (v. 17). The pillars and their sockets in the outer court were bronze (v. 10). The first major item of the outer court, the altar, was overlaid with bronze, all the utensils of the altar were made of bronze, and the laver was also made of bronze (vv. 1-8). Why were most of the items in the outer court of the tabernacle made of bronze? Bible students acknowledge that bronze signifies judgment. To be more precise, it refers to having been judged. For example, when God judged the two hundred and fifty men of Korah&rsquo;s company, they were consumed by fire from God, and their bronze censers were also burned (Num. 16:35-38). To be burned is to be judged by God. In verse 38 God said, &ldquo;The censers of those who have sinned against their own lives, let them be made into beaten plates for a covering of the altar.&rdquo; The bronze censers became a sign that all rebels and opposers of God will pass through His judgment. Hence, when people saw the bronze altar, they recalled God&rsquo;s judgment. Bronze is a sign of being judged by God.</p>
<p>Another type in the Old Testament also shows that bronze signifies judgment. When the children of Israel spoke against God and against Moses in Numbers 21:4-9, they were bitten by poisonous serpents. Therefore, Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on a pole to save the children of Israel from God&rsquo;s judgment. In the New Testament the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up&rdquo; (John 3:14). Here the Lord indicated that He was typified by the bronze serpent. The children of Israel being bitten by poisonous serpents typifies the descendants of Adam being bitten and poisoned by Satan. In the eyes of God we are the same as serpents because we have Satan&rsquo;s poisonous nature within us. The Lord Jesus as the Word became flesh (1:14), and this flesh is related to the serpent. This means that the Lord Jesus had the form of a serpent, but He did not have the poisonous nature of the serpent. Hence, Romans 8:3 says, &ldquo;God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus had the likeness and form of the flesh of sin, which in the eyes of God was the same as the poisonous serpent, Satan. However, the Lord Jesus had only the outward form of the flesh of sin; He did not have the inward sin, just as the bronze serpent that Moses made had only the form of a serpent but not the serpentine poison. The bronze serpent that Moses set on a pole typifies the Lord Jesus being judged on the cross by God so that those whom He redeemed might be delivered from God&rsquo;s judgment. These two examples in the Old Testament show that bronze refers to judgment or having been judged by God.</p>
<p>The first boundary of the tabernacle sat on bronze sockets. Within this boundary were the altar and the laver, both of which were bronze. This gives the clear impression that the building up of God&rsquo;s dwelling place must begin with His judgment, that is, with being judged by God. In other words, in order for a new believer to become material for the building up of God&rsquo;s dwelling place, he must first let the Holy Spirit work to convict, condemn, and rebuke him (John 16:8). This is to be judged. This also applies to a believer when he is revived. If we receive mercy to see this vision and are willing to let God build in us, we must pass through His judgment. We should never think that we are qualified to touch items of gold as soon as we enter into God&rsquo;s building. We must first pass through bronze in order to have silver. When we have a foundation of silver, we can slowly enter into the Holy Place, where there are items of gold. Later, we can go from the Holy Place into the Holy of Holies, where the furniture is either gold overlaying wood or pure gold (Heb. 9:2-5). This indicates that God&rsquo;s building in the church begins with His judgment. In order for us to be built by God, we must first be judged in the light of God.</p>
<p>We need to see this picture in the Old Testament. Everything that was outside the boundary of the hangings of the outer court was corrupt, dark, sinful, worldly, fleshly, and satanic and, hence, could not be part of God&rsquo;s building. Judgment, the first step of God&rsquo;s building, keeps such things outside the boundary of the building. If we desire to take part in God&rsquo;s building, we must first pass through His judgment, which deals thoroughly with everything belonging to Satan, the world, sin, and the flesh. Then we will begin to have experiences of being built.</p>
<p>I often hear some saints pray, &ldquo;Lord, we praise You because You want to gain a dwelling place, and You want to be mingled with us as one. You are being mingled with us, and we are being mingled with You to be a mutual dwelling place.&rdquo; Or they may pray, &ldquo;Lord, You are the gold, and we are the wood. You are overlaying us, and we are being mingled with You as one.&rdquo; Such prayers are not wrong, but they can be likened to jumping to the top of a building instead of climbing the stairs. At the entrance of the tabernacle there was not yet a picture of God being mingled with man. We do not see gold overlaying wood in the outer court, because this picture is not present until we enter into the Holy Place (Exo. 37:10-11, 25-26). We must be willing to be judged by God because so many things within us still need to be judged.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother quarrels with his wife and does not talk to her for a few weeks, but he comes to the prayer meeting and prays, &ldquo;Lord, build us up so that the condition of gold overlaying wood, the mingling of God and man as a mutual dwelling place, may be manifested among us.&rdquo; Can such a prayer be answered? Suppose three responsible brothers in a district are not in one accord and do not submit to one another, but at the bread-breaking meeting one of the brothers prays, &ldquo;Lord, we have seen that You want to gain a mutual dwelling place of God mingled with man. You are the gold overlaying us, the wood.&rdquo; Does such a prayer match his condition? These prayers are abnormal.</p>
<p>If God opens our eyes to see that He wants to gain a dwelling place on the earth, to build us with other saints into His dwelling place, our prayers will not be about gold overlaying wood; rather, we will condemn ourselves. We will see how many dark, base, and worldly things are in us. God will then cause us to pass through His judgment of bronze in our prayer.</p>
<p>A saint who has truly been shined upon by God to see that God wants to build him with other saints into a dwelling place will sense his corruption, desolation, offenses, and transgressions. He will see that elements of the world, the flesh, corruption, and filth are still in him. Hence, his prayer will not be concerning gold overlaying wood, God mingling with man, but rather his prayer will be similar to that of Isaiah when he met the glory of God: &ldquo;Woe is me, for I am finished!&rdquo; (Isa. 6:5). This is God&rsquo;s judgment signified by the bronze.</p><h2 class="head2">The Connecting Rods of Silver</h2>
<p>When we are judged, the Holy Spirit will show us that our corruption has been judged by God on the cross. No corrupted, filthy, fallen, or backslidden person can be used by God without first passing through the judgment of the cross. Even a believer who has been revived, accepted by God, or used by God still needs to pass through the judgment of the cross. In other words, everything that has been judged and condemned by God has been judged and condemned at the cross.</p>
<p>As soon as we experience the judgment and condemnation of the cross, there is redemption. After we are judged and condemned before God, we are redeemed and forgiven through the washing of the precious blood of Christ. This is a fine theological detail, because God cannot forgive the sins of a brother who has never judged and condemned his own sins. This is the principle in 1 John 1:9, which says, &ldquo;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s forgiveness is based on our confession of our sins, and our confession includes judging and condemning. Whenever we condemn and judge a sin, God forgives us of that sin.</p>
<p>If a brother sees that he needs to be material for the building of the church, his heart will be inclined toward God&rsquo;s building, and the Holy Spirit will immediately move within him so that he senses his sins. After he condemns his sins, the Holy Spirit will cause him to see that his sins have been judged on the cross and forgiven by God. Then he will inwardly have peace. This experience of redemption is signified by the connecting rods of silver and issues from the bronze sockets.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fine White Linen Hangings</h2>
<p>After a person is judged and experiences redemption, he no longer wants to sin. Hence, a just, clean, and white living is manifested within him. This is the fine white linen hanging on the silver rods. In the Bible garments refer to a person&rsquo;s living before God, but fine linen garments refer to the righteous acts of the believers before God (Rev. 19:8). After we experience being judged and redeemed by God, we will spontaneously have a righteous living with righteous acts.</p>
<p>The building up of the church begins here. We should not talk about being built up when there are still sins, improper things, the world, darkness, and discord among us. God&rsquo;s building begins with His judgment. Everything that is incompatible with His righteousness, holiness, and glory must be judged in His light. After we are judged and condemned, we will experience being redeemed and forgiven by God, and we will spontaneously manifest a just and righteous living. This is the boundary of God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>A brother who is not at peace with his wife does not have a just condition and cannot participate in God&rsquo;s building. He cannot touch the tabernacle if his sin is not judged and forgiven by God. Nothing unrighteous, evil, corrupt, worldly, or dark can participate in God&rsquo;s building. Thus, if this brother sees the vision of God&rsquo;s building, he will judge the abnormal condition between himself and his wife. Then he will experience redemption and receive grace to deal with the offense and be reconciled with his wife. In this way he will manifest the fine white linen hanging in his living. Furthermore, he will enter into the realm of the tabernacle and take part in God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>The children of God must realize that they cannot neglect their offenses, sins, and unrighteousnesses and still talk about God&rsquo;s building. Only those who have been condemned, judged, redeemed, and forgiven by God can enter into the tabernacle. In other words, we can experience the redemption of the silver rods and the silver hooks only after receiving the judgment of bronze, and we can manifest the fine white linen hangings only after experiencing the redemption of the silver rods and the silver hooks. By these experiences we enter within the boundary of the tabernacle and are able to discern the things outside the tabernacle from the things within. We are able to differentiate between the things that belong to the world and the things that belong to God&rsquo;s house, and we are able to separate the things of human society from the things of God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This is where God&rsquo;s building begins.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ALTAR</h2>
<p>The first large piece of furniture in the outer court was the altar. In the Old Testament no one could bypass the altar and still enter into the tabernacle. In order to enter into the tabernacle, both the high priest and the priests first had to offer an offering upon the altar (Exo. 40:29-32). Nadab and Abihu were consumed by fire and died because they did not take fire from the altar but rather presented strange fire before God (Lev. 10:1-2). Therefore, the altar is a crucial gateway. Those who serve in God&rsquo;s dwelling place must pass through the altar.</p>
<p>There are two aspects of the significance of the altar. One aspect is judgment, and the other is consecration. The aspect of judgment is seen in the bronze censers, which were used by the two hundred and fifty men of Korah&rsquo;s company and which were beaten into plates for a covering of the altar (Num. 16:35-38). This was to cause the people who saw the altar to remember that they must pass through God&rsquo;s judgment.</p>
<p>Hence, the first significance of the altar is that those who come to God must pass through His judgment. We cannot go to God in our original state; we must be judged by God. As those who want to be in God&rsquo;s building, His dwelling place, we must pass through the bronze altar, the place of judgment. The first thing that we encounter when we take a step toward God is bronze, God&rsquo;s judgment. This causes us to sense that we are incompatible with God&rsquo;s will, His heart, and His righteousness and that we are short of His glory and still have much of the world and the flesh. As a result, we will condemn our sins and confess them before God. This is the work of the Holy Spirit convicting us concerning sin, concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment (John 16:8). This is our experience when we are newly saved and every time that we are revived.</p>
<p>If we see the vision of being God&rsquo;s building and are willing to care for His need, the Spirit will operate to convict us. We will sense that we cannot stand under the shining of God&rsquo;s light and that we are short in our service, work, testimony, coordination, and private living, and we will spontaneously experience God&rsquo;s judgment. We may have heard many messages concerning dealing with sins, but this is a matter of experience, not of understanding doctrine. If we truly see the vision of God&rsquo;s building, we will be judged. We were judged at our salvation, and we are judged when we are revived. But these experiences are not sufficient. We must also be judged for God&rsquo;s building. The dark, corrupt, evil, or shameful things within us, the things that God condemns, must be judged at the bronze altar.</p>
<p>The second significance of the altar is consecration. The altar was the place where persons offered themselves to God. Although we will never see a person lying on the altar, every offering on the altar represents men. When an offering was of the herd or of the flock, the offerer laid his hands on the head of the offering. This signified the offerer&rsquo;s identification with his offering (Lev. 1:4). The offering of cattle was the offering of oneself.</p>
<p>In order to participate in the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place, that is, to enter into the tabernacle, we need not only to be judged by God but also to offer up ourselves completely to Him. We cannot participate in the building if we are not absolutely consecrated to God. In this chapter we are focusing on judgment and consecration. We must first judge and condemn ourselves in God&rsquo;s light and then offer up all that we are on the altar. After experiencing God&rsquo;s condemnation, judgment, redemption, and forgiveness, we must put ourselves on the altar and consecrate ourselves to God.</p>
<p>I hope that the serving ones will focus on the two matters of being judged by God and of consecrating ourselves to Him. Everyone who hears a message on the building must go before God and present everything that he has, item by item, so that his sins can be condemned and forgiven in the light of God&rsquo;s presence. Then he must consecrate himself to the Lord anew.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LAVER</h2>
<p>After the altar the next piece of furniture on the way into the Holy Place was the laver. The laver, which was also of bronze, was made from the mirrors of the serving women (Exo. 38:8). The bronze laver held water for cleansing, and it also was reflective. The reflecting function of the laver manifested man&rsquo;s true state and his filthiness, but the washing function of the laver was to cleanse man.</p>
<p>Titus 3:5 speaks of &ldquo;the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This is typified by the laver. After a person is condemned by God and offers everything to God, the Holy Spirit will shine on the weaknesses and filth within him. The exposing of such matters brings in further judgment. The shining and exposing of the Holy Spirit imply judgment. There is, however, a slight distinction between the laver and the altar. The redemption of the altar solves our problem of sin before God, but the washing of the laver washes away our filth.</p>
<p>For example, a brother may not be at peace with his wife. This is sin before God. When this brother is judged, he receives forgiveness by the blood upon the altar and redemption at the altar. However, if he wants to participate in God&rsquo;s building, God&rsquo;s house, the Holy Spirit must expose his not being at peace with his wife as not only a matter of sin before God but also as a weakness within him. Hence, he must not only confess this sin before God by condemning and judging this weakness in God&rsquo;s light in order to be forgiven, but he must also let the Holy Spirit operate in him to wash this weakness by the divine life and deliver him from this filth. Through the washing of the Holy Spirit, not only is his sin removed before God; he is also delivered in his daily living from the weakness of not being at peace with his wife. In other words, by the operation of the power of the Holy Spirit he is enabled to be at peace with his wife. Such experiences qualify us to participate in God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s building begins in the outer court of the tabernacle. Hence, as those who desire to participate in His building, we first need to place ourselves under the divine light for judgment. Second, after being judged, forgiven, and redeemed by God, we need to place ourselves on the altar and offer everything that we are and have, item by item, to God. Third, after offering ourselves in this way, the Holy Spirit will operate to expose our weaknesses and the filth within us so that our filth may be washed away in the laver of the Holy Spirit. At this point we are forgiven and redeemed by the blood upon the altar. All that we have has been put into God&rsquo;s hand, and we are learning to live under the shining and the operation of the Holy Spirit in order to be delivered from earthly defilement and our human weaknesses. This is how we are qualified to be built and participate in God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<p>We must give heed to this fellowship and begin step by step to experience these basic items. We must give heed to being condemned in God&rsquo;s light, being forgiven by God, placing ourselves completely on His altar, and receiving the shining of the Holy Spirit. We must have these experiences. Otherwise, instead of ascending step by step, we will be leaping futilely for the top. We must start anew from the beginning and accept God&rsquo;s judgment. At the bronze sockets everything is condemned and judged by God. At the silver hooks and silver connecting rods we are redeemed and forgiven. As a result, we will have a righteous, bright, and clean living. Then we must offer everything that God has redeemed and forgiven on the altar and also let the Holy Spirit shine and do a work of washing in us. We must experience these steps in order to take part in the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TYPE OF THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
AS SEEN IN THE TABERNACLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 25:23-24, 31; 30:1-3; 36:20-34</h1>
<p>The tabernacle portrayed in the Old Testament is a clear picture of the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Hence, if we want to know the progressive steps for building God&rsquo;s dwelling place, we must know the matters concerning the tabernacle.</p>
<p>The central significance of the tabernacle is God mingling with man so that in Him man may be built together into a corporate entity. The main structure of the tabernacle was boards of wood overlaid with gold (Exo. 26:15-30; 36:20-34). Gold signifies divinity, the divine nature, and wood signifies humanity, the human nature. Therefore, wood overlaid with gold signifies the mingling of divinity with humanity into one entity. This entity is a building, God&rsquo;s dwelling place (15:13; 25:8), which was the tabernacle and the temple in the Old Testament (40:34; 1 Kings 6:2; 8:1-13), which is the church in the New Testament (Matt. 16:18; 1 Tim. 3:15), and which ultimately will be the New Jerusalem (Rev. 3:12; 21:2). This corporate entity depends on the mingling of divinity with humanity. In other words, this dwelling place is composed of God mingled with man, and it is the mutual dwelling place of God and man. This is the central significance of the tabernacle.</p>
<p>In the tabernacle God did not dwell in the Holy Place, much less in the outer court. He dwelt in the Holy of Holies. Thus, when we speak of the tabernacle from God&rsquo;s perspective, we must begin in the Holy of Holies, pass through the Holy Place, and enter into the outer court. However, when we speak of the tabernacle from man&rsquo;s perspective, that is, according to our experience, we must begin in the outer court, pass through the Holy Place, and enter into the Holy of Holies. In this chapter and in the next we will go from man to God, that is, from the outer court to the Holy of Holies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONSTANTLY EXPERIENCING<br />
THE ALTAR AND THE LAVER</h2>
<p>There were two pieces of furniture in the outer court: the bronze altar and the bronze laver. The bronze used to cover the altar came from the bronze censers of the two hundred and fifty men who were judged and consumed by fire from God (Num. 16:37-39). Hence, the bronze altar reminded man of God&rsquo;s judgment. The bronze for the laver came from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting (Exo. 38:8). Hence, the bronze of the laver was able to reflect man&rsquo;s condition. Those who approached the bronze altar sensed God&rsquo;s judgment and were convicted of their corruption, evil, and sins. Furthermore, the blood of the sin offering was shed at the bronze altar, indicating that those whom God condemned were forgiven and redeemed. On the one hand, those who approached the bronze laver sensed that their true condition was exposed, but on the other hand, the water in the laver washed away their filth.</p>
<p>The bronze altar and the laver are always linked in our experience. When we come to the bronze altar, we confess our weaknesses, offenses, failures, defilements, and discord with God and are willing to be convicted and judged afresh in order to be cleansed. When we are cleansed and forgiven by God and redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, we will feel as though we are standing in front of a mirror that shows us our real condition. Prior to approaching the bronze altar and the laver, we could see only our strengths and believed that our attitude toward our parents, spouse, children, colleagues, and neighbors was good. But at the laver we see our real condition and discover that our attitude toward our parents, spouse, children, colleagues, and neighbors is not good. This is our experience of the shining and enlightening of the laver. At this point, we are not only forgiven of our offenses and washed of our stains; we are also delivered from the sin of disrespect in our actual living and from our improper attitude toward others. The laver puts our walk under the shining of the Holy Spirit so that our walk may be cleansed through the operation of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>This experience is not limited to our initial salvation. We experience this every time we are revived, that is, have a turn toward God. If we truly see that we are materials to be built with others into God&rsquo;s dwelling place, we will come to the bronze altar again and again to be judged and then cleansed by the precious blood of Christ and to enjoy the effectiveness of redemption on the cross. Not only so, through the shining of the bronze of God&rsquo;s judgment and the reflecting of the laver, we will be convicted and see that we are proud, not in one accord, lacking in forbearance, and unable to coordinate. The laver in the service meeting will show us that our speaking is from the self and that we cannot speak loosely any longer. This is the experience of being cleansed by the Holy Spirit in our words and deeds.</p>
<p>We experience the bronze altar and the laver every time we have a new spiritual beginning. When we have morning revival, we must first come to the bronze altar and the laver. Then we will be judged and convicted by the Lord, and we will sense that we are short in certain matters and toward certain persons. As a result, we will be willing to confess our wrongdoings and condemn our shortages in order to enjoy the effectiveness of redemption. After such an experience we will be more sensitive toward sin and sense that we cannot touch, utter, or think about certain things, nor can we have certain attitudes. We will be clear concerning many things before God. Through such experiences we are delivered from our weaknesses. This is what it means to experience the washing of the Holy Spirit, as typified by the laver.</p>
<p>We need to be under the intense shining of the Holy Spirit in order to see that our being built depends on our practical experience of the conviction and judgment of bronze at the altar and the exposing and shining of bronze at the laver. We need to experience the effectiveness of redemption at the bronze altar in order to have a thorough consecration and the cleansing of the laver in order to be delivered in our daily life from the things that cannot stand before the light, that is, the things that are obscure, unrighteous, or unclean. This is the preparatory work for the building.</p>
<p>We may be sloppy with our human affairs, but we cannot be sloppy about the building of the church. Anything that is sloppy, dark, corrupt, unrighteous, or unclean cannot be within the boundary of the hangings of the outer court. Even the matter of entering into the realm of the outer court requires that a person be judged and convicted under the shining of the Holy Spirit. Anything that does not agree with God&rsquo;s nature and is unacceptable to Him must be condemned. There is no room for sloppiness in the dwelling place of God, the church. This is a serious matter.</p>
<p>Solid churches have not been built up in some localities because the elders and responsible brothers have not been properly judged; they have not experienced the bronze altar or the laver. Sloppy men can never build up solid churches. We must have the hangings of fine white linen in our living. In order to work for the Lord, we cannot have a sloppy living or be unrighteous. If we are sloppy or unrighteous, the church where we serve will never be solid. Instead, it will collapse when the wind blows and will be damaged by the rain. In order to produce a solid church in a locality, the serving ones must first experience the judgment of the cross at the bronze altar.</p><h2 class="head1">GENUINE BUILDING BEGINNING IN THE HOLY PLACE</h2>
<p>Thus far, we have seen bronze and silver in the tabernacle, but we have not yet seen gold, which signifies God&rsquo;s substance, His divine nature. Hence, there has not yet been genuine building. There must be gold in God&rsquo;s building. The building materials must be made of wood overlaid with gold, which signifies man mingled with God. A brother may be genuinely saved and experience the cross, typified by the bronze altar, and the Holy Spirit, typified by the laver. This brother may have been judged and be forgiven by God and be experiencing the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work on the cross. He may also know his real condition from being under the shining of the Holy Spirit and also know the washing of the Holy Spirit. By the renewing of the Holy Spirit, this brother is delivered from filth and weaknesses. Hence, he is white, righteous, and blameless not only before God but also before men; he manifests the condition of fine white linen. Nevertheless, this brother may not be able to be built up. Building up requires gold, which signifies God&rsquo;s divine nature.</p>
<p>If our experience in the outer court makes us proud, that pride will become a veil that stops us from entering into the Holy Place. However, if we are neither complacent nor proud but continue pursuing, the Holy Spirit will open our eyes to see that what we experience in the outer court is a preparation for building; it is not the tabernacle, the dwelling place of God. What is most valuable and precious before God is not the righteousness of the outer court but the inner Christ. Hence, the Holy Spirit will lead us to experience the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar in the Holy Place, which typify the indwelling Christ as the bread of life, the light of life, and the acceptable incense before God. These experiences indicate that we have entered into the Holy Place.</p>
<p>On the north side of the Holy Place there was a table of acacia wood overlaid with gold, on which were twelve cakes called the bread of the Presence (Exo. 25:23-30; Lev. 24:5-6). This bread typifies Christ as our bread of life that supplies us daily (John 6:35). This bread is not only in us; it is set before God. This experience is much more precious than being forgiven, washed, and having a righteous and pure outward living.</p>
<p>When we see that Christ indwells us as our life, the Holy Spirit will further show us that this life is the light of men (1:4). Christ as the light of men is typified by the lampstand of pure gold in the Holy Place (Exo. 25:31). The outer court was open and had natural light. It had the light of the sun in the day and the light of the moon and the stars at night. There was no window in the Holy Place, and the entry to the Holy Place was covered by a screen. Hence, natural light from outside could not shine in the Holy Place. There was, therefore, the need of light from the golden lampstand. This light signifies the light of life generated by the indwelling Christ as our life (John 8:12). At the lampstand we not only know the indwelling Christ as our daily bread of life that enables us to live before God; we also know that the life within us is the light that shines within us and makes us bright. At this point we will discover that being a Christian is not just a matter of a good outward living but also of knowing Christ as life inwardly. We must not live according to our natural sight by determining matters according to right and wrong or good and evil. Rather, we must let Christ as our light of life shine and enlighten us with the truth. Thus, we will turn from outward matters to inward matters. There was also an incense altar of acacia wood overlaid with gold in the Holy Place (Exo. 30:1-3; 37:25-26). The incense altar signifies our offering up Christ as incense so that we may be acceptable before God. At this point we are acceptable to God because everything about us is in resurrection, in Christ.</p>
<p>The experiences of the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar are in the Holy Place of the tabernacle and indicate that the tabernacle has been built. The tabernacle was built of boards of acacia wood overlaid with gold and joined by rings of gold (36:34). This indicates that God is mingled with man and that His dwelling place is built when the believers are joined as one in the divine life and nature of God.</p>
<p>The boards were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold, and their sockets were of silver (vv. 24, 26, 30). The foundation of the acacia wood overlaid with gold was silver. This signifies that the foundation of the mingling of God and man is redemption. The sockets of the hangings in the outer court were of bronze (38:10-11), but the sockets of the boards of the tabernacle were of silver. In the outer court silver clasps were upon the bronze pillars, indicating that the judgment of Christ on the cross is the foundation of redemption. In the tabernacle, however, the boards of acacia wood overlaid with gold sat upon silver sockets, which indicates that redemption is the foundation for us to know Christ as life and for us to be mingled with God. In other words, redemption is the foundation for experiencing gold overlaying wood.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that concerning the outer court, Exodus 38 mentions first the bronze altar, then the laver, and then the hangings of the court and the bronze sockets (vv. 1-20). The spiritual significance of this order is that our experience of the hangings of the court and the bronze sockets is produced by our experiences of the bronze altar and the laver. In chapters 25 and 26, concerning the Holy Place, the table of the bread of the Presence and the golden lampstand are spoken of before the boards of the tabernacle (25:23-39; 26:15-29). This implies that our experience of the boards is produced by our experiences of the table of the bread of the Presence and of the golden lampstand. In other words, by experiencing Christ as our life supply and as the light of life, we are accepted by God and are mingled with Him, thus becoming building materials that are joined together through the gold rings and built up.</p>
<p>A person can be saved and experience the work of redemption and the washing of the Holy Spirit without being built. The experiences of the bronze altar and the laver are but a preparation for building; they are not the building itself. Building is a matter of God mingling with man. Without the mingling of divinity with humanity, there is no building. The outer court is only the boundary of God&rsquo;s dwelling place. In order to be in God&rsquo;s dwelling place, a person had to enter into the Holy Place. In the Holy Place we experience the Word who became flesh and has entered into us as the Spirit to be our satisfaction of life and our light of life so that we may be accepted by God. Only when we know and experience Christ in the Holy Place can we be mingled with God, that is, divinity mingled with humanity. This is the way that we become boards that can be built up together.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF THE BOARDS</h2>
<p>Each board was built with two tenons that were inserted into two sockets of silver (36:22, 24). A board needed two tenons in order to stand firm, just as a person needs two feet to stand firm. The two tenons signify testimony, that is, of not being alone. This means that we cannot do anything by ourselves. We cannot even stand by ourselves; other saints must stand with us as our confirmation. A brother may have the feeling to work in a certain place. But if no one confirms his desire, he has only one tenon, and his stand is not firm. When the Lord Jesus sent out His disciples, He sent them two by two (Mark 6:7; Luke 10:1). This is the principle of testimony in mutuality. Hence, each board having two tenons indicates that no one can be alone.</p>
<p>As boards of wood being overlaid with gold, we must learn to always have two tenons. For example, although we express our opinions, we still need to ask the saints to express their views. After the brothers speak in the coordination meeting of the church, the sisters also need to speak, and then the brothers should speak again. If only the brothers speak or only the sisters voice their opinions, there will be problems, and the church will be weak. A brother who always insists on his view cannot be built. Although such a brother may know Christ as life and as light and may be accepted by God, he will be a lone individual who cannot be built with others because he is just one tenon.</p>
<p>The boards were united by bars that passed through the rings of gold (Exo. 26:26-29). This refers to the oneness of the Spirit, the uniting of the Holy Spirit. In Genesis 24 the first item of gold that Abraham&rsquo;s servant gave Rebekah was a golden ring (vv. 22, 47). The golden ring typifies the Holy Spirit that God gave us as a pledge, a guarantee, upon our salvation (Eph. 1:14). This golden ring and the rings of gold on the boards refer to the same thing. As boards, we rely on the pledging Spirit to be joined with other believers. This is the significance of the bars passing through the rings of gold on the boards. We need rings of gold in order to be joined with the brothers and sisters around us. If we all have rings of gold, we will be built up together, and the church will be one. Then God&rsquo;s dwelling place will be manifested.</p>
<p>May all God&rsquo;s children see these points. First, we need to know that Christ is in us to be our life. Second, we need to be mingled with God, to experience gold overlaying acacia wood, so that we may become boards for the building. Third, we cannot stand alone, having only one tenon; we must learn to have two tenons, that is, to have the confirmation of others. Fourth, we must learn to depend on the Holy Spirit whom God has given us as a pledge, as a guarantee, to be joined with the saints around us and built with them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BUILT ACCORDING TO<br />
THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>The picture of the tabernacle in the Old Testament is much clearer than the plain text of the New Testament. The serving ones must learn to experience everything in the tabernacle and live in this reality. If we have rich and thorough experiences of the tabernacle, we will be able to lead people according to what we have experienced. We will know their spiritual condition, and we will know how to do a building up work in them.</p>
<p>We cannot simply preach an objective gospel without touching people&rsquo;s actual condition if we want to lead them to salvation. We must be able to touch people&rsquo;s problems and help them step by step according to their situation. For example, if we meet a person who does not believe in God, we first need to deal with the existence of God. If we meet a person who believes that God exists but has not yet believed that Jesus is God the Savior, we need to deal with this and help him. If a person does not consider himself to be a sinner, we need to help him and give him a sense of his sin so that he is subdued to confess before God that he is a sinner. Those who do not know the cross need to see the work of redemption accomplished on the cross. Those who do not have living faith are not assured of their salvation, and they need help to hold firmly to God&rsquo;s Word. Preaching the gospel is not merely a matter of giving a message on the gospel but of touching people&rsquo;s condition and using specific steps to lead them to salvation.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to our building up of the church, that is, to bringing the saints into the practical building up. It is vain to merely talk about building up. We first must have the experiences portrayed in the tabernacle. Then when we contact the saints, we will touch their condition and render them practical help. For example, if there are brothers who have not adequately experienced the bronze altar, that is, do not have much experience of dealing with sin, we need to lead them to be judged and convicted in the light of the cross. A sister who has experienced the altar and the laver and knows what it means to be righteous and blameless before both God and men can still be self-righteous and complacent. This indicates that she does not know the inner life. Therefore, we need to lead her to know Christ as life and to have two tenons so that she may be joined with others through the gold rings. Only when we know where people are in their experience of the tabernacle can we render appropriate help for their building up.</p>
<p>We cannot give gospel messages without knowing how to lead people to salvation. In such a situation people can hear the gospel for years but never be saved. In the same principle, we cannot talk about building up without practically building up the believers. If we lack the practical building up, the saints will not know what building up is even after hearing many messages. I hope that the serving ones will learn the experiences typified by the tabernacle and also bring others into these experiences. If we would do this, we will know the situation of a saint as soon as we touch him, and we will be able to lead him to be built up.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TYPE OF THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
AS SEEN IN THE TABERNACLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 26:31-35; Heb. 9:2-5; 10:19-20; Matt. 27:50-51</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to consider the way to build up the church according to the type of the tabernacle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING AND THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</h2>
<p>The tabernacle was divided into three parts: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. Each part of the tabernacle has its crucial points. In the outer court there were bronze pieces of furniture, such as the bronze altar, the bronze laver, and the pillars and sockets of bronze upon which were the linen hangings. These were the basic pieces of furniture in the outer court. In the outer court there were also the silver rods, the silver hooks, and the fine white linen hangings. Thus, everything in the outer court was either of bronze, silver, or fine white linen (Exo. 38:1-20).</p>
<p>After the outer court there was the Holy Place. All the boards in the Holy Place had two heavy sockets of silver (36:20-30). This means that the experiences of the Holy Place begin with redemption and have redemption as the base. But most of the pieces of furniture in the Holy Place were not of silver. The striking feature of the Holy Place was gold. Although the sockets of the standing boards were of silver, the boards were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold and had gold rings. The boards were joined by bars of acacia wood overlaid with gold that passed through the gold rings. Hence, in the Holy Place everything looked golden (v. 34). Moreover, the three pieces of furniture in the Holy Place&mdash;the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar&mdash;were of gold (37:10-28). There was gold everywhere one looked in the Holy Place. Gold overlaying acacia wood was the main constituent and feature in the Holy Place.</p>
<p>According to typology, gold signifies God&rsquo;s divine nature, which is God Himself, and wood signifies the human nature, humanity. Hence, acacia wood overlaid with gold signifies God mingled with man, or the divine element mingled with the human element. This dual-natured entity of gold and wood does not exist until we enter the Holy Place.</p>
<p>The most prominent symbols and types of the mingling of God and man are the standing boards, the table of the bread of the Presence, and the incense altar in the Holy Place of the tabernacle. These pieces of furniture were gold without, but they were wood within; they were wood, but they looked like gold. Each of these pieces of furniture had two natures, gold and wood. God&rsquo;s children need to see that only by experiencing the mingling of God with man is building up possible.</p>
<p>The significance of wood overlaid with gold is the same as the significance of the oil poured upon the stone in Genesis 28:18. Oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit and, hence, God as well, and the stone symbolizes man. After Jacob poured oil upon the stone, he called the name of that place Bethel (v. 19). Then he made a vow, saying, &ldquo;If God will be with me...this stone, which I have set up as a pillar, will be God&rsquo;s house&rdquo; (vv. 20, 22). Jacob vowed that the stone upon which the oil was poured would become God&rsquo;s house, His temple, His dwelling place. This corresponds to the significance of wood overlaid with gold, which is for man to be built up into God&rsquo;s tabernacle, His dwelling place.</p>
<p>If we are to be built up together in the church, we must experience oil being poured upon the stone and experience wood being overlaid with gold, that is, the mingling of God with man. If we are merely convicted and judged under God&rsquo;s light, confess our sins and are forgiven by God, receive the work of redemption and the washing, and deal with our conduct to become blameless before God and man, then we have experienced only a preparatory work; we have not yet entered into genuine building up. We must touch the mingling of God with man and become a board of wood overlaid with gold, in order to have the genuine building up. This means that being joined and built up with others depend on the divine nature of God.</p>
<p>The standing boards in the tabernacle were joined by means of the gold. If the boards were made of only wood without gold rings, they could not have been joined by the bars. The boards could be joined together because of the gold. The boards were overlaid with gold, the bars were overlaid with gold, and the boards had rings of gold as holders for the bars to pass through and thus join the boards together (Exo. 36:31-34). This shows that although the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place requires that we be built up together, we are joined together through God. We cannot be joined in our humanity. We can only be joined to become one building in divinity and with divinity as our linking factor.</p>
<p>The oneness of the church, the linking of the church, is altogether not in man but in God. No matter how blameless we are by being judged and convicted under the light, being cleansed, forgiven, and redeemed, being pleasing to God and justified by Him, and even dealing with our conduct, without divinity we will still be separate. We will not be joined, for we cannot be joined in our humanity. It is not until we move on to experience the mingling of divinity with humanity that the God we are mingled with can join us together.</p>
<p>For example, although the lamps in a room are separate, they are joined into one by means of the electric current within them. In the same principle, no matter how blameless we may be, we are still separate individuals. We can be built together only because we are in God. This is wood overlaid with gold. We cannot neglect this. Our individual effort is useless in the building. Building happens spontaneously when we live in God and are mingled with Him.</p><h2 class="head1">BUILDING AND CHRIST AS LIFE</h2>
<p>In order to be mingled with God, to become wood overlaid with gold, we must enter into the Holy Place and take Christ as our bread of life, light of life, and acceptance of life, that is, to experience the Christ typified by the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar in the Holy Place (Heb. 9:2). We can live in God&rsquo;s presence by Christ as the bread of life, we can walk in the light of God&rsquo;s presence because Christ is in us as the light of life, and we are accepted into God&rsquo;s presence because Christ is in us as the incense of resurrection. The indwelling Christ as our life enables us to live before God, walk in His light, and be accepted in His presence.</p>
<p>The highest expression in the outer court was the fine linen hangings. In the Holy Place, however, to be a Christian is not only to have outward conduct that matches the fine linen hangings but also to enjoy the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar. The experience in the outer court condemns our hate of others and approves our love for them, but the experience in the Holy Place asks what the source of our love is. Does our love come from our natural life or from Christ as life? According to the experiences in the outer court, being proud and despising others are wrong but being humble and highly esteeming others are proper. However, the experiences in the Holy Place ask what life is the source of our humility. Is our humility lived out of our adamic life or out of Christ as life? Although the brothers should highly esteem one another and not despise others, we must ask whether the esteem that we give to one another comes from our natural life or from Christ as our life. If our humility, our highly esteeming others, our goodness, and our perfection come from our natural life, they are, at best, hangings in the outer court; they are not wood overlaid with gold and therefore cannot be built up.</p>
<p>Believers who experience only the hangings in the outer court are likely to become proud. A Christian who only takes care of becoming proper will despise and condemn others. To say that we are humble but that others are bad and proud only proves that we are proud. Proud people can never be joined to others.</p>
<p>If such a believer would touch Christ as life and leave the outer layer of behavior to enter into the layer of life, he would become humble. He would know that his love and humility are imperfect and that no matter how good his love and humility may be, they are not acceptable to God and cannot be brought into the Holy Place. In the Holy Place only Christ as life is acceptable to God. Good conduct may be acceptable in the outer court, but it is condemned in the Holy Place. Only by taking Christ as life can we be acceptable to God in the Holy Place.</p>
<p>We will also discover that as Christians, good conduct cannot satisfy us. The more proper our conduct becomes, the emptier we will feel. The food and satisfaction that we need are the inner life, not outward conduct. Even if our conduct is perfect, we will still be in the natural light. Our good conduct will become a veil to us. The more humble and loving we are, the blinder our inner eyes will be. Good conduct can only block light, but experiencing Christ as life will cause us to see light.</p>
<p>We need to be able to distinguish between a Christian in the outer court and a Christian in the Holy Place. A Christian in the outer court condemns his deeds and is forgiven by God and cleansed. A Christian in the Holy Place knows Christ inwardly as his life, his satisfaction, his light, and his acceptable fragrance before God. We should ask ourselves whether we are Christians in the outer court or Christians in the Holy Place.</p>
<p>Sometimes we are like the priests in the Old Testament, because we enter into the Holy Place, but soon after, we go out to the altar and the laver again. We enter and leave the Holy Place often. Last night we were in the outer court, this morning we were in the Holy Place, but in the evening we go back out to the outer court. It is difficult to find a person who lives in the Holy Place.</p>
<p>We cannot be built up if we only pay attention to improving our conduct. We must touch Christ as life in order to experience the mingling of the divine nature with our human nature. Gold is not as hard as acacia wood. The boards are able to stand because of acacia wood, not by means of the gold. Acacia wood is a very hard wood, and it signifies the resurrected humanity. The believers who are in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection are firm and strong in their humanity. For example, the Lord raised up strong and firm persons, such as Luther, Darby, and M&#252;ller, to testify for Him. However, to stand firm is different from being joined with others. We are not joined with other believers in our humanity, which is typified by acacia wood. We are joined with other believers in the divine nature, typified by gold.</p>
<p>When we enter into the Holy Place and experience Christ as life, we will be mingled with God, and we will spontaneously be softened to understand the weak and to accommodate the defeated so that we can be joined and built up with them.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h2>
<p>To say that the tabernacle is the dwelling place of God is a general statement. God did not dwell in the Holy Place; He dwelt in the Holy of Holies. Hence, although we may experience some building in the Holy Place, strictly speaking, we still cannot become His dwelling place. In order for us to become God&rsquo;s dwelling place, we must have the experience of the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>The saints who confess their sins, are forgiven, cleansed, and manifest fine white linen in their conduct are still in the outer court. They are not yet in the tabernacle. They have good conduct but no building. Gradually, these saints will grow and come to know that Christians should not only have good outward conduct but should also know Christ as their inner life and enter into the experience of the mingling of God with man so that they can be blended as one in the divine nature. At this point, God&rsquo;s building will be seen among them, but His presence among them will not yet be complete, for they will not yet have the Ark. To experience Christ as our bread of life, our light of life, and our acceptance into God&rsquo;s presence is to enjoy things from God; it is not our entering into God.</p>
<p>The bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar in the Holy Place correspond to the three items inside the Ark, which was in the Holy of Holies. The hidden manna in the golden pot, the two tablets of the covenant, and Aaron&rsquo;s budding rod were in the Ark (Heb. 9:2-4). The bread of the Presence in the Holy Place corresponds to the hidden manna in the Ark. Christ is the bread of the Presence, our bread of life, and He is hidden in God as the hidden manna. The light of life causes man to know what is right and wrong and is typified by the golden lampstand. The light hidden in God is the inner law of life, which is typified by the two tablets of law inside the Ark. In the same principle, the experience of the acceptable fragrance at the incense altar in the Holy Place corresponds to the budding rod, the resurrection power, in the Holy of Holies, because the budding rod was proof of Aaron&rsquo;s being accepted by God (Num. 17:1-10).</p>
<p>The three pieces of furniture in the Holy Place were manifest. The bread of the Presence was on the table, the light shone from the golden lampstand, and the sweet savor went up from the golden incense altar. This means that the experiences of Christ as the bread of life, the light of life, and the acceptable fragrance are manifest. The experiences in the Holy of Holies, which are deeper, involve the hidden manna, the hidden law, and the hidden resurrection power, as typified by the three items in the Ark. Our experiences of Christ in the Holy of Holies are not manifest but are hidden in God.</p>
<p>Let us use an example to illustrate the difference between the experiences of the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. A brother who lives in the outer court will sense when he is not right and will condemn himself, deal thoroughly with his sins, and adjust his behavior. When he is led by God into deeper experiences of knowing Christ as life, he will realize that to be a Christian is not a matter of outward conduct but of experiencing Christ as his satisfaction, light, and acceptable fragrance before God. He will be filled with joy from such experiences. As a result, he will call hymns, pray, and testify in the meeting, as if he is setting forth the bread of the Presence, shining forth the light of the golden lampstand, and emanating the sweet fragrance of the golden incense altar. His functioning will cause the saints to be satisfied, to be enlightened, and to receive the sweet-smelling savor. However, this is only an experience of the Holy Place.</p>
<p>After a period of time, he will not sense God&rsquo;s presence as before, and his prayers and his eating and drinking of the Lord will lose their taste. He will feel dry instead of watered and will not receive much light from the Word. As a result, in the meeting he will not be able to set forth the bread of the Presence, to shine forth the light of the lampstand, or to emanate the sweet-smelling fragrance. This is the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to lead this brother into the experiences of the Holy of Holies. The three pieces of furniture in the Holy Place are seen, but in the Holy of Holies the three items in the Ark are hidden.</p>
<p>Christ as the bread of life is the bread of the Presence set forth in the Holy Place; He is also the hidden manna in the Holy of Holies. Christ as the light of life is the light of the golden lampstand shining in the Holy Place; He is also the hidden law in the Holy of Holies. Christ as the acceptable fragrance to God is emanating a sweet savor in the Holy Place; He is also the hidden budding rod in the Holy of Holies. Thus, a brother who has deeper experiences in God&rsquo;s presence may not be that excited in the meetings, but those who contact him can immediately sense that he has a supply of hidden manna, that he understands God&rsquo;s heart and ways, and that he has the authority of resurrection and the power of resurrection. These are very practical in him. He may not speak often, but once he opens his mouth, others will sense that he has the hidden manna, the hidden law, and the hidden power and authority of resurrection within him. Such a brother is in the Holy of Holies with God&rsquo;s presence, the Ark, and the throne of grace. This is the practical difference in our experience between the Holy of Holies and the Holy Place.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BREAKING OF THE NATURAL MAN<br />
AND ENTERING INTO THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h2>
<p>We will now consider how to proceed from the Holy Place into the Holy of Holies. The Holy Place and the Holy of Holies were separated by a veil. Outside the veil was the Holy Place, and inside the veil was the Holy of Holies. In order to meet God in the Old Testament times, the high priest had to pass through the veil into the Holy of Holies, because God was in the Holy of Holies behind the veil. In the New Testament, however, Hebrews 10:19 and 20 say, &ldquo;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh.&rdquo; This shows that the veil into the Holy of Holies has been split and that the Lord has initiated a new and living away for us. Therefore, there is no separating veil between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies in the New Testament age. According to these verses, the veil is the Lord&rsquo;s flesh. Christ is the Word becoming flesh; that is, He is God becoming a man. His becoming flesh was His becoming a man. Hence, the veil refers to the natural man. Our natural man is a veil between us and God.</p>
<p>When we are in the Holy Place, we are no longer separated from God by sin, darkness, and the world. However, between us and God there is still a separation, a veil, which is our natural man, our self. This veil needs to be split; that is, our natural man needs to be broken. No matter what our condition is&mdash;whether we have shortcomings or strengths, whether we fall or stand, and whether or not we have God&rsquo;s presence&mdash;our natural man needs to be broken. The veil was hung in front of the Ark of God, where there were no problems, stains, or faults, in order to separate man from God, who was in the Holy of Holies. We may be experiencing the Holy Place, but God is in the Holy of Holies. We are outside the veil, but God is within the veil. This separating veil is neither sin nor the world; it is our intact natural man. Without being subdued or broken, our natural man separates us from God.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He was a man in the flesh; that is, He had humanity. Therefore, when the Lord died on the cross, in God&rsquo;s eyes He was a man who had been split. In the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting we break the bread. The bread cannot break itself; rather, it is broken because we break it. When the Lord Jesus expired on the cross, the veil of the temple was split in two from top to bottom, not from bottom to top (Matt. 27:50-51; Mark 15:37-38). This means that the Lord&rsquo;s body was broken not by man but by God. Hence, the old creation, not just fallen man, was split from top to bottom by God.</p>
<p>Although this was accomplished on the cross, whether we experience this is another matter. Many believers have not experienced the breaking of their natural man. As a result, they have not entered into the Holy of Holies but linger outside the veil.</p>
<p>A considerable number among us may have entered into the Holy Place experientially. We experience oil being poured upon the stone and experience wood being overlaid with gold; we have become standing boards. We also have the rings of gold through which bars of acacia wood overlaid with gold can pass and bind us together. In a sense, such a condition is prevalent among us. However, we must admit that God&rsquo;s presence is not practical among us. On the one hand, when we see what the Lord has done in the church and how we have been graced, we bow our heads and worship God in the meetings. On the other hand, we have a strong sense that although we have the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar, we do not have the Ark. Our meetings are full of life, joy, and light, but God&rsquo;s presence is not strong. This is because few saints have been broken by God, and not many have experienced the splitting of the veil. We have not entered into the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>Many saints have the wrong concept that a person who loses his temper and is fleshly has not been broken but that a person who is meek has been broken. Both the quick-tempered believers and the fleshly believers need to be broken. However, the meek believers also need to be broken. Even if a person were blameless before God, he would still need to be broken.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s death is typified by two things in the tabernacle. The shedding of the blood of the sacrifices on the altar in the outer court and the splitting of the veil between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies both typify the death of Christ. The intrinsic significance of Christ&rsquo;s death is very rich. The lamb that was killed on the altar in the outer court speaks of Christ bearing our sins, being judged by God, and shedding His blood to accomplish redemption. The splitting of the veil between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies speaks of God crucifying the old creation, including created man, on the cross. Even though the Lord Jesus was blameless and could stand before God and man, He still needed to be split by God. This indicates that created man needs to die.</p>
<p>The burden of this chapter is to reveal the steps of building up. The saints must experience these crucial points. The experiences of the outer court deal with our conduct. The experiences of the Holy Place are a matter of taking Christ as our life. The experiences of the Holy of Holies focus on our entering into God. In order to enter into the Holy of Holies, we not only need to be delivered from sin and the world; we also need to be split, broken. When we pass through the altar and the laver in the outer court, we deal with sin and the defilement of the world. Then we can enter into the Holy Place to experience Christ as life and to be mingled with God. At this point sin and the world no longer separate us from God who is in the Holy of Holies. However, our natural man must be broken in order for us to enter into the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>After we enter into the Holy of Holies, we can touch the things within God. This is not a matter of experiencing God coming forth in Christ as our bread of life, light of life, and acceptance of life. In the Holy of Holies we enter into God and experience the hidden manna, the inner law of life, and the acceptance in resurrection. When we enter into God, we can touch the matters within Him. Only then are we truly wood in gold, that is, man in God.</p>
<p>This is the experience in Book Four of the Psalms. The first psalm of Book Four, Psalm 90, is titled, &ldquo;A Prayer of Moses, the man of God.&rdquo; This indicates that by Book Four the psalmist had entered into God; hence, he is called &ldquo;the man of God.&rdquo; Intrinsically speaking, a man of God is a person mingled with God. In Job 1:1, Job is a perfect man. In Psalm 1:1-2 the psalmist is a law-keeping, righteous man. But in Psalm 90 the psalmist is not merely a perfect or righteous man; he is a man of God, that is, a man in God and mingled with God. Therefore, the first sentence of Psalm 90 is, &ldquo;O Lord, You have been our dwelling place / In all generations.&rdquo; When we dwell in God, when wood is concealed in gold, we can experience God as our dwelling place. This is where we have God&rsquo;s presence, the throne of grace typified by the expiation cover, and the cherubim of glory.</p>
<p>God has revealed this light to us from His Word not for us to understand doctrines. I believe that according to this light, He will do an intense work among us in order to bring us from the outer court into the Holy Place and then from the Holy Place into the Holy of Holies. He wants us to learn to deal with sins and the world, to take Christ as life, to live before Him, to experience being mingled with Him, and to let the cross break our natural man. This breaking enables us to enter into God and touch Him. This is the way for God to practically become our dwelling place and for us to be joined by Him as one to become His dwelling place, His habitation. This is the mingling of God with man as a mutual dwelling place.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS LIFE<br />
FOR THE BUILDING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:11-13</h1>
<p>The Bible reveals that God wants to gain a building in the universe. God in the Son wants to mingle and build Himself into man. For this building, Christ must become everything to man, and the created and redeemed man must cooperate with God (Rev. 21&mdash;22). Christ is the content of the building, and the created and redeemed man in Christ is the expression of the building. Both the element of God and the element of man are in this building.</p>
<p>Through the type of the tabernacle we can see that God&rsquo;s dwelling place is altogether a matter of wood being overlaid with gold, of man being mingled with God. The overlaying of wood with gold, of man being mingled with God, is a matter of Christ as our life. In the Holy Place&mdash;apart from the foundation of silver sockets that refers to redemption&mdash;the table of the bread of the Presence (Exo. 25:23-28), the golden incense altar (30:1-5), and the standing boards (26:15, 29) were all made of wood overlaid with gold. This signifies Christ being in man to be man&rsquo;s life. Furthermore, everything in the Holy of Holies refers to Christ being in man as life in a deeper, more hidden way. Although Christ as life is present in the Holy Place, our experience of this life is not deep or hidden. Once we enter into the Holy of Holies, however, we not only have Christ as life but Christ Himself. All the items in the Holy of Holies typify Christ Himself.</p>
<p>Although we may have heard such a message before, I am concerned that we lack experience in these matters. Hence, this chapter will consider, from the practical, experiential side, how to have the genuine building in the church through Christ as life to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING GENUINE BUILDING<br />
ONLY BY EXPERIENCING GOD AS LIFE</h2>
<p>God has become life to us in His Son through the Holy Spirit. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily (Col. 2:9), and in the Spirit, Christ can be touched, experienced, and enjoyed to become our element and to be mingled with us (1 Cor. 6:17). Although we are clear about the truth that God is in the Son and that the Son is in the Spirit, we need to focus on our practical experience. In the church there can be no building if we have only the truth; we need the truth to become our experience, to become reality to us. Merely understanding this truth does not mean that a person is built up. A person may understand these truths very well and yet not be built up. In order to be genuinely built up, we must enter into the reality of these truths.</p>
<p>We should examine ourselves concerning this matter. We may know that Christ is our life, but how much do we live in this reality in our daily living and in our church life? This is a very serious matter. When problems arise between a husband and a wife, they often are exhorted to endure, to learn lessons, and to accept the breaking. Although this is correct, we must ask the brother and sister about the life that they are living in response to these exhortations. It is right for a wife to submit to her husband and for a husband to love his wife, but if their submission and love do not come out of the life of the Son of God, they will not be built up with each other in God. The purpose of every spiritual lesson and situation of breaking is to help us live by God&rsquo;s life. If we think that we have learned some spiritual lessons and have accepted God&rsquo;s breaking but still live by our life, it is questionable whether we have truly learned any lessons or accepted any breaking.</p>
<p>If a sister lives by God&rsquo;s life, her submission will come out of Christ being in her as life. Likewise, if a brother lives by God&rsquo;s life, his endurance and acceptance of God&rsquo;s breaking will come out of Christ being in him as life. However, if a wife submits to her husband by her own life, her submission will only make her more individualistic. Similarly, if a husband endures, thoughtfully considers, and loves his wife by his own life, he will become more individualistic. Our human life expresses our self, and our self is individualistic. The more we live by our life, the more individualistic we become. Furthermore, the individuality of the self is manifested in good things as well as corrupt things. Whether good or bad, as long as the self is present, the individualism of the self will be manifested.</p>
<p>The choice between living by our life and living by Christ as our life affects not only our daily living but also our coordination with the brothers and sisters in the church. Any coordination that comes out of our life will not last. In order for our coordination to be lasting, it must come out of God&rsquo;s life. Only God&rsquo;s life is eternal, and only coordination in God&rsquo;s life is lasting and eternal.</p>
<p>Some brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; coordination in the church seems to be very good in the beginning; that is, they bear responsibility and are willing to be restricted. Nevertheless, it is easy for such coordination to stop when a problem arises. Such a situation shows that there are considerable elements of our own life, rather than God&rsquo;s life, in our coordination. If we have learned the lessons of living by the life of God, we will be able to be coordinated and built up with others.</p>
<p>Often we have a problem in coordinating with others because they do not match our preferences or way of coordination. The problem, however, is not with them, but with the fact that we are living by our life. If we learn to live by Christ as our life, our coordination will not be affected by any weaknesses or faults in the brothers and sisters; it will not even be affected by our own natural preferences or ways. Although we may see some faults, shortcomings, and weaknesses in the brothers and sisters, the life of Christ within us will demand and enable us to continue to coordinate with them.</p>
<p>Coordination with others according to our own life never lasts, because it is impossible for the natural man to get along with others. The relationship between a couple who have been recently married is very fresh, but after a short time it can become old. A brother once complained to me about his wife, saying, &ldquo;Before we were married, she was neat, quiet, and submissive, but soon after we were married, her true colors were revealed, and now our marriage is intolerable.&rdquo; A sister likewise complained to me about her husband, saying, &ldquo;Before we were married, he seemed to be proper in everything, but now this is not the case at all.&rdquo; Similarly, when we first entered into the church life, we felt fresh and were able to coordinate well with others. Slowly, however, our natural man came forth, and many problems arose. Our fresh feeling became stale because our living and coordination were based on our own life.</p>
<p>If we coordinate with the brothers and sisters by the life of God, we will not count their strengths or weaknesses or be concerned that they do not match our preferences or ways. We will be able to coordinate with them even when we discover a weakness. If we coordinate with others by the eternal life in us, we will not grit our teeth when we encounter those who do not match our preferences and grudgingly say, &ldquo;God has led me to coordinate with you. This is God&rsquo;s arrangement, God&rsquo;s will. I will obey and accept. The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it?&rdquo; (cf. Matt. 26:42). Even if we can say this, I would still ask whether we are drinking the cup by our own life or by the life of God. If we are drinking the cup by our own life, we will quickly toss it aside. The only thing that matters is whether we are following God&rsquo;s leading and obeying His will by His life.</p>
<p>Hence, we must be persons who live by Christ as our life. We must learn rigorous lessons in all things related to abandoning our natural life and living by another life. We must know this and experience this to such an extent that even our obeying of God&rsquo;s leading and our accepting of His will come out of Christ as our life. Then we will be able to coordinate with any brother or sister, and our coordination will be lasting because it comes out of the eternal life of God.</p>
<p>This is a rigorous lesson that we need to learn. If we want to have enduring and genuine coordination through the mingling of God and man, we must enter into the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies to experience Christ as life. In the Holy Place there is the bread of the Presence, which is Christ as our life supply; the golden lampstand, which is Christ as our light; and the golden incense altar, which is Christ as our acceptable fragrance (Exo. 26:33-35; 25:30; 30:6). In the Holy of Holies the hidden manna in the Ark is Christ as our hidden inner supply; the two tablets of the law are Christ as our inner law of life, our light of life; and Aaron&rsquo;s budding rod is Christ as our authority of resurrection and the power of resurrection in us so that we may be acceptable in God&rsquo;s presence (Heb. 9:4). All these are matters of life in the Son. If we learn these lessons, it will be impossible for us not to coordinate with others. We will be able to coordinate with any of God&rsquo;s children, and our coordination will last.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE SON OF GOD<br />
TO ARRIVE AT THE MEASURE OF THE STATURE<br />
OF THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-13 says, &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for...the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&rdquo; Verse 13 speaks of knowing the Son of God, and it refers to experiencing Christ as life practically. Such experiences result in our arriving at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. This verse does not speak of arriving at the measure of the stature of the Son of God through the knowledge of Christ but of arriving at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ through the knowledge of the Son of God. According to the Gospel and the Epistles of John, <em>the Son of God</em> speaks of God being our life in His Son.</p>
<p>The title <em>Christ</em> refers mainly to God&rsquo;s anointing, and it emphasizes God&rsquo;s sending of His Son to accomplish His work. The term <em>Son of God</em> speaks of life. To have the knowledge of the Son of God means to live by Christ as our life and to be full of life. To arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ means to become useful persons in God&rsquo;s hand, to become persons anointed and sent by God to accomplish His will. Living by the Son of God as life is to know the Son of God. Manifesting our function outwardly is related to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Stature comes from life, and stature manifests function. The more we know the Son of God and live by Christ as our life, the more we will have the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and the function that comes from Christ.</p>
<p>As a child grows in stature, he is able to accomplish certain things, and the fuller his stature is, the more he will be able to accomplish. Function is absolutely related to stature. We cannot expect a child to do much, because he is lacking in stature. In contrast, the function of a brother as an elder in his care for the saints will manifest a much greater stature. The more he grows in life, the more he will manifest the stature of Christ, that is, the stature of the Anointed, the stature of the sent One. His stature and the measure of his function will come from knowing the Son of God, from growing in Christ as life.</p>
<p>Some brothers seem to be able to coordinate, but they do not manifest much function. This means that they may not be functioning according to the life of the Son, because their coordination does not cause them to grow or manifest the stature of Christ. If we live by the life of the Son, our coordination will have a stature and manifest the measure of our function.</p>
<p>Thus, we must see that if we are to be built by God, we not only need to go through the outer court, in order to be judged by God and to be clothed in fine linen to experience God as our righteousness (cf. Exo. 27:1 and footnotes 1 and 2; v. 9 and footnote 2, Recovery Version). We also must enter into the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies to experience wood being overlaid with gold, that is, man being mingled with God. We should not regard this matter merely as a doctrine that we should know or teach; we must experience this matter. In our living we must not only deal with our mistakes and transgressions but also learn to live not by our life but by Christ as our life. The more we learn this lesson, the more we can coordinate with God&rsquo;s children and enable Christ&rsquo;s stature in us and our stature in Christ to grow. The extent of our stature is the extent of our function. Function comes from stature, and stature comes from the growth in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN NEEDING TO BE REDEEMED<br />
IN ORDER TO BE MINGLED WITH GOD</h2>
<p>The building of God is the mingling of God with man; hence, there is a need for God to redeem man in order to be man&rsquo;s life. God created man so that man would be a vessel to contain Him, but before God could attain His heart&rsquo;s desire, man fell. When man fell, he had a record of sins before God. Furthermore, humanity was utterly corrupted. Man&rsquo;s body, soul, and even spirit were corrupted and damaged. Satan poisoned the soul of man&mdash;the mind, emotion, and will&mdash;and damaged the function of man&rsquo;s intuition and fellowship in his spirit. Such a fallen and corrupted man could not be mingled with God. Therefore, as Genesis 3 records, once man fell, Jehovah placed the cherubim and a flaming sword, which turned in every direction, to guard the way to the tree of life so that no man with sin could contact God&rsquo;s eternal life (v. 24).</p>
<p>However, God prepared redemption for man. God&rsquo;s redemption not only wipes out man&rsquo;s record of sins before God, solving the problem of his sinful deeds; it opens the way for the fallen man to be recovered back to God&rsquo;s intention for man to be a vessel to contain Him. God wants to save our spirit, soul, and body. God&rsquo;s recovery, His full salvation, is through regeneration and renewing. This is different from the human cultivation and improvement that is spoken of by the Chinese sages. God has regenerated us in our spirit and is renewing us in our soul. God is spreading outward from our spirit to renew our soul. He can be mingled only with a renewed man. If we do not let God renew our mind but instead hold on to stale concepts, God cannot be mingled with us in our mind. If we do not let God renew our emotions but instead hold on to our old emotions, He cannot be mingled with us in our emotions. If a considerable part of our being remains in a fallen condition, God cannot be mingled fully with us, because He can be mingled only with a man who has been redeemed and who is being renewed.</p>
<p>In the Holy Place the wood that is overlaid with gold is not rotten or withered wood but proper acacia wood. God wants to be mingled with man, but not with man in an old and rotten condition, like rotten or withered wood, but with man in a proper and renewed condition, like acacia wood.</p>
<p>Thus, if we want to take part in God&rsquo;s building, God&rsquo;s dwelling place, God&rsquo;s tabernacle, we first must be redeemed so that our record of sins can be judged before God. Although we are created men, we have also been redeemed, having passed through the altar and the laver. We have been shined upon, reproved, condemned, judged, and washed by God. Such a dealing enables us to be in His presence. Now we can go forward into the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies to experience Christ as life and to experience being overlaid with gold, being mingled with God. As those who are being mingled with God, we are like acacia wood being overlaid with gold. If parts of our being are still in a fallen condition, God cannot be fully mingled with us. God has redeemed every part of our being, but there is still a further need for renewing in order to be fully mingled with Him.</p>
<p>From God&rsquo;s perspective, He is life in His Son in order to grow in us unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so that we may become functioning members. From our perspective, we can experience God being mingled with us because of His multifaceted redemption and salvation. We need to become fine linen and acacia wood that is being overlaid with gold by experiencing Christ as our life to grow unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Thus, we will not only be built into the Body of Christ but also become functioning and ministering members.</p>
<p>We need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to see the deep thought in the picture of the tabernacle. Our person must be one of acacia wood being overlaid with gold, and our condition must be one of fine linen. The function of our mind, emotion, and will in our soul and the function of our intuition, conscience, and fellowship in our spirit must be pure. We need to be renewed by God so that we are not just speaking about building or talking about coordination. We need God&rsquo;s mercy to see our condition according to the light that He has unveiled in this picture of the tabernacle so that we may experience the reality of building and coordination. I hope that we will go step by step in our experience from the outer court into the Holy of Holies so that God would build us step by step.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING OF LOVE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:17-19; 4:16; Col. 3:10-15</h1>
<p>Ephesians 3:17-19 says, &ldquo;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; This passage speaks of five key points.</p>
<p>The first point is Christ making His home in our hearts through faith. There are many portions in the New Testament that speak of the Lord being in us or of the Holy Spirit being in us, but it is difficult to find a portion that speaks of the Lord being in our hearts or of the Holy Spirit being in our hearts. Ephesians 3:17 says that the Lord makes His home in our hearts. This verse does not say that the Lord is in us in a general way. Rather, it says that the Lord is in us in a specific way; He is making His home in our hearts.</p>
<p>The second point is that we are being rooted and grounded in love. The Chinese Union Version translates this portion as &ldquo;your love is rooted and grounded.&rdquo; However, the Greek text does not refer to our love but to the Lord&rsquo;s love. It is because Christ makes His home in our hearts that we can be rooted and grounded in His love.</p>
<p>The third point is to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth, length, height, and depth are. Who knows how broad is the breadth, how long is the length, how high is the height, or how deep is the depth? Nevertheless, because Christ makes His home in our hearts and because we are rooted and grounded in His love, we are able to apprehend what the breadth, length, height, and depth are.</p>
<p>The fourth point is to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ. When we apprehend what the breadth, length, height, and depth are, we will realize that there is something immeasurable in the universe, which is the love of Christ.</p>
<p>The fifth point, the issue of points one through four, is that we will be filled unto all the fullness of God.</p>
<p>We have seen that the building of God is God building Himself with man. God the Son, Jesus Christ, enters into us to be our life so that by this life we can be fully mingled with Him as one. In the Holy Place the bread of the Presence is the bread of life, the golden lampstand is the light of life, and the golden incense altar is the fragrance of the resurrection life. Within the Ark in the Holy of Holies are the hidden manna as the hidden life supply, the two tablets of law that signify the law of life, and the budding rod that signifies the acceptance of the resurrection life. These typify Christ as our life. In the Holy Place and in the Holy of Holies wood overlaid with gold typifies man mingled with God, humanity mingled with divinity as one. The deeper we experience the building of God, the more we will experience Christ in everything and be mingled with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESS OF BUILDING<br />
BEING A MATTER OF LOVE</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the practice of building up the church from Ephesians. No other book in the Bible covers the building up of the church as thoroughly as the short book of Ephesians. This book presents the church as the Body of Christ, which is coordinated together through building, and as the dwelling place of God, which is established through building (1:22-23; 2:22). In addition, chapters 2 through 4 are concerning the believers being built up together. Therefore, if we want to know how to build up the church, we need to pay close attention to this book.</p>
<p>There are five key points in Paul&rsquo;s prayer in Ephesians 3:17-19. The first key point is concerning Christ making His home in our hearts, and the last key point is concerning our being filled unto all the fullness of God. Hence, this portion of the Scriptures begins with Christ making His home in our hearts and ends with our being filled unto all the fullness of God. The purpose of Christ making His home in our hearts is for us to be filled unto all the fullness of God, that is, to allow God&rsquo;s riches to be constituted into our being so that we may be filled with the element of God to become His expression. This is the building of God and man and the mingling of God and man.</p>
<p>Points two through four are concerning the process of being built and mingled with God. In this process we need to be rooted and grounded in love, to apprehend the immeasurable breadth, length, height, and depth, that is, the universal dimensions of Christ, and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ. Hence, the process from Christ making His home in our hearts until we are filled unto all the fullness of God is a matter of love. The first point is concerning Christ, and the last point is concerning our becoming the fullness of God. The remaining three points are concerning our being rooted and grounded in love, apprehending the breadth, length, height, and depth of Christ, and knowing the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, all of which are a matter of love.</p>
<p>Although God&rsquo;s building is His mingling of all that He is with us so that His riches become our element, the process of building is a matter of love. God is building His dwelling place in love. The dwelling place of God, the Body of Christ, is built up in love.</p><h2 class="head1">LOVE BEING GOD ENJOYED AND TOUCHED BY MAN</h2>
<p>All the words in the Bible are intended for man&rsquo;s understanding. But our problem is that we might not have the proper understanding of what God says in the Bible. For example, our understanding of faith might not be the same as what God says in the Bible concerning faith. Likewise, our understanding of love might not be the same as what God says in the Bible concerning love. Christians often talk about faith, but many misunderstand what the Bible says concerning faith. Likewise, love is a favorite subject among Christians, but many misunderstand what the Bible says concerning love. For example, Ephesians 3:17 says that we need to be rooted and grounded in love, and 4:16 says that the church will build itself up in love. Many people understand these verses to mean that we need to love one another in the church so that we may be built up together. Such an understanding seems appropriate, but it is a natural understanding.</p>
<p>If asked what chapters 3 and 4 say concerning love, some people might answer, &ldquo;God is love.&rdquo; Although this is true, these chapters go a step further to show that love is God in the Son to be enjoyed by us. Grace is God being gained by us. Grace does not refer to general blessings, such as peace or benefits that God gives to man. Rather, grace is God Himself being gained by man. If we gain God as the Spirit, the divine life, and the divine nature, then we have received grace. After we receive grace and are brought back to God, we will realize that He is love. Both grace and love are God. God is grace, and He is also love. When God comes forth to reach man and to be gained by man, He is grace. When man returns to God in order to enjoy God, man touches love. Grace is God manifested; love is God touched. The Gospel of John speaks of God becoming flesh in order to reach man and be gained by man and therefore emphasizes grace (1:14, 16-17). First John speaks of man receiving grace and by this grace having fellowship with God, touching God, and entering into God; therefore, 1 John emphasizes love (4:8, 16). The source of grace is love, and when love proceeds out of God, it is grace. Hence, we need to see that love is deeper than grace. If as children of God we know only grace, we are still shallow. We must go deeper by entering into God and enjoying Him as love.</p>
<p>Thus, the word <em>love</em> in <em>rooted and grounded in love</em> and in <em>building up of itself in love</em> does not refer to our own love but to God in the Son being contacted, enjoyed, experienced, and touched by us. We are not only forgiven of our sins to gain life, receive salvation, and become persons of God; we must also enter into God, fellowship with Him, and touch Him. Then we will sense that Christ is making His home in our hearts. After regeneration Christ lives in our spirit, but Ephesians 3 says that Christ is making His home in our hearts (v. 17). Since the heart includes the soul as well as the conscience of the spirit, the heart is an organ that links the spirit with the soul. Therefore, although Christ lives in our spirit, He can touch our emotions, a part of our soul, so that we feel love and sweetness. We can experience Christ in such a way that we sense Him as our sweet and lovely Lord; He is our enjoyment and our love. There is an indescribable sweetness in our emotion that we sense as we enter into God and have fellowship with Him.</p>
<p>The more we live in God, touch Him, and fellowship with Him in the sweet feeling of our emotion, the more we will be rooted and grounded in love; in other words, we will be saturated with love. This can be likened to putting a handkerchief in water. The handkerchief will be soaked with water. When we fellowship with God and are saturated with Him in such a way that He can touch our emotions and cause us to enjoy His sweetness, we are touching the love of God. Therefore, being rooted and grounded in love means that we are fully immersed in the divine love. At this point, it will be impossible for us to hate, condemn, or murmur against others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LOVE OF GOD BEING UNLIMITED</h2>
<p>When we are immersed in God&rsquo;s love in such a way, we will sense that this love is indescribable; it is like the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe. When the apostle came to this point in his Epistle, he could not find a suitable word to describe such a love, so he had to use these four words. The love of God is boundless, unlimited, and immeasurable. How broad is the breadth? How long is the length? How high is the height? How deep is the depth? No one can answer these questions. The apostle used these four immeasurable terms&mdash;<em>breadth, length, height,</em> and <em>depth</em>&mdash;to describe the love of God.</p>
<p>When we enter into God and touch His love, we will discover that His love is unlimited. The Bible tells us to love our enemies (Matt. 5:44; Luke 6:35). Loving our enemies requires the unlimited love of God. If we have received the unlimited love of God, it will not be difficult for us to love our enemies. Our own love is inadequate to love our parents, spouse, and children, not to mention our enemies. Our human love is limited, but the love of God is unlimited. If we enter into God to enjoy Him and touch the love of God, we will love our enemies. When we are saturated with the love of God, we will only be able to love others.</p><h2 class="head1">HUMAN LOVE BEING LIMITED</h2>
<p>We should not misunderstand the love of God as merely being a matter of loving one another as referred to by Christians. I have been a Christian since my youth and have heard numerous messages concerning loving one another. However, it seems as though the more people talk about loving one another, the less they love one another. This is because we can have genuine love for one another only when we touch the love of God. Ephesians 4 speaks of the church&rsquo;s &ldquo;building up of itself in love&rdquo; (v. 16). This does not mean that we need to love one another. Our love is limited. When we try to love others by our love, we eventually love only those who suit our taste. If a brother suits our taste this year, we will love him, but if he does not suit our taste next year, we will stop loving him. When a new district is formed in the church, the saints love one another very much. However, in less than half a year problems will arise and the love will diminish because the saints try to love one another by their own love without the love of God.</p>
<p>It is not until we touch God, live in Him, allow Christ to make His home in our hearts, daily enjoy Him, and touch the love of God in the feeling of our emotions that our love will reflect God&rsquo;s love, not our human love. Then we will be able to love the brothers and sisters without discrimination. We will love the spiritual saints and the saints who are not spiritual. We will love those who offend us, because we have compassion and sympathy for their weaknesses. Even when we rebuke someone, we will do so because we love him and want to help him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING AND THE LOVE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>If we only talk about building and the steps of building, the church will not be built. We must have the love of God before we can be built together. In the tabernacle there were several bars made of wood overlaid with gold that connected and joined the boards together (Exo. 26:26-28). These bars signify the love in the Holy Spirit. It is in this love that we are joined as one and built up together. The building up of the church depends on the saints having this love. The extent to which the church can be built up depends on how much divine love we have. The human love, which is according to the natural taste, is limited. It is narrow, short, low, and shallow instead of being the breadth, length, height, and depth. According to Ephesians 3:18, the love that we need to touch is called the breadth, length, height, and depth. This love is the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe. Such a love is immeasurable. With such a love, we can love every brother and every sister. There is no one whom we would condemn, dislike, or not forgive.</p>
<p>The amount of love that we have depends on how much we have gained God. If we are short of love and unable to love others, it means that we are short of God. When we have fellowship with God, touch the feeling of love, and live in the sweetness of love, we will live in the love of God. As a result, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God. Genuine building up takes place in love. It is useless to merely encourage the saints to love one another. Rather, when we touch the divine love, we enter into God, enjoy Him, live in the feeling of such an enjoyment, and have the sentiment of the divine love. Then we will be filled with the element of God and spontaneously love others. When we are rooted and grounded in love, we will realize that the breadth, length, height and depth of the universe are the love of God. Such an unlimited and immeasurable love is Christ and God.</p>
<p>Genuine building is in Christ and is full of the divine element. Furthermore, Christ is love. The building is Christ, God, and love. In the church as the one new man there is nothing other than Christ (Col. 3:10-11).</p>
<p>It is useless to exhort the saints to love one another. If we would enter into God and touch His love in our emotions, we will not only put on Christ but also put on the inward parts of compassion (v. 12). When we put on love, we are in love (v. 14). Such a love is God enjoyed by us and Christ experienced by us. The divine love is unlimited because it is God, Christ, and the breadth, length, height, and depth. When we touch this love, we cannot help but love the saints. We will love them regardless of whether they suit our taste, whether they stand or fall, and whether they are strong or weak. When we all touch this love, we will be built up in love, and there will be a spiritual building among us. This building is nothing less than God being mingled with man and love filling man. It is also man immersed in God as love. This is the building that God desires.</p></body></html>
