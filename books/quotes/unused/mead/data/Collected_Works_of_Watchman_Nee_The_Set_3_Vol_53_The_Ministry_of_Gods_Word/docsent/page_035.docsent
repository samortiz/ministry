   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In looking back at church history, we find that God has been taking the way of recovery from the time of Martin Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God raised up Luther and his contemporaries to usher in the work of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since 1828 many truths have been gradually recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is one thought in the mind of many lovers of the Lord: How far will the Lord go in the way of recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But we need to ask what recovery is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Recovery does not mean that we preach what the apostles preached and speak every truth that is in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is not recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It does not mean that we have the revelation of the New Testament once we preach the truth of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nor does it mean that we have the apostles' word once we preach the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many people can preach baptism today without knowing what baptism is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They can preach the laying on of hands without knowing what the laying on of hands is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some can preach the church without seeing the church at all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Others can preach submission without knowing anything about God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not think that the content will be the same as long as the subject is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not think that the message will be the same as long as the doctrine and terminology are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many people preach in the realm of outward letters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such ones do not have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you want to be a minister of the New Testament, you must have the revelation of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only as we receive the same anointing that the apostles received do we have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only by receiving the same revelation do we receive the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not receive the divine speaking that they received simply by repeating the words they spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can reiterate the words they used without receiving the divine words they received.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's word is totally different.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose a church is deceived like the Galatians were deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Can we take the book of Galatians as it is, copy it, and send it to this church?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Epistle to the Galatians was written by Paul, but the Galatians received God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Galatians received Paul's letter, they touched God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today we can copy the words of the Epistle to the Galatians and send it to the problem church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The recipients may only touch the transcribed words without touching God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These words are in two different realms.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not uncommon for a man to touch the Bible without touching life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He only touches the Scripture, not life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He only touches the words that God once used, not God's present speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A man can touch the inspired Bible without touching the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brothers and sisters, why is it that so many people read the Bible today yet so few receive anything from it?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why is it that so many people preach the Bible yet so little of God's word is sensed?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The only explanation is that men only touch the outward shell of God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They have touched what God once said, but they have not touched what God is saying again today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has not spoken to them through the word which He once used.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must realize that the responsibility of the ministers of the word is to allow God to speak through the Scripture once again.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's ministers of the word are those through whom God can speak His word once again.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God is willing to speak through them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It should be His speaking that is released, not just the Bible that is released.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Who are the ministers of God's word?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are those who open the Bible and convey to their audience the words of God's present speaking, not just the words from the book itself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is what it means to be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the hearers have a problem in themselves, or if they choose to shut up their spirits, hearts, or minds, that is their own concern.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But as long as a man will open his spirit, heart, and mind, he will hear God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If others hear nothing of God's speaking while we are interpreting the Bible and expounding its teachings, we are a complete failure in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A minister of the word is one through whom God speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Others should have the feeling that God has spoken to them, and they should fall on their faces.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The reason the church is so poor is that the ministers are poor.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We complain that so few people have received revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why do we not give them the revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is our business to give them the revelation, yet we blame the church for being poor.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Why do we not make it rich?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is our business to make the church rich.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The function of the ministers of the word is to release God's word, not just the Bible, out of their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The words of the Bible become the word of God in their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They become life and light, not mere outward letters.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do not be deceived to think that as long as a man preaches from the Bible and interprets prophecies from the Bible, he is a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Such a person merely teaches others the outward shell of the Bible; he is not a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some people complain that the church is short of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We agree that the church needs revelation, but we must ask who will give the church revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We cannot put all the blame on the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If God's ministers are in poverty, the whole church is in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If the church does not have prophets, if it is short in vision, God's people will be void of light.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today God is dispensing light to the church through the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>How great is the responsibility of the church!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should never think that we can call ourselves successors to the apostles just as long as we preach the same Scripture that they preached.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must remember that we can consider ourselves the apostles' successors only to the extent that we have received the same revelation they received and have experienced the same anointing they experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is not a matter of having the same doctrine but a matter of having the same anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the basic test of all things.</S>
