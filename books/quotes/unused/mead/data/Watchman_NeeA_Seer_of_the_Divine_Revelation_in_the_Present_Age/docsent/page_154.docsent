   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FIRST PERSONAL CONTACT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Du and I then went to our former denomination and proposed that they invite Watchman Nee to come speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although we had left that denomination, we left them with a very good impression of us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They accepted our proposal and invited Watchman to come speak.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Du Chung-chin was returning to Shanghai, I asked him to extend my invitation to Watchman to come visit our town, which he did.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the same time the Southern Baptist Seminary in Hwang-Hsien, a city close to Chefoo, also invited Watchman to speak there.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So in the summer of 1932, he came to speak at these two places.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I, with others, went to meet the steamship on which he was arriving, and when the two of us saw each other, immediately we knew one another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We had corresponded with each other for some time, and there was a mutual recognition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He put himself into my hands and spoke with me of the things that were on his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He spoke to a large crowd for approximately one week in the auditorium of the Chinese Independent Church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I received much help from his messages, and following that conference I also accompanied him to the Southern Baptist Seminary in Hwang-Hsien.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In those years the Pentecostal movement was very strong in north China, and the seminary where Watchman spoke had come under the influence of this movement.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In those meetings I saw for the first time the strange practices of the Pentecostals.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some were jumping, some were laughing, and some were shouting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There were many strange sights.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the presiding pastor, with some effort, calmed down the meeting, Watchman gave his message.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He gave an inspiring word on the gospel of God's love from Luke 15.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Following the first meeting, Watchman and I walked home together.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the way I said, "What kind of way is this to have meetings shouting, jumping, and rolling?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He replied that in the New Testament there are no ordinances telling us how we should meet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His word shocked me and made me wonder whether he was agreeable with those strange practices of the Pentecostal movement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, I discovered that he did not agree with that kind of practice, but neither would he insist on any outward form.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I was staying in the seminary dormitory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One afternoon while a Pentecostal meeting was being held in which Brother Nee was not speaking, I stayed in my room to have some time with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I read Isaiah 44:22 and deeply sensed as I read, "Return unto Me, for I have redeemed you," that the Lord was calling me to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I deeply felt that the Lord gave me verse 21 as a promise: "You are My servant; you will not be forgotten by Me."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Also verse 23 seemed to be a clear word to me concerning the goal of His calling: "Jehovah has been glorified in Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord's presence was very real to me there, and I was thoroughly anointed, refreshed with His Spirit, and filled with joy and encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Following the meetings at the seminary, Watchman returned to Chefoo and stayed in my home for two or three days.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We had some excellent fellowship concerning the Lord's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>While staying in my home, he asked me to introduce him to Mr. Burnet, the founder of the Newton Brethren Assembly in my hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Mr. Burnet was an aged man and an excellent Bible teacher who had learned at the feet of the Brethren teacher Benjamin Newton.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the time the three of us came together, I realized that Mr. Burnet did not appreciate Watchman's testimony for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mr. Burnet stressed the accuracy of biblical knowledge, while Watchman emphasized the necessity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>My time with Watchman during those days deeply impressed me with the sweetness, loveliness, attractiveness, and newness of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those days provided a new start for me in following the Lord and caused me to have a basic turn from knowledge to life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because of those days with Watchman Nee, I began to have fellowship with the Lord in a more intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord became more precious to me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That experience was even greater than my experience of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those days with Watchman affected my pathway in the Lord throughout all the following fifty-nine years, since 1932.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For eternity I can never forget those days!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What a mercy and grace it was to me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The day before he left, Watchman charged me to do nothing after his departure; otherwise, others would think I was following him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I replied, "How could I do anything?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this town no one is standing with me."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But on the day of his departure, something happened.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the evening a brother who was a member of the board of the denomination I had left came to ask Watchman if he would help another believer in distress.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I told him that Watchman was gone, we agreed to have a time of fellowship together.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was summer, so we went down to the beach.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After a lengthy time of fellowship, about ten o'clock that night, this brother turned to me and said, "You must baptize me tonight in the sea."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After much hesitation, I did it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Through this event a meeting started in my home.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I wrote to Watchman explaining what had taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He came in April of the following year to confirm and strengthen us in the Lord's recovery and was a guest in my home for about ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He ministered to us in our meeting hall in the evenings and spoke to the denominational Christians in the Chinese Independent Church auditorium in the mornings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>His messages greatly edified all the attendants and helped the building up of the church there in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At this time I related how the Lord had called me to serve Him when I was with him in Hwang-Hsien the year before.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To this he made no comment.</S>
