   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCHES NEED BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THAT THE SAINTS WALK ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is needed in the Lord s recovery is a daily living of walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the New Testament there is a certain order in the church with apostles, elders, and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nevertheless, this arrangement and these titles would not be necessary if all the saints walked according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such arrangements are necessary because life is lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Jerusalem there will be no apostles, elders, or deacons but only precious stones Rev 21:19; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No position or title will enter with us into the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The twelve apostles will be in the New Jerusalem, but they will be there as stones for the building Rev 21:14, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to have a foretaste of the New Jerusalem today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because we are all members of the Body of Christ and have Christ as our Head, it is a shame if we need elders to regulate us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every city has police, but it is a shame if the citizens need the police to control them directly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not an honor to have police come to our home.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If all the citizens conducted themselves properly, the police would not be needed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a local church is a miniature of the New Jerusalem with all the saints walking according to the spirit, the elders would not have much to do.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps they would only need to announce the meeting times.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our need is not to be ruled outwardly but to be transformed to become precious stones for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The elders need to minister life to the saints for their transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was a lack of life that caused titles, positions, and arrangements to come into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, we know that these things are not God s intention, for the positions of apostles, elders, and deacons are gone in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even the writer of Revelation, the apostle John, did not identify himself as an apostle but only as a brother who was in spirit 1:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the seven Spirits are present, all the titles and positions are gone v. 4 . In Revelation we do not see apostles, elders, and deacons but the seven Spirits, enlightening the churches as the lampstands 3:1; 4:5; 1:20 . Every local church should be a shining lampstand enlightened by the seven Spirits, not ruled by elders.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As leading ones, we should not trust in our outward doing or controlling.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, we need to pray much, take the lead to walk according to the spirit, and minister life to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our primary concern should not be to make arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Several years ago I saw many files and paper forms in the deacons office of the church in Taipei, and all the serving ones were busy with routine work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I strongly advised the leading ones to forget about their arrangements and organizational, routine work and come back to spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we are short of the Spirit, we tend to pick up routine works and become like a secular corporation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The leading ones should not trust in their work and arrangements but in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christianity today is mainly a matter of religious work, routine, and organization.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the church is a living organism.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, our service should not be routine but organic.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Routine, organizational work in the churches is like the man-made bricks used to build the tower of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As elders, we need to take the lead to forsake any such human work and instead help the saints to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord s recovery is entirely a matter of spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The content and reality of the recovery is spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The boundary of the recovery is also spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whether someone is in the recovery does not depend on outward appearances but on the inward reality of spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The enlightening and searching of the seven Spirits is the true test and measure of whether anything is of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Any rank or hierarchy in the local churches is absolutely abominable in the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>An elder should not consider himself as an authority over others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only spirit and life are acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By the Lord s mercy we need to see what the Body of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we see the Body, we will see what the Lord s recovery is and what Christianity is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Religion is mainly a matter of hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The elders should not seek to have a position from which they can control the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to humble ourselves and pray, Lord, I am nothing, I have nothing, and I can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lord, everything must be done by You.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only You, as the Spirit, can minister life to people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am only a slave to serve the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The root of the church s degradation and the source of religious, organized Christianity is man s attempt to rule over and control things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we do not see this, such corruption and darkness may creep in and greatly damage the church in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We will reap what we sow.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I say this in love.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to be exposed in order to receive the help through the light.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Love always speaks the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>QUESTION AND ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Question: Can you say something further about forsaking arrangements and organizational work and helping the saints to walk according to the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Answer: Some arrangements are necessary, but nothing should be our personal possession.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because the church is not a secular business, we should not spend most of our time on business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As elders, most of our concern and labor should be to pray for the saints, visit them, shepherd them, and help them to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Concerning the necessary arrangements, there should always be at least two capable, trustworthy brothers to take care of matters such as the church s bank account.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Two gives us a testimony and is also practical for the continuation of the matter if one brother leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This kind of arrangement is necessary, but we should not put our trust in organization.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our trust is in the Spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to minister the Spirit and life to others so that they may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our tendency is to arrange things organizationally.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Accordingly, the elders sometimes arrange groups to take care of different practical services.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In making such arrangements, they consider which saints are best to serve in and lead the various groups.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should avoid this kind of organizational arrangement because it does not involve life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some arrangements are necessary, but our main concern should be to contact the saints, fellowship with them, minister life to them, and stir up their interest and burden to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This way involves life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When the saints come to serve, certain things will be spontaneously manifested, such as who should take the lead in the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>At that time, it will be necessary to make a few arrangements to appoint two or three to take the lead so that the service can go on in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The leading ones need to have much contact with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord may lead the elders to give a message in order to encourage the saints to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Such a message should minister a spirit of service and life for service.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In addition, the leading ones also need to visit the saints individually as much as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Our way should be to minister life, not to organize.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The way of life is to minister life to the saints by speaking and visiting.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When the saints receive life, they will be stirred up and have a heart to participate in the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Nevertheless, the elders should oversee the service in order to balance, adjust, and arrange when necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They may see that it would be better for someone to serve in a different group.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This oversight should still involve life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The elders should not give the saints the impression that their oversight is a matter of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Every service group should be open to anyone who feels to participate in that area of service.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Legality and regulation kill the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We need to remember that the boundary line is not organization but the spirit and the life.</S>
