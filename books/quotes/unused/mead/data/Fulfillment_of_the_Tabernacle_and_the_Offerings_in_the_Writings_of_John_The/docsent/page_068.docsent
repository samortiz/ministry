   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Everything Empty without Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapter five of John reveals that everything, even things that are good and holy, are empty apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Only Christ can meet man's need, for no one and nothing other than Christ can enliven us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The holy feast is empty without Christ, and the Sabbath is not a true rest apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, without Christ the holy city, Jerusalem, is nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What, then, about the pool of Bethesda?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have seen that the word Bethesda means the house of mercy and that Christ Himself is the real house of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Apart from Christ, there is no house of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Apart from Christ, the sick, blind, lame, and withered ones 5:3 would not be able to receive mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, without Christ even John the Baptist and Moses are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even the holy Scriptures, though inspired by God, are empty apart from Christ, for without Christ there is no eternal life in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is very important for us to see that without Christ everything is empty, vain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Gospel of John there are certain basic thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, we need a new birth in order to have a new life that we may become a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We also need Christ as the source of life and as the means for us to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, if we do not have Christ, everything is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that if we do not have Christ, we are empty.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is the reality, and we need to be filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Apart from Christ, everything is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only Christ is the divine reality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Truth, the Divine Reality</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John's Gospel and Epistles emphasize the matter of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Recently I have been studying this word in John's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more I study, the more I realize how profound this is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Truth is the divine reality, the reality that came with Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Jesus came, grace and truth came John 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The divine truth revealed in the Gospel of John is actually the Triune God embodied in Jesus Christ and expressed through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE POOL IN JERUSALEM AND THE SEA IN GALILEE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Much of what is recorded in chapters one through five of the Gospel of John took place in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Half of chapter two and all of chapter three describe matters that took place in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All of chapter five records events that happened in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have seen that chapter four is a record of something that occurred in Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The feeding of the multitude in chapter six of John took place in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Judea signifies the religious world, and Galilee signifies the secular world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Judea there was Jerusalem, the holy city, but in Galilee there was the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Between Galilee and Judea was the territory of Samaria, which was partly religious and partly secular.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is significant that in chapter five we have a pool, and in chapter six we have the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, the pool is in the holy city, and the sea is in the secular world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those gathered around the pool were sick, blind, lame, and withered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But those near the sea were not in such a condition.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the contrary, they were quite active and apparently they did not need mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They did not need the pool of Bethesda for their healing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As we shall see, the need of the people near the sea in John 6 was related to food, not to healing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In John 5 we see the sick, blind, lame, and withered lying near a pool in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a picture of the fact that those in a pitiful condition are drawn to religion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They come to the traditional "pool" of religion for healing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you are involved with religion, therefore, that is a strong indication that you are sick, lame, blind, or withered.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In other words, you are impotent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All those under the porches near the pool of Bethesda were in such a condition.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Would you like to be at the pool in Jerusalem with all the impotent ones, or would you rather be with the active ones around the sea in Galilee?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Of course, we would prefer not to be at the pool but at the sea.</S>
