   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE JOURNEYING 16 Scripture Reading: Num 21:4-9; 20:1, 22-29; 27:12-14; 20:14-21; 21:10-20; 33:1-49</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapters twenty and twenty-one of Numbers, there are some important matters which we need to see.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These matters are treasures, and we need to have the insight to see their preciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, Numbers 20 shows us the divine way to receive the divine supply, the way to receive the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the New Testament we do not have a chapter that reveals as clearly as Numbers 20 the way to receive the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Philippians is a book on receiving the bountiful supply of the Spirit, but not even in this book do we have the precious matter revealed in Numbers 20.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this message we will endeavor to see the treasures in Numbers 21.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. Speaking against God and Moses 1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because the Way Was Hard,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>the People Being Impatient</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>and Speaking against God and Moses,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Mainly concerning the Food Supply</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is enlightening to compare Numbers 20 and 21.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Both chapters speak of the people's contending.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Numbers 20 the children of Israel were contending for water.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This contending was fair because it came from the people's thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Numbers 21 the children contended again, but this time their contending was not fair, because it came from the people's impatience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God did not punish the people for their contending in chapter twenty, but He did punish them for their contending in chapter twenty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God had brought the children of Israel out of Egypt and had brought them into the wilderness, where the way was rough and very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"The soul of the people became impatient because of the way" 21:4b .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The way was harsh, and their patience was exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In their impatience they "spoke against God and against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For there is no bread and no water, and we loathe this contemptible bread" v. 5 . From God's point of view, this contending, unlike the contending for water, was not fair.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God had not promised that the way through the wilderness would be easy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They should have anticipated a difficult journey.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, God was not happy with them and He punished them.</S>
