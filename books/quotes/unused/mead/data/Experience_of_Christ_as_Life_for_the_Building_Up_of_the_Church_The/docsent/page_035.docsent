   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LOVE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONSTRAINING US TO LIVE TO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2 Corinthians 5 Paul spoke of the love of Christ constraining us to live to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 14 and 15 say, "For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to be constrained to such an extent that we lose ourselves, forget about ourselves, and live to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 21 says that Christ was made sin and that we are made the righteousness of God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This does not mean that we are righteous, but that we are righteousness itself through the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We were sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To turn sin into righteousness required much work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ was made sin for us to be judged and done away with by God that we might become God's righteousness in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE MEEKNESS AND GENTLENESS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Chapter ten speaks of Paul's experience of the meekness and gentleness of Christ v. 1 . This cannot be worked out by teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Someone may tell you to look at how gentle and meek Christ was on earth and that you need to learn of Him, but this does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need Christ wrought into us so that His meekness and gentleness can be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>TAKING CAPTIVE EVERY THOUGHT</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>UNTO THE OBEDIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 10:5 Paul said, "As we overthrow reasonings and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our thoughts have to be brought into captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They must be taken captive to obey Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Often, we are rebellious in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our mind is wild, natural, rebellious, and unrenewed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why we need to be transformed by the renewing of the mind Rom 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By being renewed, our mind will be subdued and brought into captivity unto the obedience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How much has our mind been renewed, subdued, and captured?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not a matter of doctrine but of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE VIRGINS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus far, we have seen that we are the captives of Christ, the letters of Christ, the mirrors of Christ, and the vessels of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Chapter eleven goes on to tell us that we are the virgins of Christ who have been betrothed to Christ v. 2 . To marry someone is not a matter of doctrine but a matter of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do we have the real experience of being a virgin to Christ?</S>
