<h1 class="title">TWO WAYS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Jer. 21:8</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Man&rsquo;s opportunity
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man&rsquo;s opportunity comes from God.</li>
	<li>God has set two ways before man: the way of life and the way of death.</li>
	<li>In the beginning, after God made man, He put man in front of life (the tree of life) and death (the tree of the knowledge of good and evil).</li>
	<li>God let man choose life or death. Both ways are opportunities given by God. The choice and the decision are up to man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Man&rsquo;s free will to choose
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God set two ways before man because God gave man a free will.</li>
	<li>The fact that man is given a free will is a proof that God honors man, and also that man is the highest creature.</li>
	<li>God let man choose either life or death according to man&rsquo;s free will.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The results of these two ways
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The way of life leads to eternal life, which includes God&rsquo;s life, the eternal peace and blessing, and the heavenly joy.</li>
	<li>The way of death leads to eternal death, which includes the elements of Satan, eternal suffering, and punishment in the lake of fire.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to choose the way of life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Acknowledge that you are already on the way of death&mdash;the way you have been treading is a way of death.</li>
	<li>Turn from the way of death.</li>
	<li>Repent and confess your sins.</li>
	<li>Believe that Christ is the life and the way. Only He can give man life, and only He can lead man to the way of life.</li>
	</ol></li>
