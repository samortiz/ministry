   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT CRUCIAL ASPECTS OF THE HOME MEETINGS CRUCIAL POINTS REQUIRING OUR ATTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE HOME MEETINGS NUTRITION AND HYGIENE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous chapter, we spoke about dividing the four hundred home meetings in the church in Taipei into a thousand smaller units.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, I am for this, but on the other hand, I am somewhat concerned about this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are not diligent, persistent, and proper in this practice, we will kill everything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Originally, there may be one small group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, with the division of this meeting into five smaller home meetings, everyone may become lost and the whole group may disband.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason I am burdened to share something further in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is a joy to have births.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But while there are births, there is also the danger of infant mortality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the past in China, when hygiene was not properly attended to, the infant mortality rate was high.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Around 1945, the average life span of the Chinese was approximately forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One of the reasons the life span was so low was that the high infant mortality rate lowered the statistic.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ancient Chinese said, Rare is the man who reaches seventy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today, however, medical science has advanced so much that the average life span has increased to more than seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The standard of living has also improved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These improvements can be attributed to the advancement in the food supply and hygiene.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My point is that we cannot congratulate ourselves merely with the fact that all the small groups have been subdivided into the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Of course, the number is encouraging, but we still need to pay attention to hygiene, medical supplies, and good nutrition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If these things are not in place, our infant mortality rate will still be high.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The subdivision will bring in death, not life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I hope that all the elders and co-workers will take note of this danger.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If there is malnutrition and lack of hygiene, the death rate will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What then should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must approach the problem from a few directions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, we need to enhance our hygiene, which includes immunization.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the other hand, we need to pay attention to nutritional care.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the co-workers, elders, and full-time serving ones have a responsibility to look into these two matters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to bear the burden of these one thousand home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason, I beg the co-workers and elders to spend much time praying together and seeking the Lord together.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Consider the weaknesses and the needs that exist in each home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After we subdivide the four hundred small groups into a thousand homes, there may be some sloppiness at the beginning, and we may easily become discouraged with the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At such times the co-workers, elders, and full-timers should bring in much encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They need to keep the brothers and sisters encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>My youngest daughter had a premature delivery when she had her first baby.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the baby was born, he was less than six pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The hospital put him in an incubator.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When my wife and I visited him, he looked like a pitiful little frog to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We looked at each other and wondered, Can he live?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Will he grow up?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, he is now nine years old.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is not only tall but also strong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is a member of the football team in school and is even one of its best players.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was able to grow up so well because his mother took good care of him; there was adequate attention given to hygiene and nutrition.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He ate well and properly, and the result was healthy and vigorous growth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>COMFORTING THE DISCOURAGED ONES AND ENCOURAGING THE WEAK ONES</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The most common negative mood that saints fall into is discouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is actually a characteristic of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Chinese are especially susceptible to discouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is strange that in other things the Chinese are aggressive and striving.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They can press forward in the midst of all kinds of adversity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The more they suffer, the more they stand up.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>During the few thousand years of their history, the Chinese were subdued by different races many times, but eventually they absorbed and neutralized their conquerors.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Chinese character is quite indomitable.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, in spiritual things they have a different characteristic.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once they encounter hardship and difficulty, they give up.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is because they think that whatever is of the Lord will be blessed by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They also think the Lord s blessing should come without any difficulty because the Lord is omnipotent.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This kind of mentality results in much discouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, they may think, Since we have turned to the Lord and are living for Him, He will bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Since it is of the Lord that we subdivide into the home meetings, He will bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the one hand, this is right, but on the other hand, we cannot be superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This may be compared to planting a crop; we need to do our part to sow.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is also like gardening; we need to plant and water.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we do not sow and water in the right way, we will kill everything.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I once planted a peach tree and a plum tree behind my house, and they both grew well.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I decided to trim them myself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>My way was to trim them in a neat and tidy way like giving a haircut.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Eventually, however, the trees did not bear any fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I was quite frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>One young American sister, who came periodically to help me, said to me, My father used to trim trees.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He told me that the young shoots should not be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is the young branches that bear the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You have cut off all the young branches and have left behind only the old branches.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To be sure, you will not have any fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I had cut off the young shoots because I considered them untidy, yet it is these untidy branches that bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Do not complain that the home meetings are going nowhere.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is possible for us to damage them through our trimming.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When this happens, it means that we are not doing things the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Later I learned the lesson concerning trimming fruit trees.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Last year my wife and I went to my daughter s house for a rest.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>For years she had sent me many sweet and juicy plums.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When I arrived at her house, I went to her backyard to take a look at her plum trees.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They were extremely ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>All of them looked scruffy and untidy.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>My daughter said to me, Do not despise these ugly branches.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Under their boughs are many fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I looked carefully and discovered that indeed all the branches were bent over with fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I began to say to myself, Man, do you want fruit, or do you want tidiness?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Dear co-workers and elders, after we divide the small group meetings into the homes, we may expect all the home meetings to be tidy and neat.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If they are not tidy and neat, we may want to trim them.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But we need to remind ourselves again and again that once we trim them, they are through.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We must allow these home meetings to have an opportunity to grow and develop by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If they grow in the wrong way, we should still let them go.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>They should be free to grow in whatever way they want.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>As long as the branches remain, they will bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Do not try to trim them in an artificial way.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Do not think that their way will never work.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Do not think that since many have been dormant for a long time, something should be done to trim them a little.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we do not trim them, they may still live.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Once we trim them, they may die and no longer bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Our work is not the work of trimming, but of encouragement, help, and stimulation.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We need to do these things until they all grow.</S>
