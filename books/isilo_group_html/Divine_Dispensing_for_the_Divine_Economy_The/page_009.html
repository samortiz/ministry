You may be a salesman for a large company during your normal work hours, but when you go out to preach the gospel for the three hours which have been dedicated to the Lord, you are no longer a salesman, but an apostle fulfilling your stewardship to dispense Christ into people. As you go out to knock on doors, there is no need to tremble before men. You have received a glorious commission to dispense, distribute, and minister the glorious Christ into people. If someone should ask what you are doing, you could reply, "I am distributing the glorious Christ!"</P><P>In the full-time training in Anaheim, I trained the trainees not to preach the gospel according to the natural way. I instructed them not to ask questions of those to whom they are preaching the gospel. Rather, I encouraged them to speak in a bold way. We may say, "I have come to dispense Christ into you. He is glorious. He has sent me here to tell you that you must believe in Him. If you believe in Him, you will receive eternal life. Let's pray." If the person responds by saying, "I do not know how to pray," we can say, "Please, pray after me: 'Lord Jesus, I love You. Lord Jesus, I receive You. You are my Savior and life. Hallelujah! Lord Jesus. Amen.'" After a person has prayed to receive the Lord, he should then be directed to be baptized. This also should not be in the way of asking whether or not the person would like to be baptized. Rather, the person should just be led to be baptized. To ask questions either at the time of prayer or at the time of baptism is unwise. To preach the gospel in the way of authority is to be a proper sent one, an apostle.</P><P>Paul received the stewardship through the grace given to him. We also have been given grace to take the God-ordained way. Before going out we should pray, "Lord Jesus, thank You that You have given us a commission to go out with Your authority to minister Yourself to sinners. Lord, go with us." When you go out in this way, you go full of power and authority. This authority may be likened to that of a policeman. The policeman who directs traffic seems to be just a small man with a uniform standing in the middle of the street. However, a car which is more powerful than the policeman must stop at his command. The car has power but the man has authority. The policeman has the authority because the government is behind him supporting him. We must obey him, or we risk receiving a fine. When we go out to preach the gospel, we also must realize that the entire divine government is behind us. We go out in the powerful name of the Lord Jesus. When we go to visit people in the homes and tell them that we have come in the name of Jesus, Satan trembles. Satan and the evil angels must retreat, because the name of Jesus is full of authority.</P><P>To preach the gospel according to the New Testament is to distribute Christ in His authority. You receive the authority by your prayer to the Lord before going out. In your going, God operates by distributing to you the sufficient grace as your capital to carry out the preaching of the gospel. In this way, you go out with the power, authority, and position as one of the apostles of Christ. You have the stewardship and the commission. In Matthew 28:18-19 the Lord said, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations." The Lord Jesus has received all authority and He has charged us to go. Our problem is that we often do not act on what the Lord has given us. The Lord as the Head of the Body has given all of the members of His Body authority to disciple the nations. We must assume this authority and go. We are apostles to those whom we baptize. Because Paul was the one who initially brought the gospel to the Corinthians, he could say, "If to others I am not an apostle, yet surely I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord" (1 Cor. 9:2). We also are apostles to those whom we lead to believe and be baptized.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Divine Dispensing for the Divine Economy &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
