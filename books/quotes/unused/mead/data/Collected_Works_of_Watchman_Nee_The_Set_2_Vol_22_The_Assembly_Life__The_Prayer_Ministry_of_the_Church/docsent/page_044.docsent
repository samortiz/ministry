   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE GREAT PRINCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have said that God has a will for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet God does not act independently; He will not do anything by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even though God has a will, He wants the free will on earth to echo His will before He does anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If there is only a will in heaven, God will not move.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The heavenly move is accomplished on earth only when the earth wants the same thing as heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today this is called the ministry of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brothers and sisters, the ministry of the church is not only the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This does not mean that we should not preach the gospel; it means that the ministry of the church is not merely the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The ministry of the church is to bring the will in heaven to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How does the church bring the will in heaven to earth?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is by prayer on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Prayer is not as small and insignificant as some may think.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not something that is dispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Prayer is a work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Prayer is the church saying to God, "God, we want Your will."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Prayer is the church knowing God's heart and opening its mouth to ask for what is in God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the church does not do this, it does not have much use on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many prayers for spiritual edification, prayers for fellowship, and prayers for supplication cannot replace prayers which are in the nature of work or ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If all your prayers are prayers for spiritual edification, fellowship, and supplication, they are too small.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A prayer which is in the nature of work or ministry is one in which you stand on God's side, wanting what God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brothers and sisters, if a prayer is uttered according to God's will, it is the most powerful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the church to pray means that it finds out God's will and speaks out this will.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Prayer is not just asking God for something.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For the church to pray means that it stands on God's side to declare that man wants what God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the church declares this, the declaration will be effectual.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now let us consider three great principles in ministerial prayer from Matthew 18:18-20.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Speaking Out God's Will</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 18 the Lord says, "Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Who is the "you" here?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is the church because verse 17 mentions the church, and verse 18 is a continuation of verse 17.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whatever the church binds on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever the church looses on earth will be loosed in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a very important principle: today God works through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God cannot do anything at will; He has to do everything through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without going through the church, God cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers and sisters, this is a very sober principle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God cannot do anything by Himself today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is a free will besides His will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If this will does not cooperate with Him, He cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The amount of power that the church has expresses the amount of power that God has because His power is expressed through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has placed Himself in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The height and extent that the church reaches is the height and extent that God's power reaches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the power of the church is small and restricted, God cannot express the height or extensiveness of His power.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The water department's reservoir may be great, but if you have only a small tap in your house, a great amount of water will not flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you want more water in your house, you have to install a larger pipe.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today the capacity of the church determines the degree to which God's power is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This can be seen from God's expression in Christ; the capacity of Christ is the degree of the manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today God is expressed in the church; the capacity of the church determines the degree of the expression of God and also the amount of knowledge one can have about God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God wants to do many things on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But He must have the church stand on His side before He can accomplish these things through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God cannot do what He wants to do by Himself; He has to do it with the cooperation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church is the means through which God expresses Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let me repeat: the church is like a water tap.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the tap is small, the amount of water flowing through the tap will not be great, even if there is as much water as the Yangtze River.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God truly wants to work in heaven, but He has to wait for the earth to move before He can work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There are many things that God wants to bind in heaven, and there are many things that God wants to loose in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God wants to see many people, objects, and things contrary to Him bound, and He wants to see many spiritual, valuable, beneficial, and holy things that are of Him loosed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The question is whether or not there are men on earth to bind what God wants to bind and loose what God wants to loose.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He wants the earth to control heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God wants the church to control heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This by no means says that God is not omnipotent.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God is indeed omnipotent, but He needs a channel on earth before He can manifest His omnipotence.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We cannot increase God's power, but we can hinder His power.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Man cannot increase God's power, but he can block His power.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We cannot ask God to do what He does not want to do, but we can limit what He wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We cannot ask God to do something that He is not willing to do, yet we can stop Him from doing something He wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Brothers and sisters, have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There is a power in the church which puts God's power under its control.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It can allow God to do what He wants to do, and it can stop God from doing what He wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our eyes have to be opened to see the future.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>One day God will expand the church to become the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God's glory will be manifested from the church without any hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Today He wants the church to first loose on earth before He looses in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He wants the church to first bind on earth before He binds in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Heaven will not take the initiative to work; it follows the earth's work.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God will not take the initiative to work; He follows the church's work.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Brothers and sisters, since this is the case, how great is the responsibility of the church!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have seen that Matthew 18:15-17 speaks of a particular case and that the great principle is given in the following verses.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When a brother sins against another, he may not confess his sins or mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When the church reproves him, he still may not listen.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If this happens, the church will consider him as the Gentile and the tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The sinning brother may say, "Who are you?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>How can you make me as the Gentile and the tax collector?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I will just stop coming to your meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If I cannot come to this place, there are many other places I can go to."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>However, what does the Lord Jesus say after this?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>"Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Hence, if the church decides to consider a man a Gentile, God in heaven will consider him a Gentile also.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If the church considers a man a tax collector, God in heaven will consider him a tax collector also.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In other words, God will do in heaven what the church does on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If the church considers a brother a Gentile and a tax collector, God in heaven will consider the same brother a Gentile and a tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Not only does this case follow the principle, a thousand other matters follow the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This case is only an example.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It shows us how much the church can do.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Then it shows us the greatness of the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The church is God's chosen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>God has placed His will in this vessel so that it will declare God's will on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When the earth wants something, heaven also wants it.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When the church wants something, God also wants it.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Hence, if God's demand is rejected in the church, God will not be able to accomplish what He wants to accomplish in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Many brothers and sisters are bearing a burden day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>They are bearing the burden because they have not prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Once the tap is turned on, water flows out.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Once it is turned off, the water is blocked.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Is the water pressure strong when water is released or when it is blocked?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We all know that when water is released, the pressure decreases.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>When water is blocked, the pressure increases.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When the church prays, it is like turning on the tap; the more the tap is turned, the less the pressure becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If the church does not pray, it is like a tap being turned off with pressure building up.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When God wants to accomplish something, He puts a burden in a brother, sister, or the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If the church prays and fulfills its duty, it will feel relieved.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The more the church prays, the more relieved it will feel.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>As it prays once, twice, five times, ten times, or twenty times, it feels more and more relieved.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If the church does not pray, it will feel stuffed and burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If the church continues to not pray, it will suffocate to death.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Brothers and sisters, if you feel heavy and pressed within, you have not fulfilled your ministry before God; God's pressure is upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Try to pray for half an hour or an hour; the pressure will be released, and you will feel relieved.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>What then is the prayer ministry of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>It is God telling the church what He wants to do and the church praying on earth what God wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This prayer is not asking God to accomplish what we want Him to do, but asking God to accomplish what He Himself wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Brothers and sisters, the church's responsibility is to declare God's will on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>On earth the church declares for God, "This is what I want."</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>If the church fails in this matter, it will not be of much use in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Even if everything else is good, it will not be of much use if it fails in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The greatest use of the church lies in the fact that it stands for God's will to be done on earth.</S>
