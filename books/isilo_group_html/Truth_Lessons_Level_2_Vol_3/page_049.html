The Helper</H2><P>The Lord is also a Helper to us, the believers. Hebrews 13:5 says that we should let our way of life be without the love of money, being satisfied with the things which are at hand, for the Lord will by no means give us up, neither by any means will He abandon us. Therefore, being of good courage, we say, "The Lord is my Helper, and I will not fear" (v. 6). This chapter is concerned with the virtues for the church life. Surely money lovers cannot enter into the reality of the church life. We should always be satisfied with what we have so that we cannot be distracted from the church life by mammon. Since we have the Lord as our Helper, we should be content and at peace. Since the Lord knows our needs, He will take care of the needs in our living. Our life is in Him, and our living is in His hands. Therefore, we need not fear; we need only to trust in Him as our Helper that we may be kept fully in the enjoyment of the church life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>56. The Overseer</H2><P>To us, the believers, the Lord is also an Overseer. First Peter 2:25 says, "You were like sheep being led astray, but you have now returned to the...Overseer of your souls." The Greek word for overseer is composed of "over" and "seer"; hence, overseer. This word seems to indicate someone above us who takes oversight concerning us and watches over us. However, the Lord as our Overseer does not mainly watch over us or rule over us. Rather, He shepherds us and takes care of us. This is like a mother caring for her child, taking care of every need of her child in a complete and gentle way. The same is true of Christ as the Overseer of our souls. Our soul is our inner being, our real person. Christ as the Overseer of our souls cares for the welfare of our inner being and exercises His oversight over the condition of our real person, and according to the need of our real person He shepherds us that we may be under His regular care and protection all the time and in everything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>SUMMARY</H2><P>As our portion, Christ is our Head. He is the Head of every man, the corporate Head of the church, and the Head over all things. He is also the Lord to us, the believers. All believers are the Lord's. Therefore, we should not judge any brother in the Lord; rather, we should receive one another. We should not only recognize Jesus Christ as the Lord; we should enjoy Him as our Lord, more personally and more intimately. He is also our Master. We should obey Him, the unique Master, as slaves in singleness of heart that we may enjoy Him as our Master, who cares for us in different ways. He is also our Sovereign Master. Therefore, He has absolute sovereignty and unlimited power over us. He is also our Friend, and He makes known to us the Father's desire. He is also our Brother. In life and nature inwardly and in position outwardly we are one with Him. He is also our Partner in the divine interest. He was anointed by God, and we share with Him in this anointing for the fulfillment of God's purpose. He is also our Physician. He heals, recovers, enlivens, and saves us so that we may have the life of God and be constituted the members of the Body of Christ. He is also our Helper. He knows all our needs and will take care of the needs in our living. He is also the Overseer of our souls. By caring for the welfare of our inner being and exercising His oversight over the condition of our real person, He shepherds us that we may be under His care and protection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>What are the three aspects of Christ as the Head?</li><li>What are the two aspects of our experience of Christ as our Lord?</li><li>How did Christ become our elder Brother?</li><li>Briefly state the significance of the fact that in God's economy we are Christ's partners.</li><li>Briefly explain how Christ is our Overseer.</li></ol><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_048.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Truth Lessons, Level 2, Vol. 3 &nbsp; pg 49</div><br></body></html>
