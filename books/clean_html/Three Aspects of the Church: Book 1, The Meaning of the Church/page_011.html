<h2 class="head4">Predestinating</h2>
<p>After choosing, God predestinated. As soon as He chose, He predestinated. John Nelson Darby translated this word as &ldquo;marked out.&rdquo; Once something is marked out, it is determined. For example, we could go to a furniture store and see that there are many cabinets, tables, and chairs. If I were to choose three cabinets, four tables, and five chairs, I would sign my name upon them. My signature would mark them out, and once they were marked out, their future would be determined. In eternity God chose the church, which means He marked out the church. We should not think that we were aimlessly wandering around, not knowing what was going on, and then we simply believed in Jesus. No, the church was chosen by God. He marked us out in eternity, and none of us can escape from His hand. We often think that God&rsquo;s grace came to us because we suffered many blows and hardships and were thus open to receive Jesus as our Savior. We do not realize that God marked us out. The church was marked out in eternity. The reason that we believe in the Lord and follow Him is not the result of ourselves or the result of anything controlled by us; rather, it is due to God, and it is controlled by Him. Every one of us is a part of what God has chosen and marked out.</p>
<h2 class="head2">That the Multifarious Wisdom of God<br />
Would Be Made Known to Satan and His Angels</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s eternal plan, as far as He is concerned, He desires to be fully mingled with man; however, God cannot forget that He has an enemy in the universe. Hence, another purpose in His eternal plan is to make known the multifarious wisdom of God to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies (mainly to Satan and his angels) through the church (Eph. 3:10). Satan thinks that he is clever, but his best schemes only provide God with the best opportunities to manifest His wisdom. God manifests His wisdom in this great universe not only through Satan but even through small men, such as Job. In the book of Job, Satan tried to do things to Job with his tactics and schemes, but Satan&rsquo;s cleverness simply gave God the opportunity to manifest His wisdom through Job.</p>
<p>If we want to know God&rsquo;s wisdom, we need to begin with God&rsquo;s creation. When we preach the gospel to people, they always like to ask: &ldquo;Why is there a devil in the universe? Since God is almighty, and He loves man, why did He not eliminate the devil?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why did God create the tree of the knowledge of good and evil?&rdquo; According to their reasoning, man fell because of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; therefore, if God had not created the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, there would not have been any problems. They also ask, &ldquo;Since God loves the world, why does He allow all the natural disasters and man-made calamities to occur? God causes man to suffer so much on the earth; can His love bear this?&rdquo; The only answer to all these questions is that God is different from man. If God&rsquo;s thought were the same as man&rsquo;s, God would not be able to manifest His wisdom.</p>
<p>The story of the universe can be compared to a drama, which has a very touching, rich, and complicated storyline. The story of the universe manifests the multifarious wisdom of God. God can be likened to a person composing a play involving the plot in many twists. A good play has a rich plot that can touch people&rsquo;s feelings and express the author&rsquo;s thoughts. The New Testament clearly says, &ldquo;We have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:9). The saved ones are likened to those in a universal spectacle or a drama. Therefore, we can say that in the universe, the item that best manifests the multifarious wisdom of God is the church.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s creation is marvelous. Consider the example of our human body. Many people who study medicine know that the construction of the human body is truly special. In the arrangement of the parts of our face, we have eyebrows above our eyes so that the rain and sweat cannot flow into our eyes. This is wonderful. Even though this is only a small item in God&rsquo;s creation, it is sufficient to manifest God&rsquo;s wisdom. God&rsquo;s wisdom is manifested not only in His creation but also in His redemption. After God created man, He brought man into the garden of Eden and placed him in front of the two trees. Man was seduced by Satan to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and thus he fell. Sin entered into man, causing him to be guilty of sin before God and also to have the element of death within him. From Satan&rsquo;s perspective, this was clever because it seemed that he had ruined the creation of God to the extent that God would not have a way to fix it.</p>
<p>God, however, became incarnated as a man. Before the incarnation, Satan never could have guessed the extent of God&rsquo;s wisdom. God in His wisdom and power accomplished a wonderful redemption. When the Lord Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Satan tried his best to kill Him; in the end he crucified the Lord Jesus. This, however, simply provided God with the opportunity to destroy Satan and to deal with everything that Satan had done in man. Man&rsquo;s record of sin, the authority of sin, and the death that was brought in by sin were all dealt with by the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross. This was something that Satan never expected. Moreover, he certainly could never have imagined that the Lord Jesus would be resurrected.</p>
<p>The Lord was raised on the third day after His death. Satan then tried his best to nullify the fact of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. He caused men to bribe the soldiers to say that Jesus&rsquo; body was stolen, not resurrected (Matt. 28:12-15). However, no matter how much Satan tried to nullify it, resurrection is a fact. Once the Lord resurrected, He brought man out of the realm of death and imparted His life into man. Once His life enters man, there is a change in man; man now belongs to God. We who have God&rsquo;s life have become the Body of Christ. One day the Body will become the New Jerusalem. At that time, Satan&rsquo;s mouth will be shut up completely.</p>
<p>God manifests His wisdom through these things. All these acts are not accomplished in individuals but in the church. Moreover, the law was also brought in because of Satan. Satan worked behind the scenes with the children of Israel, and this forced God to give them the law. The law separated the Jewish believers from the Gentile believers. Ephesians 2 shows how God in His wisdom broke down the middle wall of partition and brought the Gentile believers into the Body, causing them and the Jewish believers to be one Body in Christ (vv. 14-16). Chapter 3 says that God&rsquo;s wisdom is manifested through this Body. Hence, every single item related to the church shows God&rsquo;s wisdom. The church is especially for the manifestation of God&rsquo;s wisdom; the church is the embodiment of God&rsquo;s wisdom.</p>
<p>Ephesians and Colossians show that God&rsquo;s wisdom includes all that God is. God&rsquo;s wisdom is realized through God Himself and His power. If God&rsquo;s wisdom did not have God Himself as the resource and God&rsquo;s power as the energy, all God&rsquo;s plans would be in vain, and God&rsquo;s wisdom would not be manifested. The reason God&rsquo;s wisdom can be realized is that God Himself is the resource and God&rsquo;s power is the energy. The Bible shows that God&rsquo;s wisdom includes all that God is, and all that God is, is embodied in Christ. God also causes Christ to become wisdom to us (1 Cor. 1:30). It pleases God to make known His multifarious wisdom through the church to Satan and his angels; the multifarious wisdom of God is the church.</p>
<p>When the situation of the church before God is normal and spiritual, the wisdom of God is made manifest to man, and man can see the solution, the way, the power, and what humanity is lacking. What humanity lacks is not related to knowledge or talent but is a matter related to God. There are many people in the world who are knowledgeable and talented, but the knowledge and talent of man cannot match what the church possesses. Man does not have the wisdom of God. When knowledgeable and talented people contact the church, they say with reverence that there is something unique about the church people who worship God and belong to Him. This &ldquo;uniqueness&rdquo; is God Himself.</p>
<p>God is the wisdom of the church. When the church lives before God, it manifests many wonderful stories to man; these stories are the wisdom of God. This wisdom is God Himself, and this wisdom is something that the world lacks. However, when the church in a locality loses her nature and heavenly position, none of God&rsquo;s wisdom can be manifested. A church that is up to the standard enables man to see God&rsquo;s wisdom, that is, to see God Himself, even though the ultimate day of glory has not yet come. Throughout the past two thousand years, Satan has tried to destroy the church, but in every age God has manifested His wisdom through the church. When Paul wrote the book of Ephesians, he truly saw the vision of God.</p>
