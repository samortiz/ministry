[1]  CONTENTS A Young Man in God's Plan Saul's Birth and Religion Saul's Life and Conversion Saul's Vision and Commission
[2]  From the time of creation God has always been going on.
[3]  He wants to do something new in life, in knowing Christ, in experiencing Christ, in preaching Christ, in dispensing Christ, and in expressing Christ.
[4]  If the disciples, the followers, the believers of Christ, are not united with Christ as one, and they are not Christ Himself, how could Christ ask Saul, "Why are you persecuting Me?"
[5]  Galatians 1:15-16a says, "But when it pleased God, who set me apart from my mother's womb and called me through His grace, to reveal His Son in me."
[6]  God's plan is to reveal Christ into you, to make Christ your life and your everything, to regenerate and transform you to be a part of Christ, a member of Christ.
[7]  Furthermore, Paul said that he counted all things refuse that he might gain Christ and be found in Him vv.
[8]  To have the righteousness which is through the faith of Christ means through the union with Christ, through the identification with Christ, through the oneness with Christ.
[9]  First, God put Christ into you as your life that you may live by Him, and second, God put you into Christ.
[10]  On the other hand, God put us into Christ with the desire that we would be conformed to the image of His Son Rom 8:29 , that we might be transformed into the image of Christ to be thoroughly one with Christ.
[11]  You will be a part of God's plan to reveal Christ in you that you might be conformed to His image to be a member of His Body with a view that in this whole universe God will have a universal man with Christ as the Head in the heavens and with His believers as the members formed together as a Body on this earth to express Christ and to glorify God.
[12]  Before Saul was met by Christ on the way to Damascus, he was, no doubt, a brilliant, religious, zealous, and strong young man.
[13]  But when Christ intervened, this strong man became weak.
[14]  You may have been regenerated, but maybe even today you need a real, practical conversion from the traditional things, from the religious things, unto the living Christ.
[15]  Eventually the Lord showed me that the problem with me was that I paid much more attention to the work than to the Lord Himself I was converted at that time not from sin to God, but from the work to Christ Himself Before that time the work for the Lord was my life.
[16]  We need to ask ourselves what we are seeking.
[17]  They loved this kind of fellowship more than Christ Himself With these sisters there was the need to be converted, not from anything sinful but from this good fellowship to Christ Himself You have to consider whether or not something in your life is taking the place of Christ.
[18]  Yet you have to realize that even being spiritual could be a barrier between you and Christ and could be a substitute of Christ to you.
[19]  A Christian is a Christ-man, a man filled with Christ, a man mingled with Christ, a man lost in Christ.
[20]  It is possible to meet many working Christians, religious Christians, and active Christians who act for Christ, yet it is not so easy to meet some Christians who are one with Christ, filled with Christ, and occupied solely by Christ.
[21]  We all have to pay the price in this matter.
[22]  Many things can creep in, even good things other than Christ, to take the place of Christ in the life of Christians.
[23]  It is not only the world and sin that can hinder us from seeking Christ, that can keep us away from Christ.
[24]  Even good things, religious things, and even things concerning Christ can hinder us from seeking and being occupied with Christ Himself Therefore, we have to learn the lesson always to count everything as a loss on account of Christ.
[25]  All the things he counted as loss were good things, but those things were not Christ Himself Even many Christians are seeking spiritual gifts, but the gifts can be substitutions of Christ.
[26]  If we focus ourselves on Christ Himself to have the genuine experience of Christ, then any gift that we have will also be Christ Himself
[27]  Because you have experienced something of Christ and have seen something of Christ, no one can stop you from working together with the Lord and from ministering something of Christ to others.
