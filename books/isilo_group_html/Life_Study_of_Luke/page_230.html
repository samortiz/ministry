There can be no doubt that we are connected to Him in His ascension. For this reason, Ephesians 2:6 tells us that we are seated together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus. For years I could not understand how, in the words of Ephesians 2:6, we can be seated in the heavens. I have found electricity an excellent illustration in helping us to understand this. The electricity that operates in our homes is also in the power plant. This means that at the same time electricity is both in the power plant and in our homes. Likewise, through the divine transmission we are joined to Christ in the heavens. This is not something superstitious; it is a marvelous fact. The power that is in the heavenly power plant is also in us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Reality of the Divine Transmission</h2><p>Even though we cannot see this power, it is a reality. We cannot see the power that keeps the planets in position in the solar system, but it is nevertheless a fact. We should not say, &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s ascension is something far away from me. I can&rsquo;t understand it, and I can&rsquo;t see the divine transmission.&rdquo; Neither can you see the power that keeps the planets revolving around the sun, but you still believe it. We need to believe that in the divine, spiritual realm there is a power that transmits to us all that Christ has attained and obtained in His ascension. What Christ has attained and obtained in His ascension is beyond measure. But whatever He has attained and obtained is now being transmitted into the church. As long as we are clean receptacles and are willing to open ourselves, this transmission will take place continually.</p><h2 class="head2">Experiencing the Divine Transmission</h2><p>By now we should be able to see the connection, or the relationship, between us and Christ&rsquo;s ascension. There is a power, a divine current, flowing from the ascended Christ to the church, just as electricity flows from the power plant into a building. We should not only believe in the divine transmission; we need to experience it day by day. I can testify that because I experience this transmission, nothing can defeat me, frustrate me, or hold me down. Light, life supply, and sustaining power come to me continually because of this divine transmission.</p><p>Do you know where the church should be today? The church should be in the transmission of the exalted and ascended Christ. Christ has been raised from among the dead and seated at God&rsquo;s right hand in the heavens. All things have been subjected under His feet, and He has been given the headship over the entire universe. Now whatever He has attained and obtained in these four steps taken by God concerning Him is being transmitted into the church. This transmission is indicated by the phrase &ldquo;toward us who believe&rdquo; in Ephesians 1:19 and the phrase &ldquo;to the church&rdquo; in verse 22. In this transmission the church shares with Christ in all His attainments: the resurrection from among the dead, being seated in His transcendency, the subjection of all things under His feet, and the headship over all things. Praise the Lord for the transmission into our being of the Christ who is both in resurrection and in ascension!</p><p>Not only is Christ in us; His resurrection and ascension are also in us. As the processed, all-inclusive, indwelling Spirit, Christ dwells in us today with His humanity, divinity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. All this is being transmitted into us.</p><p>Concerning the experience of the divine transmission, we have all been hindered by the distorted teachings of traditional theology. Many Christians have never heard of the things concerning Christ&rsquo;s ascension. In particular, they have no concept regarding divine transmission. The traditional teachings have given many of us an improper education, and this kind of education has held us back from experiencing Christ in His resurrection and ascension. I urge you to empty yourselves in order to receive something newer and deeper from the divine revelation in the Scriptures.</p><p>The New Testament reveals that our Christ is in resurrection and ascension. Whatever He has obtained and attained in His resurrection and ascension is now being transmitted into us by the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. We simply need to open ourselves and say, &ldquo;Lord, I am here. I love You, and I give myself to You. Lord, I empty my whole being for You.&rdquo; If you pray like this, you will experience and enjoy this divine transmission.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_229.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_231.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Luke &nbsp; pg 230</div><br></body></html>
