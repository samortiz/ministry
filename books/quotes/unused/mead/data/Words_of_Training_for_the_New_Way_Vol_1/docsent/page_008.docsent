   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINISTRY BEING THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE LORD S MOVE ON THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the ministry?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most people lack the proper understanding of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I often heard you pray in the meeting, saying, We need to follow the ministry, or We need to be one with the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I doubt that you have a true understanding concerning the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Bible, there are these two words ministry and minister.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These two are not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ministry refers to the work of the Lord s move on the earth, whereas minister refers to one who bears responsibility in the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have spoken concerning this point quite thoroughly among us for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE MINISTRY IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Throughout the generations there has been the work of the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Old Testament, during Noah s age, the Lord s move was the building of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This work of building the ark was the ministry in Noah s age.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Noah was the chief minister in that ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, just by Noah alone, there was no way to build the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At that time, there must have been some who built the ark together with Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The work of building the ark was the ministry in that age.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do you think that in that ministry there were two or more different works, or two or more groups of different people, or two or more different leaderships?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Certainly not; otherwise, the ark could never have been built.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The problems of Christianity in the past two thousand years have been due to too many ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every denomination and every sect say that they are building the church of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many chapels have a piece of foundation stone inscribed with the words, Christ Jesus, our foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One Jesus Christ is divided up into many foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the crucial point of all the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible shows us very clearly that in Noah s age there was only one ministry; yet many ministers were there together building the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This does not mean that every minister was a master builder.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only Noah was the leader in the ministry of building the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During the age of Moses, God desired to build the tabernacle with its furniture, the most important of which was the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moses himself alone could not have built all those things, but he had the ministry of building the tabernacle, which was the work to fulfill God s unique purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this ministry, there was not only Moses himself; Moses was one of many ministers, and, undeniably, he was the leading one in that ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If there had been other leaders besides Moses, there would have been confusion in that situation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>During the age of David and Solomon, God desired to build the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The building of the temple was not merely a work, but a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time, there were not two different ministries building the temple; hence, there were not two different leaderships.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In David s age, it was David who was taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After David passed away, Solomon was the one taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, anyone who had a part in the ministry of building the temple, including the stone-cutters and stone-movers, was a minister in that ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE MINISTRY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the New Testament, the Lord Jesus came and He said, On this rock I will build My church Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first one who participated in the ministry of building the church was the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord s ministry was to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For this, He chose twelve apostles and brought them into the ministry of building the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Afterward, He also brought in other apostles, among whom the most prominent was Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since in every age there has been the work of ministry, it stands to reason that in this age also there should be the continuation of the Lord s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We cannot deny that on the earth today there is the Lord s building.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord has been building throughout the generations, and He will continue to build until His building work is fully completed, when the New Jerusalem descends from heaven.</S>
