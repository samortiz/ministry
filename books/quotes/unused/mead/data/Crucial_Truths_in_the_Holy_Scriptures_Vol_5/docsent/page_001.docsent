   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>PREFACE TO THE CHINESE EDITION</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order for the children of God, especially new believers, to receive a greater supply of the Word, we, by the Lord s grace, wish to present some crucial truths in the Holy Scriptures so that the children of God may receive a foundation in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These crucial truths, originally presented as forty-two topics, were studied by Witness Lee with the brothers and sisters in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later, in the autumn of 1949, Brother Lee studied them again with the brothers and sisters in Taipei and added eighteen topics for a total of sixty topics in all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chapters 1 through 16 cover the condition of a sinner to the time of knowing his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Chapters 17 through 60 examine various matters a believer should know and pursue after his salvation, with chapters 17 through 26 specifically covering ten matters a believer should practice after his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The purpose of these crucial truths is to make the matters of the Lord s salvation clear to those who lack an understanding of their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, they lay a foundation in the various aspects of fundamental biblical truths for believers who are clear about their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The purpose is specific, but the messages are diverse.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The notes on these crucial truths contain much light that is precious and urgently needed by the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We look to the Lord to inspire every brother and sister to read and study these notes carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We believe this will enable them not only to receive a foundation in the Word of God but also to receive manifold help in knowing the Bible.</S>
