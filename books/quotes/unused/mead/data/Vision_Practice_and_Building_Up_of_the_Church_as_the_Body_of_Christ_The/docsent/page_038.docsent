   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Talking and Reasoning Never Availing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Solve the Problems in the Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We can never solve problems by talking them over.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In my whole life I have never seen one problem solved by talking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This only wastes our time and gets us wrongly involved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The only way to fight the battle is to pray in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why whenever I go to other places, I shut myself off from hearing the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I do not like to hear and know these things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot help people by the way of listening to this kind of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sisters, if you know that certain other sisters have a problem, do not go to talk with them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you go to talk with them, you will get involved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let them talk among themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When their talk burns up all their natural fuel, the fire will stop by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not add yourself to the fire as more fuel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is foolish to jump into their fire as more material to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many who do this are still not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They call in other saints to foolishly jump into the fire with them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then instead of three pieces of firewood, there are six or seven.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then when the first three are burned out, the fire keeps burning with new material, and you yourself become the material to burn.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a real problem in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Keep yourselves away from this burning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let the firewood burn itself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This kind of talk cannot last very long.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After a few years those involved will see the need to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have learned this secret in the past, so I am passing it on to you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not be fooled.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can never solve the problems by talking about them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not waste the time, and do not damage yourselves by becoming material for the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, we need to pray in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>INSTRUCTION CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE PRACTICAL CHURCH LIFE IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to keep the oneness of the Spirit, be renewed in the spirit of our mind, and not grieve the Spirit, but rather speak things that are good for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moreover, we must be filled in spirit to be subject to one another and pray in spirit to fight the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If these five points were removed from the last three chapters of Ephesians, these chapters would be meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These five points related to the spirit are vital to this portion of the Word, which speaks about the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This proves that the church life is entirely a matter in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are truly practicing the church life, we all need to learn the lesson of turning to the spirit, both by ourselves and with others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is only in the spirit that the church life can be realized and all the problems can be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must learn to be in the spirit, exercise the spirit, and speak in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We also need to learn to forget about our natural mentality, our reasonings, and our talking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The fallen mind and the mouth work together too much.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must learn to divorce these two.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then we will know how to exercise the spirit, and the gossiping mouth will become a praising and thanking mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our mouth will be full of psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, and giving of thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can testify from our experience that the longer we talk in a gossiping way, the harder it is to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After two hours of talk we may not be able to pray for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, the more we stop our talking and forget our reasonings and our fallen mentality, the more we are full of praises.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sometimes we may even praise with tears and say, Lord, praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we will also pray, not mainly for ourselves but for others and for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We will genuinely be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all need to see that the church life is a life not of teaching or reasoning but a life in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We cannot get through our misunderstandings by reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we learn to turn from our mind to the spirit, everything will be cleared up, not through the mind but in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We all need to learn this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I would ask you to spend some time with the Lord to review all the matters concerning the practice of the church life in the last three and a half chapters of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Also, you should pray much while you read these chapters from Ephesians and the messages we have spoken here.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This will become a great help to us, and others will be helped through us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then we all will realize the proper way to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These messages are in the way of instruction that we may see the proper way to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must be strengthened into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the basic foundation for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then the spirit will spread into our mind to renew us, and we will learn how to speak with others under the control of the spirit, not grieving the Spirit but building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>From now on whenever we speak something damaging to the building up of the church, we must feel that we are grieving the Holy Spirit, and we should not have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now more than ever we need to take care of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must never speak anything that may cause damage, even if it seems good in some way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It does not matter whether something is good or bad, or right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What matters is whether it builds up or tears down.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our speaking must be for the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we speak in this way, the Holy Spirit within us will be happy; otherwise, He will be grieved.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Moreover, we must learn to be filled in spirit and to have praises, thanks, and subjection to one another from the infilling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Finally, we need to learn to pray in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>All of the above are the key passages in the last part of the book of Ephesians, showing us the proper way to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we neglect these few points, we will not have the way to build the church, regardless of how much we know.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Furthermore, we must remember that neither of the two important books that deal with the Head and the Body Colossians and Ephesians stress mere doctrines, forms, or gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Rather, they stress the strengthening of our inner man, the renewing of the mind by the spirit, walking and speaking in this spirit, and being filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is a matter of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is in this way that we have the church life.</S>
