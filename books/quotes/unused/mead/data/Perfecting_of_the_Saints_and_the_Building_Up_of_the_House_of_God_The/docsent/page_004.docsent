   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ATTITUDE OF CHRISTIANITY TOWARD HONOR OAK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The two major Christian groups in the West are the Keswick Convention and the evangelicals.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But these two groups are actually interconnected.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One of the past chairmen of the Keswick Convention was also the president of the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These two groups lead Christians in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the recent two to three years these believers have strongly opposed Brother Sparks s fellowship in Honor Oak.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They even printed their opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Hong Kong I read a book which said that Brother Sparks says that the believers need to know the Body and that a believer who does not know the Body has not entered into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The book refuted this statement and asked whether a person could be saved without entering into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The influence of these statements in Christianity is serious.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The book concluded that the teaching from Honor Oak is heresy, because a person who is saved has the life of Christ and is therefore a member of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It also asks whether anyone can say that a saved person has not entered into the church or the Body, and concludes that anyone who teaches this teaches heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christianity in the West has reached the point of absolute hostility toward Brother Sparks and Honor Oak, regardless of how congenial Brother Sparks is in his attitude and how cautious he is in his speaking and his work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE ATTITUDE OF CHRISTIANITY TOWARD US</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The brothers in the Far East have not taken the time to know the situation in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They know only how to work, lead meetings, give messages, and visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They do not care about other things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christianity, nevertheless, is determined to oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their opposition toward us is more severe than their opposition toward Honor Oak.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The believers who take the lead to oppose us are the missionaries from China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They do not express anything, but inwardly they oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Western missionaries from China Inland Mission oppose us when they come to the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After they lost the field in China, they began to work in the Chinese communities on the islands near mainland China from Japan to Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These missionaries no longer establish their own churches; instead, they help existing Christian groups.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the Baptists, the Presbyterians, or the Methodists invite them to give a message or to labor, they are willing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But they do not receive a salary from any group, because they are supported by China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was not their policy and goal when they were in China.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is my analysis, not a criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For many years we nullified the ground of organized Christianity in our attitude and our way, because of the light that we received.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, the missionaries in China Inland Mission feel that we are the least cooperative group and the most exclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They feel that they can work in any place, but we feel that they cannot work with us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although we are diametrically opposed in our ways, it is not our intention to oppose them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, they feel that our attitude is an obstacle to the goal of their work in East Asia and in the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, they take the lead to oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In expounding the truth, the heart and attitude of a believer must be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In addition, his words must be appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a serious matter before God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every believer will be judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whether or not a believer s argument concerning the truth is right, his heart, attitude, and words must be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He should not criticize others in a casual manner, nor should he make false and inaccurate statements.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 1939, after we published messages on the truth concerning the kingdom, someone put out a book to strongly oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The author of the book slandered us and said that those who advocate entering into the kingdom say that it is possible for a saved one to be in the dark hell.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we refute someone s statements, we should use their terms.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not create our own terms.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have never used the terms the dark hell or the black hell.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The author of an article entitled My Little Testimony said that he heard a message by a Mr. So-and-so.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This Mr. So-and-so was me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The author said that the message was about the believers accepting the local church s control in their marriage and that Mr. So-and-so said that if the saints do not overcome, they will go to the black hell.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I would like to ask the saints who have listened to my messages whether I ever spoke on accepting the local church s control or on controlling the believers marriage?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That article did not contain the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Over the years in Taiwan we have been attacked and severely opposed by other believers because of our attitude and our ground.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is no middle ground.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christians in the Far East have misunderstood our heart and our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In their eyes we create difficulties among the believers.</S>
