   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Travailing of the Creatures</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today many people say that animals are suffering and abused and are even near the point of extinction.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They say that we should do something to protect them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The trouble is that humans today are treated worse than cows and horses.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can we first take care of the lower forms of creatures?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other countries there are advocates of animal rights.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Romans 8 says that the whole creation groans for deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We know that one day the whole creation will be freed from the bondage of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then, as foretold in the Old Testament, the world will be a place where the wolf will dwell with the lamb; / And the leopard will lie down with the kid, / And the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; / And a young boy will lead them about.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>/ The cow and the bear will graze; / Their young will lie down together; / And the lion will eat straw like the ox Isa 11:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We know that one day all the creatures will be delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But that day is not today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today, protecting the animals is not our work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>C. Earthly Squabbling for Power</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every group of politicians in every nation of the world is vying for the center stage, and every nation in this world is trying to take advantage of other nations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are strife and unrest nationally and internationally.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are not called to engage ourselves in the work of the League of Nations; our work is not to help weak and struggling countries.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The angels one day will proclaim that the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ Rev 11:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can answer the unbelievers even today with this word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christians personal problems are solved by Christ s first coming.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The social problems of this world will be solved at the time of Christ s second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then the world will not be like the world we have today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All of the problems listed above will disappear in the twinkling of an eye.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>V. WHAT CHRISTIANS SHOULD DO TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What then should Christians do in this world?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A Christian should do his best to render help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, a doctor should do his best to help others by treating their diseases.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A scientist should do his best to help others by improving nutrition and other things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But one thing should be kept in mind: We should remain pure before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not be contaminated by the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Neither should we close our eyes to the affairs of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During His first coming, Christ labored on individuals; He did not try to do anything about the social system.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same way, today Christians should labor on individuals; they should not try to build up any system or institution.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before our personal problems or the world s problems were solved, we were sinners and we lived among sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today we have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have become the righteous among the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But there will be a day when the righteous will be among the righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the problems will be solved on that day when the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today we should give to others what we can afford to give.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not engage in any form of revolution.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Revolutions happen because there are bad institutions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Men start revolutions because they hate these institutions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They even sacrifice their blood for their revolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But we cannot sacrifice our blood for the sake of destroying any social system.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When Christ comes the second time, He will change all social systems and institutions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today, if we engage in such a work, there is a great possibility that we will be disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is foolish for us to sacrifice ourselves today.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The world has become what it is today because too many innocent people have sacrificed themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christians should not aspire to change any institution of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bible shows us a heavenly calling.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our calling is not on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This world is not our concern.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We live day by day in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But nothing with us is permanent; nothing is indispensable for us, and nothing is compulsory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is nothing in this world that we cannot live without, and there is nothing that we must have.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We take what the Lord gives to us in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is all right for us to have more and it is all right for us to have less.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the Lord arranges for us to have a smooth pathway, we can take it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the Lord arranges for us to have a rugged pathway, we can take it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are here to wait for the Lord s coming; we are not here to seek after worldly blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When Christ comes again, every earthly thing will be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>While we live on earth, we do not live for ourselves, for our families, or for society; we live for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When the Lord comes again, that will be the happiest day of all days.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Everything in this world is changing; only things pertaining to righteousness abide forever.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we do not belong to this world and do not settle down in this world, that day will be of unspeakable glory to us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>On that day, the glory of the Lord will fill the church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>His kingdom will come on earth, and the whole universe will be subject to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is why the church does not have any lingering love for the works of this earth.</S>
