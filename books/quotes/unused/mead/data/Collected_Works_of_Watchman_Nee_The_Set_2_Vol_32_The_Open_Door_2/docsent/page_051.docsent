   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Dear Brother Tsi-yi in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A meeting place for the church is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The landlord decided to take back his house, and we were forced to move out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thank and praise God that He prepared a place for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On August 1 we moved to 39 Shek-Kip-Mei Street, Second Floor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the future any news of the churches and any correspondence between the brothers and sisters should be directed to Hong Kong, P. O. Box 1664.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The work here goes on as usual: On Tuesday night we preach the gospel, on Wednesday night we have a Bible study, on Friday night we have our prayer meeting, on Saturday we have a perfecting meeting, and on the Lord's Day morning we preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Recently in Emmanuel Bookroom, we had meetings on Thursday and Friday evening and on the Lord's Day morning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is a good opportunity there, and the emphasis has been the Swatowese population and those living in the area who can speak Mandarin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The nature of the meetings is teaching and gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The work here was under Brother Luan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now that he has left Hong Kong, the work has been passed on to the local brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Please remember us before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peace to you in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Greetings to the brothers and sisters remaining in Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A weak brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ho Nai-yee, August 5</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Dear Brother K. H. Weigh:</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The work here has been taken up mostly by the local brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, since the introduction of the new principle, we have learned one lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brother Luan said that the book Rethinking Our Work The Normal Christian Church Life is a very good book.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we should not neglect the fact that this book concerns only the line of Paul, not the line of Peter in Jerusalem or the line of John in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we practice according to the principle of the book, it creates a great problem between the work of the local church and the work of the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no way to separate these two kinds of work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the experience we have learned in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have often neglected the Lord's work and the Lord's workers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May the Lord grant us grace and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The brothers here are quite burdened for the work in K'un-ming and Sikang.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We pray about it all the time in our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We hope that you can give us reports frequently and publish news of the work in K'un-ming in The Open Door so that the brothers and sisters can pray according to the needs.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May the Lord be with you, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Your brother, Ho Nai-yee, August 10</S>
