JEHOVAH'S LOVING DEALING<br>WITH HIS BELOVED ISRAEL</H2><P>In 51:1&#151;52:12 we see Christ as the Servant of Jehovah in relation to Jehovah's loving dealing with His beloved Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah's Calling of Israel</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Based upon Jehovah's<br>Calling of Their Father Abraham</H2><P>Jehovah's calling of Israel is based upon His calling of their father Abraham; hence, it is firm. Concerning this calling, 51:1 and 2 say, "Listen to Me, you who pursue righteousness,/Who seek after Jehovah,/tLook to the rock from which you were hewn,/And to the excavation of the pit from which you were dug./Look to Abraham your father/ And to Sarah who travailed with you;/For I called him when he was one person,/And blessed him and multiplied him." Here the word rock refers not to God but to Abraham, who was the source of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Jehovah Visiting Zion</H2><P>Based upon His calling of Israel, Jehovah has visited Zion. "Jehovah has comforted Zion;/He has comforted all her waste places,/And made her wilderness like Eden,/And her desert like the garden of Jehovah./Gladness and joy will be found in her,/Thanksgiving and the voice of song" (v. 3).</P>
