   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By the name Father in the New Testament, God reveals Himself to us in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God as the Father denotes God as the source of all things, the origin of all things, the initiation of all things, and the beginning of all things.</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In English, despotes is translated Sovereign Master, or simply Master.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, this is very different from the Old Testament adonai, which is translated Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When the New Testament quotes an Old Testament verse, kurios is often used in place of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Mark 1:3 is an example.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Kurios is a title of the Lord Jesus in His divinity.</S>

   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In John 20:28 when Thomas said, My Lord and my God, it is My kurios and my theos.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Furthermore, Lord in Jesus is Lord in 1 Corinthians 12:3 and Lord in Lord Jesus in 1 Corinthians 5:4 are kurios.</S>

   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Je is Jehovah.</S>

   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Jesus in particular refers to the Lord being a man.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is a title of the Lord Jesus in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>For this we can refer to Luke 1:31 and Matthew 1:21.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Although Jesus is a name that refers to Him as a man, this man is Jehovah coming to be our Savior and becoming our salvation.</S>

   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the Old Testament times, in order for someone to become a priest, a king, or a prophet, he had to be anointed with oil; all the priests, kings, and prophets were anointed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In the New Testament, as Luke 4:18 says, God anointed the Lord Jesus when He came to the earth, so the Lord Jesus was also an anointed One.</S>
