   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VICTORY AND PATIENCE BEING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A man once said to me, "I want to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I desire to overcome all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How can I overcome?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I answered coldly, "If a person like you could overcome, the whole world could overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A person like you could never overcome."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He became angry and said, "Why can't I overcome?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I said, "You simply cannot overcome."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His face turned red, and he said, "Are you saying that I am too evil?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I said, "That is right, you are altogether evil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, I am not the one who says this; God says this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to Him, you are totally wicked and completely hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why I can tell you that you can never overcome."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He said, "But what if I want to overcome?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I said, "Even though you want to, you cannot."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By then he had realized a little that he could not overcome by his own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I then told him, "God does not say that you have to be a certain kind of person before you can overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You are wicked beyond hope, and God knows that you will only fail and be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why He has put you aside.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No one in this whole world can overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only One can overcome Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Other than Christ, there is no one who can overcome."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then he understood that victory is simply Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once a brother confided in me that he could not be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have heard this kind of confession a countless number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Perhaps temper is a common problem all Christians have, and everyone loses his temper easily.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I asked, "Do you lack patience?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He said, "Yes, and I have been praying for God to give me patience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Perhaps God has not answered me because I have not been earnest enough in my prayer."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then he turned to me and asked, "Mr. Nee, did I pray the right prayer?" I said, "No. God only engages in wholesale business; He is not interested in retail business." He asked, "What do you mean?" I said, "When you lack patience, you go to God for patience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When your patience runs out, you go to God for more.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may realize that you are proud, and you go to the Lord for humility.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A few days later you may realize that you lack love and that you are critical of others, and you pray to the Lord for love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you do this, aren't you treating God just like a retail grocery store?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But this is not the way that God works.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why He never answers your prayer."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is interested only in wholesale business.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whoever comes to Him will receive the whole Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A whole Christ is within you, and He is your meekness, humility, patience, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God does not dispense anything to us in a fragmentary way; whatever He gives to us is found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we have Christ, we have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we gain Christ, we gain all things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is within us and living for us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No matter how hard and difficult a task may be, He is more than able to fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is victory?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Victory is simply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We cannot overcome by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Victory is not a matter of us overcoming, but of Christ overcoming in our place.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May the Lord be merciful to open our eyes so that we can see that we can never overcome in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not only be disappointed with ourselves but also lose all hope in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should cherish no hope whatsoever in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Overcoming is not a matter of change, but a matter of exchange.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If it is a matter of change, we will still be the same after three or five years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But since it is a matter of exchange, it happens instantly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We do not attain anything through a gradual process; everything comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are clear about God's salvation, we will overcome in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But if it is up to us, we will be the same three, five, eight, or ten years from now; we will be the same thirty or fifty years from now.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, since it is an exchange, we overcome in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Anything that issues from ourselves works slowly; it will not accomplish anything after even one hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But anything that is from God happens quickly, even instantly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Victory is not man-made; it is a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>May the Lord open our eyes to see that it is no longer us, and may we live a life that is full of miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When one sister died, the following words were inscribed on her tombstone: "She did what she otherwise could not have done."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that her living was not one that issued from herself.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>She could not do anything by herself, but through Christ she could do all things.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As a consequence, she did what she otherwise could not have done, and she said what she otherwise could not have said.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Everything is of Christ, and we have no part in it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christ is victory!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He lives within us, and He is living for us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All we have to do is abandon ourselves and allow Him to live out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then victory will be ours spontaneously.</S>
