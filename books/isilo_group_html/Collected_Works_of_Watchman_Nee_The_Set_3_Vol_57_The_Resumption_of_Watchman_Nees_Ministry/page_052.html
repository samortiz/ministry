There is a need for the leading of the Body because an individual's spiritual journey can be shortened with the leading of the Body. If a brother is left to himself, he may stumble for ten years before he can come up with something. But through the Body he may acquire the same thing in one evening. If the brother will take the judgment of the Body, he will save much time. The use of authority in the church is for the purpose of reducing the mistakes and shortening the journeys.</p><h2 class="head2">Everyone Functioning<br />and Everyone Submitting to Authority</h2><p>The principle of service in the church is that all the one-talented ones have to rise up. But as soon as they rise up, the flesh rises up also. Hence, in order for the church to become the church, all the one-talented ones have to rise up. However, in order to deal with the flesh, there must also be the exercise of authority. Here the only solution is for man to listen and obey. If you think that something is right, you should obey. If you think that something is not right, you should nevertheless obey. Everyone should rise up, and everyone should learn obedience. After a church has its authority established, there is still the need for the one-talented ones to rise up. Without the one-talented ones, there is no church. At the same time, without authority there will be confusion in the church. The problem with the Catholic Church is that the one-talented ones have not risen up. However, most of the people in the church are one-talented ones. Today the church has fallen into desolation because the one-talented ones are buried. If all the one talents are dug out and everyone is submissive, the authority in the church will be able to deal with the flesh.</p><p>There was a brother in Foochow who could be considered the very "incarnation of opinion.'' He was very zealous toward the gospel. It was right that his one talent be put to use, but the church could not let him do whatever he liked. At the same time, the church had to give him the opportunity to serve. At any rate a person must learn to obey. We may not see the result today, but in eight or ten years we will see the result. Having authority alone is empty; having the one-talented ones alone is disorderly. But when the one talents are added to authority, we have the church. Under these circumstances, what could have only been accomplished in ten years can now be accomplished overnight. The brother that I mentioned earlier was later dealt with. He responded by saying that he would quit and would move back to his hometown. I said, "Brother, you cannot do this. You still have to serve. However, you must serve according to the way the church tells you.''</p><p>One's submitting to authority is his inheriting the riches that lie in the authority. If a man truly learns to drop the self, he will have no problem with the matter of submission.</p><h2 class="head2">The Service in the Holy Spirit<br />and God's Light Being Found in the Body</h2><p>The kind of service that is in the Holy Spirit is found only in the Body. In 1 and 2 Timothy and in Acts, we see the matter of the Body. Paul told Titus to remain in Crete (Titus 1:5), and he told Timothy to come to him before winter (2 Tim. 4:21). Paul did not ask them to go and pray; he only told them directly where to go. Today God's move is carried out through the Body. Our service is also under the direction of the Body.</p><p>In the beginning God created a garden, and He went to the garden to look for man (Gen. 3:9). After man sinned, God no longer had a place of rest. Noah's dove was not able to find a resting place over the entire condemned earth (Gen. 8:9). God did not have a place of rest. This is why He later built the tabernacle. The tabernacle is God's resting place. The tabernacle brought in the temple. Later, the temple was judged, and not one stone was found on top of another. Then the church was brought in. Ephesians 2 says that the church is the dwelling place of God. Today God dwells in the church (1 Tim. 3:15). In the Old Testament the light was in the Holy of Holies. There was no lamp or sunlight in the Holy of Holies. Yet there was light because God was there. In the same principle, if you want to receive light today, you have to come to the church. It is a strange thing for a person to be able to come to the church yet not receive any light. If a man is outside the church, he can remain in darkness. But once he comes into the church, he will see light.</p><p>Let me ask the co-workers a question: Do you receive more light when you read the Bible by yourselves or when you meet in the church? Do you understand the Scriptures more by staying in your room or when you speak on the platform? What one person cannot see clearly by himself, he will see clearly when he is with the brothers. You may think that what you have received comes from your own mind. But have you ever given more thought to the matter? All revelations come from the light. Only when there is the light can there be the revelations (Psa. 36:9). Today there is abundant light in the church. This is why we have to see that it is impossible for us to be an individual Christian.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 57: The Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry &nbsp; pg 52</div><br></body></html>
