   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE WORDS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Words are one of the most important things in our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus said, "For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks" Matt 12:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This shows that words express a man's heart; they show what is within a man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a man does not open his mouth, it is not easy for us to know his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But as soon as he opens his mouth, his heart is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a man does not speak, no one will know his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once he speaks, however, others will touch his spirit through his words; they will know his condition before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can judge a person by the words he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, a believer must be very careful with his words.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He must learn to speak the proper words.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Bible, there are four or five places that tell us how to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us consider them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>LIES</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, we must not speak lies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John 8:44 says, "You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he speaks the lie, he speaks it out of his own possessions; for he is a liar and the father of it."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Satan speaks a lie, he speaks out of his own possessions, for he is a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He did not learn his lies from others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is the father of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Satan damaged God's creation in the garden of Eden with lies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He has to lie in order to overturn God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lying is a sin more common than any other sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are as many people who lie as there are people under Satan's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As soon as man is saved by God, the first lesson he should learn is to reject any lie.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He should reject inaccurate words, words that add to or come short of the truth, and intentional or unintentional lies.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Lies should not be found in a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If lies remain, it means that he is giving Satan the ground to maintain his grip.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a man has never learned to reject lies, he will not realize how often he lies.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more a person tries to reject lies, the more he will find out that he is simply a lying person; even his heart is inclined towards lying.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are more lies in this world than we can think of, and there are more lies in us than we expect.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we have never learned to reject lies, we will not know how many lies there are.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But once we resolve to reject lies, we learn how many lies there are in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What a pity that among God's children, so many lies still exist!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord's word is clear and serious Satan is the father of those who lie.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, all those who lie are the children of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is a pitiful thing for God's children to allow Satan's lying seed to remain in them!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brothers and sisters, we should not be believers for many years and yet never make a resolution to deal with our lies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such a dealing is long overdue.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As soon as a man believes in the Lord, he has to learn to speak accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are many kinds of lies; some are obvious, while others do not seem like lies at all.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In reality, however, they are still lies.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some examples can be seen in the following:</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Being Double-tongued</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Being double-tongued 1 Tim 3:8 is speaking something in one circumstance and speaking something else in a different circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is saying that it is all right to do something to one person and not all right to do the same thing to another person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is switching between yes and no and changing unpredictably.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This kind of speaking is a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Speaking according to One's Emotions</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many people do not speak according to the truth or according to facts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead, they speak according to their likes and dislikes; they speak according to their emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If they like something, they speak a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If they like a person, they speak a certain way, but if they hate something or some person, they speak another way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is speaking according to our emotions rather than according to reality.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This way of speaking is also lying.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must realize that we should not speak according to our feelings but according to facts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not speak according to our emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A Christian should learn to control his emotions to the extent that he will not speak according to his wish or imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many people's words do not reflect facts; they reflect their imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When they wish that a certain sister would be good, they tell others how good she is.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When they think a certain brother is about to fall, they tell others how bad he is.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Actually, the one they say is good is not necessarily that good, and the one they say is bad is not necessarily that bad.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Their words are based on their imagination rather than on facts.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Man often speaks what he hopes to see and what he imagines to be true; his words do not reflect the true condition of a matter.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must learn to deal with this kind of speaking.</S>
