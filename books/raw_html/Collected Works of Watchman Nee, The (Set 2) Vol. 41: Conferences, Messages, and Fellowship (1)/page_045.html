<h2 class="head1">THE ATTITUDE OF AN OVERCOMING LIFE</h2><p>The section above covers the steps one should take to live a life beyond the gate of victory. Now we have to know the attitude one should take toward maintaining an overcoming life. Many people have done the things we mentioned above, but they are constantly afraid that the Lord will not come to them, and they worry that they will fail if He does not come. In order to live an overcoming life, we have to pay attention to our attitude. We must remove all fear by faith and allow the Lord to take over everything. When the Lord was with the disciples by the sea, He told the disciples to go to the other side (Mark 4:35). He did not tell them to go to the bottom of the sea, but to the other side of the sea. Yet the disciples did not believe His word. When the storm arose, they were beside themselves with fear and were sore afraid. They did not have faith, and they begged the Lord to do something. Many times, the louder we pray, the less faith there is in our prayer. Sometimes the more earnestly that we pray, the more it shows that we do not have faith. Faith is trusting in the Lord's word. The Lord said that the disciples were to cross to the other side, not to go to the bottom of the sea. If they had faith, they could have all gone to sleep. Having faith means sleeping with the Lord. If one does not have faith, he cannot sleep with the Lord. If a man has faith, even if he does not sleep, he can still go to the stern of the boat and speak to the waves. He can even mock the waves, saying, "You are not strong enough. You are not fierce enough." A person who has faith has peace; he has peace within and without. Satan cannot prevail over such a person. Hence, victory is believing in God's word and His power. The attitude of an overcoming life is being fully at peace through faith.</p><h2 class="head1">WHAT TO DO IF ONE FAILS</h2><p>After a believer has overcome, he should not sin anymore in regard to God's work, provisions, and commandments. However, those who have passed the gate of victory may discover to their surprise that they can sin again. While it is clear to them that they sinned in the past, they wonder why they are still sinning after they have supposedly passed the gate of victory. Some may ask, "If a saved person who has overcome still sins, what difference does this victory make in him?" There is a big difference. There are three differences between an overcoming person and a person who has not yet overcome when it comes to sinning. First, before one overcomes, sin is a compulsory and imperative thing. One has no choice but to sin. There is a power within him which forces him to sin. After one overcomes, the situation is entirely different. Sin is accidental, and it is committed through oversight or carelessness. Second, before one overcomes, he commits the same kind of sins over and over again. He has some so-called private sins which are characteristically his own. He commits the same sin over and over again. Every person has only three to five kinds of recurring sins. These few sins entangle him constantly. But after a person has overcome, the situation becomes very different. He still sins, but only occasionally. Frequent sins do not bother him anymore; they only catch up with him accidentally. Third, before one overcomes, resuming a clear fellowship with the Lord after he sins is hard and takes time. But after he overcomes, he can recover his fellowship with the Lord quickly if he sins again. This is because he has faith, and he believes that the Lord's blood can cleanse him from all his sins (1 John 1:9). Those who have passed the gate of victory should confess their sins to the Lord immediately after they accidentally commit a sin, and they should believe that the Lord can cleanse them with His precious blood. After this, they should immediately praise and thank the Lord, and apply His overcoming life continually. If we accidentally sin, we should not delay our confession for three or five days. If we do, we will commit more sins.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GROWTH OF THE OVERCOMING LIFE</h2><p>Some may ask, "Since a person has overcome, how can he sin again?" We have to know what faith is. The overcoming life is a life of faith. The Lord wants us to set our eyes on Him all the time. No matter what the outward circumstances are, we should believe in Him. The Lord wants to deliver us out of a life of feelings into a life of faith. He wants us to go on step by step by faith and in grace. Now we need to see how we grow in the overcoming life.</p><p>Victory is a gate as well as a path. It is a crisis point first, and then a journey. If we continue on the path, there will be no limit to our future. Some have asked, "Since the Lord is my life, and since He is living in me already, how can I grow any more? Are you saying that this life is not perfect? And are you saying that there is the need for His life to grow?" It is true that the Lord does not change; He neither advances nor retreats. But we have a free will, and we have our own intellect and emotions. Our victory is overcoming the sins that we know of. It is not overcoming all the sins that we do not know of. This is like our consecration; we only consecrate the things we know of. There are many things which we do not know of, which we can only consecrate gradually. Even consecration does not have any absolute standard. For example, I may know that I am powerless in the matter of endurance. When I consecrate myself, the Lord's endurance will be expressed through me. As far as endurance itself is concerned, we cannot have any more growth because the Lord's endurance is perfect. However, growth means that in addition to endurance we can experience meekness. Growth simply means an expansion of sphere and a deepening of measure. There is no growth as far as meekness or endurance are concerned because meekness and endurance are just Christ. But as far as our experience of these things is concerned, it is possible to have a continual expansion and deepening in sphere and measure. This is the meaning of the growth of the overcoming life.</p><p>We have said that the Lord is our sanctification. But there is a verse that says that we are sanctified by the truth (John 17:17). This means that we may have a sin today which we are quite proud of and which does not bother our conscience at all. Later, we may find from the truth of the Bible that this is wrong. In this way, we know one more sin, and we can confess such a sin. After the truth exposes our sin through God's enlightening and after we know that it is a sin, we have to deal with it. The way to deal with it is the same as before. We have to tell the Lord, "I have found another sin. Thank You that I now know one more sin and can experience more grace and know more of the overcoming life." The New Testament says that we should grow in grace (2 Pet. 3:18). What does it mean to grow in grace? Grace is God doing things for man. When man does things for God, this is the law, whereas when God does things for man, this is grace. Growing in grace is allowing God to do more things for us. When truth shines on us, our shortcomings are exposed. Then grace comes to supply us. Truth is God exposing our needs, whereas grace is God supplying us with strength. The more light we receive, the more needs we discover, and the more we receive and grow in grace.</p>
