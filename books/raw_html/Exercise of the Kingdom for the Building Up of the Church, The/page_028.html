 <h2 class="head1">STIRRED UP TO SEEK CHRIST IN A DESPERATE WAY</h2>
<p>When we have been compelled and encouraged to seek Christ, we shall not be idle regarding Christ, and we shall no longer be indifferent. I must confess that I have a burden about this matter. I am concerned that not even many of us have been stirred up to seek Christ in such a desperate way. We need to see how crucial the situation is. We shall either be punished or rewarded. Thus, we need to say, &ldquo;Lord, I am desperate. Because I will be either punished or rewarded, I must seek after You.&rdquo; This is not simply a matter of knowing the truth of the kingdom. It is a matter of being desperate to gain Christ.</p>
<p>Are you seeking Christ? Are you gaining Him more and more? If not, do not make excuses for yourself. Do not say, &ldquo;Lord, I can&rsquo;t make it. I can&rsquo;t come up to the standard of Your constitution in Matthew 5, 6, and 7. Lord, You know that no one can do it. How can I make it? Lord, please excuse me.&rdquo; You may excuse yourself today, but you will not be able to do so when you meet the Lord at His judgment seat. At that time there will be no excuse. If you try to excuse yourself then, the Lord will say, &ldquo;Did I not present Myself to you? I am the all-sufficient grace. But were you hungry enough to seek Me?&rdquo; What will you say? You will be silent.</p>
<p>Because so few Christians are hungry for the subjective Christ, it is impossible for the church to be built up with them. Where can you find Christians who are denying the self and losing the soul? It is difficult to find any. Most Christians stay with a particular group as long as they are happy there. But when they are no longer happy, they leave and go somewhere else. This indicates that there is no denying of the self and no losing of the soul. Instead, there is one excuse after another. But what about us? Are we making excuses, or are we being forced to seek Christ? We need to tell the Lord that we are short of Him and that we are desperate to gain Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAUL, THE PATTERN</h2>
<p>I thank the Lord for setting up a pattern in the New Testament with the Apostle Paul (1 Tim. 1:16). Paul was so hungry for Christ that eventually he became fully saturated with Christ. Therefore, in Philippians Paul seemed to be saying, &ldquo;As long as I can manifest Christ, I don&rsquo;t care about the circumstances. For to me to live is Christ. I am satisfied to be able to manifest Christ in any environment.&rdquo; Paul was one who sought Christ in an absolute way. He was utterly hungry for Christ, and he did everything possible to gain Christ, to experience Christ, and to be saturated with Christ. Therefore, from his experience he could say that it was God who worked within him both the willing and the working of His good pleasure (Phil. 2:13, Gk.). He could also say, &ldquo;I can do all things in him who empowers me&rdquo; (Phil. 4:13, Gk.). At the end of his life, Paul had the assurance to say these words: &ldquo;And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:18). No doubt, Paul was saturated with Christ. He surely was one fully built into the Body of Christ and completely under the exercise of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A DESCRIPTION OF THE LIFE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Recently a brother testified in a meeting that the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 5, 6, and 7 is a description of the life of Christ. I appreciate this word. All the exercises and requirements of the kingdom are a description of Christ&rsquo;s life. They all speak of how much Christ&rsquo;s life can do in us. The requirements of the kingdom&rsquo;s constitution and the exercise of the kingdom reveal what great things Christ&rsquo;s life can accomplish in us. Thus, there is no excuse. His grace is all-sufficient. If Christ had not been incarnated, crucified, and resurrected, we might have an excuse. But now, after having been incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended, Christ is the very all-inclusive life-giving Spirit within us. The only question is whether or not we are hungry for Him and seek after Him. Do not make excuses for not denying the self, taking up the cross, or losing the soul. None of us should offer excuses for ourselves. Instead, we should say, &ldquo;Lord, there is no excuse. I am compelled to seek You, and I am encouraged to gain You. Lord, I want to be filled with You, saturated with You, and permeated with You so that I may be a part of You.&rdquo;</p>
