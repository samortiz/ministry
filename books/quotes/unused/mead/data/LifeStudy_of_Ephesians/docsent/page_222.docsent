   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 3:8 Paul says that he preached the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What Paul preached was not doctrine, gifts, knowledge, or power.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He preached the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that Paul ministered these riches to others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The unsearchable riches of Christ include all the aspects of what Christ is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a gradual way, Christ s riches need to be wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, we are not the ones who should be patient, kind, gentle, or loving.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, Christ must be wrought into us to be our patience, kindness, gentleness, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that we need to participate in the riches of Christ and to have these riches daily, even hourly, wrought into us in a specific way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In our daily experience we should be able to itemize Christ s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ must become our patience, our love, our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ must be wrought into our being to such an extent that He makes His home in our hearts 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am concerned that for many of us the matter of Christ making His home in our hearts is simply a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Is Christ actually making His home in your heart?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Who is presently at home in your heart you or Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you are honest, you will have to say that, for the most part, your heart is your home, not Christ s home.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You are the one living there, not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may hear a message about Christ making His home in us and shout that our heart is Christ s home.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But there may be no reality to support what we proclaim.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order for Christ to make His home in our heart, we need to take Him both as our person and as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In such a case, we shall be able to testify that the person living in our heart is no longer the self, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The crucial issue is not whether we are humble or proud, weak or powerful, gifted or not gifted.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The question concerns who is living in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Who is the person taking up residence in your heart?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may be unusually gifted, but your heart may not yet be Christ s home.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, it may be the home of the self, as long as you are still the person living in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today s Christianity is a religion of behavior, doctrine, work, power, gifts, and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, it is virtually devoid of the reality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Most Christians are veiled by natural and religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the reason that we need a heavenly vision to know what is in God s heart and to see what He planned in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God desires to have a people who care only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He wants a people who are not occupied with knowledge, work, behavior, or power, but who simply care for Christ in a very practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The experience of the riches of Christ and the reality of Christ making His home in our hearts should not be mere doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They must be the reality of our daily Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the past, quite often husbands and wives have come to me with problems.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Usually the husband would accuse the wife, and then the wife would accuse the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then they would say, Since you are a servant of the Lord and have spiritual understanding, you can discern who is right and render a fair judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>My practice was not to judge according to right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead, I would ask them whether or not Christ was making His home in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I would then go on to ask if Christ was living in them while they were accusing each other.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Usually, they had nothing further to say, and eventually the word went out not to bring such problems to me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes people come to me with the intention to argue about doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But instead of answering them in a doctrinal way, I ask them to what extent Christ is making His home in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What good does it do to be right in doctrine if we do not have Christ living in us?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Pharisees were apparently correct as far as doctrine was concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, the Lord Jesus still rebuked them because they did not have any reality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In a very practical way, our hearts need to become Christ s home.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He must be able to live in us and to settle down in us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He, not the self, must be the One who occupies our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is our need today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Apart from this, it does not matter very much whether husbands love their wives or wives submit to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the book of Ephesians the matter of Christ making His home in our hearts is more strategic than love for wives or submission to husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, I am fully assured that if a brother allows Christ to make His home in his heart, he will certainly love his wife in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Moreover, if a wife allows Christ to dwell in her heart, she will no doubt be submissive to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What we need more than anything else is for Christ to make His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord s recovery is not a matter of doctrine, biblical interpretation, or conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Furthermore, it is not a matter of knowledge, gifts, power, or work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In contrast to all this, the Lord s recovery is altogether a matter of Christ wrought into us and making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>ARRIVING AT A FULL-GROWN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In 4:13 Paul says that we all need to arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to become not only a perfect man, complete man, or whole man, but a full-grown man, one who has the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ 1:23 , which has the stature with the measure.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In 4:15 Paul goes on to say that we need to hold to truth in love so that we may grow up into Christ in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To grow up into Christ in all things is to have Christ increase in us in all things until we attain to a full-grown man.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>PARTS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In 5:30 Paul says that we are members of Christ s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This indicates that we are members of Christ, parts of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>According to our natural constitution, we cannot be members of Christ s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christ Himself is the element, the factor, that makes us part of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hence, in order to be parts of Christ as members of His Body, we must have Christ wrought into our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In 5:32 Paul says that the great mystery is Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the Lord s recovery we should devote our attention to the matter of Christ being wrought into us to make us a proper church for the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is God s economy.</S>
