<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. To Be Presented to God<br>Full-grown in Christ</H2><P>Eventually, we have to grow to such an extent so that we can be presented to God full-grown in Christ (Col. 1:28b; Eph. 4:13b). We have to mature with Christ in full growth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Hope of Glory</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Christ in You, the Hope of Glory</H2><P>Christ is in us as the hope of glory (Col. 1:27). Christ is not only life to us today but also our glory in the future. Our hope is for our body to be saturated with Christ's glorious, splendid element. This will be the redemption of our body, the transfiguration of our body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Hope of Our Calling</H2><P>The hope of our calling (Eph. 1:18b; 4:4b) is the hope of glory, which is the transfiguration of our body and the manifestation of the sons of God (Rom. 8:19, 23-25). The Lord did not give us or allow us to have any other hope on this earth. Our hope is that we will be transfigured in our body, redeemed to the uttermost.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Every Necessity and All the Enjoyment</H2><P>Christ is every necessity and all the enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Our Light</H2><P>Christ is our light. John 8:12 says that He is the light of the world and that everyone who follows Him shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Our Food</H2><P>Christ is also our food. In John 6 He told us that He is the living bread and that if we eat Him, we shall live because of Him (vv. 51, 57b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Our Drink</H2><P>According to 1 Corinthians 10:4, Christ is our spiritual drink. In the Christian race, we should not drink anything other than the all-inclusive Christ as our all-inclusive drink.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Our Breath</H2><P>Christ is our very breath. John 20:22 shows that Christ breathed Himself into the disciples. We need to breathe Him in moment by moment by calling on His name.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Our Clothing</H2><P>Christ is even our clothing. Galatians 3:27 says, "For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ." To put on Christ is to wear Christ as our clothing.</P>
