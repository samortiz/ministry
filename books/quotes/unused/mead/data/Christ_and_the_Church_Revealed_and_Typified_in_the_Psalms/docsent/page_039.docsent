   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Psalm 63 we see a further aspect of the saints' enjoyment of the house: They looked upon God in his sanctuary to see his power and his glory.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is" v. 1 . This experience is similar to that of a dear brother who has been in the church, but who is now out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is in a dry and thirsty place without water; so he is longing for satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is longing for that which is mentioned in verse 2, "to see thy power and thy glory, so as I have looked upon thee in the sanctuary."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perhaps you are in the local church now, and you sense that it is good, but you do not sense how wonderfully good it is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If, however, you are cut off from the local church and brought to a place where there is no church, at that time you will pray the words of the Psalmist in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You will long to be where you have been in the past; you will thirst for God and yearn to see His power and glory as you have looked upon Him in the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The sanctuary is not a dry and thirsty place; the house of God is not a place without water.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the sanctuary there is a river.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once you have looked upon the Lord in the sanctuary, once you have drunk of the river of God in the sanctuary and then are brought away to a dry place, at that time you will realize the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How grateful we all should be to be in the local church, where we may enjoy Him in the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What enjoyment this is!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both these verses and our experience prove that the local churches arc the places with water, places where we may look upon the Lord and see the power and glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then we see how the saints in Zion praise and wait for God!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion" Psa 65:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brothers and sisters, whenever we come together, are we ready to praise?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do we really have some praises waiting for God?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From now on, whenever you come to the meeting, do not bring two ears itching for teachings, but two lips ready for praise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 2 Timothy 4:3 the apostle Paul said, "The time will come when they will heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>People pile up teachers because of their itching ears.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need praising lips.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever you come to the church meetings, you should be prepared to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even before you come, you must compose something touching the King.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then when you meet, your praise will be waiting for the Lord, waiting for God in Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Praise must be waiting for the Lord in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then, Psalm 65:4 says that to dwell in God's courts and be satisfied with the goodness of His house is blessed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Psalm 36:8 we read, "They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house," and here, "We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you would come to the local church and enjoy the goodness of the house of God, it is a strong proof that you have been chosen and blessed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not know what kind of wind He causes to blow us into His house, whether it is a wind from the west, the east, the north, or the south.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Anyway, we are here.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He has not only chosen us, but also caused us to dwell in His courts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Could you ever have dreamed that you would be in the local church?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No, but praise the Lord, the Lord who has chosen us has also caused us to be here.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more we enjoy the fatness and goodness of the house, the stronger our assurance is that we have been chosen and caused by God to be in such a place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must all bow before Him and say, "Lord, it is Thy doing; it is all of Thee that we are in Thy building today and not outside of it."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Psalm 66:13 the Psalmist says, "I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The burnt offerings are the praises of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord has caused us to dwell in His courts, and now we may come to the house of God with praises of Christ as an offering.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We learn to offer these praises as offerings to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In all the local churches we need to be trained to praise Him that we may always have praise concerning Christ as an offering to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Finally, in Psalm 51:18, we see how the saints pray to God for the building up of the wall of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all need to beseech God to build the walls of the city that we may have the full safeguard in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In God's recovery, the recovery of the temple is first, and then the recovery of the walls of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With the recovery of the walls, the house is fully safeguarded.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I would ask you to pray-read all of these verses concerning the saints' enjoyment of the house and the city of God in Psalms 49 through 67.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All their enjoyments are through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more you pray-read them, the more you will enter into their enjoyment.</S>
