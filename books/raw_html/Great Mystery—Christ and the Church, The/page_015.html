        <h2 class="head2">Being Strengthened into the Inner Man and Christ Making Home in Our Hearts</h2>
<p>After speaking of the mystery of Christ, Paul bowed his knees unto the Father and prayed for the believers. Paul did not ask the Father to give us peace, prosperity, wealth, or success. He prayed that the Father would grant us, &ldquo;according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home&rdquo; in our hearts through faith (Eph. 3:16-17). When we are strengthened into the inner man, Christ will be able to make His home in our hearts; that is, Christ will have the ground in us and will be the Master of our home. This is a crucial key. In order to see the mystery of Christ and the riches of Christ, we must let Christ make His home in our hearts. If Christ cannot make His home in our hearts, we will have nothing of His riches in our experience.</p>
<p>After a couple gets married, it is inevitable that there will be problems. Everyone likes the word <em>marriage,</em> but no one wants trouble. Once a marriage is &ldquo;tied,&rdquo; however, the couple is bound together; this means that they are trouble-bound as well. Before getting married, a single brother does not have many problems. But after he is married, he will begin to have problems the second day of his marriage. It is not easy to be married. Therefore, we need Christ. However, we should not only have Christ; we must also let Christ make His home in our hearts. If Christ does not make His home in us, our having Christ is in vain. For example, what is the purpose of having a cup with water if we do not drink the water? If we drink the water, it enters into us, and we receive the supply.</p>
<p>A sister may be a good wife, but she can be a problem to her husband. If the brother lives in his emotions, an unpleasant countenance and tone from her will touch his emotions and provoke his anger. If he is a rational person, his mind will be able to control him when his anger flares up. However, over time his anger will eventually overcome his mind, and he will respond when she speaks. This is a typical example of how an argument occurs between a husband and wife. We cannot say that Christ is not in the husband and wife. Christ is in them, but He does not have ground in them; hence, He is confined by them.</p>
<p>Man has many parts. We have emotions, which include our anger. We have a mind, in which is our reasoning. We have a will, which can control our behavior. If our will is not strong, we will not be able to control ourselves, and we will lose our temper. However, we also have an inner man, which is our spirit. When we lose our temper and quarrel with our spouse, we are using our mind, emotion, and will. When we quarrel, our inner man often faintly says, &ldquo;Why are you doing this? What are you quarreling about? Calm down! Pray!&rdquo; Every believer has had this kind of experience. This is Christ in our spirit. We lose our temper and quarrel with our spouse because we are strong in our mind and emotion; we are strong in everything but not in our inner man, where we confine Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>Therefore, Paul prayed that the Father would grant us, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith (vv. 16-17). When our spirit is strong, it prevails over our mind, emotion, and will; our spirit can prevail over our entire soul. Many of us have had the experience of our anger dissipating when we call, &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; Our anger can be compared to a big balloon that is pricked and deflated when we call on the Lord. When we are strengthened into the inner man, Christ has the ground to come out of His confinement. We may confess our sin, saying, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me for not giving You the ground. I was the boss. Lord, forgive me and gain me.&rdquo; When we pray in this way, we give Christ the opportunity to permeate our inward parts and to supply our whole being. Christ can gain ground and make His home in our hearts when we are strengthened into the inner man.</p>
<p>In Greek the word <em>hearts</em> in this portion is not a word without a definite meaning that is used to fill out the sentence; rather, it functions as a noun with a definite meaning that is important to the sentence. The heart here refers to our psychological heart, not our physiological heart. Our heart is composed of our mind, emotion, will, and conscience. For Christ to make His home in our hearts is for Him to possess these four parts. The phrase <em>make home</em> is a verb derived from the noun <em>home</em> in Greek. Hence, it should be rendered &ldquo;make home.&rdquo; When we visit the churches, we may stay in a hospitality room in a meeting hall, and the love and service of the saints may be perfect. However, no matter how perfect everything may be, this room is not our home. We can only be a guest; we cannot make our home there. We must be ready to leave at any moment.</p>
<p>It would be terrible if Christ were merely a guest in us. As Christians, we possess the Lord&rsquo;s life within us. But the question is whether the Lord has made home in our hearts. When He makes home in our hearts, His riches are transmitted into us to supply our needs and quench our thirst. We should never think that this is superstition or that this is merely someone&rsquo;s exposition of the Bible. I can testify that this has been my experience for over fifty years.</p>
<p>Christ is rich; He is God, He is the Spirit, He is life, and He is a man. In resurrection He brought humanity into divinity. Now the human element is in the Spirit and in the divine life. The resurrected Christ is indescribably rich.</p>
<p>The Christ in whom we believe is true. He is a mystery, and He is rich. However, He must make His home in us. For Him to make home in us means that we give everything to Him, and He supplies us within. If we lack wisdom, He is our wisdom. If we lack patience, He is our patience. If we lack humility, He is our humility. He is whatever we lack. He is not an objective religion, nor is He doctrine. He is living inside of us. He is God, man, the Spirit, and life; He is all and in all. His riches are unsearchable and inexhaustible. As long as we open to Him, give Him the ground, and let our inner man prevail over our mind, emotion, and will, Christ will have the ground to make His home in us.</p>
<p>Then we will be filled with the riches of Christ, His rich supply. The result of such filling is that we become the fullness of God, that is, the expression of God. We will express God. This expression is the church. The multifarious wisdom of God is made known to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies through the church. This is what we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery announce and testify in every country and in every place. I hope that the young people, the young adults, the middle-aged, and the elderly among us would see this mystery. This is our vision, and this is our testimony.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
