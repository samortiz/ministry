   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR QUALIFICATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let me put forth a few propositions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If there is a book written by God, it must first of all mention God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It must tell you that it is from God and that its author is God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the first qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, it must carry a moral tone that is higher than what we commonly know.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If it is a fabrication, it can at the most be on the same level as man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Third, if there is such a divine book, it must tell us about the past and the future of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only God knows clearly what occurred in the past and what will happen in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only by telling us these matters will we know Him as God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Fourth, this book must be simple and available so that all may be able to secure and understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If there were only one such book in the world, then only a very few people would be able to see it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It would not pass the test unless it is a book accessible to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the United States there is a group of people who claim to have a book from God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is engraved in gold and contains only twelve pages.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such a book then would not be accessible to the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God would never write to us a book at which we could not look.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now the matter is simplified.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let us repeat these four conditions once more.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1 If such a book exists, it must tell us explicitly that its author is God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2 It must carry a high tone of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>3 It must give a detailed description of the past and the future of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>4 It must be available.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let us pick out some of the more important writings throughout human civilization and check them against these qualifications to see if any meets our requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>GOOD BOOKS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We will start from books that are generally considered to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let us take the Chinese classics of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are immediately disqualified under the first requirement, for none of them claims to be written by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They do have a high tone of morality, but they fail to give the origin and destiny of the world, the universe, and man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This does not mean that they are worthless books; it means that they do not contain the qualifications we want.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They are not what we are looking for.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us go to the classics of other cultures.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are numerous volumes of famous writings, but none of them passes the first test.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are all clearly written by man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They may be masterpieces in philosophy or morality, but they are not written by God, nor are they divinely inspired.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to set them aside.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is a book in India called the Rig-Veda.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It once dominated Hinduism.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, it does not claim to be written by God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Another book called the Avesta, written by a Persian named Zoroaster, is also extremely influential in the Middle East.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It does not claim to be from God either.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moreover, its moral tone is not especially commendable.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let us come to the Koran of Mohammedanism.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the closest one we can find.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It tells us that it comes from God; it meets the first requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, it does not fulfill the second requirement, for its moral tone is too low.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The heaven it describes is full of lusts and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God could never write a book with such licentiousness and immorality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, this book does not pass the test of morality.</S>
