   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will cover another crucial point in the practice of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This point that we want to cover is the truth concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is more crucial than any item.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, I hope we can see the preeminence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Recovery Version, Colossians 1:18 says, "That He might have the first place in all things."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, the first place is the preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The second thing we want to see is what Christ is to us, the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is very subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then we have to see what Christ is to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We also want to see the centrality and universality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is the hub, the spokes, and the rim in the big universal wheel of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ezekiel 1 refers to this wheel v. 15 . God's move in accomplishing His eternal economy is likened in the Bible to a great wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order for man to move adequately, he cannot keep himself away from the wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without the wheel, man would be limited to only walking or running.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God uses the wheel to illustrate His move in His economy on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I. THE PREEMINENCE OF CHRIST A. In the Triune Godhead</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is one yet three, and He is three but still one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Triune means three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is the three-one God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Among the Three in the Godhead, the preeminence always goes to the Second, the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The First, the Father, always exalts the Son Phil 2:9 ; and the Third, the Spirit, always testifies concerning the Son John 15:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Having the First Place in All Things</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ has the first place in all things; for in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell Col 1:18b-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fullness was pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates that the fullness must be a person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He felt happy to dwell in Jesus the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"All the fullness" refers to all the matters, all the things, and all the persons involved in and with the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Godhead is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Acts 2:23, for example, indicates that before the foundation of the world there was a council held by the Three of the Godhead concerning the Lord's crucifixion see note 1 of verse 23, Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our God is very wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is one God, yet His Godhead is in three.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the fullness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell in Christ Col 1:19; 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This fullness was involved with creation and with Christ's crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Genesis 1:1 says that in the beginning God created.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then verse 2 says that the Spirit of God was brooding over the death waters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, in verse 26 God used the pronouns us and our "Let us make man in our image."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Us and our are used to denote the divine person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First, the old creation came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then in God's resurrection, the new creation came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In both the old creation and the new creation, God's fullness was involved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In His resurrection and ascension, Christ was made preeminent.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He has the first place in the old creation and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This One in whom all the fullness was pleased to dwell has the preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He has the first place in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the Fullness of the Godhead</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Dwelling in Him Bodily</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before His incarnation, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the eternal Word, but not bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since He became incarnate, clothed with a human body, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in a bodily way, and in His glorified body Phil 3:21 now and forever it dwells.</S>
