   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When we hear the Father telling us that our sins are forgiven, we have peace and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we have not yet received the freedom of forgiveness, we are indeed poor men.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All who are sitting here today have heard that their sins are forgiven; they have peace and do not need to ask anyone or look for any other evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As long as God has said it, it is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When He says that we are forgiven, we are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Unfortunately, we only enjoy half of the happiness; we have not yet entered into God's happiness, enjoyed His happiness, and allowed Him to enjoy His happiness over us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Real worship is having the happiness which God has.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some have said it well, that worship is not just to thank Him but to consider Him as one's joy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We joy in God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is a phrase in Psalms which says that God is our exaltation's rejoicing Psa 43:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should all consider God as our exaltation's rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 24 says, "Because this son of mine was dead and lives again; he was lost and has been found.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And they began to be merry."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God says that we should be merry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What are the reasons for being merry?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are two reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first is that the son was dead and now lives.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second is that the son was lost and now is found.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why we should be merry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Being dead and living again is the son's gaining something.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Being lost and being found again is the father's gaining something.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The prodigal son was originally a son; now he becomes a son once again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Man was first created by God, but later he fell and was as good as dead.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the Lord Jesus came to save men, He caused dead men to become alive again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is to be dead and live again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not the part we emphasize today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What we will pay attention to today is to be lost and found again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are three parables in Luke 15.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the lost son.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Have you ever thought about this?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With these three losses, who do you think is the one that lost them?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We think that the lost sheep was poor, who was probably fumbling in the barren hills and the scattered rocks, and who had probably fallen into the thorny paths.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We forget that the one who lost the sheep was the shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The one who suffered was the shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The one who was poor was the shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We wonder where the lost coin was, but we forget that it was the woman who had lost the coin and it was she who suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the last parable we always think about the poor prodigal son, who wandered in destitution and longed to be satisfied with carob pods when no one would give him anything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we consider how he turned, we rejoice for the great blessing he received.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But who was the one who had lost the son?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was not the son but the father.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The poor one was the father; the suffering one was the father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was the father who had sacrificed his heart and wasted his money on his son's education.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why the father said that his son was lost and now was found, and why they began to be merry.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Have we ever thought that when we turn back and obey, God's heart will rejoice?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The highest point of the gospel is not to show us what the sinner has received but what God has obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have squandered the money, but God has suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should give ourselves totally to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How much have we given to God?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not think that it is all right to be a little cold.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to realize how much God suffers by our little coldness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not think that it is all right to love the world a little and be mixed with it a little.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to realize how much this affects God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This will cause God to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every time we come before God, consecrate ourselves to Him once again, and deny ourselves once again, God gains something, and we are giving joy to God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our personal, petty gains and losses are worth nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What counts is for God to gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is a wonderful thought that every time we choose the way of submission to God, we make His heart happy and gain something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God can create the universe, and He can give things to men.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But it is possible for Him to lose the heart of men!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God cannot force man's heart to go His way!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What a joy to consider that a God as great as ours, who is omnipotent, who has everything, and who is the Creator of everything, would want something from those who are like worms and dust!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He said, "We had to be merry and rejoice" v. 32 . The return of a prodigal son can cause God to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The God who holds the universe will rejoice at a little obedience from us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Consecration is not an imposition or concession but a way for us to enter into the joy of God; it makes God happy on account of us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How amazing this is!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>May we all enter into the joy of God today, and may we all render Him the joy.</S>
