   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A husband who loves his wife in affection may spoil her, but a father who loves his son in life never spoils his son.</S>

   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Eventually, Ephraim declares that he has no more idols.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Ephraim says, What have I yet to do with idols? v. 8a . God answers by saying, I respond and look on him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>/ I am like a green fir tree; / From Me your fruit is found v. 8b . Jehovah s being like a green fir tree symbolizing God s being living and evergreen and Ephraim s bearing fruit from Him indicates Ephraim s oneness with Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It also indicates that a wonderful transformation has taken place, based on the factor of love in life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Today God is the evergreen tree, and we, the believers in Christ, are the branches of the tree, bearing fruit out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is more than an organic union; it is the oneness of two in one life, in one nature, and in one living.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The outcome of this book is transformation in life by God s love.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the revelation in chapter fourteen of Hosea, and we all need to see it.</S>
