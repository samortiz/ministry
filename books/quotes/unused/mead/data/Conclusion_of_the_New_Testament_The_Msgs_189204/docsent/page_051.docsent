   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED THE CHURCH THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH 2 B. The Local Aspect</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every truth in the Bible has two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is also true with respect to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church has two aspects: the universal aspect and the local aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Universally, the church is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Locally, however, the church is expressed in many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the one universal church becomes the many local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is expressed in Christ, Christ is expressed in the church, and the church is expressed in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the foregoing message we covered the universal aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this message we shall go on to consider the local aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Local Churches</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the local aspect the church is expressed in many localities as many local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The one universal church expressed in many places on earth becomes the many local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The expression of the church in a locality is the local church in that particular locality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The universal church as the Body of Christ is expressed through the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The local churches, as the expressions of the one Body of Christ, are locally one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without the local churches there would be no practicality and actuality of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The universal church is realized in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Knowing the church universally must be consummated in knowing the church locally.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is a great advance for us to know and practice the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only in the local church can the church be practical.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only in the local church and by the local church can we have the practice of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not have the local church, we do not have anything practical as far as the church is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, the Bible ends with seven local churches Rev 1:10-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As believers, we are living today in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, we cannot live directly in the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is impossible for us to live in the universal church without living in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord is building up the universal church, and each one of us is living practically in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The universal church as the Body of Christ needs to have its expression.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we talk about the church without having the expression of the church, our talk is entirely theoretical; it is not practical.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For the church to be real and practical, there is the need of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you do not have the local churches, you do not have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you do not have the local church, you cannot have the universal church, for the universal church is composed of all the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As Revealed by the Lord in Matthew 18:17</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The universal church was revealed by the Lord in Matthew 16:18, but the local church was revealed by Him in Matthew 18:17.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church mentioned in this verse must be a local church because it is a place where we can go.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord said that if you have a problem with a brother, you should go to him first.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If he listens to you, the problem is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if he does not listen, you should bring one or two with you to witness to him, expecting him to listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If he still does not listen, then you should bring the problem to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This, of course, must be the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It cannot be the universal church, for we cannot bring a problem to the universal church, only to the local church.</S>
