<h2 class="head1">XII. ISRAEL BEING A LUXURIANT VINE<br />
BRINGING FORTH FRUIT FOR HIMSELF</h2>
<p>Hosea 10:1a says, &ldquo;Israel is a luxuriant vine; / He brings forth fruit for himself.&rdquo; The fruit of the vine should have been offered to God as a drink offering, but they used the vines to bring forth fruit for themselves, not for God.</p>
 <p>Verse 1b and 2 continue, &ldquo;According to the abundance of his fruit / He has multiplied altars; / According to the goodness of their land / They have made pillars well. / Their heart is divided; / Now they will be found guilty. / He will break down their altars; / He will destroy their pillars.&rdquo; Israel became rich, but they used their produce to build up altars and to make idols. Therefore, Hosea said that God would break down their altars and destroy their pillars.</p>
<p>Verse 3 says, &ldquo;For now they will say, / We have no king, / For we did not fear Jehovah; / And the king, what can he do for us?&rdquo; Because they did not fear Jehovah, they could not have God&rsquo;s deputy authority (a king). This refers to the headship, the leadership, among God&rsquo;s people. When the church is proper, the church has the headship, the leadership, representing God as His authority. But in a time of turmoil, some would say, &ldquo;Why do we need God&rsquo;s deputy authority? Why do we need to have any headship or leadership?&rdquo; This issues in anarchy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XIII. THEY SPEAKING MERE WORDS,<br />
SWEARING FALSELY WHILE MAKING A COVENANT</h2>
<p>In verses 4 through 8 we have further details concerning the idolatry of Israel against Jehovah and the punishments of Jehovah upon Israel. They spoke mere words, swearing falsely while making a covenant. Judgment sprouted forth like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field. The inhabitants of Samaria would fear for the calves (the idols) of Beth-aven (probably a contemptuous name applied to Bethel, which was a seat of idolatry&mdash;1 Kings 12:26-33; Hosea 4:15). Its people would mourn over it, and its idol priests would tremble for it, for its glory, because it had departed from it. It would be carried to Assyria: a present to King Jareb. Ephraim would be taken in shame, and Israel would be ashamed of his own counsel. Samaria would be cut off with her king and would be like sticks, or small pieces of wood, on the surface of the water. The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, would be destroyed. The thorn and the thistle would come up upon their altars, and they would &ldquo;say to the mountains, Cover us! / And to the hills, Fall on us!&rdquo; (v. 8). This is Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on Israel and on her idolatry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XIV. ISRAEL HAVING SINNED SINCE<br />
THE DAYS OF GIBEAH</h2>
<p>Israel had sinned since the days of Gibeah (v. 9a). Israel thought that the battle which took place in Gibeah against the children of iniquity could not overtake them (v. 9b; Judg. 19:15-30). But Jehovah said that He would chasten them for their &ldquo;double iniquity&rdquo; (Hosea 10:10). This double iniquity refers to Israel&rsquo;s two evils: forsaking Jehovah and turning to idols (Jer. 2:13). Israel&rsquo;s sins in their social life were due to their sin of forsaking God and turning to idols.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XV. EPHRAIM BEING A TRAINED HEIFER<br />
THAT LOVES TO TREAD THE GRAIN,<br />
BUT JEHOVAH HAVING PASSED<br />
THE YOKE OVER HER FAIR NECK</h2>
<p>Ephraim was a trained heifer that loved to tread the grain. But Jehovah had passed the yoke over her fair neck. Jehovah would make Ephraim draw the plow. Judah would plow, and Jacob would break his clods (Hosea 10:11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">XVI. THE CHARGE TO SOW<br />
UNTO RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR THEMSELVES,<br />
TO REAP ACCORDING TO LOVINGKINDNESS,<br />
AND TO BREAK UP THEIR FALLOW GROUND</h2>
<p>Verses 12 and 13 say, &ldquo;Sow unto righteousness for yourselves; / Reap according to lovingkindness; / Break up your fallow ground; / For it is time to seek Jehovah / Until He comes and rains / Righteousness on you. / You have plowed wickedness; / You have reaped injustice; / You have eaten the fruit of lying. / For you have trusted in your way, / In the multitude of your mighty men.&rdquo; This is similar to what Paul says in Galatians 6:7 and 8, where he tells us that if we sow unto the flesh, we will reap corruption of the flesh, but if we sow unto the Spirit, we will of the Spirit reap eternal life. Here in Hosea 10:12 to sow means to seek Jehovah. To seek Jehovah rightly is to sow rightly. Thus, Hosea charged the children of Israel to sow unto righteousness. If they did this, they would reap according to lovingkindness. Otherwise, if they plowed wickedness, they would reap injustice.</p>
<p>In verse 12 Hosea uses the expression &ldquo;fallow ground.&rdquo; Fallow ground is ground that has been plowed but has not been sown with anything. The children of Israel were the fallow ground. They had been plowed by God, but had not been sown with righteousness. They were to break up the fallow ground; that is, they were to seek God until Christ came as righteousness to rain righteousness upon them.</p>
<p>However, Israel did not sow properly. They trusted in their own way and in the multitude of their mighty men. Therefore, God caused them to be utterly destroyed. Regarding this, verses 14 and 15 say, &ldquo;A tumult will arise among your peoples; / And all your fortresses will be devastated, / As Shalman devastated Beth-arbel / In the day of battle: / The mother was dashed in pieces with the children. / Thus Bethel will cause this to happen to you / Because of your great evil: / At dawn the king of Israel / Will be utterly cut off.&rdquo; This was fully fulfilled by Titus in A.D. 70.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;dawn&rdquo; in verse 15 indicates that Israel was in the night, in darkness. They were a people who were altogether lacking in righteousness and justice. They forsook God and they were evil to one another.</p>
