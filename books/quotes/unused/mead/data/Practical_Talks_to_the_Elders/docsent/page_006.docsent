   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A SUBDUING ATMOSPHERE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I think those of you who were with us in those years at Elden Hall will all agree with me that the recovery then was very pure.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It had one direction, one tendency, one goal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I don t mean that all who were meeting with us had seen the focus; but the focus was there.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A good number of the saints saw, and some did not, but there was no mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This made the atmosphere convincing, even subduing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Any who came with another goal either dropped it or stopped coming.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not too many left, yet there were some who did, because they had their own goal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They would have liked to use our field to carry out their own work; when they realized there was no way, they left.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many who came, however, were subdued, convinced, and purified.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today the churches seem to have lost that convincing, subduing power, as far as the leadership is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>CARING FOR NUMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In some places there is an effort being made to build up the numbers in attendance at the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I would ask you to check whether your concern is for the meetings to be in the focus of the Lord s economy or whether it is for an increase in the number attending.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even if you simply want to have a good meeting, this may cause you to miss the focus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The focus is to have the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lord, I don t care merely for a good meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I don t care merely for numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I don t care merely for good attendance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lord, I care for Your testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brothers, if there has been an increase in attendance in your locality, that is really good.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But I would check with you, what is the focus in your locality?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is the goal of your work?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Is there a real lampstand, or just a Christian meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>DESIRING THE LEADERSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As long as you have even a little desire to be a leader, that is a debit to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brothers, as long as you have such a debit factor, you don t have the power to convince, subdue others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Elden was convincing because it was pure in God s move.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The convincing, subduing power came from a source that was pure and clean.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord s blessing is of different kinds.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The rain, according to Matthew 5:45, is for everybody.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The righteous do not get more and the unrighteous less.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord s blessing today is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many Christian groups have some blessing in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But the special blessing is not general.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These groups do not enjoy the Lord s special blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am afraid that in some of the churches in the recovery also this special blessing is lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To take the leadership, to serve the Lord, you must have a pure heart and a pure motive.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You must not try to build up a meeting just because it is in your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That is impure.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To like being the leader is impure.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To want to be the first leader is impure.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even to have a consideration that someone does not want you to be the leader is impure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As long as you have an impure heart, the blessing can only be general; it cannot be special.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Apparently you all are pure.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You sacrifice your time, your family, your home, and many other things for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet you are not absolutely pure for the focus of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>PLAYING POLITICS</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Another sign of impurity is to play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even if it is only a little, in quality it is the same; only the quantity is different.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may bring your experience in the world into the church, even into the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you do this, it is impure.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is to contaminate, to pollute, the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A WORD FOR THE FUTURE</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I want to have talk after talk with you, not messages but talks, that you may all see what the Lord wants in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Preaching the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There are lots of preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you say, Well, let s do the same thing, then there is no need for a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Teaching the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Coming together to have an assembly according to the Scripture an ekklesia, the called-out ones meeting together?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Is this all the Lord wants?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What I share with you here will be made available in printed form to the public.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The video tapes will not last as long as what is printed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It will be sent to the whole earth, not just to Orange County.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is not for the present only; it will be available for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is good that the churches preach the gospel, that they use the Life-studies, that they are doing things according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But, dear brothers, where is the focus?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Do we practice the one spirit with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do we have a vision, the prevailing, present vision, every hour controlling us, guarding us?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we do not, how can we expect the brothers and sisters in our locality to have such a vision?</S>
