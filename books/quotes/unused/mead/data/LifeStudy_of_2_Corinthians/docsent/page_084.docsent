   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO THE MANIFESTATION OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH THE KILLING OF THE CROSS 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:1-18</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that 2 Corinthians 3 is a chapter on doctrine and that 2 Corinthians 4 is a chapter on experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, we saw that what Paul speaks of in chapter four is a confirmation from his experience of what he says concerning the ministry in chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For each of the major points regarding the ministry in chapter three, there is a corresponding point in chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, life corresponds to the Spirit, renewing to transformation, and the weight of glory to the degrees of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But what corresponds to righteousness in 2 Corinthians 3?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to answer this question properly, we need to say a further word about righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>EVERYTHING IN GOOD ORDER</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Righteousness refers to a condition, a state, where everything is in good order.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Where there is righteousness, there is no disturbance, confusion, or mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, in a church meeting we often can see righteousness, for in the meeting everything is right and in good order.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a result, the meeting is in a condition, a state, of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But suppose the brothers are arguing, the sisters are upset, and the children are running around the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What turmoil there would be!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In that kind of a situation, a condition of turmoil, there would not be any righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Righteousness refers to a state where everything is in good order.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second Peter 3:13 says, Nevertheless, we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The righteousness dwelling in the new heaven and the new earth indicates that everything will be in proper order, that nothing will be wrong, upset, or in turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead of turmoil and confusion, there will be peace and order.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the sight of God, such a state is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The entire condition in the new heavens and the new earth will be righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nothing will be disorderly; rather, everything will be in good order.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This orderly condition is a condition of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 4:8 Paul speaks of being afflicted in every way, or of being attacked from every side.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But no matter how much he was afflicted or attacked, with him there was no turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, there was the manifestation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This manifestation of life produced a condition of peace and calm.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose you are troubled on every side by your husband or wife, by your children, and by your in-laws.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, instead of being disturbed or in turmoil, you manifest life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that life comes out of you in that situation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a result, your condition will be one of peace and order.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In spite of the trouble that comes to you from every side, you remain in such an orderly and peaceful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The processed Spirit, the cooked Spirit, within you experienced as life calms down the whole situation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 4:8 and 9 Paul speaks of being afflicted, perplexed, persecuted, and cast down.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We would expect such a situation to result in turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if you find yourself in that kind of situation and yet everything becomes calm and orderly, that is the manifestation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, that orderly state is a state of righteousness.</S>
