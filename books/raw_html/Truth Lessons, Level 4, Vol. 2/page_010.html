<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<h2 class="head1">I. JACOB PROPHESYING WITH BLESSING</h2>
<p>According to the record in Genesis, the human race began with Adam and continued with Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Eventually, Jacob became the father of a house that was chosen by God. This house, the house of Jacob (46:27), was composed of Jacob&rsquo;s twelve sons. Later these twelve sons became the twelve tribes of the nation of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jacob&rsquo;s Words Being Prophecy<br />
as Well as Blessing</h2>
<p>The mature, strong, and weighty Jacob called his sons together when he was dying and said, &ldquo;Gather yourselves together that I may tell you what will happen to you in the last days&rdquo; (49:1). This indicates that Genesis 49 contains an important prophecy. In fact, this portion of the Word can be said to be the deepest prophecy in the Bible. Jacob&rsquo;s words to his twelve sons are &ldquo;what their father spoke to them when he blessed them; he blessed them, each one according to his blessing&rdquo; (v. 28). Although this chapter is a prophecy, it is a prophecy saturated with blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Jacob&rsquo;s Prophecies with Blessing Being Poetry</h2>
<p>The prophecies with blessing uttered by Jacob are poetry. We need to use allegories and signs in order to probe into the depths of their meaning because the poetic language is significant and descriptive.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Jacob&rsquo;s Prophecies Being<br />
the Conclusion of Genesis and<br />
Being Developed in the Remainder<br />
of the Old Testament and in the New Testament</h2>
<p>The prophecies in Genesis 49 are the conclusion of the book of Genesis. They are also the basis of the remainder of the Old Testament and the New Testament. This chapter of the Bible is a very rich seed that undergoes a marvelous development in the rest of the Scriptures. The prophecies in Genesis 49 are not only related to Jacob&rsquo;s twelve sons. They are also closely related to the experience of the New Testament believers because the house of Israel typifies the church, and the church is God&rsquo;s house today.</p>
<p>Jacob&rsquo;s first six prophecies concern Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Zebulun, and Issachar&mdash;the sons born of Leah, Jacob&rsquo;s proper wife. The last six concern Dan, Gad, Asher, and Naphtali&mdash;the sons born of Bilhah and Zilpah, Jacob&rsquo;s two female servants&mdash;and also Joseph and Benjamin&mdash;the sons born of Rachel, Jacob&rsquo;s beloved wife. In this lesson we will look at Jacob&rsquo;s first six prophecies with blessing.</p>
