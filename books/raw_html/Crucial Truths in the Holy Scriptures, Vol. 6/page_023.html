	 <h2 class="head1">HIS NATURE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The devil has sinned from the beginning&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:8).</p>
<p>The devil has sinned from the beginning, so his nature and essence are sin. The sins that he committed in the beginning were thinking of himself, including his own beauty, glory, and honor; becoming proud by thinking of himself; wanting to uplift himself because of his pride; and rebelling against God and wanting to usurp God&rsquo;s position as the Most High because of his desire to uplift himself. His words <em>I will</em> were spoken entirely out of himself, according to his will, and completely denied God&rsquo;s authority. This is the principle of his sin. Even today he is working to incite men to sin according to this principle. He is operating according to this principle to cause people to sin in the same way that he sinned in the beginning. He causes men to become proud in their thoughts concerning themselves so that they will usurp and deny God&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He is a liar&rdquo;</strong> (John 8:44).</p>
<p>The devil is a liar by nature; therefore, lying is part of his nature and essence. Lying involves falsehood, so his nature involves falsehood. Everything that he says and does is designed to cheat people. Even if he speaks of matters related to the truth, his false intentions make his speaking a lie. Even if he does something that seems right, his false intentions make his actions a lie. He speaks lies out of himself and out of his nature. He is the father of all liars; he is the source of all who lie and are false. All lying and falsehood come from him (Matt. 5:37).</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;He was a murderer from the beginning&rdquo;</strong> (John 8:44).</p>
<p>The devil was a murderer from the beginning. Murder is part of his nature and essence. All the murder and hate throughout the history of the human race come from this evil one whose nature is murder.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HIS NAMES</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The great dragon&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 12:9).</p>
<p>There are many names for the devil in the Bible, and all his names are meaningful. All the names for the devil in the Bible reveal something about him. The most frightening of his names is the great dragon. This name shows that he is cruel and vicious. He is a great dragon in the universe, cruel and vicious, putting fear into people.</p>
<p>The dragon is not only a name for the devil but also a symbol of him. The devil likes people to use his symbol on everything. In idol temples there are dragons on many things. People all over the world and throughout all the ages have been attracted to dragons. Some get dragon tattoos or wear dragons on their clothes. Some have dragons on the implements in their homes. It seems as if there is almost no place without the symbol of a dragon. The devil likes this practice, but believers should have no part in it.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The ancient serpent&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 12:9).</p>
<p>In the Bible the name of the great dragon is paired with the name of the ancient serpent. This name shows that he is devious and crafty. The Bible says that the serpent was the most crafty of all the creatures (Gen. 3:1). In the beginning the serpent was very beautiful to look at. When the devil came to tempt Eve, he came in the form of a serpent. Today the devil still comes in the form of people or things that are like serpents in principle. He uses them to tempt and trap people. He is an ancient serpent who is devious, crafty, and difficult to withstand.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The Devil&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:2).</p>
<p>The Bible often calls the devil, the Devil. This is his true name. The meaning of this name in the original Greek language is &ldquo;accuser,&rdquo; or &ldquo;slanderer,&rdquo; and it speaks of his character and actions. He is always accusing us before God and encouraging us to blaspheme God. Sometimes the devil carries out his accusation and slander from within us, and sometimes he uses the people around us. His name truly reflects what he is&mdash;an accuser and a slanderer of God and man.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Satan&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:2).</p>
<p>The Bible also calls the devil Satan. Satan means &ldquo;adversary.&rdquo; The devil is God&rsquo;s adversary. From the day he rebelled, he has opposed God in everything in the universe. God will completely deal with him in the future. Even within us, he influences us to oppose God. Any inward opposition or rebellion toward God within us is the result of Satan&rsquo;s operation in us.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;The ruler of this world&rdquo;</strong> (John 12:31; 16:11; see also 14:30).</p>
<p>The Bible also calls the devil the ruler of this world because the devil is the leader of the rulers of the world today (Eph. 6:12; 2:2). The world today is completely under the devil&rsquo;s control; it is dark and evil. The devil is the ruler of this dark and evil world.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;The god of this age&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 4:4).</p>
<p>The Bible also calls the devil the god of this age because in this age the devil receives worship and service from man. <em>The ruler of this world</em> refers to his control over people; <em>the god of this age</em> refers to the worship that he receives from people. In this age he hides behind idols and things to receive worship and service from people. Every idol worshipper is worshipping and serving the devil behind the idol.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;The evil one&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:12; 5:19).</p>
<p>The Bible calls the devil the evil one because he is evil. The devil is evil; he is the evil one in the universe. Therefore, his designation as the evil one truly fits him.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;He is a liar and the father of it&rdquo;</strong> (John 8:44).</p>
<p>The devil is called the father of lies because all lies come from him. Every liar is his child (1 John 3:10).</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;The tempter&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 4:3).</p>
<p>The devil tempts people in all things. Therefore, the Bible calls him the tempter.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;The ruler of the authority of the air&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:2).</p>
<p>This dark world today is ruled by a group of evil spirits in the air (6:12), and the devil is their ruler. Therefore, the Bible calls him the ruler of the authority of the air.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;Beelzebul, ruler of the demons&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 12:24).</p>
<p>The devil is called ruler of the demons because he rules over all the demons. The Bible calls him Beelzebul, which means &ldquo;the lord of the dunghill.&rdquo; This name contains a contemptuous reference to Beelzebub, or Baal-zebub, the god of the Ekronites (2 Kings 1:2), which means &ldquo;the lord of flies.&rdquo; This tells us that demons are dirty and unclean. The demons under his rule are like a dunghill and flies. Both a dunghill and flies are filthy. This is the nature of the demons who are under the devil. The devil is their filthy ruler.</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;Adversary&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 5:8; see also Matt. 13:28, 39).</p>
<p>The devil is God&rsquo;s enemy and always fights against God&rsquo;s children, so the Bible calls him the adversary.</p>
<p><strong>13. &ldquo;Belial&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 6:15).</p>
<p>Belial is another name for the devil in the Bible. Belial means &ldquo;worthless, filthy, and lawless.&rdquo; These adjectives describe the condition of the devil, which is the exact opposite of the honorable, holy, and lawful condition of Christ.</p>
