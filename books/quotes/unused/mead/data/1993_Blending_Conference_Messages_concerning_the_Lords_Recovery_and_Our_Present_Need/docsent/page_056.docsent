   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many so-called good, spiritual, heavenly sisters have the habit of looking at the newspaper Saturday morning for sales so that they can go shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They may realize within that this is not of the Lord and that they do not need what they are going to buy, but they still go shopping anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a small thing that is seemingly easy to overcome, but most of the time they are defeated in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But when the Antichrist is ruling during the great tribulation, he will threaten people with death if they do not worship him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In a sense, such a great thing could be easier for us to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you refuse to worship him, you will be martyred immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You will not have the time to consider as you do when you are about to go shopping for things on sale.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whatever the case, though, we all have to overcome so that we can be matured.</S>
