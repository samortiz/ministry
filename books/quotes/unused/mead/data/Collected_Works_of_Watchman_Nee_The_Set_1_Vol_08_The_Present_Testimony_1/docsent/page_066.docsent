   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This tells us that a stranger can also be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today, if there is anyone here who has not believed in the Lord, if you are willing to be circumcised, you can be the same as the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CIRCUMCISION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The significance of circumcision is to put off the lust of the flesh.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps your outward behavior is quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yet inwardly, you love the world, and in your heart you commit the sins which the immoral commit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Are you inwardly envious of others' houses, cattle, servants, or wives?</S>

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The foregoing verses of the Old Testament lay considerable stress on the circumcision of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is even more emphasis in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Romans 2:28 and 29 are most apparent.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They clearly tell us that circumcision is not outward in the flesh but inward of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not in the letter but in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What God spoke to Abraham was only the circumcision of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today God has gone a step further.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now all must be circumcised in the heart.</S>

   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God's promise to Abraham was prior to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What we receive came before the law.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If any pride or envy is in our hearts and if they are not put off, we have no share in the covenant of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Instead, we will be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we talk about the meaning of circumcision, if we just stop here, we are preaching the law and not the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Thank and praise God that we have the gospel; we have a way to put off the lust of our heart.</S>
