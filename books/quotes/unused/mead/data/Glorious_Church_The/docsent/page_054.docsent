   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FALL OF BABYLON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Of the two women spoken of in Revelation 17:1-3 and 21:9-10, one is called the great harlot, and the other is called the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 17:1 says, "And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits upon the many waters."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Revelation 21:9 says, "And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Revelation 17:3 says, "And he carried me away in spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Revelation 21:10 says, "And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the Holy Spirit inspired man to write the Scriptures, He purposely used a parallel structure in pointing to these two women so that we would have a clear impression.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us first consider the things relating to the harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The harlot spoken of in Revelation 17 and 18 is Babylon, whose deeds are extremely displeasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why is her conduct such an offense to God?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What does Babylon represent and what is the principle of Babylon?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why does God deal with Babylon and why is it necessary to wait until Babylon is judged before the wife of the Lamb appears?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May God open our eyes so that we would really see Babylon according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The name Babylon originates from "Babel."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We remember the story of the tower of Babel in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The principle of the tower of Babel involves the attempt to build up something from earth to reach unto heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When men built this tower, they used bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is a basic difference between brick and stone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Stone is made by God, and bricks are made by man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Bricks are a human invention, a human product.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The meaning of Babylon relates to man's own efforts to build a tower to reach unto heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Babylon represents man's ability.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It represents a false Christianity, a Christianity which does not allow the Holy Spirit to have authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It does not seek the Holy Spirit's guidance; it does all things by human effort.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everything consists of bricks baked by man; everything depends upon man's action.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who are according to this principle do not see that they are limited; rather, they attempt to do the Lord's work by their own natural ability.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They do not stand in a position where they are truly able to say, "Lord, if You do not give us grace, we cannot do anything."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They think that man's ability can suffice for spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their intention is to establish something upon the earth that will reach to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God, however, can never accept this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One man has some talent and thinks that he can preach after he has studied a little theology.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Bricks!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Another man who is very clever receives some help and possesses some knowledge and then becomes a Christian worker.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Again, what is this?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Bricks!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A certain man is capable of doing things, so he is asked to come and manage the affairs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Bricks!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All of these things are man's endeavors to build something from earth to heaven by human ability, by bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Again we must emphasize that there is no place for man in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Heavenly things can only come from heaven; the things of this earth can never go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man's difficulty is that he does not see that he is under judgment, nor does he see that he is just dust and clay.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Man may build high, but heaven is higher than man's highest height.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No matter how high men may build their tower, they still cannot touch heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Heaven is always above man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Though man may climb and build and though he may not fall, he still will not be able to touch heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God destroyed man's plan to build the tower of Babel in order to show man that he is useless in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Man cannot do anything.</S>
