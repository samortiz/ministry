   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We should not think that the universe is so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are speaking of things which are not visible to the eyes of worldly people, but they are visible to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is why Paul, before sharing this portion of the Word, prayed, asking the Father to give His people a spirit of wisdom and revelation that they may have the full knowledge of Him Eph 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What Paul spoke in Ephesians 1 cannot be understood by the people of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even I am greatly concerned that among the Christians, very few are clear in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many do not even admit that they have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How poor this is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But Paul prayed, "Father, give Your chosen people a spirit of wisdom to understand and of revelation to see."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need a spirit of wisdom to understand all these mysterious things and a spirit of revelation to see them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Formerly, we may have been veiled concerning God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now the veil has been taken away and a revelation has been presented to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can see that in this universe there are four layers of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The bottom layer is Hades, the second layer is the earth with all the troubling persons, and the third layer is the air with Satan's power of darkness and all his rebellious angels.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The good angels are also there, and the Bible tells us that they sometimes fight with the bad angels Dan 10:13, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The highest layer is the third heaven, which was polluted by Satan's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ transcended far above all the layers of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>America spent billions of dollars to build something to land on the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But compared to where Christ landed in His ascension, landing at the moon is like taking one step on a very high stairway.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul prayed that we would see the surpassing greatness of God's power which operated in Christ to raise Him from the dead out of Hades and to seat Him on high at God's right hand in the heavenlies vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ died; He was there in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But after three days He came out of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then He transcended through the heavens, and He is sitting on the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By doing this He is above all the rulers, authorities, power, and lordship, good ones and bad ones among the human race and also among the angelic race.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is above all names in this age and in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These names include yours and mine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I was opposing Christ for some time, but one day I was subdued by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many of us are ex-opposers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all were subdued by Him because He transcended above all of us in His transcending power.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This power subjected all the things under His feet v. 22a and gave Him a gift for Him to be the Head over all things v. 22b . Now Christ is sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has come out of Hades, and He is above all the things on the earth and in the air, and He is higher than the heavens with all things subjected under His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is the Head over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What a picture!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who can resist this Head of all things who has become the very Head of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Who can oppose this One?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And who can oppose His Body, the built-up church?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is why He said in Matthew 16, "I will build My church."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is building the church in His heavenly ministry as He is sitting on the throne with all things subjected under His feet as the Head over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The gates of Hades cannot prevail against such a built-up church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>History tells us that the Caesars, including Nero, rose up against Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Later, Hitler and Mussolini were opposing Christ, but they were defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Who is prevailing today?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The transcending Christ and the Body of this Christ are prevailing today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I was raised up by the Lord as a little servant to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But from the first day that I rose up to speak for Him in His recovery, opposition came.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before that day people warmly welcomed me to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But a number of my inviting friends became my opposers when I took the Lord's way in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The denominations rose up against me in my city.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have also experienced opposition from the political circle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the Japanese invaded China, I was arrested and put into their prison twice.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The second time I was in prison for thirty days.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At that time it was nothing for the invading army of Japan to kill a Chinese person, but the Lord preserved me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Later, I came to this country, and I put out messages on Christ as the Spirit and on our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then some evil books were published to oppose these truths.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The opposition is always there to try to blockade us, but Christ has transcended.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord's recovery is still going on, and the Lord will not stop until He has accomplished His purpose according to His heart's desire.</S>
