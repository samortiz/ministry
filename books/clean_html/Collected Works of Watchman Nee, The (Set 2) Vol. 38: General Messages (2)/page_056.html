<h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, although the breastplate is something in the Old Testament and there are differences in outward form between the Old Testament and the New Testament, God works according to the same principle in both testaments. The things in the Old Testament are shadows, while the things in the New Testament are realities. Yet the New Testament realities are the same in principle as the things in the Old Testament. Therefore, God's way of revelation to His people is the same as His way of revelation to His children. When one, two, three, or five of God's children are humble and fearful before the Lord and when they discover some problems among God's children or His Word is not clear among them, what should they do? They have to learn to shoulder and embrace God's children and inquire for them before God. Paul was one who shouldered God's believers and had the churches of God on his heart (2 Cor. 11:28-29). When he went before God with a breastplate of judgment, God's light shined. He saw the one who sinned in Corinth, and he also comprehended the word of spiritual mystery which he wrote to the church in Ephesus. Why was Paul able to write and present God's way so clearly before the churches of God? He was not ignorant or unconcerned about the affairs of God's children, nor did he receive light in a cloister while praying as a hermit. This was not Paul's way. He had the churches of God and His children upon his shoulders and breast. He came to God with a fearful heart, and the Father of light shined on him and revealed the needs of the churches which he was shouldering and embracing. Therefore, his letter to the church in Corinth was what the church in Corinth needed, and his letter to the church in Ephesus was what the church in Ephesus needed. Paul wrote his letters to the churches according to the same principle as the high priest who sought God's light with the breastplate of judgment. The affairs of the churches of God were upon Paul's shoulders and upon his heart. Paul was not nonchalant about the affairs of the churches, nor did he pray mindlessly. He did not casually pray a few words and then write to the church in a particular place and then pray another casual prayer and write to another church. Paul did not do this, and no saint should do this. We have to understand the principle of bringing the Lord's saints into the presence of God. Paul brought the children of God with him as he looked to the Lord for many days. When he saw something in God's light, he wrote a letter based on that light. On another day he would see something else in God's light, and then write another letter based on that light. Brothers and sisters, in order to understand God's will and way for His people and for the church, there must be some who will shoulder God's children and embrace them, bring them into God's presence, read their condition in God's light, and then write down what they have received before the Lord. This is the way God reveals Himself to His children in the church.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>The affairs of the church are decided by the principle of the breastplate of judgment. The experienced, God-fearing, and godly ones among God's people should shoulder and embrace His children and bring them to the Lord. They should read their condition in the light of God and make judgments accordingly. Decisions in the church are not made through the dictates of one or two men. This is not God's way. You may ask, "Did not the churches at the time of the apostles obey the apostles?" Yes, they did. But the apostles first brought the people of God to His presence and asked for His revelation. They did not dictate their orders like a pope.</p><p>The affairs of a church are not carried out by one or two men giving all the orders and the rest going along with the orders. Should the affairs then be decided by a vote of hands? No, that is not God's way either. Then what is the proper way? The elders in the church should bring the condition of the children of God to Him and inquire about them. The elders are the matured ones among God's children. Being advanced in years does not make a person an elder. Spiritual experience and condition distinguish one as an elder. An elder must be godly and know the condition of the brothers and sisters. When a problem or doubt arises in the church, a decision is not made by one person or by a vote of hands. The elders have to bring the condition of the brothers and sisters before the Lord; they have to go before the Lord with the saints' situations, discuss them, and seek common guidance for them. Although we cannot guarantee that the outcome will be a hundred percent right, we can say that it will be difficult for them to err. We have to remember that once God's people become a corporate entity, His method of revelation changes. Thereafter, God reveals Himself through His people; He places His heart's desire within His people. In fact, His speaking is His echo to His people. Before the elders speak, God has put something within the brothers and sisters already. When the elders bring the brothers and sisters to the Lord and read their condition, they see a message which God has revealed within the brothers and sisters. This message is the present need of God's children; it is also God's need among them. Only this kind of message will touch God; only this kind of message will touch the children of God, and only this kind of message will touch God within all of them. God reveals Himself through His children. Hence, decisions in the church are not made by a few people nor by a show of hands, but through a group of elders who uphold the people of God in His presence in a fearful way, asking God for His enlightening and revelation. This is the way that God guides His children in the church. The elders in the church should learn to know God's will and to understand the condition of His children and always have them in their hearts. Once a problem arises, they should bring His children to His light and read His mind concerning the solution to the problem. The Epistles in the New Testament were written according to this principle. The writers of the Epistles understood the mind of God and the condition of all the churches. Their hearts were with the affairs of the churches, and when they received some light from the Lord, they wrote it down. As a result, no word was wasted. These written words became God's revelation and His Word.</p><p>When we do not judge according to this principle, we fall into error eight or nine times out of ten. Often God's servants see light and truth through the brothers and sisters. God's servants often receive divine revelation through the ones with whom they have fellowship. Often we receive God's word when brothers and sisters are around us; when they are not around us, we do not have God's word. In deciding any matter in the church, we must follow this principle. In this way we will be preserved and not fall into error.</p>
