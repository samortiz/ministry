<h2 class="head2">Prayer</h2><p>O Lord, we stand before You beseeching You to speak again. Man is empty and cannot do anything. We can only ask for Your grace to open our eyes. Every time we open our mouths or make decisions, cause us to come before You and ask if our decision is according to right and wrong or according to the inward leading of life. Lord, cause us to see the difference between what is spiritual and what is fleshly. Cause us to really see the difference between inward light and outward law. Lord, save us from the way of death. Lord, it is wrong for us to live by discerning right from wrong. May we see that discerning right from wrong is sin and death, because only those who live in death can do this. Those who live in life must be led by life. It must be the life that takes the lead. Lord, be among us so that we would see this clearly. We have said this many times, and we want to say it again: May Your Word not be spoken in vain. Cause us to know what life is and what law is. Bless these scattered utterances. Have mercy on us, and grace us. Lead us in the way before us. In the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen.</p><p>Watchman Nee</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT TESTIMONY<br />(The Testimony has been combined with this publication.)</h2><p>THEME: Messages specifically on life.</p><p>CONTENTS: The contents describe the light we received before God and the lessons we learned in order to help God's children have practical growth in the aspect of life.</p><p>FREQUENCY: Irregular.</p><p>PRICE: Not for sale.</p><p>SUBSCRIPTIONS: Anyone wishing to subscribe to this publication should clearly write his name, address, and the number of copies requested and send it to the Periodical Subscription Department, Gospel Book Room, P.
