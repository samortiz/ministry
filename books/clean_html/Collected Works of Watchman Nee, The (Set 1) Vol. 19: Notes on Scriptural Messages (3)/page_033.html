<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Fourth Presumption</H2><P>Our brothers say that the disciples in the Gospels all refer to Jewish disciples, and not to the church, because the church was not formed until Pentecost. The disciples were Jewish disciples, whereas we are Christians; therefore, what the Lord said in the four Gospels has nothing to do with us Christians. Only the Epistles, and only the Epistles written by Paul in prison have something to do with us.</P><P>Why do they say this? It is because in the four Gospels the Lord always says to watch and prepare for His coming back, and that if one does not, he will be left behind when the Lord comes back. Since they advocate that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation, they can only push the Lord's warnings to the disciples in the four Gospels upon the so-called Jewish disciples. In the four Gospels, the Lord never said that all of the saved ones would be raptured at once. The Lord always said that only the watchful and prepared ones would be raptured. They know that the whole church is composed of saved ones, but not all are watchful and prepared. Therefore, if the whole church is to be raptured before the tribulation, they must prove that the commandments to watch and be prepared are not for the church. In this way, the church will not be divided into two groups—the watchful ones and the unwatchful ones, the prepared ones and the unprepared ones. Otherwise, they cannot get over this big obstacle. We can prove that it is a presumption to say that the disciples are not Christians. Were not the twelve disciples Christians? We say yes, and we have the following reasons:</P><P>(1) If the twelve disciples were not Christians, why does the Bible pay so much attention to transitional matters? Matthew has twenty-eight chapters, Mark has sixteen chapters. If one says the four Gospels are for the so-called Jewish disciples, why does the Bible use so many chapters to record the transitional matters, yet use a few books that have only a few short chapters to record the things concerning the Christians?</P><P>(2) It is true that at that time the disciples were Jews. But at the time of Pentecost, were they not still this same group of people? Were not those who were called the pillars of the church the same group of people? Even though the designation might be different, were they not the same group of people? Before Pentecost and before the church was established, had not the Lord already chosen them? Did not the Lord cultivate these ones to be seeds, to be the foundation? Did not the Lord especially intend for them to bear the responsibility in the church? Suppose a certain person intends to open a department store. Before he opens it, he trains a group of people in advance, teaching them the general knowledge of commerce. After the store opens, can this group of people say that the training they had previously received cannot be used any longer? It is true that the church was not yet established, but can we say that the teachings received before this cannot be used, and that only what Paul has written is useful? Can we set aside all the words of instructions and warnings given by the Lord? (Of course, we admit that in the Gospels many times the Lord Jesus spoke to the disciples as Jews. We will speak about this in detail in Study on Matthew. At present, it suffices to say just a word of distinction: with regard to things of the environment, the Lord regarded His disciples as Jews; with regard to spiritual things, the Lord regarded His disciples as the church.)</P><P>(3) Does the Bible say explicitly that the disciples were Christians? Acts 11:26 says, "The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch." Does this not mean that the disciples were Christians? Moreover, the name Christian was the name others used to mock the disciples at that time. They put this name upon the disciples to mock them for being like Christ. Can we say that because a person has two names he is then two persons? Can we say that since the disciples were later called Christians, that everything related to them when they were called disciples is not related to them as Christians? The disciples were the Christians; they were the church.</P><P>(4) Another evidence is Matthew 28:19: "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." Here it says to disciple all the nations. This means that all the saved persons in this world are disciples, and that the Jews are not the only ones who are disciples. The term "all the nations" is the same as "Gentiles" in the original text. The nations spoken of in Matthew are the Gentiles. These ones say that the disciples are the Jews, but the Bible and the Lord say that among the disciples there are not only Jews, but Gentiles also. Therefore, the words that the Lord spoke to the Jewish disciples in the four Gospels are also for the Gentile disciples, because the Gentiles, as well as the Jews, were the disciples of the Lord Jesus.</P><P>From this we see that the words that the Lord Jesus spoke to His disciples concerning watching and preparing were spoken to all the Christians. Therefore, everyone who does not watch and prepare as the Lord commanded is liable to suffer loss at the Lord's coming. Thus, how can the whole church—watching or not watching, prepared or not prepared—be raptured before the tribulation?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Fifth Presumption</H2><P>Our brothers say that all the words, that is, all the teachings, spoken by the Lord in the four Gospels were for the Jews. (Mr. Scofield said that Matthew 5—7 uplifts the law to a most fearful position.)</P><P>Now we want to consider if the Lord's words were to those under the law, or to the Christians.</P>
