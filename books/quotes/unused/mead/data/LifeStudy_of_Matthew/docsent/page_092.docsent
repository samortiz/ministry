   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Wide Gate and the Broad Way</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Leading to Destruction and Many Entering It</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 13 the Lord said, For the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Destruction here does not refer to the perdition of the person, but to the destruction of his deeds and works 1 Cor 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is no doubt that today s Christianity leads people to destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Time will prove that this is true.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By the Lord s mercy, I will never take the way of Christianity, because deep in me I have the conviction that it is a broad way leading to destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the narrow gate and the constricted way lead to life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you take the way of Christianity, the broad way, your spirit will become deadened immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, everything you do will be destroyed, for that broad way leads to destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not my opinion; it is the word of the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1 Corinthians 3:10 Paul says that he has laid the foundation, which is Christ, and that others are building upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul then says, Let each one take heed how he builds upon it, for we may build upon this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, or with wood, hay, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verses 13 through 15 Paul says, The fire itself will test each one s work, of what sort it is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If anyone s work which he has built upon it shall remain, he shall receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If anyone s work shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but he shall be saved, yet so as through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In these verses Paul seems to be saying, Take heed how you are building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you build with gold, silver, and precious stones, you will be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the work on the constricted way which leads to a living reward in life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, Paul also seems to be saying, If your work is of wood, hay, and stubble, it will be burned by fire, and you will not receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, such a work will result in destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may claim to be a Christian worker, but what kind of material are you building with?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From these verses in 1 Corinthians 3 we see that not only those who build theaters and gambling casinos will be led to destruction, but also those who build Christian cathedrals and chapels.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fire will try the nature of your work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If your work is of wood, hay, and stubble, it is certainly on the broad way leading to destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because we are not on the broad way, but on the constricted way, there are many things that we cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I would rather have an ounce of gold than many pounds of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not want to have a huge pile of wood, hay, and stubble, for that will only result in a larger fire.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I would rather have a small amount of gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although we want to see the increase in all the churches, we do not want the increase on the broad way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, we want the increase on the constricted way, the increase of gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we have this kind of increase, the Lord will have a testimony on the constricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Narrow Gate and the Constricted Way Leading to Life and Few Finding It</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 14 says, For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads to life, and few are those who find it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Life here refers to the ever blessed condition of the kingdom, which is filled with the eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This life is in the reality of the kingdom today and will be in the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age 19:29; Luke 18:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Lord s recovery today we are taking the constricted way which leads to life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>B. Discerning the False Prophets by Their Fruit</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 15 says, Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep s clothing, but within are ravenous wolves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As we are taking the constricted way, we must discern who the false prophets are.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that on the constricted way we must be alert for any kind of falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord said regarding the false prophets, By their fruits you shall know them v. 16 . We know a prophet not by his talk, preaching, or work, but by his fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All Christians today are accustomed to being influenced by people s talk.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>An eloquent speaker with enticing words is able to seduce many.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not listen to eloquent speech or to enticing words.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, wait and see what kind of fruit is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the way to discern whether a prophet is true or false.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church is going on, and the Lord s testimony is spreading throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because the doors are wide open, some self-appointed prophets may try to come in, claiming that they know certain things and can do certain works.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Let them say whatever they will, for we shall look to the Lord to prove them by their fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to apply this principle to every such case.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not listen to eloquent speech, but consider the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every good tree produces goodly fruit, but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Every tree that does not produce goodly fruit will be cut down and cast into the fire 7:17-19 .</S>
