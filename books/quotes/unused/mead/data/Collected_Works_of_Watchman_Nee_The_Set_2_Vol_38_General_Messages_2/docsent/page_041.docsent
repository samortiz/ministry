   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE THE KEY TO PRAYER Scripture Reading: Matt 7:8; Isa 62:6-7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer is a matter of great importance in the spiritual life of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every true Christian realizes this and prays.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, even though some of the Lord's children spend time praying over many matters, they do not seem to get through in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It seems as if they have not found the way to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is because they have not discovered the key.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In whatever we do, we must first have the key, the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we want to enter a room and the door is locked, we will not find the way in unless we possess the key.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Suppose we need two people to carry a table through a door.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some may do it without a problem; but others may do it awkwardly, bumping and banging it in a vain effort to get it through the door.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The size of the table and the width of the door is the same; the only difference is with the people who are carrying the table.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some have the key to carrying the table, while others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>People who have found the key do things well; they are able workers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once a person gets the key, he can do things twice as fast as others do, while those who do not have the key labor in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The same principle applies to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Matthew 7 speaks of principles relating to prayer, one of which is, "He who seeks finds" v. 8 . Seeking requires effort.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Anyone who looks in a half-hearted, leisurely manner will probably not find anything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Seeking involves patience and perseverance, and unless we are thorough, we will not find what we seek.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If God does not answer our prayers, we must exercise patience and diligently seek the key to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God answered the prayers of many of the saints in the past because they had the key to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By reading the biography of George M ller, the one who founded a number of orphanages, we can see that he was a man of prayer; throughout his entire life, he was always receiving answers to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>George M ller had discovered the key.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many earnest Christians pray at great length; they pray wordy prayers, but they do not receive answers from God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In prayer, words are essential, but our words must be to the point; they should be words that touch the heart of God and move Him so that He has no alternative but to grant our requests.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Words that are to the point are the key to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These kinds of words match God's will, and He cannot but respond to them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let us find the key to prayer from a few scriptural illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>ABRAHAM'S PRAYER FOR SODOM</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>GENESIS 18:16-33</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When God made known to Abraham that He was about to execute judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah for their wickedness, Abraham waited before God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then he began to pray for Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He did not just open his mouth and say, "O God, have mercy on Sodom and Gomorrah!"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He did not beseech God with great intensity, saying, "Oh, forbid that Sodom and Gomorrah should be destroyed!"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Abraham laid hold of the fact that God is a righteous God Gen 18:25 ; this was the key to his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In deep humility and with great earnestness, he proceeded to ask God one question after another.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His questions were his prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As he proceeded in prayer, he stood steadfastly on the ground of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At length he said, "Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there" v. 32 . Following this he did not ask or make any more requests.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After God answered, we are told that "the Lord went his way" v. 33 . Abraham did not try to hold on to God; he did not try to go on praying.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He returned to his place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some people may think that Abraham should have continued beseeching God and that he should not have stopped with just ten people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, the Scriptures show that Abraham knew God, and he knew the key to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He heard the Lord say, "The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and...their sin is very grievous...the cry of it...is come unto me" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If there were not even ten righteous people in a city, what kind of a city was it?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord loves righteousness and hates lawlessness Heb 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He cannot cover sin and refrain from judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was the awful consequence of their sin, and it was the manifestation of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When He overthrew those cities, He did no injustice to a single righteous person; He "rescued righteous Lot, who had been oppressed by the licentious manner of life of the lawless" 2 Pet 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Abraham's prayer was to the point, and it was answered.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There was no unrighteousness with God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He did not "slay the righteous with the wicked" Gen 18:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We worship and we praise Him.</S>
