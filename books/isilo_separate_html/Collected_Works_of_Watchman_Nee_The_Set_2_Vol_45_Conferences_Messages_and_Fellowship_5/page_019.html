Yet in actual experience, many Christians do not believe that God is in us as a law. If I let go of my keys and at the same time try my best to push them downward, this means that I do not believe in the force of gravity. This is the way many people live their Christian life. They strive with the sweat of their whole body to do good. They struggle strenuously and forcefully to be a Christian, but they still fail. It is a hard thing to try to muster one's will to act spiritual. It is also a hard task to act serious out of fear of becoming unspiritual. Such performances are not the conduct of a genuine Christian. When I was in London, I asked Brother Sparks about a certain person. He told me that this person was too serious. He meant that he was propping himself up with his will; he was trying to maintain a spiritual fa&#231;ade. Once the fa&#231;ade falls, however, everything falls apart.</p><p>If anyone tries to solve his problem by the will and thinks that he can deal with his problems as long as he has a strong will, he will experience what Paul experienced in Romans 7:24: "Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?" All those who strive with their will find that they cannot make it. They cannot satisfy God's demand. Asking them to be totally obedient to God's will is like asking a fish to fly in the air or a bird to swim in the water. The fish and the bird have their own lives, and the laws of the two lives act differently. Swimming in the water is a law for fish, and flying in the air is a law for birds. If a fish tries to fly by its will or a bird tries to swim by its will, they will both be dead in five minutes. Man's will can only be made subject to the law of life; it can never be put above the law of life. Man can only satisfy God's demand by living according to the law of God's life; he cannot accomplish this by the power of his own will.</p><h2 class="head1">TRUSTING IN THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p>Paul preached life, and he also preached the law of life. God has not only given us life, He has given us the law of life. Believers should not only trust in life, but in the law of life. Being a Christian is not a strenuous exercise. There is no need to strive, to make up our mind, or to pretend to do good. All we have to do is let go and allow the law of the inner life to operate within us. We have to be clear that the life a Christian receives is a law. This law is not under the control of our will. On the contrary, the minute we stop exercising our will, this law will operate and do good in a spontaneous way. May the Lord open our eyes to see that the life we received is a law, and may we see the futility of man's will. May the Lord forbid us from doing His will by our own will, and may we trust in the law of His life, allowing this law to operate in us in a spontaneous way.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
