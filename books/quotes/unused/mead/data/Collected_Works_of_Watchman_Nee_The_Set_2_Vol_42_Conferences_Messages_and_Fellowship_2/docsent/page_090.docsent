   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD'S FLESH AND OUR CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are also two aspects to man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the positive side, he lacks something God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the negative side, he still has the human, natural, and mortal life, and there is the need for him to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I want to say a few words here to the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It does not matter whether you are good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As long as you do not have the life of Christ, you have nothing to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I have over ten friends who invited me once to a feast at the ancestral hall of a Chen clan, but because my last name is not Chen, I could not participate in the fellowship of that ancestral hall.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You do not have to commit any sin to become a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as you are a man, you are alienated from the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's way for man to receive His life is for man to eat His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord's flesh signifies His life which was released through death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This flesh is equivalent to the fruit of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Both flesh and fruit are edible fruit is the edible part of the tree, while flesh is the edible part of an animal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For us to eat the Lord's flesh is for us to regain the blessing of Adam which he lost in paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The blood speaks of the substitutionary death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The cross speaks of the identifying death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The flesh speaks of Christ's life-releasing death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He died in order that man may eat His flesh to receive His new life, the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But how can we allow the flesh, that is, God's life, to live within us?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In practice, it is through the cross, that is, through bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The bearing of the cross signifies our acceptance of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It means that we lose our own soul life, natural life, and allow Christ to live within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After Adam sinned, man became the "old man."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before Adam sinned, man was simply man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When God crucified you on the cross with Christ, He crucified the old man; He did not crucify you as a man on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Your hands, feet, mind, will, and emotion are still here.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Your personality, self, and natural disposition are still here.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What then does Galatians 2:20 mean, when it says, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me"?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The "I" in this verse refers to two different things: one is the old man, and the other is our personality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this verse, the first two "I"s refer to the old man, while "me" at the end of the verse refers to our personality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The "I" of the old man is dealt with through crucifixion with Christ, whereas the "I" of our personality is dealt with through bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>TWO ASPECTS OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our natural human life is mortal and animal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Adam was in paradise, even before he sinned, his life was mortal; he did not have God's life within him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The natural life needs to be dealt with and the animal life needs to be dealt with even more.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Otherwise, God's life will be bound by man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is like the Lord Jesus when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The life of God within Him was bound by the body He received from Mary, and it could not be released.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, He dealt with this mortal life and was able to express God's life through His body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The way to deal with the old man is by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The way to deal with the mortal life is also by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Are these two dealings identical?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No. The first dealing has to do with the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His crucifixion deals with our sinful self; this is an accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The second dealing has to do with our own cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to bear the cross, and it deals with our natural self.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is something that we have to do every day.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>TAKING UP OUR OWN CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every work spoken of in the Bible has its own specific application.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, here is a chair.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we turn it upside- down, no one can sit on it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to apply the two aspects of the cross correctly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The cross of Christ requires faith.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once we believe, it is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Its purpose is to deal with sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our cross does not require faith; it requires obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Its purpose is to deal with the self which was there before sin even came in. This self can only be dealt with by obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For your benefit I should mention one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am not only condemning you, I am also condemning myself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some people are more amiable than others.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We tend to be attracted to them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They speak well, and there is nothing sinful or wicked about them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Yet when we are with them, we do not feel the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although such a person may talk about God, we can only sense his wisdom or cleverness; we do not sense God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Only his natural life is manifested in him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Eloquence, management skill, and kind dispositions are natural traits.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They do not issue from God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When a person sits beside us, we may be attracted to him and he may make us feel very comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This kind of natural goodness is often the very thing that frustrates God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The natural life is the totality of the life that we have inherited from our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is what remains in our life after the sinful elements have been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The life of the old man, the natural life, easily veils God's life and keeps it from being released.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In Luke 9:23 the Lord said, "If anyone wants to come after Me" this means if anyone wants to live as He lived on this earth "let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Verse 24 continues, "For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake, this one shall save it."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The word "for" at the beginning of verse 24 tells us that verse 24 is an explanation of verse 23.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The life spoken of here is the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Everyone wants to preserve his own soul-life, animal life, and natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This life includes such traits as our natural generosity, excellence, and good disposition.</S>
