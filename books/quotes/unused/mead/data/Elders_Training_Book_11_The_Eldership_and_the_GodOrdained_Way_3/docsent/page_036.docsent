   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The elders must also seek new sources of sinners as their gospel candidates.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The source of our acquaintances may become exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should then seek new sources.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may ask a friend to recommend his friends to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must find a way to gain more sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Leading Sinners to Know</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>the Main Contents of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, the elders should lead sinners to know God as the source and Creator of the universe, the unique Supreme Being in the entire universe and the only one God for our worship Acts 14:15b; 1 Cor 8:6a .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They must also lead sinners to know Christ as the only begotten Son of God to be our Savior, who was crucified on the cross for our sins and resurrected from among the dead to be our life for our regeneration John 3:16; 1 Pet 2:24a; 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The elders must also lead sinners to know man's sin and sins sin in man's nature and sins in man's behavior Rom 7:16-17, 20; 3:10, 12, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, they must lead sinners to know God's salvation by man's believing in the Son of God, Jesus Christ, as his Savior and life Acts 16:31; John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These points are the main contents of our gospel that we should preach to sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, we have to preach them in different ways according to the different persons we contact.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Crucial Step of Leading a Sinner</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>to Be Regenerated and Saved</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The crucial step of leading a sinner to be regenerated and saved is firstly to lead him to pray to God and the Lord Jesus by confessing his sins and receiving the Lord Jesus as his Savior and life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we lead a sinner to be regenerated and saved, we should not talk too much.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more a salesman talks, the more he loses the sale.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same way, too much talk kills our preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At a certain point, we should "close the deal" and lead the sinner to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The sooner we bring a sinner to prayer, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of course, we should first say something to open up the sinner's mind, heart, and even his spirit, but then we must help him to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the sinner says that he does not know how to pray, we must teach him and help him to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must then lead the sinner to realize that the Lord Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit desiring to enter into His believers and that he, the sinner, has a spirit for him to receive the Lord Jesus as the Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; John 4:24; 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord is a Spirit, and the sinners have a spirit to receive the Lord as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to explain this clearly and stress it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is very crucial.</S>
