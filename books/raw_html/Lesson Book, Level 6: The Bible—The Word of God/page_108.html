 <h2 class="head1">II. 2 JOHN</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by John, the elder, to the chosen lady and her children (see v. 1 and footnote 2). It should have been written after 1 John (refer to this section under 1 John). Church history definitely states that at the time of the writing of this book, John was an elder in Ephesus; therefore, this book must have been written in Ephesus.</p>
<p>B. The subject: prohibition of the participation in heresy.</p>
<p>C. The background: See this section under 1 John.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [The Epistle of 2 John prohibits us from participating in any heretical teaching concerning Christ&rsquo;s Person. In verse 10 the apostle John says, &ldquo;If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!&rdquo; As in verse 9, the &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; here is the teaching concerning the deity of Christ, especially regarding His incarnation by divine conception. In this Epistle John warns us not to receive anyone who denies the truth concerning Christ&rsquo;s deity and incarnation.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: In his introduction (vv. 1-2), John speaks of loving in truth for the truth. In verse 3 the apostle greets and blesses the believers with grace, mercy, and peace based upon the existence among them of the two crucial matters of truth and love. In verses 4 through 6 he speaks concerning the walk in truth and love. In verses 7 through 11 he speaks concerning not participating in heresy. In verses 12 and 13 John concludes his epistle with his expression of hope of closer fellowship for more joy and his greeting in endearing care.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction (vv. 1-3), 2) the walk in truth and love (vv. 4-6), 3) not participating in heresy (vv. 7-11), and 4) conclusion (vv. 12-13).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. 3 JOHN</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This epistle was written in Ephesus by John, while he was an elder there, to Gaius (v. 1 and footnote 2). It was written after 2 John.</p>
<p>B. The subject: encouragement to the fellow workers in the truth.</p>
<p>C. The background: See this section under 1 John.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [Both 2 John and 3 John are based on 1 John. Both 2 and 3 John indicate that we need to live in truth and walk in truth. The difference is that in 2 John there is the prohibition of participating in heresy, of participating in any teaching that is against this truth. We must stay away from any teaching or any person who is against the reality of the Triune God. But in 3 John there is the encouragement to help the fellow workers in the truth. We need to join ourselves to anyone who works for the divine reality of the Triune God that we are enjoying, and we need to do whatever we can to promote this work. Hence, in 2 John there is a negative attitude toward heresy and in 3 John, a positive attitude toward the work for the truth. Whether our attitude should be negative or positive depends on whether the particular situation is for the divine reality or against it.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: In his introduction (vv. 1-4), John speaks concerning loving in truth (v. 1), prospering in all things and in health (v. 2), and walking in truth (vv. 3-4). In verses 5 through 8 he speaks concerning hospitality to the traveling workers (vv. 5-8) given faithfully, in love, and worthily of God (vv. 5-6) by the fellow workers in the truth (vv. 7-8). In verses 9 through 12, John speaks concerning imitation not of the evil but of the good, giving two examples&mdash;the self-exalting and domineering Diotrephes as an evil example (vv. 9-11), and the well-reported Demetrius as a good example (v. 12). In verses 13 and 14, as the conclusion, John expresses the hope of closer fellowship (vv. 13-14a) and extends mutual greetings (v. 14b).</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction (vv. 1-4), 2) hospitality to the traveling workers (vv. 5-8), 3) imitation not of the evil but of the good (vv. 9-12), and 4) conclusion (vv. 13-14).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. JUDE</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by Jude, a slave of Christ. Both Jude and James were brothers of the Lord Jesus in the flesh (v. 1 and footnote 1). Because the degraded condition of the church evident in this book is similar to that which must have existed at the writing of 2 Peter, these two books must have been written at about the same time, around A.D. 69, before the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70. Jude may have been written in Jerusalem or Judea. According to the Jewish flavor of this book, it must have been intended for the Jewish saints.</p>
<p>B. The subject: contending for the faith.</p>
<p>C. The background: The [Epistle of Jude was written in the time of the church&rsquo;s apostasy and degradation.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: Jude and Peter (in his second epistle) [bore the responsibility to sound the trumpet for the New Testament truths, condemned the same things and emphasized the fact that anyone who takes the way of apostasy will suffer God&rsquo;s judgment.] [We need to learn from the books of Jude and 2 Peter to fear God and to be very careful concerning the Lord&rsquo;s Person and His redemptive work. Because we live in a perverted age, the young people especially need to be on the alert. We all must have a basic understanding of the Word of God. This will protect us.] [Today we all need to be faithful to contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: After his introduction (vv. 1-2), Jude charges the believers to contend for the faith (v. 3). Then he goes on to speak concerning apostasy (v. 4), pointing out historical examples of the Lord&rsquo;s judgment upon apostasy (vv. 5-7), and the evils of the apostates and their punishment under the Lord&rsquo;s judgment (vv. 8-19). In verses 20 through 23, he charges the believers to build themselves up in the holy faith and to live in the Triune God (vv. 20-21), and to care for others with mercy in fear (vv. 22-23). Jude concludes with praise to Him who is able to guard the believers and set them before His glory (vv. 24-25).</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction&mdash;to those called, beloved, and kept (vv. 1-2), 2) contending for the faith (v. 3), 3) heresies of the apostates (v. 4), 4) historical examples of the Lord&rsquo;s judgment upon apostasy (vv. 5-7), 5) evils of the apostates and their punishment under the Lord&rsquo;s judgment (vv. 8-19), 6) charges to the believers (vv. 20-23), and 7) conclusion&mdash;praise to Him who is able to guard and set the believers before His glory (vv. 24-25).</p>
