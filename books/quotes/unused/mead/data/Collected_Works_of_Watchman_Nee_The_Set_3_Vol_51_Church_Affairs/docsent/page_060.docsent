   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Possibility of a Third Region Being Set Up</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brothers and sisters, this is most crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 13 is the foundation of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without Acts 13 we cannot say how many problems would have occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without Acts 13 the concept of the pope would be entirely correct.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The concept of Rome, the concept that there is a capital of Christianity, would be completely correct.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But now we know that before God there was not only one center but two centers, not only one region but two regions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, when it pleases the Holy Spirit, He can establish a third region, a tenth region, a hundredth region, a thousandth region, or a ten-thousandth region on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is according to the intention of the Holy Spirit regarding His work on the earth; it is not according to man's intention.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Apostles Who Are Not Elders</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Being Able to Continually Go Out</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As I have said, it is interesting that these two apostles sent out from Antioch were not elders at Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, if they wanted to work, they had to become travelers, continually going out from place to place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They also returned to Antioch, but they did not return very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Paul stayed in Ephesus, he stayed for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If they had been elders in Jerusalem when they went to Ephesus, they could have stayed for three weeks at the most before returning; they could have gone out from Jerusalem, but they would have had to return soon after.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because they were apostles, they could go out.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if they had been elders, they would have had to return.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul and Barnabas were apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, they went out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It could be a long time before their return because they were not elders at Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter and John were both apostles and elders in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason, whenever they went out, they had to return quickly because the responsibility of Jerusalem was upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They had to go out because they were apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They could not help but return because they were elders.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let me tell you, this is a beautiful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because they were apostles, they continually went out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because they were elders, they continually returned.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They could not go too far because they had to bear the local burden in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul and Barnabas were only apostles, not elders.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, they could go out for a period of years without any problem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Wherever the Holy Spirit led them, they could go because they were only apostles and not elders.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>NEEDING A STRONG MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why do we need to spend so much time to talk about this one matter?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is because this has much to do with our work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must receive this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we begin to bear responsibility in a region and establish local churches there, we need to learn to be apostles, on the one hand, and elders, on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is because we need to have a strong meeting in this region.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many Bible expositors have often told us that Antioch was the strongest church at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, many have told us that the church in Antioch was a model church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I remember that when I was young, there was a book called The Model Church, which spoke about Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If someone does not bear the responsibility in a local church, he must be an apostle exclusively, continually going out freely, and then returning.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It does not matter if he takes a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, some need to return soon after they go out, as Peter did when he went to Samaria and Caesarea.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After a short time, he had to return because he was also an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From now on, when brothers among us go out, you must remember that those who are apostles can go, but those who are elders need to return.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I feel this way is very pure.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is definite with no difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE GENERAL LOCAL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>AND THE LOCAL CHURCH AT THE CENTER OF THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>DIFFERING SLIGHTLY IN THE MATTER</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>OF THE MESSAGE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The local church in this locality is still the same as the local churches elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If there is a difference, the difference is that there are apostles living in the regional center.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Perhaps at the same time these apostles are also elders.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once you have clearly seen this point, you can realize that there may be a slight difference between the general local church and the local church at the center of the work in the matter of the message meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because the apostles are there, they may be willing to give a special supply, special messages, or special ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There can be such a thing because the apostles are there.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is something that a general local church does not have.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the difference between a local church at the center of the work and a general local church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>THE APOSTLES ALSO BEING ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I think we must recognize that when the co-workers met at Hankow, the light regarding Jerusalem was still not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Of course, there are still many other things that we have not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But today at least we can say that we see the light concerning Jerusalem which we did not see in Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We can now add to it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We see that the church is local and that the work is regional.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God chooses a locality to be the center of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The church in that locality is slightly different from the churches elsewhere because there are apostles who are also elders in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is what we wanted to bring up concerning the arrangement of a local church at the center of the work.</S>
