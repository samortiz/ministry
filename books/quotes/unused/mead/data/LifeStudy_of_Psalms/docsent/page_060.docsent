   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In His Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to the third stage of Christ in Psalm 16 His resurrection Psa 16:10-11a; Acts 2:27-28a .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>a. God Not to Abandon Christ's Soul to Sheol</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God would not abandon Christ's soul to Sheol, nor let Him as God's Holy One see corruption, decay Psa 16:10; Acts 2:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that Christ's soul would be raised up from Hades and also that Christ's physical body would be resurrected from the tomb Matt 28:6; John 20:5-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God to Make Known to Christ the Path of Life Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God would make known to Christ the path of life resurrection Psa 16:11a; Matt 28:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In His incarnation Christ brought divinity into humanity; in His resurrection He brought humanity into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In His incarnation Christ made something divine, human; in His resurrection He made something human, divine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In resurrection Christ was also begotten of God to be the firstborn Son of God Psa 2:7; Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through His incarnation Christ put on humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In His resurrection He brought His human part into divinity to be begotten of God that He could be the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In eternity past and before His resurrection, He was the only begotten Son of God John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in resurrection the only begotten Son became the firstborn Son of God by having His humanity begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Christ's resurrection the believers were regenerated to be the many sons of God and the many brothers of Christ 1 Pet 1:3; Heb 2:10; Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First Peter 1:3 says that through the resurrection of Christ, God regenerated us, all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually, we were not regenerated at the time when we believed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That is merely according to our estimation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the divine fact, we all were regenerated together nearly two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Christ in His humanity was begotten of God to be God's firstborn Son, all His believers were also begotten of God to be God's many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, now through the resurrection of Christ, God has a group of sons, a corporate sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As sons of God, we need to realize that divinity was brought into our humanity and now our humanity is being brought into Christ's divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ was divinely human, and we are humanly divine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, we are the same as He is in life and in nature, but not in the Godhead.</S>
