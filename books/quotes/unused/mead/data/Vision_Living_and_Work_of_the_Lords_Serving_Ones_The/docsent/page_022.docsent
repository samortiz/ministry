   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Contending for the Ground of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The next time we came together, I felt that I could no longer stay neutral.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, I said, In our fellowship during the past two days we have touched the matter of the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Austin-Sparks has said that no group is absolutely right but that all are relatively right.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He said that it depends on the measure of the stature of Christ that a group has; the greater the measure of the stature of Christ, the more the group is right, and the smaller the measure of the stature of Christ, the less the group is right.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now I would like to ask a question: The children of Israel were taken captive to Babylon, and at the fulfillment of the period of seventy years, God wanted them to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the holy temple that had been destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose at that time a prophet arose and said, It is right that we worship, pursue, and love God, but we do not need to return to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our worship of God does not depend on a place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is all right to worship God in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Look at Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is spiritual, but he has remained in Babylon instead of returning to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, you do not have to go back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is sufficient just to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I would like to ask whether this prophet is genuine or false?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And whether his teaching is right or wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I continued and said, For the past three hundred years those who have pursued spiritual growth in life have been helped by the inner-life people, such as Madame Guyon.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Concerning the measure of the stature of Christ, I think that among those of us present today, hardly anyone has a measure of the stature of Christ that surpasses that of Madame Guyon.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, as far as the church is concerned, Madame Guyon was in Catholicism, which we all condemn.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Madame Guyon was very spiritual and had a great measure of the stature of Christ, but can we say that it is therefore right or relatively right to remain in the Catholic Church?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I believe that none of us would say this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I also said, During these two visits by our Brother Austin-Sparks, he has highly recommended Dr. F. B. Meyer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have read books by Dr. Meyer and received help from him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He indeed had some spiritual weight.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But at the time of his death he was still in organized Christianity, which Brother Austin-Sparks condemns.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Can we say that because of his substantial spiritual weight his being in organized Christianity was also relatively right?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After I finished speaking, no one refuted my words, and we left in an unpleasant atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The next morning we had another training for the co-workers and elders from the whole island.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There were more than five hundred brothers gathered together.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Austin-Sparks gave the message, and I translated for him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In his message he said emphatically, You make Christ a small Christ and the church a small church in order to fit your local ground.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I had no choice but to calmly translate what he said into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, for the sake of subsequent training meetings, during the afternoon teatime I spoke personally with Brother Austin-Sparks and told him that although our views differed concerning the practice of the church and the ground of the church, he should be assured that we would still respect and honor him and receive his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I felt there was no need to say more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Releasing Messages</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>concerning the Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>and the Ground of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the meetings in Taipei came to a close, Brother Austin-Sparks invited me to go with him to Hong Kong to be his interpreter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When I returned from Hong Kong, I immediately called a conference for the whole island to speak concerning the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those series of messages were later published in a book entitled The Testimony and the Ground of the Church .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After the messages were released, the majority of the brothers and sisters became clear and began to stress the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, several brothers who had been influenced by Brother Austin-Sparks had secret fellowship among themselves and waited to see whether I would reject Brother Austin-Sparks so that they could also reject me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At the time I was unaware of this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Invited to Visit Honor Oak and</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Seeing the True Situation</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Shortly afterward, Brother Austin-Sparks invited me to return his visit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since several brothers were influenced by him and had become dissenting, I decided to visit Brother Austin-Sparks s group to see their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this way I would be able to give the co-workers an account and tell them why we could not receive his ministry concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 1958 I went to England and stayed there for four weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brother Austin-Sparks received my wife and me as honored guests during our stay in England.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He committed an entire conference at Honor Oaks to me, as well as the regular meetings on the Lord s Day, and the meetings that were mid-week, asking me to give all the messages.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, I saw many situations there.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Not long after I arrived there, the elders came to visit me one by one at the place of my hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They told me their grievances; in particular, they were unhappy with our brother s control.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This put me, as a guest, in an awkward situation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One day Brother Austin-Sparks invited me to visit the elders meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even though it was a meeting for the elders, he was the only one giving directions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this way I learned their real situation.</S>
