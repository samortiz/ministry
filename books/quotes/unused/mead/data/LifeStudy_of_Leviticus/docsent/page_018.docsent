   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SKINNING OF THE BURNT OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first part of 1:6 says, "He shall skin the burnt offering."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The skinning of the burnt offering signifies Christ's willingness to let the outward expression of His virtues be stripped.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the four Gospels we see that Christ was defamed, stripped of the beauty of His virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, some said, "Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John 8:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Others said of Him, "He has a demon and is insane; why do you listen to him?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John 10:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that as the burnt offering the Lord Jesus was "skinned."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul also experienced this skinning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was skinned by the Corinthians who accused him of sending Titus to them for the purpose of taking money from them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul addressed this accusation in 2 Corinthians 12:16-18.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"But let it be so, I did not burden you, but being crafty I took you with guile.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Did I take advantage of you through anyone whom I have sent to you?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I entreated Titus and sent with him the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Did Titus take advantage of you?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Did we not walk in the same spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not in the same steps?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some of the Corinthians had charged Paul of being crafty in making gain, indemnifying himself by sending Titus to receive the collection for the poor saints.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul's real attitude is expressed in verse 15.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls, even if loving you more abundantly, I am loved less."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was willing to be wholly exhausted for their sake.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, he was accused of beguiling them and of using Titus to steal money from them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Was this not a matter of skinning?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 2 Corinthians 6:3-13 Paul lists many of the evidences that he is a servant, a minister, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 8 says, "Through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may find it hard to believe that the spreading of evil reports concerning Paul was an evidence that he was an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These evil reports were an evidence that Paul was God's servant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>An evil report is a matter of skinning, of having our outward beauty stripped away.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No one likes to be skinned.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During my years in the church life, many have come to me asking me to put back the skin that had been peeled off.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you are skinned by your husband or wife, will you not do everything possible to reattach the skin?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Will you not try to restore the good report concerning you, to recover the outward expression of your virtues?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose you are one trying to reattach the peeled-off skin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When you come to the Lord's table, will you be able to praise the Lord for helping to put the skin back on?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I do not think that anyone could offer such a praise to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, suppose in the family life and in the church life you experience a lot of skinning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then you will be able to say, "Lord, I have experienced the very skinning You experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I follow You and accept the skinning, the stripping, the defaming, the evil reports, just as You did.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Lord, what I have experienced is actually Your experience of being skinned."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you are a person with this kind of experience, the praise you offer, even if it is short, at the Lord's table will deeply touch the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the real, sincere, and honest offering of Christ as the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not an offering of the total Christ as the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No one, not even Paul, can offer Christ totally as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, we can offer only that part of Christ which we have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>CUTTING THE BURNT OFFERING INTO PIECES</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Leviticus 1:6 also tells us that the one who presented the burnt offering was to "cut it into its pieces."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No one likes to be cut into pieces; we all like to remain whole, complete, perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We keep ourselves from being cut by insisting that we are right and that others are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be accused of doing something wrong is to be cut into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Most of the quarrels between husband and wife involve the first party saying that the second party is wrong and the second party arguing that the first party is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The situation is the same in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A sister may complain that others in the church life are not fair.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When she comes to the meeting, she may look at a certain saint, thinking that this saint has not been fair with her.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This saint may have the same thought toward this sister.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The result is an inner fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Who, then, is fair, and who is not fair?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The only fair one is the one who is willing to be put on the cross and crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Problems between husband and wife and between the saints can be solved only through forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do you know what it means to forgive?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To forgive is to forget.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you touch some saints in the church life wrongly, they may not forgive you during their lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This unwillingness to forgive affects the praises at the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If the saints have complaints against one another, it will be difficult to have a living, uplifted Lord's table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Instead of being willing to be cut into pieces, we like to protect ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>During His life on earth, Christ was cut into pieces continually, and we need to experience His being cut.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In our married life and in our church life, we need to follow the Lord's steps by His life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>His life is not a quarreling life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>His life is a life that is willing to suffer the cutting.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we experience this, we shall be able to bring to God the Christ whom we have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have often spoken about laboring on Christ in order to have something of Christ to exhibit in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Laboring on Christ includes our being willing to be cut into pieces as He was.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we labor on Christ in this way, then as the produce to be offered to God we shall have the Christ who was cut into pieces.</S>
