They do not care much for what Christ as a man has done and still is doing. Especially they do not pay full attention to the prophecy concerning Christ as a man in His humanity in the Old Testament. In these first three messages I hope that the Lord will go along with us to unveil to us what Christ as a man in His humanity did in the Old Testament.</P><P>We want to see the humanity of Christ in the prophecy concerning the eternal economy of God. God has an eternal economy, and Christ carries it out. In what way does Christ carry out God's economy? He does it in His humanity. There are prophecies concerning this in the Old Testament. In these messages the culture and language are new, so we have to pay our full attention to the wording of the outlines.</P><P>In this message we want to see four persons, signifying Christ as a man in His humanity: the seed of woman, the seed of Abraham, the seed of David, and the branch of Jesse.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE SEED OF WOMAN</H2><P>Christ as the seed of woman is prophesied in Genesis 3:15. After Satan tempted Adam and Eve and caused them to fall, God came in to say to the serpent that one day He would use this tempted woman to produce a seed to bruise his head.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Immanuel</H2><P>The Son born of a human virgin is called Immanuel&#151;God with us (Isa. 7:14; Matt. 1:23; Gal. 4:4). El in the name Immanuel means "God." Christ is a human seed of a woman, yet He is God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Mighty God and Eternal Father</H2><P>Isaiah 9:6 says that a child is born to us and a son is given to us whose name is Mighty God and Eternal Father (Luke 2:11-12). This human child is the Mighty God. The wise men who came from the east to see that child worshipped Him as God (Matt. 2:11). As the Son given to us, His name is Eternal Father. Is He a son or a father? We have to declare that He is both. We should spend time to get into verses like Isaiah 9:6. We should not skate on the surface of the ice in our study of the holy Word. We must break the ice and dive into the depths of the Word to see the divine revelation. This is the way the Lord has been leading us to study His Word over the past seventy-four years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Bruising the Head of the Old Serpent</H2><P>As the seed of woman, in His humanity, He would bruise the head of the old serpent&#151;Satan (Rev. 12:9; Heb. 2:14). In order to destroy a serpent, one should not touch its tail. Instead, the serpent's head must be bruised. Hebrews 2:14 reveals that Christ bruised the head of the old serpent on the cross. On the cross He destroyed the devil.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Satan Tempting the Man<br>to Sin and Rebel against God</H2><P>Satan tempted the man, whom God created for Himself, to sin and rebel against God. He also imparted himself in his sinful nature into man to be man's nature, constituting man a sinner, dead in his spirit (Gen. 3:1-6), making himself one with man (Matt. 16:23; John 6:70; 8:44; 1 John 3:8a). We are not sinners because we sin; we sin because we are sinners. In Adam we have been constituted sinners. From the day that man fell Satan became one with man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Having the Might of Death</H2><P>Satan has the might of death, holding man in slavery through the fear of death (Heb. 2:14-15), but Christ came as a man, as the seed of woman, to destroy Satan and to rescue fallen man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Becoming the Sacrifice<br>for the Redemption of Fallen Man</H2><P>As the seed of woman, in His humanity, He would become the sacrifice, shedding His blood (Heb. 9:22) for the redemption of fallen man, covering him as his righteousness, signified by the coats of skins of the sacrifice (Gen. 3:21; 1 Cor. 1:30a; Phil. 3:9), and making him alive (Rom. 1:17; 5:18b). Christ was made our righteousness, and we have been made alive in Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Opening the Closed Way to the Tree of Life</H2><P>As the seed of woman, in His humanity, Christ opened the closed way for sinners to take God as the tree of life&#151;the source of the divine life (Gen. 3:22-24; Heb. 10:19-20). After man's fall the way to the tree of life was closed due to the requirements of God's glory, righteousness, and holiness. Later, Christ died to fulfill all these requirements, and by this He opened the closed way for man to partake of God as the source of the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SEED OF ABRAHAM</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Signified by Isaac</H2><P>Christ is the seed of Abraham (Gen. 22:18; Matt. 1:1b), signified by Isaac (Matt. 1:2). Isaac was a figure of the coming Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Blessing All the Nations<br>with the Gospel of Christ</H2><P>As the seed of Abraham, in His humanity, Christ blesses all the nations with the gospel of Christ (Gal. 3:8-12, 16). There is a long bridge from Genesis to Galatians, which reveals Christ as the seed of Abraham. Our labor in the Word through many years has brought us to the end of this bridge.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Bearing the Curse of the Law<br>and Blessing the Redeemed Sinners<br>with the Consummated Spirit</H2><P>As the seed of Abraham, in His humanity, He bore the curse of the law. Satan tempted man, and man committed sin to break the law of the righteousness of God. Christ as the seed of Abraham needed to bear the curse of the law so that the redeemed sinners could be blessed. Today we are no longer cursed; we are blessed through Christ as the seed of Abraham in His humanity with the consummated Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God (Gal. 3:13-14). Christ's blessing brought the triune, processed, and consummated God to us for our enjoyment. These are all deep and detailed points which require our study.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE SEED OF DAVID</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Signified by Solomon</H2><P>Christ is the seed of David (Matt. 1:1a; Rom. 1:3), signified by Solomon, the son of David (2 Sam. 7:12b-14a; Matt. 1:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Building Up the Temple of God</H2><P>As the seed of David, in His humanity, Christ builds up the temple of God, the church of God, to be God's dwelling place on the earth (2 Sam. 7:13a; Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:21-22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The King of the Kingdom of God</H2><P>As the seed of David, in His humanity, He is the King of the kingdom of God for the consummation of God's eternal economy (2 Sam. 7:13b; Matt. 16:19; Rev. 11:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE BRANCH OF JESSE, THE FATHER OF DAVID</H2><P>Christ in His humanity is the seed of woman, the seed of Abraham, the seed of David, and also the branch of Jesse, the father of David (Isa. 11:1-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Twig from Jesse's Stem</H2><P>Christ is a twig from Jesse's stem&#151;the last part of a cut trunk close to the roots (v. 1a). The royal family of David had been cut to the bottom. The whole trunk of David's family had been cut close to the roots, leaving only a twig from the stem. Christ was born out of the family of David as a twig which grew into a new branch, the branch of Jesse.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Spirit of Jehovah Resting upon Him</H2><P>Isaiah prophesied that the Spirit of Jehovah&#151;the Spirit of wisdom, the Spirit of understanding, the Spirit of counsel, the Spirit of might, the Spirit of knowledge, and the Spirit of the fear of Jehovah&#151;would rest upon Christ (v. 2). In the human living of Jesus, the branch of Jesse, people saw the Spirit of God with all these attributes. He was full of the Spirit of wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, and the fear of Jehovah. No human being has ever feared God as much as Jesus did.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Given by God the Authority to Execute Judgment in Righteousness over the Earth</H2><P>In His humanity Christ would delight in the fear of Jehovah, and as the King of Israel, in His humanity, He was given by God the authority to execute judgment (John 5:27) in righteousness over the earth and make all the creatures of God live in peaceful harmony in the millennium (Isa. 11:3-9). Isaiah reveals that in the kingdom of one thousand years, the wolf will dwell with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the kid, the nursing child will play by the cobra's hole, and upon the viper's den the weaned child will stretch his hand. In the millennium through Christ as the branch of Jesse, all the creatures of God will live in peaceful harmony.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>IN THE PROPHECY<br>CONCERNING THE ETERNAL ECONOMY OF GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman" start="5"><li>A man:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Christ visited Abraham as a man in His humanity&#151;Gen. 18:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>He was Jehovah with two angels&#151;vv. 1-3, 9-14, 16-18, 22, 33; 19:1.</li>		<li>Abraham provided Him with water for foot-washing and asked his wife to prepare a meal for Him&#151;vv. 4-8.</li>		<li>He told Abraham that his wife Sarah would bring forth a son in the next year&#151;vv. 9-15.</li>		<li>Considering that Abraham would become a great nation to be the kingdom of God on the earth for the carrying out of His economy, He told Abraham as His friend (James 2:23; 2 Chron. 20:7; Isa. 41:8) that He would judge the sinful Sodom and Gomorrah&#151;vv. 16-21.</li>		<li>Abraham prayed to Jehovah for Sodom; actually, his prayer was for his nephew, Lot, who made his home in Sodom (vv. 22-33), and Jehovah answered him by rescuing Lot from the destruction of Sodom (Gen. 19:1-29).</li>		</ol>	<li>Christ, who was God, wrestled as a man in His humanity with Jacob&#151;Gen. 32:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>While Jacob was under the threatening that his elder brother Esau would come to destroy him on his way back to his father's land from Haran, where he could not suffer his uncle Laban's stripping any longer, Christ came in His humanity to meet Jacob at the time of his need&#151;vv. 1-24.</li>		<li>Jacob would not let Him go unless He would bless him&#151;v. 26.</li>		<li>Realizing that He could not prevail against Jacob, He touched the hollow of his thigh so that the hollow of his thigh was out of joint&#151;v. 25.</li>		<li>His touching of the hollow of Jacob's thigh transformed Jacob, a heel-holder, into Israel, the prince of God, who was one of the three prominent forefathers of the people of Israel for the carrying out of God's economy&#151;v. 28.</li>		</ol>	<li>Christ, as a man in His humanity, met Joshua as the Captain of Jehovah's army to fight for Israel for the carrying out of God's economy&#151;Josh. 5:13-15.</li>	<li>Christ, who was the Angel of Jehovah, Jehovah Himself, came as a man in His humanity to tell Manoah's wife that she would bring forth a son, Samson, to deliver Israel from the oppression of the Philistines for the carrying out of God's economy&#151;Judg. 13.</li>	</ol></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. A MAN</H2><P>We want to continue our fellowship concerning the humanity of Christ in the prophecy concerning the eternal economy of God. This message presents Christ appearing as a man four times in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament Christ was prophesied as a man, particularly in four cases. First, Christ as a man in His humanity visited His friend, Abraham (Gen. 18). Second, Christ as a man in His humanity wrestled with Jacob, a heel-holder (Gen. 32). Third, Christ as a man in His humanity met Joshua, the general of God's army, to fight not only for Israel but for the carrying out of God's eternal economy (Josh. 5:13-15). Fourth, Christ as a man in His humanity came purposely to the wife of a common man by the name of Manoah to tell her that she would bring forth a son by the name of Samson to fight for Israel (Judg. 13). Samson would fight the Philistines, signifying a people between the world and religion, who greatly disrupted the carrying out of God's economy on this earth. It is hard to find out the reason why Christ appeared as a man in these four cases. I want us to notice the following phrase which is written four times in the outline of this message: for the carrying out of God's economy. In order to carry out God's economy, Christ needs to be a man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Christ Visiting Abraham<br>as a Man in His Humanity</H2><P>God became Abraham's friend. If God would have visited Abraham as God, this would have frightened Abraham. As God He could not become friends with man. If God came as God to be friends with us, we would run away. In our crystallization-study of Song of Songs, we saw that God came as a "country man" in order to court a "country girl." One day God came to visit Abraham, not as God, but as a man.</P><P>Christ was Jehovah, but He came to Abraham as a man with two angels (Gen. 18:1-3, 9-14, 16-18, 22, 33; 19:1). Abraham might have wondered who this One was who came as a guest to his tent. He provided Him with water for foot-washing and asked his wife to prepare a meal for Him (18:4-8). As God He would not have needed to wash His feet or to eat. He told Abraham that his wife Sarah would bring forth a son in the next year (vv. 9-15). At that time Abraham was about one hundred years old (Rom. 4:19), and Sarah's age prevented her from bearing children. However, there was One who told Abraham that He would come back and that Sarah would have a son. Actually, the birth of the son would be His coming back (Gen. 18:10).</P><P>Considering that Abraham would become a great nation to be the kingdom of God on the earth for the carrying out of God's economy, Christ told Abraham as His friend (James 2:23; 2 Chron. 20:7; Isa. 41:8) that He would judge the sinful Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 18:16-21). Abraham prayed to Jehovah for Sodom; actually, his prayer was for his nephew, Lot, who made his home in Sodom (vv. 22-33), and Jehovah answered him by rescuing Lot from the destruction of Sodom (19:1-29).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Christ, Who Was God, Wrestling as a Man<br>in His Humanity with Jacob</H2><P>Genesis 32 reveals that Christ, who was God, wrestled as a man in His humanity with Jacob. This was during the time that Jacob was under the threatening that his elder brother Esau would come to destroy him on his way back to his father's land from Haran, where he could not suffer his uncle Laban's stripping any longer. At that time Christ came in His humanity to meet Jacob at the time of his need (vv. 1-24). Jacob probably realized that this man was God, so he would not let Him go unless He blessed him (v. 26). If God had remained only in His divinity, there would have been no possibility for a man to deal with God in this way. Jacob was so strong that he would not let God go. Realizing that He could not prevail against Jacob, Christ as God touched the hollow of his thigh so that the hollow of his thigh was out of joint (v. 25). From that day Jacob became a lame man.</P><P>His touching of the hollow of Jacob's thigh transformed Jacob, a heel-holder, into Israel, the prince of God, for the carrying out of God's economy (v. 28). Jacob wanted to be the first out of his mother's womb, so he grasped Esau's heel. He did not want Esau to be ahead of him. But the Lord transformed him into the prince of God, the meaning of the name Israel. Christ came to visit Abraham as a man in His humanity for the purpose of carrying out God's economy. Later Christ wrestled with Jacob as a man in His humanity in order that Jacob would become Israel, who is one of the three prominent forefathers of the people of Israel for the carrying out of God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Christ, as a Man in His Humanity,<br>Meeting Joshua</H2><P>Christ, as a man in His humanity, met Joshua as the Captain of Jehovah's army to fight for Israel for the carrying out of God's economy (Josh. 5:13-15). Joshua was neither like Abraham, a common man, nor like Jacob, a cunning person. Joshua was a general, the commander of God's army, fighting not only for Israel but also for the carrying out of God's eternal economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Christ Coming as a Man in His Humanity<br>to Manoah's Wife</H2><P>Christ, who was the Angel of Jehovah, Jehovah Himself, came as a man in His humanity to tell Manoah's wife that she would bring forth a son, Samson, to deliver Israel from the oppression of the Philistines for the carrying out of God's eternal economy (Judg. 13).</P><P>Now we have to find out why Christ needed to be a man to visit Abraham, wrestle with Jacob, meet Joshua, and come to Manoah's wife. The answer to this question brings us to the unique and deepest truth in the divine revelation of the holy Scriptures. We need to answer the questions: "Why is there a God, why is there a Bible, why does this unique God have an economy which is revealed in this Bible, and why did God create the old creation with man as its center?" The answer to these questions as the one truth is the deepest truth, and it is very hard to explain.</P><P>Acts 2:23 says that Christ was crucified, "delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God." The Triune God in eternity past held a council to make a decision that the second among Them had to become a man for the purpose of visiting His chosen ones and making friends with them (Luke 7:34). When Nathanael saw Christ, he proclaimed that Christ was the Son of God, but Christ referred him to the Son of Man, saying, "You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man" (John 1:51). Christ being a man in His humanity is for God to carry out His economy, and the goal of God's economy is for the Triune God to be incorporated with man to be an incorporation. The New Jerusalem is the universal incorporation of God with man. For God to carry out His economy to have this incorporation, a constitution of God and man, man needs to be mingled with God. Without this, the whole universe means nothing. This truth is the unique truth in the whole universe. God needs man to match Him, to be united with Him, to be mingled with Him, to be incorporated into one incorporation with Him. The New Jerusalem will be the consummate incorporation of God and man. In eternity the New Jerusalem will stand to declare to the whole universe that this is God's eternal goal for His expression and for His enlargement.</P><P>The sixty-six books of the Bible are very consistent, but to see what the Bible unveils requires light. Apparently all the books are different, but in the unique truth the entire Bible is consistent. The Bible unveils to us that God's economy is to have God and man incorporated into an incorporation. Without man, with whom could God be incorporated? Therefore, there is the need of man. The one Bible reveals to us only one thing. First, God wants to be united with man, to have a union with man. Then God wants to be mingled with man. Consummately, God wants to be incorporated with man to be an incorporation. This enlarged, divine-human, universal incorporation is God's eternal goal, which is the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate union, mingling, and incorporation of God and man.

Being like a Refuge, a Covering,<br>Streams of Water, and the Shadow of a Massive Rock</H2><P>Isaiah prophesied that Christ, as a man in His humanity, would be like a refuge from the wind and a covering from the tempest, like streams of water in a dry place, like the shadow of a massive rock in a wasted land, and at the same time He would reign according to righteousness as the King, under whom there would be righteousness, protection, and enjoyment, in the millennium (Isa. 32:1-8). A tempest is a violent windstorm frequently accompanied by rain, snow, or hail. Christ is not only a refuge from the wind but also a covering from the tempest. Although this prophecy will be fulfilled in the millennium, we need to realize that today the church life is a minor millennium. In this minor millennium, we can enjoy Christ as the reality of so many rich items.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. A Man of Sorrows</H2><P>Isaiah 53 unveils that Christ was a man of sorrows (v. 3) in His humanity to be our Redeemer in detail.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Sitting on the Throne of God</H2><P>Ezekiel saw Christ, as a man in His humanity, sitting on the throne of God above the firmament (1:26-28). Satan's realm is in the air, the firmament, but Christ as a man in His humanity is sitting on the throne that is in the third heaven, above the territory of Satan. Stanza 1 of Hymns, #132 says:</P><blockquote>Lo! in heaven Jesus sitting,<br>Christ the Lord is there enthroned;<br>As the man by God exalted,<br>With God's glory He is crowned.</blockquote><P>According to history Christ's sitting on the throne should be after His death, resurrection, and ascension. But in the Old Testament Ezekiel saw Him sitting on the throne. This is similar to the apostle John's experience. He saw the New Jerusalem, but the New Jerusalem to him and to us is not yet.</P><P>The entire Bible needs our study so that we may have the proper interpretation of the Bible. The Bible was first written, later translated, and then interpreted. The many different truths in the Bible can be likened to pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. In our study of the Bible, we have endeavored to put together all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. Today I believe that I have finished the work of putting the pieces of the entire Bible together. When all the pieces are put together properly, we can see a clear view.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Measuring the Holy Building of God</H2><P>In Ezekiel 40&#151;43 Christ, as a man in His humanity, measured the holy building of God for His possession among Israel in the millennium (40:3-5; 43:6-7a). According to Ezekiel's measurement, that holy building will be wider than today's holy land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Walking with Daniel's Friends<br>in the Midst of the Fire</H2><P>Christ, as a man in His humanity, was walking with the three friends of Daniel in the midst of the fire. Because Daniel's friends would not worship the idol of King Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar gave the commandment to throw them into a blazing furnace. When he looked into the midst of the fire, Nebuchadnezzar said, "I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire; and they are not harmed. And the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods" (Dan. 3:25). This story in Daniel occurred about six hundred years before Christ was actually born as a man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Appearing to Daniel<br>for His Appreciation, Consolation,<br>Encouragement, Expectation, and Stabilization</H2><P>In Daniel 10:4-19 the excellent Christ, the centrality and universality of God's move on the earth, as a man in His humanity, appeared to Daniel for his appreciation, consolation, encouragement, expectation, and stabilization.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Being with Israel<br>in the Suffering of Their Dispersion</H2><P>Christ, as a man in His humanity, was with Israel in the suffering of their dispersion for God's eternal economy (Zech. 1:8). The children of Israel offended God and were given up by Him to be exiles in foreign countries. While they were suffering in their dispersion, Christ as a man in His humanity was with them in order to maintain Israel for God's eternal economy. If Israel had ceased to exist, how could Christ have been born to carry out God's eternal economy? Israel had to remain in order for Christ to be born.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. Measuring Jerusalem for His Possession</H2><P>Christ, as a man in His humanity, measured Jerusalem for His possession so that He would be her wall of fire round about and the glory within her (Zech. 2:1-5). Christ as a man would be a wall of fire around Jerusalem for her protection and the glory within her for His expression.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. The Shoot of David</H2><P>Christ as the Shoot of David (Zech. 3:8; Jer. 23:5; 33:15; cf. Isa. 4:2), as a man in His humanity, will build the temple of God, bear majesty, sit and rule on His throne, and be a priest on His throne, being the counsel of peace between the two (Zech. 6:12-13; Rev. 20:4, 6). Between the two means between the priesthood and kingship. In the Old Testament no king could be a priest. But in the millennium both Christ and the overcomers will be kings to reign and priests to serve God. These two responsibilities will be reconciled in both Christ and the overcomers. The overcomers will be priests, drawing near to God and Christ, and kings, reigning over the nations with Christ in the millennium (Rev. 2:26-27; 12:5). As priests they satisfy God and Christ with the enjoyment of their service, and as kings they reign for God and represent God, shepherding man for man's enjoyment and satisfaction. This is a reward to the overcomers. The believers who are defeated in this age will forfeit this reward. However, after being dealt with by the Lord in the millennium, these defeated ones will participate in the blessing of this reward, which will be to serve God and represent God in the priesthood and kingship in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (22:3, 5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE SON OF MAN</H2><P>In the prophecy concerning the eternal economy of God, Christ is a man and He is also the Son of Man. Of course, the Son of Man is a man, but there is a difference between the Son of Man and man. Christ as a man is simple, without any relationships or involvements. But as the Son of Man coming to seek and to save sinners (Luke 19:10), He is full of relationships and involvements.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Oneness of Christ,<br>as the Son of Man in His Humanity,<br>with the Children of Israel</H2><P>Psalm 80:15 and 17 say, "Even the stock which Your right hand has planted/And the son which You have strengthened for Yourself....Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand,/Upon the son of man whom You have strengthened for Yourself." These two verses refer to the oneness of Christ, as the Son of Man in His humanity, with the children of Israel. Matthew 2:15 quotes Hosea 11:1, saying, "Out of Egypt I called My Son." The Son here refers to both Christ and Israel. Christ, as the Son of Man in His humanity, was the stock of Israel planted by God's right hand and strengthened for God Himself; God exalted Him in His ascension by seating Him at His right hand (Psa. 110:1), the highest place in the universe, with the first place, the highest position, the preeminence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Coming Son of Man</H2><P>Daniel 7:13-14 says, "Behold, with the clouds of heaven,/One like a Son of Man was coming;/And He came to the Ancient of Days [the eternal God]....And to Him was given dominion,/Glory, and a kingdom,/That all the peoples, nations, and languages might serve Him./His dominion is an eternal dominion, which will not pass away;/And His kingdom is one that will not be destroyed." Christ, as the Son of Man in His humanity, after He was cut off (Dan. 9:26), after He finished His earthly ministry through His crucifixion, went to God in His ascension to receive the kingdom (Luke 19:12, 15; Rev. 11:15).</P><P>He, as the Son of Man in His humanity, will be a stone cut out, not by human hands, to crush (Matt. 21:44) all the kingdoms of the world and become a great mountain, filling the whole earth in His kingdom for the carrying out of the eternal economy of God (Dan. 2:34-35, 44-45). The entire Bible reveals that Christ is a stone in three aspects. First, He is the stone for His temple (Psa. 118:22; 1 Pet. 2:4-5). Second, He is the stone for us to trust and rely upon (Isa. 28:16). Third, He is the stone crushing the enemies. All these aspects of Christ are for the carrying out of the eternal economy of God.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>IN THE FULFILLMENT<br>OF THE ETERNAL ECONOMY OF GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The flesh:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Christ as the very God became flesh&#151;John 1:1, 14:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To be a man partaking of human blood and flesh with the human nature&#151;Heb. 2:14.</li>		<li>In the likeness of the flesh of sin&#151;Rom. 8:3.</li>		<li>Tabernacling among men.</li>		<li>Full of the glory of the only begotten Son of God.</li>		<li>Full of grace (God gained by us) and reality (God realized by us).</li>		<li>As the Word who is God becoming the last Adam&#151;the last man&#151;1 Cor. 15:45.</li>		<li>In this flesh, Christ becoming the seed of David (the seed of Abraham and the seed of woman&#151;Matt. 1:1b; Gal. 4:4)&#151;Rom. 1:3; Matt. 1:1a.</li>		<li>Suffering&#151;1 Pet. 4:1.</li>		<li>Offering up both petitions and supplications with strong crying and tears to God to save (resurrect) Him out of death and being heard because of His piety&#151;Heb. 5:7.</li>		<li>The Spirit of God confesses that Christ came in the flesh in the teaching of the apostles, but at the end of the first century, when the apostle John was still in his ministry, Docetism intermixed with Gnosticism denied that Christ came in the flesh&#151;1 John 4:2-3; 2 John 7.</li>		<li>After His resurrection Christ showed His disciples that He still had the resurrected flesh and bones (Luke 24:39; Acts 2:31) of God's new creation (whereas in His incarnation He became flesh of God's old creation), which will be His body of glory when He comes back (Phil. 3:21).</li>		</ol>	<li>Christ's ministry in the flesh:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>As the Word becoming the flesh, He brought God into man, making God one with man&#151;John 1:1, 14.</li>		<li>Manifesting God&#151;1 Tim. 3:16.</li>		<li>Condemning sin&#151;Rom. 8:3b.</li>		<li>Being put to death for our sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous&#151;1 Pet. 3:18.</li>		<li>Abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances to create in Himself as the element the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers into one new man&#151;Eph. 2:15.</li>		<li>Reconciling all things, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens, to God&#151;Col. 1:20-22.</li>		<li>In John 6:51-56 blood and flesh refer to Christ's humanity (Heb. 2:14); Christ's blood being separated from His flesh indicates death; and eating and drinking denote receiving.

The man is simple with no relationships or involvements. When Christ came to visit Abraham, He was a man in humanity, without any involvements. When He came to wrestle with Jacob, He was simply a man without any involvements. But Christ as the Son of Man coming to seek and save sinners is full of involvements. Psalm 80:17 uses both of these terms for Christ. On the one hand, Christ was the man; on the other hand, Christ was the Son of Man. As the Son of Man in His humanity, He was one with the children of Israel.</P><P>In the previous three messages we have seen the humanity of Christ in the prophecy concerning the eternal economy of God in the Old Testament. In the following set of three messages we want to see the humanity of Christ in the fulfillment of God's eternal economy in the New Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE FLESH</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Christ as the Very God Becoming Flesh</H2><P>John 1:1 and 14 reveal that Christ as the very God became flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Be a Man with the Human Nature</H2><P>Christ became a man partaking of human blood and flesh with the human nature (Heb. 2:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. In the Likeness of the Flesh of Sin</H2><P>Romans 8:3 says that God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin. Christ did not become sinful flesh but came in the likeness of the flesh of sin. According to John 3:14 He was the reality of the bronze serpent lifted up by Moses in the wilderness (Num. 21:4-9). The bronze serpent had the form of the serpent but was without the serpent's poison. In the same way, Christ was made in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He did not participate in any way in the sin of the flesh (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Tabernacling among Men</H2><P>As the very God who became flesh, Christ was the real tabernacle. The tabernacle was God's dwelling place on this earth among men. The incarnated Christ became God's dwelling place among men, the tabernacle of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Full of Glory</H2><P>The incarnated Christ was full of the glory of the only begotten Son of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Full of Grace and Reality</H2><P>He was also full of grace (God gained by us) and reality (God realized by us). Christ Himself is the grace to be gained and enjoyed by us and the reality to be realized and experienced by us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Becoming the Last Adam</H2><P>As the Word who is God, Christ became the last Adam, the last man (1 Cor. 15:45).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Becoming the Seed of David</H2><P>In this flesh, Christ became the seed of David (Rom. 1:3; Matt. 1:1a), the seed of Abraham and the seed of woman (Matt. 1:1b; Gal. 4:4). The seed of David implies Christ's human nature. By incarnation, the first step of Christ's process, God was brought into humanity. In the Bible flesh is not a positive word. Nevertheless, the Bible declares that the Word became flesh. The gospel of God concerns God who became flesh; according to the flesh He became the seed of man. Galatians 4:4 says that Christ was born of a woman. The Son of God was born of the virgin Mary (Luke 1:27-35) to be the seed of woman, as promised in Genesis 3:15.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Suffering</H2><P>Christ became flesh to suffer, to be crucified (1 Pet. 4:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. In the Days of His Flesh<br>Christ Praying with Strong Crying and Tears</H2><P>In the days of His flesh in Gethsemane, Christ offered up both petitions and supplications with strong crying and tears to God to save (resurrect) Him out of death, and He was heard because of His piety (Heb. 5:7). God answered His prayer by raising Him from the dead.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. The Spirit of God Confessing<br>That Christ Came in the Flesh</H2><P>The Spirit of God confesses that Christ came in the flesh in the teaching of the apostles, but at the end of the first century, when the apostle John was still in his ministry, Docetism intermixed with Gnosticism denied that Christ came in the flesh (see 1 John 4:2-3 with note 1 of verse 3, and 2 John 7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. Still Having the Resurrected Flesh and Bones after His Resurrection</H2><P>After His resurrection Christ showed His disciples that He still had the resurrected flesh and bones (Luke 24:39; Acts 2:31) of God's new creation (whereas in His incarnation He became the flesh of God's old creation), which will be His body of glory when He comes back (Phil. 3:21). In the night of His resurrection, Christ came back to the disciples. The disciples thought He was a spirit or a ghost. However, He told them to touch Him. This was not His original flesh, but the resurrected flesh and bones of God's new creation. His physical body was of God's old creation. His resurrected body is of God's new creation. His resurrected body will be His body of glory when He returns. At that time we also will be transfigured to be the same in body as He is, that is, we will be conformed to the body of His glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Christ's Ministry in the Flesh</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Bringing God into Man</H2><P>As the Word becoming the flesh, He brought God into man, making God one with man (John 1:1, 14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Manifesting God</H2><P>First Timothy 3:16 says that Christ was God manifested in the flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Condemning Sin</H2><P>Christ came in the likeness of the flesh of sin to condemn sin (Rom. 8:3b). Sin is in the flesh of sin. Christ died not only for the sins in our conduct but also to condemn the sin in our nature.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Being Put to Death for Our Sins</H2><P>Christ was put to death for our sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous (1 Pet. 3:18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Creating the One New Man</H2><P>On the cross He abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances to create in Himself the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers into one new man (Eph. 2:15). He created the one new man in Himself as the element.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Reconciling All Things to God</H2><P>Colossians 1:20-22 reveals that through His death Christ reconciled all things, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens, to God. Hebrews 2:9 says that He tasted death on behalf of everything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Christ's Death Ministering to His Believers Eternal Life and Making Him One with Them</H2><P>In John 6:51-56 blood and flesh refer to Christ's humanity (Heb. 2:14). Christ's blood being separated from His flesh indicates death, and eating and drinking denote receiving. Christ's death through the shedding of His blood ministers to His believers eternal life and makes Him one with them (John 3:14-15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Initiating for Us a New and Living Way</H2><P>Through His death He initiated for us a new and living way to enter into the Holy of Holies through the splitting of His crucifixion (Heb. 10:19-20; Matt. 27:51a). Christ's crucifixion split the veil, that is, the human flesh. That veil had cut off the way for people to enter into the Holy of Holies to contact God directly. But since Christ split the veil through His death, the new and the living way is opened for us.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>IN THE FULFILLMENT<br>OF THE ETERNAL ECONOMY OF GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>The Son of Man:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Coming in His humanity to seek and save the lost sinners&#151;Matt. 18:11; 9:13; Luke 19:10:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Eating and drinking with the tax collectors and sinners&#151;Matt. 9:10-11; 11:19; Luke 7:34.</li>		<li>Making friends with them.</li>		<li>Visiting and lodging with a sinful man&#151;Luke 19:5-7.</li>		<li>As a Physician to the ill&#151;Matt. 9:12.</li>		<li>Having authority to forgive sins&#151;Matt. 9:6.</li>		<li>Not destroying men's lives but saving them&#151;Luke 9:56.</li>		</ol>	<li>Having no place to lay His head&#151;Matt. 8:20; Luke 9:58:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Not even as the foxes having holes.</li>		<li>Nor as the birds of heaven having roosts.</li>		</ol>	<li>Being, in His humanity, the Lord of the Sabbath&#151;Matt. 12:8; Mark 2:28; Luke 6:5.</li>	<li>Confessing in him, before His Father in the heavens and before His angels, everyone who confesses in Him before men, and forgiving the ones speaking words against Him&#151;Luke 12:8, 10; Matt. 10:32; 12:32.</li>	<li>Sowing Himself, in His humanity, as the good seed into man to grow Him&#151;Matt. 13:3-9, 37.</li>	<li>Asking His disciples who they knew Him to be in His humanity and guiding them to know Him as the Christ, the Son of the living God, who will build the church to be the kingdom of the heavens&#151;Matt. 16:13-20.</li>	<li>Coming, in His humanity, not to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many&#151;Matt. 20:28; Mark 10:45.</li>	<li>Giving, in His humanity, the food which abides unto eternal life&#151;John 6:27, 53.</li>	<li>Dying in His humanity:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Going away from His disciples and being betrayed by one of them&#151;Matt. 26:24; Mark 14:21; Luke 22:22, 48.</li>		<li>To be killed as John the Baptist was by the Jewish authorities&#151;Matt. 17:12; Mark 9:12-13.</li>		<li>To be delivered into the hands of the chief priests and scribes and crucified by them&#151;Matt. 17:22-23a; 20:18-19a; 26:2, 45; Mark 8:31a; 9:31a; 10:33-34a; 14:41; Luke 9:22a, 44; 18:31-33a; 24:7a.</li>		<li>Giving His life as a ransom for many&#151;Matt. 20:28b; Mark 10:45b.</li>		<li>To be lifted up on the cross:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>That people may know that He is the great I Am&#151;John 8:28.</li>			<li>To draw all men to Himself&#151;John 12:32, 34.</li>			<li>As a serpent, typified by the serpent lifted up by Moses (Num. 21:8-9), that everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life&#151;John 3:14-15.</li>			</ol>		</ol>	<li>Being buried in His humanity in the heart of the earth three days and three nights as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish&#151;Matt. 12:40; Luke 11:30.</li>	<li>Resurrecting in His humanity:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>On the third day after His burial&#151;Matt. 17:23b, 9; 20:19b; Mark 8:31b; 9:9, 31b; 10:34b; Luke 9:22b; 18:33b; 24:7b.</li>		<li>Being glorified&#151;John 12:23; 13:31-32; 7:39; Luke 24:26.</li>		</ol>	</ol></ol><P>Our crystallization-study of the humanity of Christ is to show us how much Christ is to us and how much we can enjoy Christ. Our circumstances in our living can be like a blowing wind, and sometimes they can be like a tempest with heavy rain. Christ is a refuge from the wind and a covering from the tempest (Isa. 32:2). When China was invaded by the Japanese army during the Second World War, the military police of the Japanese army arrested me twice. That was a real tempest. During the war, it meant nothing for the Japanese army to put a Chinese person to death. They imprisoned me for thirty days, and that was a real test to my family and the church. But I can testify that Christ was my covering to protect me from that tempest. The New Testament alone does not tell us how to enjoy Christ as a refuge and a covering.</P><P>The Brethren taught the prophecies in the book of Daniel, but we need to see that the book of Daniel is also full of the enjoyment of Christ, the Son of Man. The three friends of Daniel were thrown into the fire, and Christ as a man was walking with them. Also, in Daniel 10:4-19, we see that Christ is our stability, but we do not have such a thought pointed out in this way in the New Testament.</P><P>If we had only the New Testament without the Old Testament, our enjoyment of Christ would not be adequate. I have given many messages on the types and prophecies in the Old Testament to show people Christ and the enjoyment of Christ. In Luke 24:44 the Lord Jesus pointed out to His disciples that the three sections of the Old Testament, the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms, reveal Him. This shows that the entire Old Testament is a revelation of Christ and that He is its center and content.</P><P>Some teach that the whole Bible unveils Christ, but they understand this in a very shallow way, which can be compared to skating on a layer of ice. All the deeper truths are in the depths "beneath the ice." By the Lord's unveiling in His mercy, we have an interpreted Bible, revealing the deeper truths.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SON OF MAN</H2><P>In the outlines for this message and the next one, we have extracted all the New Testament verses which speak of the Son of Man. In Matthew 18:11 the Lord said, "For the Son of Man has come to save that which is lost." He did not say, "I have come," but, "The Son of Man has come." I refers simply to the man, not the Son of Man. Changing the Son of Man to I or Me in any of the verses in these outlines makes them much less meaningful. If we read these points again and again, we will enter into them and enjoy Christ as the Son of Man. It is the Son of Man who has the authority to forgive sinners, who can be the Lord of the Sabbath, who gave His life as a ransom for many, who gives the food which abides unto eternal life, and who was glorified with the Father's glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Coming in His Humanity<br>to Seek and Save the Lost Sinners</H2><P>Christ as the Son of Man came in His humanity to seek and save the lost sinners (Matt. 18:11; 9:13; Luke 19:10). He ate and drank with the tax collectors and sinners (Matt. 9:10-11; 11:19; Luke 7:34), making friends with them. He visited and lodged with a sinful man, a tax collector named Zaccheus (Luke 19:5-7). He also came as a Physician to the ill (Matt. 9:12), having authority to forgive sins (v. 6). As the Son of Man, Christ came not to destroy men's lives but to save them (Luke 9:56). We need to enjoy Christ as the Son of Man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Having No Place to Lay His Head</H2><P>As the Son of Man, Christ had no place to lay His head (Matt. 8:20; Luke 9:58), not even as the foxes having holes nor as the birds of heaven having roosts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Lord of the Sabbath</H2><P>Christ in His humanity is the Lord of the Sabbath (Matt. 12:8; Mark 2:28; Luke 6:5). As the Son of Man, Christ can forgive people and be the Lord of the Sabbath.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Confessing before His Father<br>in Those Who Confess in Him before Men</H2><P>Christ as the Son of Man will confess in him, before His Father in the heavens and before His angels, everyone who confesses in Him before men, and He will forgive the ones speaking words against Him (Luke 12:8, 10; Matt. 10:32; 12:32).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Sowing Himself into Man</H2><P>The Lord as the Son of Man sowed Himself, in His humanity, as the good seed into man to grow Him (Matt. 13:3-9, 37).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Asking His Disciples<br>Who They Knew Him to Be in His Humanity</H2><P>The Lord Jesus asked His disciples who they knew Him to be in His humanity and guided them to know Him as the Christ, the Son of the living God, who will build the church to be the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 16:13-20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Coming in His Humanity to Serve</H2><P>Christ came in His humanity, not to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many (Matt. 20:28; Mark 10:45).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Giving the Food<br>Which Abides unto Eternal Life</H2><P>Christ gave, in His humanity, the food which abides unto eternal life (John 6:27, 53).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Dying in His Humanity</H2><P>Christ died in His humanity. In His death He went away from His disciples and was betrayed by one of them (Matt. 26:24; Mark 14:21; Luke 22:22, 48). As the Son of Man He was killed as John the Baptist was by the Jewish authorities (Matt. 17:12; Mark 9:12). He was delivered as the Son of Man into the hands of the chief priests and scribes and crucified by them (Matt. 17:22-23a; 20:18-19a; 26:2, 45; Mark 8:31a; 9:31a; 10:33-34a; 14:41; Luke 9:22a, 44; 18:31-33a; 24:7a). He gave His life as a ransom for many (Matt. 20:28b; Mark 10:45) and was lifted up on the cross. His being lifted up on the cross as the Son of Man was so that people may know that He is the great I Am (John 8:28) and that He may draw all men to Himself (12:32, 34). On the cross He was lifted up as a serpent, typified by the serpent lifted up by Moses (Num. 21:8-9), that everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life (John 3:14-15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Being Buried in His Humanity<br>in the Heart of the Earth</H2><P>The Son of Man was buried in His humanity in the heart of the earth three days and three nights as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish (Matt. 12:40; Luke 11:30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Resurrecting in His Humanity</H2><P>Christ resurrected in His humanity on the third day after His burial (Matt. 17:23b, 9; 20:19b; Mark 8:31b; 9:9, 31b; 10:34b; Luke 9:22b; 18:33b; 24:7b), being glorified (John 12:23; 13:31-32; 7:39; Luke 24:26).</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY<br>OF THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>IN THE FULFILLMENT<br>OF THE ETERNAL ECONOMY OF GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>The Son of Man:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="12">	<li>Ascending to the heavens in His humanity&#151;John 6:62:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Sitting at the right hand of God&#151;Matt. 26:64a; Mark 14:62a; Luke 22:69.</li>		<li>Seen standing at the right hand of God by Stephen&#151;Acts 7:56.</li>		</ol>	<li>Taking care of the churches as the lampstands in His humanity&#151;Rev. 1:11-13:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>As the High Priest dressing the churches as the lampstands to cherish them.</li>		<li>With His divinity as the energy motivated by His love signified by the golden girdle on His breast.</li>		</ol>	<li>Coming back in His humanity&#151;Matt. 10:23:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To destroy the whole earth as the flood did in Noah's days and as the fire and brimstone did at Lot's time&#151;Matt. 24:37-39; Luke 17:26-30.</li>		<li>To take away His believers who are watching and ready for His coming secretly&#151;Matt. 24:40-44; Luke 12:40; 21:36.</li>		<li>Expecting to find His believers in faith&#151;Luke 18:8.</li>		<li>To reap His harvest openly&#151;Rev. 14:14-16.</li>		<li>Sending His angels to collect out of His kingdom all the tares and cast them into the lake of fire&#151;Matt. 13:41-42.</li>		<li>In the glory of His Father with His angels in His kingdom&#151;Matt. 16:27-28; 25:31; Mark 8:38b; Luke 9:26b.</li>		<li>To be ashamed of the people who were ashamed of Him and His words in this adulterous and sinful generation&#151;Mark 8:38a; Luke 9:26a.</li>		<li>As the lightning coming forth from the east and shining to the west&#151;Matt. 24:27; Luke 17:24.</li>		<li>Appearing in heaven on the clouds with power and great glory to be seen by all the mourning tribes of the earth&#151;Matt. 24:30; 26:64b; Mark 13:26; 14:62b; Luke 21:27.</li>		</ol>	<li>Receiving authority from the Father to execute judgment in His humanity according to the will of the Father who sent Him&#151;John 5:27-30:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To judge all the dead people:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>All His believers who are dead at His coming to be resurrected unto life before the millennium&#151;v. 29a.</li>			<li>And all the unbelievers who are dead to be resurrected unto judgment after the millennium&#151;v. 29b.</li>			</ol>		<li>To judge all the people, signified by the sheep and the goats, who are living after His coming back&#151;Matt. 25:31-46:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Sitting on the throne of glory&#151;v. 31b.</li>			<li>The sheep who have well-treated the Jews and the believers in the great tribulation will go into eternal life to be the nations of the judged world&#151;vv. 33-40, 46b.</li>			<li>The goats who have ill-treated the Jews and the believers in the great tribulation will go into eternal punishment (the lake of fire) to perish&#151;vv. 41-46a.</li>			</ol>		<li>To judge all the dead people who will be resurrected unto judgment after the millennium&#151;Rev. 20:11-15.</li>		</ol>	<li>Reigning in His humanity in the millennium&#151;Matt. 19:28-29:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Sitting on the throne of His glory&#151;v. 28a.</li>		<li>With His faithful followers&#151;vv. 28b-29.</li>		</ol>	<li>Bringing heaven to earth and joining earth to heaven as the ladder seen by Jacob in Genesis 28:11-12, 16-19&#151;John 1:51:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>As the uplifted standing stairway.</li>		<li>For the traffic of the angels ascending and descending on Him in eternity future.</li>		</ol>	<P>Note: While fundamental Christianity was fighting against the heresy that denies the divinity of Christ, another heresy was unconsciously made by some Christians, even Christian teachers, that is, the heresy concerning the humanity of Christ of two points:</P>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Many Christian Bible teachers dare not recognize that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15).

God's eternal economy is to have a Body for Christ, and this Body consummates the New Jerusalem. The Bible ends with Christ as the Son of Man, as the consummation and completion of God's eternal economy. Nathanael recognized Jesus as the Son of God (John 1:49), but Jesus told Nathanael that he would see the angels ascending and descending upon the Son of Man (v. 51). Christ as the Son of Man is the reality of the ladder which Jacob saw in Genesis 28:12. John 1, the introduction to the Gospel of John, ends with Christ as the Son of Man being a ladder that joins earth to heaven and brings heaven to earth. The entire Bible also ends in this way, that is, with Christ Himself as the Son of Man being a heavenly ladder. This heavenly ladder is the New Jerusalem.</P><P>We have seen that the New Jerusalem as the goal of God's economy is the universal incorporation of the consummated God with His regenerated believers. God in His Divine Trinity is an incorporation, mutually coinhering and working together as one (John 14:10-11). Furthermore, Christ is in the Father, we are in Christ, and Christ is in us (v. 20). The conclusion and totality of these three ins is the Spirit of reality, who is Christ Himself, to be the reality within us (v. 17). The Spirit of reality came not only to be with us but also to be in us. Our being in God the Son and God the Son being in us and also in the Father reveal an incorporation. This incorporation is first the Body of Christ and then the New Jerusalem. Ephesians 4 speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father (vv. 4-6). The three of the Triune God&#151;the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father&#151;are constituted and incorporated with the believers. We have spent much time to study the humanity of Christ from the prophecy of the Old Testament and from the fulfillment in the New Testament to see a view showing us that God's economy is to have a Body for Christ which consummates the New Jerusalem&#151;the enlarged, universal incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers.</P><P>Now we want to conclude our fellowship concerning the revelation of the humanity of Christ in the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God. In the previous message we saw Christ as the Son of Man from His incarnation through His resurrection. In this message we want to see Him as the Son of Man from His ascension through eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. Ascending to the Heavens in His Humanity</H2><P>John 6:62 reveals that Christ ascended to the heavens in His humanity. As the Son of Man He is sitting at the right hand of God (Matt. 26:64a; Mark 14:62a; Luke 22:69). Furthermore, Stephen saw Him as the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God (Acts 7:56). Sitting is for resting, whereas standing is for working. Because a member of His Body was suffering on this earth, the Son of Man was seen standing at the right hand of God. This indicates that the Lord was greatly concerned for His persecuted one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. Taking Care of the Churches<br>as the Lampstands in His Humanity</H2><P>Revelation 1:11-13 shows that Christ as the Son of Man is taking care of the churches as the lampstands in His humanity. As the High Priest He is dressing the churches as the lampstands to cherish them, to make them happy, bright, and shining. He is also caring for the churches with His divinity as the energy motivated by His love signified by the golden girdle on His breast.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>N. Coming Back in His Humanity</H2><P>Christ will come back as the Son of Man (Matt. 10:23). He will destroy the whole earth as the flood did in Noah's days and as the fire and brimstone did at Lot's time (Matt. 24:37-39; Luke 17:26-30) and take away His believers who are watching and ready for His coming secretly (Matt. 24:40-44; Luke 12:40; 21:36). His coming back has two parts: one part is the secret part, and the other is the open part. The watchful ones, the ready ones, will see Him as the morning star and be taken by Him in the early part of His secret coming back (Rev. 2:28). Later, He will openly come back to the earth as the sun of righteousness (Mal. 4:2). Today as the Son of Man He is expecting to find His believers in faith (Luke 18:8). When the Son of Man comes back, He will reap His harvest openly (Rev. 14:14-16). He also will send His angels to collect out of His kingdom all the tares and cast them into the lake of fire (Matt. 13:41-42). All of the false believers, the tares, damage God's economy. They will be cast into the lake of fire when Christ comes back in His humanity.</P><P>Christ as the Son of Man will return in the glory of His Father with His angels in His kingdom (Matt. 16:27-28; 25:31; Mark 8:38b; Luke 9:26b). He will be ashamed of the people who were ashamed of Him and His words in this adulterous and sinful generation (Mark 8:38a; Luke 9:26a). When He comes back openly, He will be like the lightning coming forth from the east and shining to the west (Matt. 24:27; Luke 17:24). Lightning may be considered as being concealed in a cloud, waiting for an opportunity to flash forth. In a similar way, Christ will be clothed with a cloud (Rev. 10:1) in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear, like a flash of lightning striking the earth. This implies also that the Lord is like electricity. He will appear in heaven on the clouds with power and great glory to be seen by all the mourning tribes of the earth (Matt. 24:30; 26:64b; Mark 13:26; 14:62b; Luke 21:27). At that time they will see and receive Christ, and the whole family of Israel will be saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>O. Receiving Authority to Execute Judgment</H2><P>Christ as the Son of Man will receive authority from the Father to execute judgment in His humanity according to the will of the Father who sent Him (John 5:27-30). God has given all judgment to Christ because He is the Son of Man. The apostle Paul said that God has appointed this one man to judge the living and the dead (Acts 10:42; 17:31; 2 Tim. 4:1). He will judge all the dead people to decide who should be resurrected at His coming and who should be resurrected one thousand years later. At His coming all His believers who are dead will be resurrected unto life before the millennium (John 5:29a), and all the unbelievers who are dead will be resurrected unto judgment after the millennium (v. 29b).</P><P>He will judge all the people, signified by the sheep and the goats, who are living after His coming back (Matt. 25:31-46). During the great tribulation, Antichrist will persecute the believers. At that time, an eternal gospel will be preached to the nations (Rev. 14:6-7 and notes). Those who obey that gospel and treat the Jews and the suffering believers well will be blessed, will be reckoned as righteous, and will inherit the kingdom (Matt. 25:34, 37). These are the sheep. But those who do not will be cursed (v. 41) and will perish for eternity. These are the goats. The Lord will sit on the throne of glory at His return to separate the sheep from the goats. The sheep who have well-treated the Jews and the believers in the great tribulation will go into eternal life to be the nations of the judged world (vv. 33-40, 46b). They will be saved, not to receive eternal life but to enter into eternal life. Eternal life will be the sphere and the realm into which they will enter and in which they will live. They will be the nations around the New Jerusalem but not the kings. We believers, who are the New Jerusalem, will be the royal family to rule over all the nations. The goats who have ill-treated the Jews and the believers in the great tribulation will go into eternal punishment (the lake of fire) to perish (vv. 41-46a). Later, the Lord as the Son of Man will judge all the dead people who will be resurrected unto judgment after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>P. Reigning in His Humanity in the Millennium</H2><P>Christ will reign in His humanity in the millennium, sitting on the throne of His glory with His faithful followers (Matt. 19:28-29).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Q. Bringing Heaven to Earth<br>and Joining Earth to Heaven<br>as the Ladder in Eternity Future</H2><P>For eternity Christ as the Son of Man will bring heaven to earth and join earth to heaven as the ladder seen by Jacob (John 1:51; Gen. 28:11-12, 16-19). Nathanael recognized Jesus as the Son of God, but Jesus answered Nathanael by saying that he would see the angels ascending from earth to heaven and descending from heaven to earth upon the Son of Man. The Son of Man is the ladder as the uplifted standing stairway for the traffic of the ascending and descending angels in eternity future. This is a picture of the eternal age. In eternity future the New Jerusalem will be standing in the whole universe as something uplifted toward the heavens upon which the angelic family will ascend and descend to bring heaven to earth and join earth to heaven. This is the universal vision of God's economy.</P><P>God's economy will consummate in such a ladder, which is a city. This city is an incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers, an incorporation of God in man and man in God. We will be God's incorporation for God's glory to be manifested in humanity. We will be His dwelling place, the tabernacle (Rev. 21:3), and He will be our dwelling place, the temple (v. 22). That will be the mutual abiding of God in us and us in God to have God's glory manifested in humanity radiantly. This is the conclusion of the humanity of Christ in both the Old and New Testaments.</P><P>Note:While fundamental Christianity was fighting against the heresy that denies the divinity of Christ, another heresy was unconsciously made by some Christians, even Christian teachers, that is, the heresy concerning the humanity of Christ of two points:</P><P>1. Many Christian Bible teachers dare not recognize that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15). This implies that they dare not acknowledge the humanity of Christ, who is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation. According to our human view, Christ was born about two thousand years ago. But according to the divine view, He is the Firstborn of all creation. In God's eyes, there is no time element. Although Christ was slain less than two thousand years ago, Revelation 13:8 says that Christ was slain from the foundation of the world. With God there is only the fact, not the element of time. According to the fact, God reckons Christ as the Firstborn of God's old creation so that Christ might be the first in everything. We reject that heresy which says that Christ was only a creature and not God. Christ as God is the Creator, but we also have to recognize that Christ is a part of the creation because He is a man who partook of the created blood and flesh. As such a man, He is the Firstborn of God's old creation.</P><P>2. Some Christians do not believe that after His resurrection Christ is still a man through His ascension, coming back, reigning in the millennium, and being the heavenly ladder in eternity. Probably even a good number of Christian teachers make the same mistake unconsciously. Eventually, the centrality and universality of the entire universe, signified by the New Jerusalem, is Christ as the Son of Man.</P></body></html>
