   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX CHRIST, THE SPIRIT, AND THE BODY IN THE BOOK OF ACTS Scripture Reading: Acts 9:1-17; 22:6-16; 1 Cor 12:13; Luke 24:49; John 7:37-39</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapters we saw seven main points relating to the content of the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are incarnation, the kingdom, the condition of man, Christ meeting every man's needs, the divine living in humanity, the imparting of Christ as life, and man being brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although these matters may seem brief and simple, they are very profound.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, we need to spend more time to pray over these points and to ask the Lord to reveal something further in order that we may thoroughly understand the spiritual content of these four books.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we may come to the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we have mentioned previously, the Acts should not be separated from the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Acts should be included with the Gospels because these five books together give us a full picture of a universal man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The four Gospels give us a picture of the Head, and the book of Acts shows us the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE DUPLICATION AND REPRODUCTION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The books of the Scriptures were not originally given their titles by their writers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The titles were given by others many years later when they arranged the books of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In some versions of the Bible, the book of Acts is simply called The Acts, but in the King James Version it is called The Acts of the Apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Strictly speaking, however, this book records not merely the acts of the apostles but the acts of Christ by the Spirit in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The acts of the apostles and of all the believers, that is, of the church, are the acts of Christ in the church by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the four Gospels there is one man, Jesus of Nazareth, living in a divine way by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Acts, however, there are thousands of persons living in a divine way by the same divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the four Gospels there is a single Jew who lived divinely, but in the Acts there are thousands of Jews and Gentiles living exactly in the same way as He did.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, these thousands of people lived, acted, walked, and worked not by themselves but by that one wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the Lord Jesus died, resurrected, and ascended, He continued to live, act, walk, and work on this earth in thousands of people because He imparted Himself into them through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By His death, resurrection, and ascension, He made a mass reproduction of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Originally He was one Jesus, one Christ, but now He was reproduced in thousands of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Originally He was one grain, but now He became many grains, a mass duplication, a mass reproduction John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every one of us is also a part of this mass reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may illustrate this duplication by the printing of a newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are three main steps in the printing process.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first step is the thought of what we want to print.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The thought is the very source; without a thought there is nothing to put into black and white.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, the thought is invisible, unexpressed, unknown, hidden, mysterious, and secret.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The thought may be compared to the Father in the Triune God John 1:18a; 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Following this, the thought becomes the word, which is written and composed as the logos in a particular language, that is, into a literate, expressed writing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the second step, which includes many items.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the word is written and composed into expressed writings, it is typeset and put on a printing plate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everything that is in the thought is now visible with a definite form.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This may be compared to the Son in the Triune God as the expression of God John 1:1, 14, 18b .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The third step is the duplication in which the plate is placed on the press with the ink.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Millions of copies can then be reproduced from the one plate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is printed on the copies is identical to what is on the plate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the evening there is only the thought, but by the next morning millions of people can read what is in the newspaper as the reproduction of the thought.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The printing with the ink may be compared to the Holy Spirit, and we are the many sheets of paper 2 Cor 3:3, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This process points to the person and work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, He is the Word of God to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By His incarnation, His human living on this earth, His sufferings, and His death and resurrection, all that He is was "typeset" and put on the "printing plate."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In printing, the plate is a real treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we intend to print a book, we must finish the plate first.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After it is finished, we can keep it and use it to duplicate many copies whenever we need them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this way, it is easy to reproduce millions of copies.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The thought to be printed can be compared to the Father, the plate signifies the Son, the duplicating illustrates the Holy Spirit, and we, the believers, are the copies.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Christ died, resurrected, and ascended, the plate was made.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Following this, many copies were reproduced by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Holy Spirit printed the image on the plate onto Peter and John and onto us today.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are like blank pieces of paper onto which the Holy Spirit prints whatever is on the plate.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From the day of resurrection until today millions of copies have been printed by the Holy Spirit with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whatever Christ is, is the printing plate as the expression of the thought, that is, of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, on the plate, which is Christ, we can read the thought of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On Christ, in Christ, and with Christ, we can see the expression of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Moreover, others can read the same thing in us, the many pieces of paper, that they read in Christ because whatever is on the plate has been reproduced in us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are the reproduction of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In brief, in the four Gospels, there is the printing plate, and in the Acts we find the duplication, the reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, the Acts are the Acts of Christ, not Christ acting in Himself alone but acting in His reproduction and duplication, which is the church, the Body of the universal man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This universal man is the fullness of Christ Eph 1:23 ; therefore, it is a part of Christ, even Christ Himself.</S>
