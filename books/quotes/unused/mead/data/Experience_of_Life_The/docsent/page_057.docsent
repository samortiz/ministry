   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Nature of the Teaching of the Anointing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We now come to see the nature and characteristic of the teaching of the anointing:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Firstly, the teaching of the anointing is a feeling rather than something clearly spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although the teaching of the anointing must first pass through the understanding of our mind, yet what we comprehend is not a spoken sentence or a word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Its nature is still a feeling in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the most, it may seem to be a spoken word as well as a feeling, but it can never be a clearly and definitely spoken sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It may be likened to a certain kind of color, which evidently is not a spoken word, but a display which can be known when seen.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Likewise, when we live in the presence of the Lord and have fellowship with Him, the Holy Spirit as the ointment gives an unveiling to our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If our mind has been educated with the proper knowledge, we can understand the meaning of this unveiling and thereby obtain the teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, this understanding signifies the meaning and not the literal teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Though sometimes the Holy Spirit reveals the words to us from the Bible, He does not give us the printed letters; rather He causes us to touch the principle of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the complete Bible consisted of printed words, it would be inadequate for our use.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, consider someone who seeks the Lord about purchasing a pair of glasses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If he seeks a sentence as an answer from the Lord, it is impossible, for glasses are not mentioned in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the Lord can only give him a feeling and a certain knowledge based upon a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Practically speaking, the principle is more precious than the letters.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more matured a saint is and the deeper he experiences the anointing, the more free he is from the letters of the Bible, and the more attention he pays to the feeling in the spirit concerning the principle of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many who learn this lesson of the teaching of the anointing still like to seek reassuring words and obtain verbal confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This kind of seeking very easily deceives us and is dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, someone may seek the will of the Lord about marriage and pray for a definite answer either a "yes" or a "no."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This kind of seeking is very dangerous and causes one to be easily mistaken; actually, it is a mistake in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord makes known His will to us mostly by way of our inner feeling; He seldom uses words.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we pray and commit a matter to the Lord and sense inward peace and sweet fellowship, we know that the Lord agrees with the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, when we pray about this matter and feel hindered, or whenever we think about it, we feel uneasy, this signifies that the Lord does not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the teaching of the anointing is a feeling, not verbal words.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Secondly, the teaching of the anointing is inward rather than outward, subjective rather than objective.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is a feeling deep within and not a voice outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, it is in us and not outside of us; it is subjective and not objective.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Often our inward feeling is influenced by outward matters, but these outward influences still need the response from the inward anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Mere outward influences should be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since the teaching of the anointing is so subjective, many times the feeling which comes from the teaching appears to be our own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Under this condition we often doubt whether it is the feeling of the Holy Spirit or our own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Often we question, "This is apparently my feeling; how can it be the Holy Spirit's?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is because this feeling, which comes from the Holy Spirit within us, passes through us and is mingled with us, thus giving us this feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, it is difficult to separate it from our own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, this feeling is indeed from the Holy Spirit; thus, we can still differentiate it from our own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, when our fellowship with the Lord ceases, it is difficult for us to have this kind of feeling again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But when our fellowship with the Lord is recovered, this kind of feeling, which seemingly is our own feeling, reappears.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This proves that this feeling does not originate from us, but from the Holy Spirit passing through us.</S>
