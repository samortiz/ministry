   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A LIFE WITHIN THE VEIL 6:4-13 A. The Beloved's Praise 6:4-9</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the maiden arrives at this stage, we see the Lord's satisfaction in her.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This book speaks of a progressive union; the purpose of the union is fellowship, while the meaning of fellowship is identification.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the maiden sees in the King what she has experienced in the King.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The King sees the manifestation of His life in the maiden.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The King's praise is a proclamation of the riches the believers have received through their union with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 4 says, "Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord is viewing the believers from heaven, from within the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, this is something which happens within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord has mentioned her beauty and comeliness previously.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the beauty and comeliness in this verse are more restricted than before.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, "Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Tirzah is where the palace is 1 Kings 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jerusalem is the city of the great King.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Tirzah signifies the heavenly sanctuary, the dwelling of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jerusalem signifies the heavenly Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord is examining our heavenly nature and life within the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In that Jerusalem everything is comely, and in that Tirzah everything is beautiful, because both are God's new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today believers are already displaying the beauty and comeliness of the coming sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Weapons are the most important thing to an army in battle, whereas the banner is the most important thing in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the battle is lost, the banner is put away in shame.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>An unfurled banner signifies the glory of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This verse indicates that the maiden is beautiful and comely before the Lord, as solid as the heavenly city and as serene as the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the same time, she displays the glory of her victory before the enemy and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A life within the veil is not just a life before the Lord, but a life before the enemy, because the heaven in which the saints dwell is the very heaven which the enemy assails.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has no intention for His believers to possess only the heavenly beauty without possessing a warring nature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The heavenly warfare is never abated before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Believers ought to be lovable and terrible at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Believers today have lost their loveliness before the Lord, and they have lost their terribleness before the enemy and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Are men terrified by us?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bible often mentions the terribleness of the Lord; He is terrible because He is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we maintain our holiness and victory, we will see the enemy retreating and the world standing back.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But believers today have sacrificed their terribleness, and neither men nor demons are afraid of them any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 5a says, "Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first phrase in verse 5 is a poetic expression.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The power of love is expressed by the affection in the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord is not rejecting the believers' love; rather, there is the element of encouragement and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just as He turned down the Syrophoenician woman Mark 7:25-29 , delayed two days before going up to Judea John 11:5-7 , told Moses, "Let me alone" Exo 32:10 , and allowed Jacob to hold on to Him Gen 32:26 , He is inviting the maiden's expression of love with a word of seeming rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Turning away is the opposite of fixing one's eyes upon an object.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This speaks not only of love, but of the firmness of love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It seems that He has become weak before her love; this weakness in Him has been displayed often in the face of love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He seems to give a hint of His total helplessness, apparent failure, and lack of defense before love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only those who have experienced the Lord's apparent rejection, delay, denial, and helplessness know the way of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verses 5b to 7 say, "Thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead: thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Just as before, "hair" signifies the power of consecration, while "teeth" signify the power of reception.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The temples or cheeks within the locks signify hidden beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The praise in these verses is the same as in 4:1-3.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But here we see two important facts:</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>1 The Lord's love never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although the maiden failed through her delay and feels that she has sinned through falling into darkness, the Lord treats her just the same as before.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to remove her doubt that He may have changed, He reveals Himself to her with the same words.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What a believer most often lacks after a failure is the assuring faith; it is easy for him to develop a wrong evaluation of his relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We often do not realize how full of doubts we are.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, the Lord uses the same words; He does this to remove our doubts.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>2 Many spiritual experiences need to be repeated even after a believer has reached a higher stage of attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Just as it is necessary to have separating consecrations, the power of reception, and a hidden life at the time of immaturity, the same things are necessary at the time of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some spiritual experiences can change as you progress.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But other spiritual experiences, such as those mentioned here, do not change as you progress.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These experiences take on a deeper significance at a higher stage.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Have we not experienced many repeated lessons in our own spiritual journey?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Are not the lessons learned at the latter stage more perfect than those learned in the initial stage?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The experiences may be the same, but the level and degree are different.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Verse 8 says, "There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All these people are related to Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the world, this may be evil, but spiritually, this presents a beautiful picture to those who understand spiritual types.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our Lord is gaining the whole church with all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Corporately speaking, the Lamb has only one wife.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But individually speaking, He has many lovers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some are like queens, some are like concubines, while others are like virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Adam, Isaac, and Moses all typify Christ marrying a corporate wife.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But Solomon typifies Christ taking individual believers.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It seems that those who are holy and spiritual are not chosen as the type; rather, an unrighteous one is chosen as a type of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Yet the unrighteousness of the person is not typified.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A thief can be a type of the Lord, but only the act of stealing is typified.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All those who have wisdom should understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The experiences of individual believers in their communication and relationship with the Lord's love are not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Some are like queens, others are like concubines, and still others are like virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But whatever they are, they all have a love relationship with the King.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Yet none of them matches the maiden in her pursuit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Verse 9 says, "My dove, my undefiled, is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Here the Lord marks out the one from among all the people who satisfies His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Lord considers her as the unique one.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This does not mean that there is only one person of her kind.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Rather, it means that in the Lord's eyes, she can be considered as the unique one.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>She is absolutely in the Holy Spirit; hence, she is a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>She is also fully separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Therefore, she is indeed "undefiled."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It seems as if she is the only perfect one begotten of grace, the only child of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It seems that among all the products of the work of grace, she is the most excellent one.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Being a child of grace does not merely mean being one who experiences the forbearance of God and who is forgiven by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>All of the works of God in man's heart are works of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Grace means that it is done by God and not by man.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>A person who receives more grace is one who allows God to work on him more, while a person who receives less grace is one who allows God to work on him less.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>God has the grace, but man will not necessarily allow God to do all the works in him.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Everything that is of the self belongs to the law, and everything that is of God belongs to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The church is full of children of grace, yet only a very small number of people will allow grace to work on them to the point of perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Being the only child of grace does not mean that the maiden is the only one; it merely means that she is the most excellent one.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The meaning of the only child is that there is an absolute union with the Lord, and that everything is the Lord's. She has reached a complete union with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>"The daughters saw her, and blessed her."</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Although many believers realize that they are not absolute for the Lord, they know the ones who are absolute for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>They have enough life within them to admire those who are absolute, even though they do not yet have enough life to be absolute for the Lord themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Many people have enough experience of obedience to appreciate those who are absolutely obedient, even though they are not absolute in obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The daughters, queens, and concubines may not admire the maiden in the fleshly sense, but they cannot help but acknowledge the blessedness of the maiden with respect to the grace she has received.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>A life within the veil and everything within man that is from God should be held in high esteem.</S>
