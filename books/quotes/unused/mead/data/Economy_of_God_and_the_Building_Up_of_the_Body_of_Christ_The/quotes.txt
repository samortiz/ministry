[2]  CHAPTER ONE A VIEW OF GOD'S ECONOMY FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT TYPES 1 Scripture Reading: Col 2:17; Heb 8:5; 10:1a OUTLINE Individual types: Adam and Eve Christ and the church Gen 2:18, 21-24; Eph 5:30-32: Adam Christ as the expression of God.
[3]  From Adam, the fallen one, to Noah, the one who worked together with God from a fallen sinner to a saint working together with the Lord: The fallen Adam wearing the skin of the sacrifice a sinner receiving Christ as his covering righteousness Gen 3:21; Gal 3:27; 1 Cor 1:30.
[4]  Abel, the one inheriting salvation, offering up a lamb as a sacrifice a believer living in Christ to become the righteousness of God, being acceptable to Him Gen 4:4; 2 Cor 5:21.
[5]  Enoch, the one pursuing after God, walking with God a believer who pursues after the Lord living together with the Lord Gen 5:22-24; John 14:19b; Gal 2:20.
[6]  As the one inheriting from his grandfather and his father, Jacob being chosen by God, experiencing trials to become the Israel of God, bringing God's blessing to everyone a believer chosen by God, enjoying the love of God the Father and the grace of God the Son, experiencing the transformation of God the Spirit through trials in his environment, to become a mature man to bestow God's blessings upon others Gen 25:23; Rom 9:10-13; Gen 27:41-45; 31:1-2; 32:28; 47:7, 10; 48:9, 15-16, 20; 49:26, 28; 1 Pet 1:2; Rom 8:28; 2 Cor 3:18; 1 Cor 15:58; Heb 6:1; Rom 12:14.
[7]  As the one who in experience forms a part of Jacob, Joseph reigning and dispensing widely the riches of God to everyone a believer who is transformed, overcoming, and mature, reigning for the Lord and dispensing the riches of God in Christ to everyone Gen 41:40-44, 55-57; 2 Cor 2:14-16; Eph 3:8; Rev 20:4, 6.
[8]  Prayer: Lord, our hearts are rejoicing, and our spirits are praising.
[9]  On man's side, we are also of three parts.
[10]  In this chapter we will first look at God's economy in the types of the Old Testament.
[11]  FROM ADAM, THE FALLEN ONE, TO NOAH, THE ONE WHO WORKED TOGETHER WITH GOD
[12]  CHAPTER TWO A VIEW OF GOD'S ECONOMY FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT TYPES 2 Scripture Reading: Col 2:17; Heb 8:5; 10:1a OUTLINE The corporate type: The corporate Israel the church as the Body of Christ Exo 12:3a; Gal 1:2; 6:16: Experiencing the Passover, having God's judgment pass over them the whole church experiencing Christ as the Passover Exo 12:21, 13; 1 Cor 5:7-8.
[13]  Prayer: Lord, by Your precious blood we look to You again.
[14]  You are the Lord who is with us and the One who speaks to us.
[15]  For this, God went on from Genesis to Exodus, working Himself into the corporate Israel that they would become the house of God, which is God's habitation on earth as typified by the tabernacle in the midst of the Israelites.
[16]  Enjoying the Manna from Heaven as the Daily Supply
[17]  Defeating the Enemy, Gaining the Land, and Building the Temple
[18]  When the Israelites entered Canaan, God delivered into their hands the people of that land.
[19]  Furthermore, we deny the natural life by passing through the death of Christ, dying and resurrecting together with Him, and enter into Him, being joined together with all the saints to be built up into a solid dwelling place of God in Him.
[20]  CHAPTER THREE A VIEW OF GOD'S ECONOMY FROM THE NEW TESTAMENT REVELATION 1 Scripture Reading: Eph 3:2-11; 1:9-11 OUTLINE God becoming flesh to bring Himself into man John 1:14: Becoming a God-man.
[21]  This God-man living a human life on earth: Living and expressing God in the human life John 6:57a; Acts 10:38.
[22]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You for bringing us once again to Your Word.
[23]  Open and release Your mystery to us that we would see God's eternal economy.
[24]  THIS GOD-MAN LIVING A HUMAN LIFE ON EARTH
[25]  CHAPTER FOUR A VIEW OF GOD'S ECONOMY FROM THE NEW TESTAMENT REVELATION 2 Scripture Reading: Eph 3:2-11; 1:9-11 OUTLINE The ascended God-man as the Head in His ascension: Pouring out the Holy Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, the realization and reality of Him as the Head, upon all His believers throughout all the ages and among all the nations Acts 2:1-4, 33.
[26]  Baptizing them into one Body, the church 1 Cor 12:13a.
[27]  The church being given to drink of Him as the Spirit and becoming one Spirit with Him 1 Cor 12:13b; 6:17: Enjoying His all-inclusive Spirit as the life supply Phil 1:19.
[28]  The church as the Body of Christ being expressed as the local churches in all the localities to be the golden lampstands shining forth Christ Rev 1:11-12, 20b: In administrative affairs, being administered locally.
[29]  We have seen the first part of God's New Testament economy, which is mainly concerning the Lord Jesus.
[30]  The economy of God is the Triune God working Himself into tripartite men that they may become the members of Christ to be constituted the Body of Christ.
[31]  Through this He became a wonderful God-man, being at the same time God as well as man.
[32]  THE ASCENDED GOD-MAN AS THE HEAD IN HIS ASCENSION
[33]  Hence, on the day of Pentecost, the Body of Christ, the church, was brought into being through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
[34]  From the Bible we see that soon after the age of the apostles the local churches as the golden lampstands became desolate, degraded, and fallen Rev 2:14-15, 20 and were carried away to the mysterious Great Babylon Rev 17:5 ; this is similar to the Israelites in the Old Testament who were taken captive into Babylon through their degradation and failure.
[35]  CHAPTER FIVE THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST 1 Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18; Eph 4:8-14 OUTLINE Christ's prophecy Matt 16:18: "On this rock Christ and the revelation of Christ received by the apostles I will build My church."
[36]  Christ as the ascended Head giving gifts to men Eph 4:8-11: Some apostles: Those who have received the revelation of God's New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church Matt 16:16-18; Gal 1:11-12, 15-16; Eph 3:3-4, 8-11; 5:32.
[37]  Those who are able to preach the gospel of Christ to save the sinners chosen and called by God, bringing them unto Christ Gal 1:16a; Eph 3:8; 2 Cor 11:2.
[38]  From this message forward, we will consider the building up of the Body of Christ.
[39]  The Gates of Hades Not Being Able to Prevail against the Church
[40]  In Matthew 16:18 the Lord continued by saying, "the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it the church ."
[41]  The prophets are the second class of gifts given by the ascended Christ Eph 4:11 .
[42]  The prophets are those who through the Lord's revelation, speak for the Lord, speak forth the Lord, and speak the Lord into others.
[43]  CHAPTER SIX THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: Eph 4:15-16 OUTLINE The perfected saints directly building up the Body of Christ Eph 4:15-16: Holding to truth in love: God's New Testament economy.
[44]  Out from the Head: All the Body causing the growth of the Body of Christ: Through every joint of the supply every specially gifted part of the Body of Christ for the supplying of every member of the Body of Christ.
[45]  Ephesians 4:12-16 occupies a special place in the New Testament because it shows us the mystery concerning the building up of the Body of Christ.
[46]  Without these few verses, we would not know how to build up the Body of Christ.
[47]  First, we must say that to build up the Body of Christ is not to build up a congregation.
[48]  THE PERFECTED SAINTS DIRECTLY BUILDING UP THE BODY OF CHRIST
[49]  In the last chapter we have seen that in the building up of the Body of Christ the first One who builds is Christ.
[50]  Our growth in life is a growth into Christ the Head.
