 <h2 class="head1">OUR GOAL IN PRACTICING THE BIBLICAL WAY</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that in practicing the biblical way our goal is to arrive at one of the major items in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. What we are dealing with now may be the last item, the concluding item, of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It seems that we are now very close to the end of this age, the conclusion of the ages, which will bring the Lord back. However, we should not say that this new way will definitely bring the Lord back. The New Testament teaches us that no one can know the day and the hour of the Lord&rsquo;s return (Matt. 24:36). In the past century, certain ones prophesied concerning the time at which the Lord Jesus would come back. Some went out with white robes to wait for His return, but nothing happened. We should not make the same mistake. Nevertheless, according to our knowledge of the Bible, it seems that this new way may be the last and concluding recovery of the Lord.</p>
<p>This new way is crucial, it is important, and it is just in time to meet our present need. I feel that I have come to a point that without such a change I just cannot go on in my ministry. This compels me very much. Furthermore, the ministry is altogether related to our living. If I would not know how to minister, it would be hard for me to know how to live. Our living must have a purpose; it must be for the purpose of the ministry. If I would not be here for this change, I would not know how to minister and what the purpose of my living should be. I would be lost. This is why I am endeavoring and am so desperate. In the years since October of 1984, many have seen the same thing I have seen. Therefore, we all must endeavor to carry this out with much patience, gradually yet positively.</p>
<p>To practice the biblical way is not merely to change a way. It is to fulfill the Lord&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire according to His word concerning the building up of His Body (Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:12-16). This is not merely to fulfill some of the prophesies in the New Testament. It is to accomplish the unique, central thing in the entire universe&mdash;the building up of the Body of Christ. We have not yet seen the accomplishment of such a thing. Where has this building been in the past, and where is it today? In the whole universe there is not yet such a thing. The building up of the Body of Christ has not yet been completed. With many Christians this building has hardly begun. Perhaps even among us over the last sixty years, this building has barely begun. This is a great and crucial matter prophesied by the Lord and the Apostle Paul in the New Testament. This is crucial; it must be fulfilled and completed, and we are here for this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S DAY MORNING MEETING</h2>
<p>The saints and the elders in all the churches must consider what we should do with the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting. To have one speaker designated to speak to a great audience is traditional and should be condemned. Whether a particular meeting should be accepted or renounced does not depend on the day or time at which it occurs but on the nature and reality of that meeting.</p>
<p>Today most nations on the earth consider the Lord&rsquo;s Day to be a holiday. We call this day the Lord&rsquo;s Day, whereas the nations call it Sunday. Sunday is a name according to pagan religion, meaning the day of the sun. This is a superstitious title, and, strictly speaking, we should not use it. Around the world, regardless of their religion, most countries have this day as a holiday. It is a convenient time for people to do many things. In a good sense, if we do not utilize this day, we will miss something. Therefore it is better to hold an important meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. If we set up an important meeting on a weekday, most people will be busy at work. They may not even be free to come to the meetings in the evening. The Lord&rsquo;s Day is the best time for a large number of the saints to be gathered together. We may not need to change the day or the time of our present meetings, but we surely need to change the nature of the meetings. By doing so we will take advantage of this day. To set up a meeting on this day will be convenient, not only to the Christian believers but also to the Gentiles. It will accommodate their situation. However, this does not mean that we still should keep the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning service in the traditional way.</p>
