   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Thirty-three HOW LONG WILL YOU HESITATE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BETWEEN TWO OPINIONS?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture: 1 Kings 18:21 The two sides in the universe Explain that in the universe there is God, and there is also Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God and Satan are the two sides or two sources in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On God s side there is light, good, heaven, life, etc. On Satan s side there is darkness, evil, hell, death, etc. Because of the two sides or two sources in the universe, man has two possible choices: he may choose to follow God, which means to choose light, a good life, and heaven; or he may choose to follow Satan, which means to choose darkness, evil, death, and hell.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The conflict within man Because man has two possible choices, he has a conflict within him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand he is inclined toward light, but on the other hand he is drawn toward darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He likes good, but he also has an appetite for evil.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He desires life, but he also bends toward death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He wants heaven, but he cannot stay away from hell.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here we may give some examples to describe the condition within man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then explain that the conflict within man is a battle between God and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever man inwardly bends toward light, toward good, and toward life, that is the Spirit of God working inside of him to gain him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever man inwardly bends toward darkness, evil, and death, that is Satan s evil spirit working inside of him to gain him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man s indecision toward the gospel</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we may draw people s attention to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many people have heard the gospel, agreed with it, acknowledged it, and even almost believed it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But because they were still fond of darkness, evil, death, and the things of the flesh, they were not able to make a final decision.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The desire to believe is the working of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But indecision is the hindering of the evil spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At this point we should describe the feeling of the moving of the Holy Spirit and the feeling of indecision.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The urging of the Holy Spirit You are hearing the gospel today because of the reminding and urging of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Holy Spirit not only urges you during the gospel meeting, but also often urges you in private.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, the strongest urging is in the gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Listen to the urging voice of the Holy Spirit saying, How long will you remain in indecision?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now you must check with yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the gospel is not worthy of being believed, you should refuse it right away.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If hell is the place you would like to go, you should go right ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If God ought not to be accepted, you should put Him aside.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Obviously, you know that you should choose good and life; yet you would not give up darkness, evil, and death!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How long will you falter between two opinions?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The way of decision It is easy to make a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The faster you decide, the easier it will be.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, you should make a decision right now.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ask all those who want to make a decision to please stand up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Saying it in this way makes it sound very easy to stand up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To stand up is to make a decision.</S>
