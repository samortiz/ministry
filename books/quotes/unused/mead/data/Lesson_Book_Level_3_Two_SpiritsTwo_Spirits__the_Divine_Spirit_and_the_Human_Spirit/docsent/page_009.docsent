   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Philippians 1 Paul was saved from a particular situation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapter two he goes on to point out how the believers may experience a constant salvation in the ordinary things of daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, 2:14 says, "Do all things without murmurings and reasonings."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Murmurings and reasonings are things we experience daily.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may not experience hate or anger every day, but we certainly reason and murmur every day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may often be unhappy with your situation at home or at school.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The next time that you feel your situation is a "prison," you need to declare, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thank You for my wonderful situation!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Dear Lord, You are all that I need!"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is not a theory; it is practical and experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This will save you from so many negative things and will surely cause you to express Christ to those around you.</S>
