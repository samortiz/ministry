<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1>

<P>The contents of the outlines in this book are from notes and printed publications of Brother Witness Lee that have been released by him from 1964 through 1990. Our brother points out that the Lord's table meeting is the most important meeting of a local church. We pray that these outlines will uplift our vision and practice of the Lord's table meeting as we remember Him and display His death until He comes (1 Cor. 11:26).</P>
