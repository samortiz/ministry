<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MINGLING OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>The Lord Jesus was not born in such a simple way, but in a very meaningful way&#151;as the issue of all kinds of human generations, from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, through the kings, and then through the captured and returned ones. However, this is only one aspect of the Lord Jesus. Another aspect is the mingling with the Triune God. He was not only the issue of many generations of the human race, but He was also mingled with the Triune God. He was the issue of forty-one generations of humanity mingled with the Holy Father, the Holy Son, and the Holy Spirit. According to the revelation of the Bible, the Father is in the Son (John 14:11), the Son is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), and the Spirit is the application of the Triune God to the mingled humanity (2 Cor. 13:14). When we have the Lord Jesus, we have everything. In this One we have Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, David, Solomon, and Mary. We also have the Holy Father, the Holy Son, and the Holy Spirit. He was the issue of forty-one human generations mingled with the Triune God. It will take eternity for us to fully apprehend this matter. Only in eternity will we fully understand what the Lord Jesus is.</P><P>The Lord Jesus is not so low and so simple. He is much more than a Savior who had pity on poor sinners and saved them from hell. He is wonderful! We need to pray over chapter one of Matthew again in the light of all the history of the Old Testament. Then we will see what He is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JESUS AND EMMANUEL</H2><P>Jesus means "Jehovah-plus." Jesus is not only Jehovah; He is Jehovah-plus. In Hebrew, the name of Jehovah is included in the name of Jesus. Jesus means Jehovah plus "the Savior," or plus "the salvation, the deliverance." Jesus is Jehovah plus the all-inclusive salvation. Emmanuel means God "with us," another plus. The Lord Jesus is not only God; He is God "with us." We would tell our Jewish friends that we are richer than they. We have what they have, but they do not have what we have. They have Jehovah, and they have God; but we have Jehovah plus "salvation" and God plus "with us." We would invite them to come and join us. They would have everything to gain and nothing to lose. We would never join them, because we have something richer, higher, better, and greater; this is the Lord Jesus. He, as the issue of all the human generations mingled with the Triune God, is Jehovah-plus and God-plus. From now on, surely you will have another taste when you call upon the name of the Lord Jesus. His name is so rich, so sweet, and He is rich to all who call upon His name (Rom. 10:12). Hallelujah for Jesus! Hallelujah for Jehovah-plus! Hallelujah for Emmanuel! Hallelujah for God-plus! Jehovah-plus and God-plus is the seed which has been sown into us.</P>
