The whole Bible is the unveiling of God, and Revelation is the conclusion of the entire Bible. So in this book we have the ultimate and complete revelation of who God is. God is triune. In Revelation, the book which reveals things in an ultimate way, we see something deeper, higher, richer, and sweeter concerning the Triune God. </P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. GRACE AND PEACE FROM THE TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>In chapter one there is a wonderful greeting. Revelation 1:4 and 5 say, "Grace to you and peace from Him Who is, and Who was, and Who is coming, and from the seven Spirits Who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth." Here it says that you will receive grace and peace from the Triune God. He "Who is, and Who was, and Who is coming" is God the eternal Father. The "seven Spirits Who are before His throne" are God the Spirit. Jesus Christ, of course, is God the Son. He is the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth. Most of the Epistles begin with a greeting but none can compare with this one. This is the ultimate "Triune God greeting." If you would pray-read this verse, you could not help but enjoy grace and peace from the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SPEAKING SPIRIT</H2><P>In chapters two and three we see that the Lord is just the Spirit. In these chapters there are seven epistles to seven local churches. At the beginning of each epistle it is the Lord who speaks (2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14). But at the end of all seven epistles it says that it is the Spirit speaking (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). This proves that whenever the Lord Jesus speaks He is the speaking Spirit. The Lord is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Lord. The speaking Lord is the speaking Spirit.</P><P>Have you ever heard the Lord's speaking? Certainly you cannot hear Him with your physical ears. But because Christ is the speaking Spirit, He can speak something into your spirit, your "spiritual ears." When you read the Word of God with an open spirit, the Spirit will speak something of Christ into you. In the letter to Ephesus the Lord says, "But I have this against you, that you have left your first love. Remember therefore whence you have fallen and repent" (Rev. 2:4-5). Then verse 7 says, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." As you read these verses you may realize that the Lord is not your first love, your best love. That means you love something else&#151;like clothing, music, or computer games&#151;more than the Lord Himself. That feeling inside you is from the speaking Spirit. That is the Lord speaking to you. You must immediately repent and turn back to Him by praying, "O Lord, I love You only. I don't care for so many other things. I want to be crazily in love with You. I love You supremely. You are my best love, my first love." Then the grace and peace of the Triune God will fill you. You will enjoy the presence of the Lord as grace and your heart will be at peace with God. Hallelujah, He loves us so much! He should be our first love.</P>
