<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE TRUTH OF THE MYSTERY IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h2 class=head1>A BIRD’S-EYE VIEW OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2><p>Of all the outlines in the New Testament Recovery Version, the outline of the Gospel of John may be considered the best. If we want to know a certain book thoroughly, we must begin with its outline. The outline of a book helps us to have a complete bird’s-eye view of that book<h2 class=head2>Two Main Sections of the Gospel of John</h2><p>From the outline of the Gospel of John we see that the entire book can be divided into two main sections. The first main section, chapters one through thirteen, concerns “The eternal Word incarnated coming to bring God into man.” The second main section, chapters fourteen through twenty-one, concerns “Jesus crucified and Christ resurrected going to prepare the way to bring man into God, and as the Spirit coming to abide and live in the believers for the building of God’s habitation.” The crucified One is Jesus, while the resurrected One is Christ. Through Jesus’ crucifixion and Christ’s resurrection the way has been prepared for man to be brought into God. In brief, the first section of the Gospel of John speaks about bringing God into man, and the second section speaks about bringing man into God. How could God be brought into man? God was brought into man through the eternal Word’s coming in His incarnation. How could man be brought into God? Man was brought into God through Jesus Christ’s going in His death and resurrection. Therefore, His coming was accomplished in His incarnation, and His going was accomplished in His death and resurrection.<p>Moreover, after His resurrection He comes to us again as the Spirit. He came the first time in His incarnation. Then He went in His death and resurrection, and following this He comes again as the Spirit. He came in incarnation to bring God into man, and He went in death and resurrection to bring man into God. However, He was not able to accomplish His purpose just by His coming and His going. Thus, as the Spirit He comes again to abide and live in the believers for the building of God’s habitation.<p>God’s work is not done until His habitation is built up. Although God was brought into man, and man was brought into God, God still needs a habitation. In order to produce such a habitation, it is necessary that the Spirit come to abide and live in the believers. This is the bird’s-eye view of the whole book of the Gospel of John.<p>The two main sections of the Gospel of John are as distinct as a person’s eyebrows. Within the two main sections there are sub-points, and each sub-point has many small items that give further explanation. For example, the first main section, composed of thirteen chapters, is on “The eternal Word incarnated coming to bring God into man.” The first sub-point, which is in chapter one, is: “Introduction to life and building.” The first small item is: “The Word in eternity past, who was God, through creation coming as life and light to bring forth the children of God.” This is covered in verses 1 to 13, concerning the eternal Word, who was God (v. 1), in whom was life, which was the light of men (v. 4), and in whom also were all things, for all things came into being through Him (v. 3). Therefore, life, light, and creation are included in this small item. The One who came in incarnation was such a One.
