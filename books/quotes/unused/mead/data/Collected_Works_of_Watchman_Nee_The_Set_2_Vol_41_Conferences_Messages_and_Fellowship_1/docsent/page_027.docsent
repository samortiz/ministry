   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OVERCOMING LIFE BEING AN EXCHANGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RATHER THAN A CHANGE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Last year in Chefoo, a Christian said to me, "I need a great change.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once I am changed, everything will be fine."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I said, "Your hope can never be realized."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He said, "You do not know me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How do you know that there is no hope in me?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I said, "I knew you long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before you were born, I knew you already.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What are you?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You are hopelessness itself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has said in the Bible that there is no hope in you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there were some hope in you, God would not have crucified you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The cross is God's valuation of you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It means that you only deserve to die.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You are worthy of nothing but death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You should die, and you must die.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You are absolutely useless.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God was not mistreating you when He crucified you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You say that you want to change, but I say that you can never change for the better.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You can never improve.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This hope can never be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It does not matter how much a cow changes; it will still be a cow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It does not matter how much a pig changes; it will still be a pig.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No matter how much you change, you will still be yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You want to change.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But let me say something to you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Add the letters e and x to the word change and make it exchange.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What you need is not a change, but an exchange."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No matter how much I, Watchman Nee, change, the life within me will always be the life of a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's way of salvation and His method of deliverance is not changing what is evil and weak within me into something that is good and powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's way of salvation is to set me aside.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Henceforth, it is no longer I, but Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God has exchanged my life for the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not a change, but an exchange.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God put Christ within us so that He would live instead of us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is victory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A man may have a bad temper, but God's way of salvation is not to change his bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His way of salvation is to put Christ within him so that Christ becomes his patience and meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God intends that Christ be our sanctification, righteousness, humility, patience, etc. This means that everything is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is Christ who is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the meaning of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Victory is something that God gives to us; it is not something we strive to attain.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many people read only the letter of the Bible but do not understand the reality behind the letter of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They do not understand what Galatians 2:20 means.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Over ten years ago, when I was first saved, someone read me a story about a little eight-year-old girl.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She was saved and had the excellent experience of overcoming sin, and she knew what victory meant to her.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>During a meeting at the Keswick Convention, someone asked how she would overcome when temptation came.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She answered, "Every time temptation comes, I will not speak to it, I will not fight against it, and I will not ask it to go away.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When Satan knocks on my door, I tell the Lord, Lord, You open the door for me.'</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When Satan hears the Lord opening the door, he will say, Sir, sorry, I have knocked on the wrong door,' and he will turn and run away immediately."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The first time I heard this story, I smiled like you do today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At that time, even though I knew that the little girl was right, I did not know how right she was because I did not have the experience yet.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>During the past few years, I have learned this secret of overcoming sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The secret is for Christ to deal with the sins instead of dealing with them myself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I do not need to resist sins; Christ resists them for me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I do not have to fight against temptations; Christ fights against them for me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I do not have to reject Satan; Christ rejects him for me.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I do not have to overcome sin; Christ overcomes it for me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I do not have to exercise patience; Christ becomes my patience for me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I do not have to be pure and humble; Christ is my purity and humility.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Son of God is in me; Christ is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is my victory, and this is my everything.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I cannot help but praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Son of God was willing to die on the cross for me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today He is willing to live within me.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is sitting on the throne in heaven, but at the same time, He is also living within me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God has given His Son's life to us for this very purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He has set aside man's life and put His Son's life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our living and our everything depends on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many people think that as long as they receive a package of patience, humility, or love from heaven everything will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But we have to realize that God's salvation in Christ is a wholesale transaction instead of a retail transaction.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We do not need to ask for a little today and a little tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He has put everything within us once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT BEING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Many people say that there are nine kinds of fruit of the Holy Spirit in Galatians 5:22 and 23.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They think that the Holy Spirit has nine different kinds of fruit and that we take in this fruit one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is like saying that we first take in a fruit called love.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Now love is within us, but we do not have joy yet.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>So we move on and take in another fruit called joy.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After we have joy, we move on to take in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But there is not such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We have to realize that the word fruit in the phrase the fruit of the Spirit is singular in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There is only one fruit of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Love, joy, peace, endurance, etc. are all part of the one fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Once we have the fruit of the Spirit, we have all nine virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we do not have the fruit of the Spirit, we do not have any of the nine virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We cannot say that we have one kind but are short of the other eight.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If we have one, we have all.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we are short of one, we are short of all.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Christ is the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When we receive Christ into us, we have the entire fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We often ask what the fruit of the Spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But God asks who the fruit of the Spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The fruit of the Spirit is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When we have Christ, we have the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we have Christ, we have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In the eyes of God, we do not obtain these things item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Rather, we obtain the whole Christ once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Once we have Christ, we have the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Many people have tried to buy a little grace from God here and there.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The result is nothing but failure.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Let me ask: You have been praying for patience for a long time, but have you received it yet?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Christ is in us as our life, and He is living for us.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>What else do we need?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Once we see that Christ is our life and that He is living for us, we will immediately have all the grace that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The Chinese have an expression: "As long as the green mountain remains, there is no fear that one will run out of wood for fire."</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Christ is our "green mountain," and the nine aspects of the fruit of the Spirit are the trees growing on this "mountain."</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If we want to be overcoming in our lives, our eyes have to be set continually on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The kind of Christians that God is after are not those who imitate Christ or those who have received a little power here and there.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The kind of Christians that God is after are those who will set aside themselves and allow Christ to live instead of them.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>With this replacement, there will be the proper walk.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>When Christ lives for us and within us, we become Christ, and we can overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Otherwise, we will not live Christ, and we will not overcome no matter how we live.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Victory is Christ becoming everything within us and living for us.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This is the overcoming life.</S>
