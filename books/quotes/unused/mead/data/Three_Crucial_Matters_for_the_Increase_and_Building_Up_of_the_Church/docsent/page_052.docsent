   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE NORMAL CHRISTIAN LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 4:10; 5:10; 2 Pet 1:2; 3:18; Acts 6:7; 12:24; 19:20</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should all speak whenever we come together.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should not speak idle words, human words, or negative words.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead, we should speak words of God, that is, words of Spirit, light, life, grace, blessing, and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE NORMAL, PROPER CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Concerning the home meetings, we have considered a life of pursuing the truth and the importance of being filled with the Lord s word in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we rise early in the morning, we should first contact the Lord and fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should then enjoy the Lord s Word in order to be filled with His speaking during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This will enable us to preach the gospel at work and to live a meeting life in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We will be able to speak the Lord s words to one another in the meetings, and the words we speak will be words of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>May we all be led into a proper, normal Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The most important thing in such a living is to call O Lord Jesus the moment we wake up in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As soon as we get out of bed, we should fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can enjoy two verses from the Word, and we can read while praying and pray while reading.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All day long we should be soaked in the Lord s word; then spontaneously we will live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all have a heart and a burden to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not preach the gospel in an ostentatious way but in a spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In other words, preaching the gospel is our living and our occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If someone asked me what my occupation is, I would say that I am a gospel preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I hope that all the brothers and sisters can also say that they are gospel preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Preaching the gospel is our main occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The jobs that we do to meet the necessities of our living are side jobs; they are secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The most important goal in our Christian life is to preach the Lord Jesus and bring people into the Lord so that they can follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This will bring in the kingdom of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After fellowshipping with the Lord in the morning, we should stay saturated with the Lord s word, live Christ, and preach the gospel during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the evening we should not merely attend a meeting but rather go and meet in order to offer our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through preaching the gospel, our relatives, classmates, and colleagues may be brought to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we feel to visit someone in the evening, we should go.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may miss a meeting, but we will be meeting with someone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At another time we may feel burdened to meet with our family at home.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whether we go out or stay home, we should come together to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The words attend a meeting imply that we do not need to do anything but simply sit, listen, and look around.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the words go and meet mean that we are active participants, not spectators.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are going to play basketball, we do not attend basketball; we play basketball.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The difference is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not attend a meeting; we should go to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not attend a prayer meeting; rather, we should go to a prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To go to a prayer meeting means that we go to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is a great difference in these two expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should all study the Word every day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should also pray, sing, and speak the truth to others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not speak idle words; we should speak the Lord Jesus and the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In addition to this, we should have an occupation as a side job to cover the needs of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are able to cover our livelihood by working eight hours a day, we should not work more hours even if we are offered a higher salary.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are not slaves to this world, and the world is not worthy of us Heb 11:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every evening we can visit our relatives or friends.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we do this for several hours in the evening, we may save two people or edify four.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is much better than working overtime and having an increase in salary.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the normal living of a Christian; this is the genuine, proper Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are not here for our education, our career, or for money.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are those who spend our energy on the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that we labor on the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>GOD S WORD AS GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>NEEDING TO PROSPER, GROW, AND MULTIPLY</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>First Peter 4:10; 5:10; 2 Peter 1:2; and 3:18 can be grouped together into one category because they all speak of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>First Peter 4:10 says, Each one, as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are stewards ministering grace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is a pity that the Chinese Union Version translates the word grace as gift.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It says that we are good stewards of the varied gifts of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the original Greek, the meaning of the word varied implies more than a large amount; it also implies a large variety.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, varied implies a large variety as well as a large quantity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For example, one hundred small cakes may be a large quantity, but there may not be a large variety of cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But if the one hundred cakes consist of British biscuits, Danish pastries, and German bread, then there are many varieties.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For this reason, the Recovery Version of the Bible translates the phrase as varied grace, implying that there is largeness both in number and in variety.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>First Peter 5:10 says, The God of all grace.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our God is a God of all grace, and this grace multiplies.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For this reason, 2 Peter 1:2 says, Grace to you and peace be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Chinese Union Version translates be multiplied as be added bountifully.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The word bountifully is an adverb or an auxiliary in the Chinese, but in Greek this word is a verb meaning to multiply and to increase.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It refers to the grace that is multiplying in us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This means that grace will multiply and increase in us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Eventually, the apostle Peter admonishes us to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Grace is varied, all-inclusive, and multiplying; it is inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, we should grow in this grace.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Acts 6:7; 12:24; and 19:20 belong to another group which says that the Lord s word grows and multiplies.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Acts 6:7 says, The word of God grew.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Anything that grows must have life; hence, the Lord s word has life since it can grow.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A rock that is planted will never grow.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, any kind of seed will grow if it is planted.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Just like a planted seed, the Lord s word grows in us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Acts 12:24 says, The word of God grew and multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God s word not only grows but also multiplies.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Acts 19:20 says, Thus, the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we put these two groups of verses together, we can see the relationship between grace and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In the Bible the Word is God, the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Bible also shows that grace is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>John 1:14 says, The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In this verse the Word and grace are connected.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This verse also shows that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Word came to dwell in us as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This grace is the embodiment of the Word; hence, the Word is also called the word of His grace Acts 14:3; 20:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The genuine, proper Christian life is a life that spends time in the Word and enjoys the word of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The Word is God, and grace is also God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Hence, we should enjoy God and grace every day.</S>
