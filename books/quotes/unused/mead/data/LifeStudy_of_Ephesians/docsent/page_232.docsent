   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE EIGHTY PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY GROWING UP INTO CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 4:12-16, 22-24</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have pointed out that the church is not only the Body, but also the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the Body, the church needs Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But as the new man, the church needs Christ as the person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, trees have life, but they do not have a person and therefore have no personality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As human beings, however, we have both life and personality, for we are persons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>CHRIST BECOMING THE PERSON IN OUR HEARTS</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because the church is not only the Body with Christ as life but also the new man with Christ as the person, Paul in 3:17 emphasizes the importance of Christ making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although our spirit is a vessel to contain God, the spirit is not the center of personality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The center of personality is the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The various functions of our personality our mind, emotion, and will are directly related to our heart, not to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because all the functions of personality are concentrated in the heart, it is the place where Christ desires to make His home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ as the life-giving Spirit is now in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, He wants to spread into our hearts and make His home there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through regeneration we have Christ as the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But through transformation Christ will spread from our spirit into our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every regenerated person has Christ in his spirit, but not many have allowed Christ to spread into their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the reason Paul prayed that we would be strengthened into our inner man so that Christ may make His home in our hearts 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It seems as if Paul wanted to tell the Ephesians, Because you have been saved and regenerated, you have Christ in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But I m concerned that you have not allowed Christ to spread into your hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, I pray for you that you may be strengthened in your spirit by the Spirit so that Christ may make His home in your hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to take Christ not only as the life in our spirit, but also as the person in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Christ is in our spirit, He is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, when He spreads into our heart, He also becomes our person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all have Christ in our spirit, but I wonder how much Christ has spread into our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sisters, do you take Christ as your person when you go shopping?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you allow Him to make home in your heart as you are deciding what to buy?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For the most part, you are the one who makes these decisions, not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have Christ in your spirit as life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The problem is that you confine Him to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Deep within I am afraid that you say, Lord Jesus, You are my life in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when it comes to shopping, I want You to stay in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let me shop according to what is in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I want to buy the things I like.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Lord, my spirit is Your sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But my heart is reserved for me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When you pray, you may contact the Lord in your spirit, only to leave Him and go shopping according to your own desire and choice.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Of course, the sisters may not put this into words, but this may be their attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I doubt that many sisters consult the Lord about their shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This indicates that in the practical matter of shopping they do not take Christ as their person in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Simply having Christ as life does not produce the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to have the proper church life, we must take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Remember that the church is the new man as well as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As the new man, the church needs Christ as the person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The main problem is not with the life, but with the person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no need to adjust the life, but there is the need for a change of person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our mind, emotion, and will all need to be adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>With the church life, the problem is not only with our taking Christ as life; it is also with our taking Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Very few saints take Christ as their person in an adequate way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To have Christ as our person is deeper, higher, and fuller than to have Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Ephesians 3 Paul did not pray that the saints would have Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He prayed that they would take Him as their person by allowing Him to make His home in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is our need today.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whatever we do, we should do by taking Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The question is not what we do, but who is doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Are we the ones, or is it Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Concerning shopping, it is not a matter of what we intend to buy; it is a matter of who is buying that particular item.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Are we the ones buying it, or is it Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we do not take Christ as our person, it may even be wrong in the eyes of the Lord to purchase a Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, the question is not what we do or what we buy; it is who is doing that thing or buying that item.</S>
