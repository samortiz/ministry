   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXERCISING OURSELVES IN WORD AND CONDUCT AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NOT LETTING OTHERS DESPISE OUR YOUTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you study the footnotes in the New Testament Recovery Version, you will discover that those footnotes were not composed in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I revised the footnotes repeatedly until they accurately expressed the meaning of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To study in Taiwan you need to strive and to be industrious.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our striving and being industrious are related to our character.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What Paul said to Timothy was entirely related to the matter of character.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Perhaps you may say that although the letters to Timothy mention many matters, the word character is never mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the charge that Paul gave to Timothy was definitely a teaching regarding the matter of character.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1 Timothy 4:12 Paul said to Timothy, Let no one despise your youth, but be a pattern to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse has a very profound meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You should not let anyone despise your youth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, if your attire is unsuitable and your speech is inappropriate, how could others not despise your youth?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you are careless and frivolous in your actions, people will spontaneously despise your youth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, what Paul was telling Timothy in this verse was that Timothy should be dignified in his conduct and actions and proper in his speech.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What he said, how much he said, and when and how he said things should have caused others to respect him rather than despise his youth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this verse Paul first mentioned our words, then our conduct, behavior, and actions, and lastly our love, faith, and purity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Love and faith are matters of life, whereas our words and conduct are matters of our character.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we were to write this verse, we would mention faith and love first and then conduct and word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, in doing so we would mistake the means for the end and say exactly the opposite of what Paul said.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I do not intend to boast, but I would like to testify that when I was thirty-one years old, I was already pursuing the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One day a brother said to me, Brother Lee, I would like to know what your background is, because you seem to be someone of noble birth in your words, actions, conduct, and manner of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I answered, My background is not noble but poor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I was ten and was beginning to understand the affairs of human life, I realized that my family was in a destitute situation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I was of a lowborn family, but I was strict regarding my education.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, as one who was still in school, whenever I stood up to speak, people around me, including the elderly, would become quiet and respectfully listen to my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Wherever I go in the United States, those who have a higher status than I still respect me, even though I am Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I seemed like a lower class person, they would not respect me, and it would be difficult for them to accept my speaking, no matter how well I could speak.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, in order that others would not despise your youth, you should learn of me and be strict from your youth in disciplining yourself and taking the initiative to learn by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the recovery we emphasize the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The way of life is not a matter of ethics, morality, or culture but a matter of walking according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In light of this, some may say that character training is contrary to our emphasis in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They may say that character training is not a matter of life but a matter of developing our bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, surely the character of a person who walks according to the Spirit would be much higher than the character of a person who develops his bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we talk about life, but our character is lower than the character of those who develop their bright virtue, then we make the salvation of the Lord Jesus worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I hate for this to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the recovery we are pursuing the truth, we are learning to take the way of life, and we are proper with regard to morality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, when we examine the matter of our human character, immediately our inadequate condition is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are lacking in diligence and seriousness, and we are short in pursuing, making progress, and learning.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This makes me very sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A DISCIPLINED CHARACTER</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>BEING NECESSARY FOR PROGRESS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>IN THE LORD S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because of our shortages with regard to character, the church is not highly respected in people s eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our way of working is not very high, so when a Christian group with a way that is superior to ours emerges, we immediately fall behind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thirty-five years ago in the Far East, there were not many groups that had as many high quality people as we had in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we were in mainland China, a group of saints was raised up among us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we officially began the work in Taiwan on August 1, 1949, we had only four to five hundred brothers and sisters on the island of Taiwan and a little over a hundred in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 1955, after six years, there were 45,000 believers in the churches on the entire island.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Other groups could not match our large size.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, today these groups have adopted a number of our ways and even improved on them through further study and revision.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have the truth and life, but because we have been so closed to new things and have confined ourselves to the old ways, we have fallen behind the other groups.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, some Christian groups are now using small groups to bring hundreds and thousands of people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thirty years ago we already had the practice of the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We used the small groups as a means of going from house to house to bring people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, we unconsciously dropped the practice of the small groups and started to bring people to the meeting hall to gather them for conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Outwardly, the conferences seemed to be merely conferences, but in reality they had become occasions for celebrity speeches.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This may be likened to gathering students to a school that does not have classes, classrooms, or teachers but only a few celebrities who come in to speak, and hoping that the students will eventually be able to graduate after hearing this kind of speaking for ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our work in the past replaced the cause with the effect.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Speeches display a person s achievements, but if you want to learn the way to attain to those achievements yourself, you need to go through certain courses and learn them sequentially, lesson by lesson.</S>
