The Valuation to Be Also according to the Number of Years from the Jubilee</h2><p>&#8220;If he sanctifies his field from the year of jubilee, it shall stand according to the valuation; but if he sanctifies his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall calculate the money for it according to the years that remain until the year of jubilee, and it shall be deducted from the valuation&#8221; (vv. 17-18). The longer the time before the jubilee, the greater was the value of the devoted land. This signifies that our devotion related to the enjoyment of Christ should be valued also according to the measure of God&#8217;s grace from the jubilee.<p>In these verses we have two ways of valuation: according to the seed required and according to the number of years from the jubilee. Actually, these two ways are one. The greater the number of years before the jubilee, the greater would be the seed required. The lesser the number of years, the lesser would be the seed required.<p>Paul&#8217;s consecration afforded a larger prospect of the increase of the church. Paul&#8217;s consecration also provided him a great opportunity to enjoy the grace of God.<p>The more increase we bring in, the more grace we have a share in. The more increase our consecration affords, the more grace we enjoy. This is related to the number of years. If we devote ourselves to the Lord early in life, we shall have more years to bring sinners to the Lord and thus to contribute to the increase of the church. This increase will then indicate that we have enjoyed the Lord&#8217;s grace. The amount of grace is measured by the amount of increase. The greater the increase, the greater is the grace, and the lesser the increase, the lesser is the grace. This realization urges us to devote ourselves earlier-the earlier, the better. For example, if you have waited until now to preach the gospel by visiting people in their homes, you will afford less prospect of increase than if you had begun last year but more than if you wait until next year. This indicates that the earlier you devote yourself to gospel preaching the better. Preaching the gospel will help you to enjoy Christ. You may enjoy the Lord in the morning by pray-reading a few verses, but you will have more enjoyment of Christ if you preach the gospel by visiting people. To visit people with the gospel requires a certain amount of devotion. As we devote ourselves, our time, and our energy to preaching the gospel, we shall be helped to enjoy the Lord more. This kind of devotion to preaching the gospel consummates not only in people being saved but also in our enjoyment of Christ. The principle is the same with participating in home meetings to nourish the new ones.<p>The point I wish to emphasize here is this: The more we devote ourselves to the Lord in anything, the more we are related to the enjoyment of Christ. The amount, the degree, the level, of the enjoyment of Christ is figured by the seed required and by the number of years to the jubilee. The seed required indicates the prospect of increase to the Body. The greater the seed required, the greater will be the increase we shall bring in for the Body. The greater the number of years to the jubilee, the greater will be the grace for our enjoyment.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_231.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_233.html">Next</a> </body></html>
