   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Dear Brother Watchman:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I gladly received and read your letter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I was comforted to find out about the condition of the co-workers in China through reading The Open Door.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When will you travel abroad?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It would be best if you could take the steamer that passes through Manila so that the brothers and sisters here may have the opportunity once again to receive your teaching and learn about the details of the work in China.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I went on a trip to preach the gospel in October and sowed seeds in thirty-nine localities in ten provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A new assembly was raised up in one locality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A brother in business is responsible there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I hope I can go out again next spring.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am comforted by the fact that most of the brothers and sisters in the church in Manila are growing spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Several brothers have moved from here to other places.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lei Chun-yung and Huang Lien-sheng have also gone to other places on business.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This locality has lost its strong arms, but we hope that the Lord's Word and work will spread through them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you have time, I would appreciate you writing to me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Brother Luk passed through Manila, I was out and was away from home.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He came ashore and stayed for several hours.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Brother Luk is finished with the work in Singapore, perhaps he can stay for a short time in the Philippines.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Peace.</S>
