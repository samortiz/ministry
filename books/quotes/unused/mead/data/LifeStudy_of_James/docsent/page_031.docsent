   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JAMES MESSAGE TEN PRACTICAL VIRTUES OF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION 10 Scripture Reading: James 4:6-17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing message we considered three major problems found in 4:1-10.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These problems are pleasures, the world, and the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall go on to consider what James says in 4:6-17.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>GREATER GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 6 James says, But He gives greater grace; wherefore it says, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The pronoun it in this verse refers to the Scripture in verse 5.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The latter part of verse 6 is a quotation from the Septuagint, Proverbs 3:34.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This verse says, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the context, this means to be proud toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Being proud toward God causes Him to resist us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be humble is also toward God, and this causes Him to give us grace, as He desires.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to learn to draw near to God v. 8 to receive greater grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead of being proud and resisting God, we should receive in meekness the implanted word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Someone who is proud cannot receive God s implanted word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are humble, we shall receive the implanted word, and we shall also receive greater grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BEING SUBJECT TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 7 James continues, Be subject therefore to God; but withstand the Devil, and he will flee from you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be subject to God is to be humble toward God v. 10; 1 Pet 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To be proud toward God is to side with God s enemy, the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be humble toward God, that is, to be subject to God, is to withstand the Devil, that is, stand against the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the best strategy to fight God s enemy; it always causes him to flee from us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The flesh implied in verse 1, the world in verse 4, and the Devil in verse 7 are the three major enemies of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They are related one to another: the flesh is against the Spirit Gal 5:17 , the world is against God 1 John 2:15 , and the Devil is against Christ 1 John 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The flesh indulges in pleasures by loving the world, and the world usurps us for the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This annuls God s eternal purpose in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verse 8 James goes on to say, Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Cleanse your hands, sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-souled!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here, as in 1:8, James uses the expression double-souled, double-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1:8, being double-souled is related to doubting in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God made man only one soul with one mind and one will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When a believer doubts in prayer, he makes himself two-souled, like a boat with two rudders, unstable in direction.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 4:8 being double-souled is a matter of having the heart divided for two parties God and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This makes people adulteresses v. 4 and sinners, who need their hearts purified and their hands cleansed so that they may draw near to God and that God may draw near to them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 9 James says, Be miserable and mourn and weep.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into dejection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This verse is a solemn admonition to God s adulterous spouse, who, under the usurpation of the Devil, indulges herself in fleshly pleasures by loving the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 10 James concludes this section: Be humbled before the Lord, and He will exalt you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This word, as a conclusion to this section vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>1-10 , is an exhortation against the fightings and desires mentioned in verses 1 through 3.</S>
