In Psalm 41:9</H2><P>As we have pointed out, Psalm 41:9 is a prophecy concerning Judas Iscariot betraying Christ. This verse says, "Even my familiar friend, in whom I trusted,/Who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me." The familiar friend in this verse is Judas Iscariot (John 6:70-71). Judas Iscariot was one who ate with the Lord (John 13:18, 23-27; Luke 22:21-22) and lifted up his heel against Christ, betraying Christ. However, Judas did not partake of the Lord's table (Mark 14:17-25; John 13:26-30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Blessing God for Eternity</H2><P>In Psalm 41:13 David blessed God for eternity&#151;"Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel,/From eternity to eternity!/Amen and Amen!"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVII. ANOTHER THREE POINTS<br>OF THE PROPHECIES CONCERNING CHRIST</H2><P>Psalms 25&#151;41 are a section of psalms showing us the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in his enjoyment of God in God's house. In this long section, we have seen that there is one of the greatest prophecies concerning Christ in His coming to replace the Old Testament sacrifices and offerings. In this section there are another three points of the prophecies concerning Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Taking Counsel Together against Him<br>and Scheming to Take His Life</H2><P>Psalm 31:13b says, "When they take counsel together against me,/They scheme to take my life." This prophecy was fulfilled in the New Testament with the Lord Jesus. Matthew 26:4 says that the chief priests and the elders took counsel together to seize Jesus by craftiness and kill Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Committing His Spirit<br>into God's Hand</H2><P>Psalm 31:5a says, "Into Your [God's] hand I [Christ] commit my spirit." This was quoted by Christ when He was crucified on the cross. At the end of His crucifixion, He said, "Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit" (Luke 23:46; cf. John 19:30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. God Keeping All His Bones and<br>Not One of Them Being Broken</H2><P>Psalm 34:20 says, "He [God] keeps all his [Christ's] bones; /Not one of them is broken." This verse was fulfilled at the time of the Lord's death. When the Roman soldiers who crucified Him saw that He had already died, they did not break His legs. John 19:36 says, "For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled: 'No bone of His shall be broken.'" Christ was also typified in Exodus by the Passover lamb, whose bones were not to be broken (12:46).</P><P>These are the minor prophecies concerning Christ unveiled in Psalms 25&#151;41.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_146.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_148.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 147</div><br></body></html>
