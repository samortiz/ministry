        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEARING FRUIT BY SERVING IN THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE ACCORDING TO MAN<br />
VERSUS THE REVELATION OF GOD</h2>
<p>In Galatians 1:11 Paul says, &ldquo;I make known to you, brothers, concerning the gospel announced by me, that it is not according to man.&rdquo; <em>According to man</em> shows that we can announce the gospel according to the will of man. In verse 12 he says, &ldquo;Neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation by Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This shows that the will of man is versus the revelation of God. It is possible to announce the gospel according to the will of man and contrary to the revelation of God.</p>
<p>In verse 13 Paul says, &ldquo;You have heard of my manner of life formerly in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it.&rdquo; As an orthodox religion, Judaism teaches man to worship God and to carry out God&rsquo;s will. However, Saul of Tarsus&rsquo;s zealous service in this God-worshipping and God-serving religion actually contradicted God&rsquo;s will. In his service he persecuted and ravaged the church that God had established. It is God&rsquo;s will to gain the church, but Saul persecuted and ravaged the church. This should be a warning to not be too confident concerning our service in the church. It is possible for our zealous service to contradict God&rsquo;s will. Although Saul of Tarsus persecuted and ravaged the church to the point of killing Christians, his persecution and ravaging were really the work of Satan. It is possible for Satan to use a person&rsquo;s zealous service even in an orthodox religion. Thus, we should not think that Satan can never be involved in our service. Such confidence brings in self-deception. If Saul of Tarsus could be deceived, we can be deceived.</p>
<p>In verse 14 Paul says, &ldquo;I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more abundantly a zealot for the traditions of my fathers.&rdquo; Perhaps no one was more diligent than Saul of Tarsus, because he advanced beyond many contemporaries in his race. If others woke up at 5:30 in the morning to worship God, he probably woke up at 3:30. He was not slothful in his zeal for Judaism, but Satan used his diligence. Although slothfulness is an indication that a person is not in the spirit, diligence is not necessarily an indication that a person is in the spirit. It is possible for both a slothful person and a diligent person to not be in the spirit. We should never just condemn slothfulness while justifying diligence, because a person&rsquo;s diligence is not necessarily associated with being in the spirit. Saul served God diligently in an orthodox religion and advanced beyond all others, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of his fathers. Since zealousness requires diligence, a person who lacks diligence will not be zealous. However, it is possible for such zeal and diligence to be apart from God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>In Acts 26:9-11 Paul said, &ldquo;I thought to myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus the Nazarene, which also I did in Jerusalem; and I both shut up many of the saints in prison when I had received authority from the chief priests and cast a vote against them when they were being done away with. And in all the synagogues I punished them often and tried to compel them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged at them, I persecuted them even as far as foreign cities.&rdquo; Saul was very diligent in doing things contrary to the name of Jesus, and he often persecuted the saints exceedingly. Although he was more diligent than others, his diligence was not in the spirit. We must condemn this kind of diligence in the same way that we condemn slothfulness. Although some local churches suffer loss because of the slothfulness of the responsible ones, other churches are damaged by their natural diligence.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE DEPENDING ON SEEING THE LORD<br />
IN HIS APPEARING</h2>
<p>We need to consider how to touch God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire without damaging the church. In verse 16 the Lord said to Paul, &ldquo;Rise up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a minister and a witness both of the things in which you have seen Me and of the things in which I will appear to you.&rdquo; This indicates that Paul&rsquo;s service did not depend on slothfulness or on diligence but on the things he had seen concerning the Lord, that is, the knowledge of Christ he received through the Lord&rsquo;s appearing. It is possible for a person to receive a vision of many things but not necessarily of the things concerning Christ. Thus, the Lord appeared to Paul and said that He would appear to him again so that Paul might see the things concerning Him. The things in which He would appear to Paul were the things concerning the church. On his way to Damascus, Paul gained knowledge of Christ, and then the Lord gradually revealed the church to him.</p>
<p>In verses 17 and 18 the Lord spoke to Paul and said that He was sending him to the Gentiles &ldquo;to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God.&rdquo; Saul thought his eyes were open, but once a great light flashed around him from heaven, his blindness was exposed. Before the light flashed around him, he thought his eyes were opened because he was taking the lead to serve God. Once the light came, however, he was blinded and had to be led by the hand by others (9:8). Formerly, he led others; now others led him. His inner eyes were not opened until he was blinded outwardly. Hence, when the Lord told him that he was being sent to open the eyes of others and to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, he understood.</p>
<p>Like many zealous Jews, Saul of Tarsus was in darkness. The Jews thought that they were living in the light and that they were guides to the blind and teachers of babes (Rom. 2:19-20), but they were actually in darkness. Therefore, when the Lord spoke to Saul of Tarsus concerning opening the eyes of the Gentiles to &ldquo;turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God&rdquo; (Acts 26:18), this was a strong indication that Saul&rsquo;s service was related to Satan&rsquo;s scheme. Saul persecuted the church and was zealous for religion and the law, but he was fully under the authority of Satan. Those who are under the authority of Satan are blind and in darkness. Like other Jews, Saul worshipped in the temple, and he supported the priestly service of offering sacrifices, burning incense, lighting the lamps, and presenting the bread of the Presence. However, he served God without knowing that he was blind, in darkness, and under the authority of Satan. Hence, before the Lord sent Saul to the Gentiles, He sent him to His people for help.</p>
<p>A person may receive revelation without vision. In Acts 26:19 Paul testified to King Agrippa, saying, &ldquo;I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.&rdquo; On his way to Damascus, Paul received not only revelation but also a vision &ldquo;that the Christ would suffer and that He, being the first to rise from the dead, would announce light both to the people and to the Gentiles&rdquo; (v. 23). <em>The people</em> refers to the Jews who worshipped God, not to Gentiles. The Jews who worshipped God in the temple needed to receive light. The gospel was preached to the Jews first and then announced to the Gentiles.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
