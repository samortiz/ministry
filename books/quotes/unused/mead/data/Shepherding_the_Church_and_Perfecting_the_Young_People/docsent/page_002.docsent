   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HOW TO ADVANCE IN THE WORK THREE POINTS REQUIRING OUR ATTENTION The Church Multiplying</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Acts 9:31 says, The church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it was multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 47 of chapter 2 gives a description of the early believers in Jerusalem: they were praising God and having grace with all the people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And the Lord added together day by day those who were being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The situation of the churches in Taiwan is similar to that of the early believers in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have peace, we are being built up, we fear the Lord, we have the comfort of the Holy Spirit, and we are praising God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, there is one thing that does not seem to match the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Acts the Lord added together day by day those who were being saved ; that is, the number of believers increased day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In recent years our numbers do not seem to have increased.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our present rate of increase cannot compare to the increase that we experienced during our first eight years in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1949 there were about five hundred saints in Taiwan who had come from the mainland.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later these saints spread to various places on the island.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1955 there were close to twenty thousand saints in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These figures indicate that we had a rapid rate of increase.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the last ten years, however, our increase has slowed down.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During this period, there was a turmoil among us; hence, it was not so easy for the work to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even though the churches in Taiwan have been in harmony and oneness for the last two to three years and the co-workers have also been in one accord, our rate of increase has been very slow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church in Taipei has not experienced a ten-percent increase during the past three years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the number of districts has increased, the total number of saints in attendance has not.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I believe that this is the situation in all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The churches today have more provisions than we had twenty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time, the saints were young, and our financial capability was less than a tenth of what it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In spite of all these factors, our present rate of increase is very slow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This situation is worthy of our study and examination before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Producing New Co-workers</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, very few new co-workers are being gained.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that very few saints are answering the Lord s calling to be set apart by the Lord and be useful in full-time service.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We cannot use human methods, such as opening a kind of school to recruit young people in order to cultivate and produce some useful ones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Such a method is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our situation should be that year after year new ones are called by the Lord, raised up by Him, and set apart by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regrettably, we do not have such a situation among us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Spreading the Work</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>of the Lord s Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At present the work is not spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It seems as though we are only maintaining the status quo among existing local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is in contrast to our situation a few years ago when the work was always spreading and opening new areas.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now only a few local churches are being raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One reason for this may be that churches have already been established in most of the major cities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, most of the serving ones are in the major cities, and it is not so easy for them to go to smaller places.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Initially, the scattered brothers and sisters moved to the major cities for the raising up of local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now it is not common for the saints to move to smaller places.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>People tend to concentrate in large cities rather than small towns.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For this reason, it is not easy to raise up more churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In view of this situation, we must rely on the workers going out rather than on the saints being scattered in order to raise up new churches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Bible there are two ways for the work to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first way is for workers to go forth and establish churches in various places Acts 13:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The second way is through the scattering of the saints 8:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot rely on the saints being scattered to smaller towns.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, the spread of the work depends on the co-workers going out.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since the co-workers have been unable to go out, it has been difficult for the work to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As a result, the work and the testimony of the church are limited to large cities.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This point is worthy of our study.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are three matters that require our attention: the slow rate of increase in the churches, the lack of new co-workers being produced in the work, and the way to spread the work of the Lord s testimony from large cities to smaller cities and from smaller cities to towns and even to villages.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must examine these three matters before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>An additional matter that is also worthy of our attention is that very few who were baptized have remained.</S>
