   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Living faith never imitates past deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible never tells us to imitate the deeds of others' faith even though it tells us to imitate others' faith Heb 6:12; 13:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To imitate faith and to imitate the deeds of faith are two entirely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should imitate the faith of the apostles, but we should not imitate the deeds of their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Their shadows, handkerchiefs, and aprons were capable of healing the sick Acts 5:15; 19:12 , but this does not mean that we can do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even if we do the same thing, the sick will not be healed because we would only be imitating the deeds of the apostles' faith and not their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes a person suffers from a certain illness and God heals him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But this does mean that we can be sick with the same illness and expect God to heal us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God never allows us to imitate the deeds of others' faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We often travel a long way before we find out that we are imitating the deeds of others' faith instead of imitating their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We often have to pass through many difficulties before we find out that imitating the deeds of faith is a dead end. When we cannot make it and realize that we have come to the end of the road, our prayer will become real and genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only then will we really seek after God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Up to that point, our prayer will merely be mindless words, habitual and unintended.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when we reach that point, our prayer will become genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will become genuinely empty, and we will confess, "I am useless.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even the victory I had before cannot help me now."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we compare the difficulty God has given us with the strength we now have, we will realize that there is no way we can overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we will genuinely seek after the Lord and be conscious of our uselessnes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We will not need someone to tell us to be humble; we will spontaneously be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our humility will not be a thing taught by others but something that swells up within us spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we will truly know that everything we have is vanity, and we will understand the meaning of "apart from Me you can do nothing" John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brothers and sisters, God desires to see you seeking after Him in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, He places trials and difficulties before you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When these things are before you, you should honestly seek after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When you really need His power, you will realize that you can do nothing apart from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is true that when you do things according to your own design, you apparently can do quite a bit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But when you have to do something according to God's design, you will find out that you need His power.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without His power we cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brothers and sisters, we must realize that God has ruled us out on the cross already!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have often overestimated ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In reality, we have been ruled out by God on the cross already.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Golgotha is where we were ruled out.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We ourselves no longer exist.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brothers and sisters, whenever we become empty, the Lord will fill us up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Word of God plainly promises: "The hungry He has filled with good things" Luke 1:53a .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, He will certainly make the hungry satisfied with good things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brothers and sisters, has God brought us to this point?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Have we ever felt that we cannot make it?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who feel that they have nothing at all are blessed because they will certainly be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only these persons can receive God's blessing; only these ones will be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you think that you are rich and feel that you are good in everything, you can only expect to be sent away empty.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only one class of people will be filled before God: those who are empty in hand and empty in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers and sisters, are you truly empty?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Have you really reached the point where God can bless you?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Can you say, "I am useless in the service of God, and I can do nothing at all"?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you are truly empty and if you are truly seeking after God's word, He will work and operate in you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>FIVE</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The story in 2 Kings 4 shows us an important spiritual principle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What did the woman and her sons have?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They only had a pot of oil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This same pot of oil was later poured into many empty vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The little bit of oil that she had at the beginning was crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the Bible oil represents the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Holy Spirit works only on those who already have the Spirit abiding in them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The widow's problem was that she had too few vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Elisha told her, "Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full" 2 Kings 4:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What did the woman do?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>And the oil stayed" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>She had to borrow empty vessels this speaks of the need for empty room within us for the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>She was to borrow not a few this means the more the better.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There should not be only one empty room but many empty rooms.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>One empty space is not enough; there needs to be many empty spaces.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The more empty spaces there are, the more fullness there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is a principle which the Lord has shown us: spiritual progress is a matter of being continually emptied out and continually filled up.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The work of the Holy Spirit is not "once empty then forever full" but "always empty and always full."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, brothers and sisters, do not think that as long as we have been emptied once, we will not need any more emptying.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The work of the cross in us is ever-increasing and ever-deepening.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Another very important thing is the place where the oil was to be poured.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It was to be poured in the house and with the door shut.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>To shut the door means to confine the woman, her sons, and the oil within the door.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This indicates that we have to deal with the Holy Spirit directly ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Everything should be between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Difficulties and victories are all personal.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If there is something wrong with us, we must not bear a grudge against anyone nor blame anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We should shut the door, which means we should deal with the Holy Spirit within us alone.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Our relationship is with the Holy Spirit alone.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is up to us and the Holy Spirit to decide whether we should live a rich spiritual life or a poor one.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As long as we have settled everything with the Holy Spirit, all will go well.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should consider another very precious thing: "And he the son said unto her, There is not a vessel more.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>And the oil stayed."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Holy Spirit will fill every empty vessel, even the very last one.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If there had been more empty vessels, there would have been more oil.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must bear in mind that the reason the oil stayed was because there were no more vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It was not the oil that first stayed, but the empty vessels that were first exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When there were no more empty vessels, the oil stayed.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The oil did not exhaust itself; it was the empty vessels that were exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Brothers and sisters, God is waiting for us to empty ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If there is an infinite emptiness in us, the Holy Spirit will grant us an infinite filling.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Whether or not we will receive the blessing of the Holy Spirit depends on whether we have empty vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It depends on whether or not we have reserved room for the Holy Spirit and whether or not we have provided Him a place to work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We need to pray and ask the Lord to dig more deeply in us and make more room in us so that the Holy Spirit can fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The filling of the Holy Spirit depends on our emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I will repeat: our emptiness ought to be a continuous state.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we cannot empty ourselves, God cannot fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The Holy Spirit is waiting for empty rooms within us.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The more empty rooms we give to Him, the more He will fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If there is empty room, it means there is more filling by the Holy Spirit to come.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Therefore, we need not seek for the filling; all we have to do is to empty ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The Holy Spirit alone is responsible for the filling; our responsibility is to empty ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If we can empty ourselves, we will have the filling.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We may not be conscious of the filling, but the fact of the filling will certainly be with us.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Brothers and sisters, God wants to fill the hungry with good things.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If God has already created a seeking heart within us and if He is digging and emptying us, we ought to believe that He will certainly fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>God will only send away empty those who think they are rich.</S>
