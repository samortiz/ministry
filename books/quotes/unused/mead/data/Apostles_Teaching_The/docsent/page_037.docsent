   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHAT THE HEAVENLY SECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE KINGDOM OF A THOUSAND YEARS SHOULD BE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO THE BELIEVERS IN THE PRESENT AGE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND WHAT IT WILL BE TO THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>IN THE COMING AGE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The heavenly section of the kingdom of a thousand years should be an exercise and encouragement to the New Testament believers in the present age 2 Tim 4:1, 18b; 2:12a .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, which will be the heavenly section of the thousand-year kingdom, is the reward, the prize, to the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is also an exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today many Christians are saved and love the Lord to some extent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They believe this to be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are grateful for the Lord s mercy and grace but lack a strong exercise to pursue the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we know the truth, we will not be so complacent because we realize there is a reward set before us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Olympic athletes go through rigorous training and exercise in order to win the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If they do not exercise, they will miss the prize for which they are striving.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many Christians will miss the Lord s reward because of their complacency.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second Timothy was Paul s last letter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the first chapter, he said that all the believers who were in Asia had forsaken him 2 Tim 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They had forsaken his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some, such as Hymenaeus and Philetus, had spoken words that were like gangrene to damage and infect the saints 2 Tim 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Alexander the coppersmith did many evil things to Paul 2 Tim 4:14 to damage his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even Demas, who had been Paul s co-worker, forsook him 2 Tim 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These situations are very disappointing, but despite these sufferings Paul had the Lord s appearing and His kingdom in view.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 2 Timothy 4:1 Paul told Timothy, I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is about to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The coming kingdom will either be a reward to us or we will miss it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 2 Timothy 4:18 Paul declared, The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto His heavenly kingdom, to whom be the glory forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was a triumphant declaration by Paul, yet in the same chapter he told us that he was going to be martyred: For I am already being poured out, and the time of my departure is at hand v. 6 . Paul realized that Caesar Nero might kill him, but that meant nothing to him because the Lord would save him into His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is both the exercise and the encouragement related to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, the thousand-year kingdom should be an exercise to us, and on the other hand, it should be an encouragement to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Someday we will be examined and measured concerning whether we will get the reward of the kingdom or miss it and receive some punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The heavenly section of the kingdom of a thousand years will be a reward to the overcoming believers and a loss as a punishment to the defeated believers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Matthew 24:46-47 and 25:19-23 show the Lord s reward to His faithful servants.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Matthew 24:48-51 and 25:26-30 show how the unfaithful ones, the defeated slaves of Christ, will be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Christ comes back, the defeated ones will be cast out into the outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth 25:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE KINGDOM OF A THOUSAND YEARS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>AS THE KINGDOM AGE TO BE USED</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>FOR THE LORD TO DISCIPLINE AND PERFECT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE DEFEATED SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are not the overcoming ones in this age, we will be the defeated ones who will be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The punishment to the unbelievers is one of condemnation and perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, to the defeated believers, the punishment is a discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord will discipline the defeated ones to perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may have been Christians for years without being perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we have not been perfected in the present age, we will miss the reward and receive a punishment as a discipline to perfect us in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is similar to a student who desires to graduate, but is not qualified to graduate at the time of graduation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The school may require him to remain for another term in order to graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The extra term is a punishment or discipline to him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The discipline helps to perfect him so that he can become a graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we do not graduate in the Christian life in this age, the Lord will require us to learn some hard lessons in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually, we have to graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we graduate earlier, that is, in this age, we will get the reward in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we graduate later, there will be some suffering, but we will still graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All Christians will graduate sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After the thousand-year kingdom age, all the chosen people of God, both those of the Old Testament and those of the New Testament, will have been perfected by being disciplined and will be qualified to enter the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Actually, the heavenly section of the thousand-year kingdom is also the New Jerusalem in the thousand-year kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is according to the Lord s promise in Revelation 3:12: He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The mentioning of the New Jerusalem as a prize to the overcomer indicates that this promise will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom will be a prize only to the overcoming saints, whereas the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the common portion of all the redeemed for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, the overcomers will enter into the New Jerusalem a thousand years earlier than the defeated believers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who are defeated in this age will delay their entry into the New Jerusalem by a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Bible tells us that God has two creations the old creation and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God uses the old creation as the material to produce the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Before being saved we were all a part of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus, we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This caused us to become a part of the new creation 2 Cor 5:17 , but with us there are still many things related to the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is why we need to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To be perfected means to get rid of the old creation and to grow up in the new creation every day.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The church age is wonderful because God is working Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As God works Himself into us for His new creation, His new creation is increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The increasing of the new creation is discharging the part in us that is of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In our physical life, as we eat and drink, we are continually being supplied with new elements.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As these new elements are added into us, the old elements are discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In our spiritual life, the new creation increases so that the old creation can be discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Sometimes we are not that submissive or obedient, so we need some discipline from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is to help us be renewed to be more of the new creation and have the old creation reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If during this age we are still not that submissive, the Lord will deal with us in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He will tolerate us until the next age, the thousand-year kingdom, so that He can resume His discipline on us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>During that time He will put the unfaithful, defeated believers into a dark room to suffer punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But the overcoming believers will be in glory to reign as kings.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The coming age, the age of the thousand-year kingdom, will still be an age that is in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The first age in the old creation was the age of the patriarchs.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This age was used by God to select some patriarchs for His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Following the age of the patriarchs was the age of the law, in which God perfected many faithful overcomers from among the children of Israel, His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we read the Old Testament carefully, we will realize that some Old Testament saints such as Jacob and David were disciplined by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Although Jacob was a supplanter, he was transformed into Israel Gen 32:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Israel means prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The age of the church, the age of grace, follows the age of the patriarchs and the age of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Today in the church we enjoy grace, but we are also under training.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we are not obedient to God, He will have some discipline prepared for us in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Even the Apostle Paul had some suffering that was a discipline to him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>His thorn in the flesh was such a suffering to him that he entreated the Lord for it to depart from him 2 Cor 12:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we are not submissive in cooperating with God s grace and discipline in this age, God will discipline us in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>God uses four ages in the old creation to perfect His chosen people to get them saved, regenerated, transformed, and eventually transfigured to be the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God has assigned four ages to gain His new creation out from the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We should not think that the thousand-year kingdom age will be altogether glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It will be glorious for the overcomers, but not for the defeated believers.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We must consider our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Even the Apostle Paul felt that he was not wrong in anything, yet he would not dare to judge himself.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He said that the One who judges is the Lord 1 Cor 4:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He will judge us at His judgment seat 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The decision will be made there concerning whether we will enter into glory or suffer loss in the thousand years 1 Cor 3:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The decision will be made concerning whether we will reign with Him or whether we will suffer without Him.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>What that decision will be depends upon how we have behaved ourselves in the Lord in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This is a very sober warning to us, and it is quite unveiling.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Everyone who believes in Him has been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Still, we must run the race to win the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>In 1 Corinthians 9:24-25 Paul says, Do you not know that those who run in a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize?</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>So run, that you may lay hold.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>And everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; those, therefore, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>As we run the race, we must run with the prize in view that we may lay hold of it.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>It was not until the last moment of the Apostle Paul s running, in 2 Timothy 4:6-8, that he had the assurance that he would be rewarded by the Lord at His appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>In the light of this prize, Paul charged the Corinthian believers to run the race that they may obtain the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This is the apostles teaching.</S>
