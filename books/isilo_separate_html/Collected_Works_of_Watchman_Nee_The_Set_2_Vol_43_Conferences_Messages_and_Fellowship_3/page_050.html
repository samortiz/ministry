I desire to overcome all the time. How can I overcome?" I answered coldly, "If a person like you could overcome, the whole world could overcome. A person like you could never overcome." He became angry and said, "Why can't I overcome?" I said, "You simply cannot overcome." His face turned red, and he said, "Are you saying that I am too evil?" I said, "That is right, you are altogether evil. However, I am not the one who says this; God says this. According to Him, you are totally wicked and completely hopeless. This is why I can tell you that you can never overcome." He said, "But what if I want to overcome?" I said, "Even though you want to, you cannot." By then he had realized a little that he could not overcome by his own strength. I then told him, "God does not say that you have to be a certain kind of person before you can overcome. You are wicked beyond hope, and God knows that you will only fail and be defeated. This is why He has put you aside. No one in this whole world can overcome. Only One can overcome&mdash;Jesus Christ. Other than Christ, there is no one who can overcome." Then he understood that victory is simply Christ Himself.</p><p>Once a brother confided in me that he could not be patient. I have heard this kind of confession a countless number of times. Perhaps temper is a common problem all Christians have, and everyone loses his temper easily. I asked, "Do you lack patience?" He said, "Yes, and I have been praying for God to give me patience. Perhaps God has not answered me because I have not been earnest enough in my prayer." Then he turned to me and asked, "Mr. Nee, did I pray the right prayer?" I said, "No. God only engages in wholesale business; He is not interested in retail business." He asked, "What do you mean?" I said, "When you lack patience, you go to God for patience. When your patience runs out, you go to God for more. You may realize that you are proud, and you go to the Lord for humility. A few days later you may realize that you lack love and that you are critical of others, and you pray to the Lord for love. When you do this, aren't you treating God just like a retail grocery store? But this is not the way that God works. This is why He never answers your prayer." God is interested only in wholesale business. Whoever comes to Him will receive the whole Christ. A whole Christ is within you, and He is your meekness, humility, patience, and love.</p><p>God does not dispense anything to us in a fragmentary way; whatever He gives to us is found in Christ. When we have Christ, we have everything. When we gain Christ, we gain all things. Christ is within us and living for us. No matter how hard and difficult a task may be, He is more than able to fulfill it. What is victory? Victory is simply Christ. We cannot overcome by ourselves. Victory is not a matter of us overcoming, but of Christ overcoming in our place. May the Lord be merciful to open our eyes so that we can see that we can never overcome in ourselves. We should not only be disappointed with ourselves but also lose all hope in ourselves. We should cherish no hope whatsoever in ourselves. Overcoming is not a matter of change, but a matter of exchange. If it is a matter of change, we will still be the same after three or five years. But since it is a matter of exchange, it happens instantly. We do not attain anything through a gradual process; everything comes from God. If we are clear about God's salvation, we will overcome in an instant. But if it is up to us, we will be the same three, five, eight, or ten years from now; we will be the same thirty or fifty years from now. However, since it is an exchange, we overcome in an instant. Anything that issues from ourselves works slowly; it will not accomplish anything after even one hundred years. But anything that is from God happens quickly, even instantly. Victory is not man-made; it is a miracle.</p><p>May the Lord open our eyes to see that it is no longer us, and may we live a life that is full of miracles. When one sister died, the following words were inscribed on her tombstone: "She did what she otherwise could not have done." This means that her living was not one that issued from herself. She could not do anything by herself, but through Christ she could do all things. As a consequence, she did what she otherwise could not have done, and she said what she otherwise could not have said. Everything is of Christ, and we have no part in it. Hallelujah! Christ is victory! He lives within us, and He is living for us. All we have to do is abandon ourselves and allow Him to live out of us. Then victory will be ours spontaneously.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> </body></html>
