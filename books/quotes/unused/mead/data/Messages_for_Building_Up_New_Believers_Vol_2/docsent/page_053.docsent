   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT MANAGING ONE S FINANCES Scripture Reading: Luke 6:38; 1 Tim 6:7-10, 17-19; 2 Cor 9:6; Mal 3:10; Prov 11:24; Phil 4:15-19 I. MANAGING ACCORDING TO GOD S PRINCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we will cover monetary offering and giving.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After a person has sold everything, he will still receive income; money will still find its way back to his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How should he manage his money?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even after a person has offered up all of his money, we should not think that money will no longer have an influence on him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some people can give away their money all at once, but money can gradually regain its power over them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, they will consider their money to be their own once again.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, a believer must learn to continually let go of his money.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Christian way of managing wealth is completely different from that of an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Christian way of financial management is the way of giving.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The unbeliever s way is the way of accumulating.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today we are concerned with how a Christian should live in order to be free from want.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has promised us that we will have no lack on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The birds of the air have no lack of food, and the flowers of the field have no lack of clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even so God s children should have no lack of clothing and food.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If they have any lack, there must be a reason or cause for it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a brother is financially hard-pressed, he is not managing his wealth according to God s principle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After you have forsaken all of your possessions to follow the Lord, you should walk according to God s principle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you do not follow God s principle, you will eventually end up in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is a great need for many of God s children to learn to manage their wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If they do not learn to manage their wealth, they should expect nothing except hardship in the way ahead of them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today we want to consider the way to attain God s prosperity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>GOD S PROVISION BEING CONDITIONAL</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As believers we have to look to the Lord for our food, clothing, and other needs while we live on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without God s mercy, we cannot pass through our days on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is true even for the rich ones; they have to look to the Lord also.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During World War II, we saw many rich people stripped of clothing and food.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One day many people will be in remorse over their wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul warned us not to depend on unpredictable riches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A greedy person is always an anxious person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who trust in the Lord may not have much in the way of savings, but the Lord will not leave them in difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He can supply all their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, we must also realize that God s supply is with conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If God can feed the birds in the air, He can keep us alive.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In reality, no one can feed all the birds or supply enough fertilizer to grow all the lilies of the field.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But God has enough riches to keep the birds of the air and the lilies of the field alive.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He also has enough riches to keep His children alive.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God does not want to see us come short in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He does not want our living to be deprived in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everyone who falls into deprivation falls because he has a problem in himself; he has not managed his wealth according to God s way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we manage our money according to God s law, we will not be in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let us read Luke 6:38.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This portion of the Word describes the type of person God will supply.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is always willing to supply.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When He supplies us, the supply can come in such abundance that it comes out of our mouth and even becomes loathsome to us, as described in Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has no problem in doing such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should never think that God is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The cattle upon a thousand hills are His, and the goats upon ten thousand hills are His.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If everything belongs to Him, why are God s children poor?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why do His children experience lack?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not because God cannot supply.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, we need to meet His requirements before we can receive His supply.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to meet certain conditions before our prayers can be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even our salvation had certain requirements to it we had to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Every promise has conditions, and we must fulfill these conditions before we can receive the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Likewise, we need to fulfill God s requirements before we can receive His supply.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>His requirement is to give.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord says, Give, and it will be given to you.</S>
