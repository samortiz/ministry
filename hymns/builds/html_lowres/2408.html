<b>1</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>Oh listen to a story of abounding grace</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Of how our God came down to earth to join the human race</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>And through His kind intention, He came up with a plan</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>That He Himself might be expressed by dispensing into man.</span><br>

<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Oh what a kind intention, oh what abounding grace</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>How our God came down to earth to join the human race</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>It surely was a mystery so deep we could not trace</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>That we might be to the praise of the glory of His grace.</span><br>
</div>
<div style='padding-left:1px; padding-top:8px;'>
<b>2</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>For God had predetermined, by His counsel and His will</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>That man might be a vessel, which He Himself would fill</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>And so for this He chose us, back in eternity</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>And He predestinated us His very sons to be.</span><br>

<b>3</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>His task, it was not easy, it surely took much grace</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>When on the earth He first appeared, a man in time and space</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>And then for 33 long years, He lived out God in Man</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>That He might fully carry out all of the Father's plan.</span><br>

<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Went to the cross and shed His blood, redemption to win</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>This brought us into favour, into a blessed place</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>For God forgave our offenses by the riches of His grace.</span><br>

<div style='padding-left:1px; padding-top:8px;'>
<b>5</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>Now in the application, the Spirit's moving in</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Applying all the Son has done, forgiving all our sin</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>He's sealing God into us, full sonship to bring</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Oh, this is the mystery of the universe, and this is why we sing.</span><br>
