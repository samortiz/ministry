   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. By Changing the Nature of the Small Mustard into the Nature of a Tree</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Satan's damage is also to change the nature of the small mustard, signifying the church in life, which is good for food supply, into the nature of a tree, signifying the big Christendom in confusion, which is good for lodging the evil ones, signified by the "birds" Matt 13:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The mustard plant is small, but Satan changed the nature of the mustard into a great tree.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The mustard signifies the church in life, which is good for food supply, but today's Christendom is a big organization, like a big tree.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead of being good for food, it is good for lodging the evil ones, signified by the "birds."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church should be small in nature and in function, not big as Christendom is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We Christians who follow the Lord Jesus are relatively small in number, but Satan has made Christendom very large.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a damage to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is why in the recovery we do not like to have anything as a big facade.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to note that the three items above under Roman numeral I the wayside, the rocks, and the thorns frustrate the growth of the life seed in the believers and restrict the multiplication of Christ through His believers; whereas the two items above under Roman numeral II the tares and the mustard seed becoming a great tree , on the one hand, bring in a mixture among the components of the church, and on the other hand, change the nature of the church and make the appearance of the church abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today the appearance of Christianity is altogether abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the church life, we do not have titles or assigned pastors as great speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The genuine church is not something great but is like the small mustard that produces food for the satisfaction of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For the proper church life, we need to have the fourth kind of heart, the good earth, for growing Christ, and we need to be small, not great.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus told His disciples that they were a little flock Luke 12:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should be the little flock following the Lord 1 Pet 5:2a; Acts 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are not, we are abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church is little in number compared with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church as the little flock is a little herb for the supply of life, not a big tree for the birds to lodge in, not a huge religion like Christendom.</S>
