   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ALL THE GIFTED PERSONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are too self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are always concerned about our personal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But we have to realize that our personal salvation is for a corporate church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 4 says that when Christ ascended to the height, He led a train of vanquished foes and gave gifts to men v. 8 . He made all the vanquished foes the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The apostle Paul was one of these vanquished foes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When he was Saul of Tarsus, he was a real foe to Christ Acts 8:1, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But Christ vanquished him and made this vanquished foe, Saul of Tarsus, the biggest gift.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ gave this biggest gift, the apostle Paul, to the church for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the gifts, the gifted persons, such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, are for the building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>GOD PUTTING SATAN TO SHAME THROUGH THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ephesians 3:10 says, "In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that God puts Satan with all his power of darkness to shame through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God would say to Satan, "Satan, look at the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You gave Me a lot of trouble, but out of all the troubles, I have obtained a church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the troubles you gave Me become a kind of help to Me. So I am wiser than you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Satan, have you seen My wisdom?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Satan caused so many young people to become hippies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But out of the hippies, God has gained a number of saved saints.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is wiser than Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is through the church that the multifarious wisdom of God is made known.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, here we have to be bold enough to say that even Satan is for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Satan always has been and still is trying his best to damage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But all the damage caused by Satan is used by God in His wisdom to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Satan is a tool used by God for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If Satan had never come into existence, everything in the universe would be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There would not be anything evil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Consequently, there would be no tears, no pain, and no suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to realize that God, in His marvelous wisdom, allowed all the negative things to happen for this one purpose, that is, to produce a wonderful thing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will need eternity to understand how much good the darkness, suffering, pain, and tears have done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even the dark and negative things are used by God for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE GLORY OF GOD BEING FOR THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ephesians 3:21 says, "To Him be the glory in the church."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The glory of God is not only in the church but also for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, we see that God's purpose is for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ's death is for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ's resurrection, ascension, enthronement, and glorification are for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In other words, all the main things accomplished by Christ are for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, the gifts are for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then Satan, with all the negative things, is for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Finally, God's glory is for the church.</S>
