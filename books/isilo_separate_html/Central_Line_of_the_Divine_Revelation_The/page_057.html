As portrayed in the four Gospels, Christ is God, a man, a King, and a Slave. However, this is not a full and proper definition of who and what Christ is. The Bible is a record of Christ as a threefold seed in humanity who became a life-giving Spirit, as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God, for our portion. The very Triune God became a man as the human seed of three persons&#151;the woman (Mary), Abraham, and David. At the beginning of the Old Testament, Genesis 3:15 says, "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel." The seed of the woman accomplished many things on the negative side. He destroyed Satan (Heb. 2:14), took away sin (John 1:29), nullified death (2 Tim. 1:10), and terminated our old man (Rom. 6:6). Then, in the middle years of the Old Testament history, God promised Abraham a seed who would become the blessing to the entire world (Gen. 12:2-3; Gal. 3:16). The seed of Abraham as the God-man, the very Triune God in a man, is the very God given to and enjoyed and experienced by man as the blessing. In the whole universe only God Himself is a blessing; all else is vanity of vanities. If we have God, we have the blessing. However, the way for God to be our blessing involved a process. For food to become our blessing, it must be cooked. In the same way, God had to be "cooked" in order to be our blessing. Before passing through a process, God was a "raw" God. By passing through a process, God became the "cooked" God and was "put on the table" as our food supply. This God in His totality is the processed, consummated, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, compound Spirit. He as the wonderful Spirit is the blessing from God to us.</P><P>As the seed of David the king, Christ is the successor to David's throne. According to Isaiah 55:3 and Acts 13:34, this seed of the king is the sure mercies of David. The resurrected seed of David is the sure mercies that God covenanted to David. Mercies are the initiation of God's blessing. God gives Himself to us as a blessing through many kinds of mercies as the initiation.</P><P>At the end of the Bible, Revelation 22:17 says, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come." This verse indicates that the Spirit and the bride are a couple. The term the Spirit indicates the process of the Triune God. The processed Triune God will marry the redeemed and glorified tripartite man, and together they will become a universal couple. Revelation 21 and 22 show us that the New Jerusalem is a compound, a mingling, a blending, of this processed Triune God with the chosen and glorified tripartite saints. This is the blessing given to us based on God's sure mercies.</P><P>After Christ as the human seed lived and consummated His ministry on earth, He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). From that point onward, whatever has taken place related to Christ has been something of this Spirit. Today the very God whom we have received and are worshipping and serving is the consummated Triune God, the reality of whom is the life-giving Spirit, who is the realization of the man Jesus, the threefold seed. This is the central line, the contents, the substance, and the essence of the entire Bible.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> </body></html>
