Destroying the Devil</H2><P>In His all-inclusive death Christ destroyed the devil, who has the might of death and who is related to the flesh of sin (Heb. 2:14; John 12:31b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Judging the World and Casting Out<br>Its Ruler, the Devil</H2><P>Four things are related to one another: the flesh, sin, Satan, and the world. Christ in His death judged the world and cast out its ruler, the devil (John 12:31; Gal. 6:14b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Crucifying the Old Man</H2><P>Christ also crucified the old man (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20a; 6:14b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Terminating the Old Creation</H2><P>Christ terminated the old creation by the crucifixion of the old man (Rom. 6:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Abolishing the Law<br>of the Commandments in Ordinances</H2><P>On the cross Christ abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances (Eph. 2:15a). The ordinances are the human forms or ways of living and worship. These ordinances divide people, so Christ abolished them in His death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Releasing the Divine Life</H2><P>In Christ's death He dealt with seven negative points: the flesh, sin, Satan, the world, the old man, the old creation, and the ordinances in the law. There is a positive point to His death. In His death He also released the divine life from the one grain into many grains, signified by the flowing of water at the death of Christ (John 12:24; 19:34b). When He was crucified, His side was pierced and out flowed blood and water. Blood is for redemption to deal with sins for the purchasing of the church (Acts 20:28). Water is for imparting life to deal with death for the producing of the church (Eph. 5:29-30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE ALL-CONQUERING RESURRECTION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Producing the Firstborn Son of God</H2><P>In the all-conquering resurrection the firstborn Son of God was produced. God had only one Son, the only begotten Son of God (John 1:18; 3:16). But in resurrection another kind of Son of God was produced, the firstborn Son of God. This took place in resurrection by uplifting the humanity of Christ into His divinity and by having Christ born of God (Acts 13:33; Psa. 2:7), that is, by designating the seed of David by the divinity (the Spirit of holiness) of Christ in the power of resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 1:4; 8:29; Heb. 1:3-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Regenerating All God's Chosen People<br>to Be the Many Sons of God</H2><P>In Christ's all-conquering resurrection all of God's chosen people were regenerated to be the many sons of God and the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God&#151;the resurrected God-man, Christ (1 Pet. 1:3; Heb. 2:10; Rom. 8:29).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
