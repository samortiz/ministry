<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONFERENCE (5)</H1><p>Date:Evening, January 12, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</p><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:10; 3:16-19</H1><P>Prayer: May the Lord cause the word to come out of us tonight, and may You cause others to receive these words into them. Although there is not much outward stimulation or excitement, may these words give others the freedom and the light as they enter into them. We admit our darkness and our foolishness. We admit that we have not given You the proper ground. We pray that You would have more ground in us tonight.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GOAL OF GOD'S WORK&#151;<br>WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</H2><P>Many people think that God's will is to make the proud person humble and the violent person meek. In other words, they think that God's will is to make the bad persons into good ones. But God's central work in man is not to do these things. He is not turning an evil man so that he becomes a good one. What is the goal of God's work? All the words and teachings will pass away. God has to open our eyes to see that throughout the ages, His work is to work Himself into man. Although this word is simple, most people have never thought of this matter before.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SALVATION BEING GOD WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</H2><P>We will start from the very beginning. What is it to be saved? Before we answer this question, we have to ask why do men have to believe in Jesus? Men believe in Jesus because there are sufferings in the world and because they want to receive blessings. Man has sicknesses and sins, and this is why he needs Jesus. It is true that this is the gospel. But this is not the center of the gospel. I have to ask this: If man needs to believe in Jesus because he has sinned, would he need Jesus if he does not have sins?</P><P>One brother said that the gospel is for us to receive Christ. But why do we have to receive Christ? Today, many people can speak some spiritual terms, but they do not know what those terms mean. For example, to many people justification and sanctification are but terminologies only. What is it to receive Christ? To receive Christ is to receive Jesus. But what is the meaning of receiving Jesus? To receive Jesus is not merely for the purpose of being delivered from sin, suffering, and hell. It is right that a man is saved to receive Christ. Actually, salvation itself is simply Christ. For a man to be saved is for him to have Christ. Salvation is not merely for us to be delivered from sin and suffering. After a man has received the Lord, surely he will be delivered from these things. But God's work in man is to work Himself into man. Salvation is God entering into man. To receive Christ is to receive God Himself. Christ is God, and God is Christ. The Bible never tells us that there are three Gods. When He is in heaven, God is the Father. One day, when He came among men and was seen and touched by men, He was the Son. John 1 shows us that the Son is the Father manifested. The Father is the hidden God; He is the source. This is the meaning of the word father. One end of the Son is the Father, and the other end of the Father is the Son. When God is in heaven, He is the Father. When He walks on earth, He is the Son. One day, when He comes into man, He is the Holy Spirit. This is our God. He proceeds from the Father, passing through the Son, and becomes the Spirit. In John 14 the Lord Jesus said that His going is the Comforter's coming, and the Comforter's coming is His going. Not only was He dwelling among us; He wanted to dwell within us. The Son is the manifestation of God. His entry is the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is the entry of the Lord, God, and Christ. God was originally in heaven, and man was on earth; there was a great distance between the two. But through the Lord Jesus, man can now come to know God. However, although the Lord was among men, many did not know the Lord. This is why there is the need of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the entry of the Lord. Through the Holy Spirit, man can now know the Lord.</P><P>When I was in Hong Kong, someone asked me where Christ has gone according to Matthew. If we take the Gospel of Matthew to a place where people have never heard the gospel, they will never say that Christ has ascended to heaven. It is because Matthew never says this. This is the result of the teaching in Christianity.</P><P>Matthew did not mention the ascension of Christ. If it had twenty-nine chapters, it would have said that Christ has entered into us. His name is Emmanuel, which means God with us. How is He being with us? He is with us by being in us. This is what the Chinese mean by "the shadow following the person all the way."</P><P>To be saved is not merely to be delivered from perdition and death, and to be forgiven of our sins. These are the necessary results of salvation, but they are not the center of salvation. The center of salvation is God working Himself into man. Salvation cannot be separated from the Savior. Suppose someone gives you a gift. It is wrong to accept the gift while rejecting the giver of the gift.</P>
