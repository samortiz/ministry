   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE GENESIS THE GENERAL SKETCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND CENTRAL THOUGHT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Praise the Lord for the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Praise the Lord for the life, the divine life, the eternal life, which is contained in this Book!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And praise the Lord that He has afforded us this opportunity to have a life-study of His divine Word with such a large congregation!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord willing, starting from today, April 6th, 1974, we shall continue this life-study through the Bible, book after book, consecutively every weekend.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>May the Lord grant us His dear presence with His rich anointing all the way through our study.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A WONDERFUL BOOK</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible is a wonderful book.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is "The Book" among all books!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It took 1600 years to complete, starting with Moses, the greatest prophet of God, and ending with the Apostle John.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was confirmed 300 years later 397 A.D. at a council held at Carthage in North Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not long after that, the Bible was locked away from the people by the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For nearly a thousand years, from the 6th century through the 15th century, the Bible was locked up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>History calls this period the Dark Age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Human society became dark because the Bible, containing all the divine light, was locked away from humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then, in the Reformation, God used Martin Luther to unlock the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the same time, printing was invented, allowing the Bible to be printed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the Bible was unlocked, it was not so open.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet, we thank the Lord that during the past five centuries He has opened up His Word again and again through many great teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We stand on their shoulders and we are grateful to them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet, how we thank the Lord that today the Bible is so open to us, allowing us to have a rich life-study of the living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE BREATH OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We know that the word "Bible" means "the Book."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But what is this book?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible itself says, "All Scripture is God-breathed" 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible is the breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not merely the word or the thought of God, but the very breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whatever we breathe out is our breath, and this breath proceeds out of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So the Bible as the breath of God is something breathed out of the being of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bible contains the very element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whatever God is, is contained in this divine book.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God is light, life, love, power, wisdom, and many other items.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All these items of what God is have been breathed out into the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever we come to this book with an open heart and an open spirit, we can immediately touch something divine: not just thoughts, concepts, knowledge, words, or sentences, but something deeper than all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We touch God Himself.</S>
