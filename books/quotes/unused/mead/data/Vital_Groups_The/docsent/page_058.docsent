   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. BEING A PERSON IN THE INTIMATE AND THOROUGH FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to be vital, we should be ones who are in the intimate and thorough fellowship with the Lord, without anything between the Lord and us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are not such persons, we are not qualified to contact people for God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many in Christianity promote soul-winning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They may gain people, but most of the ones they gain are dying spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do not want to bring dead and dying people into the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must have the vitality to vitalize those whom we contact.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The vitality is hidden in our intimate, thorough fellowship with the Lord, with nothing between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This makes us absolutely one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>HAVING A THOROUGH CONFESSION</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must have a thorough confession all the time of our failures, defects, wrongdoings, practices of the flesh and of our natural man, our offenses toward God and men, and our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We want to remain in and be conformed to Christ's death Phil 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must confess that we have not been fully conformed to His death, especially in the way that we speak to our spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First John 1 says that if we say we do not have sin, we are lying vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>8, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we say we have no sin, this means we are blind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are full of sins, so we must make a thorough confession of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because our hands become dirty throughout the day, we have to wash them many times.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the same way, we must confess our sins to the Lord throughout the day to receive the continual cleansing of His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>PRAYING THOROUGHLY FOR THOSE WHOM WE VISIT</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should pray thoroughly for our visiting of people and for those whom we visit and contact.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not contact someone without praying for him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should pray adequately and desperately for the people whom we contact.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the past I encouraged the saints to visit people by knocking on their doors once a week for about three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who go out should be able to stand on the thorough prayer they have had throughout the week.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should pray desperately that the Lord would make us fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If each of us cannot gain one person for the Lord within a year, this is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord charged us to go and bear much fruit for the Father to be glorified John 15:8, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must keep the Lord's word to bear fruit, but we have not done this absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BECOMING FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE OUTLINES OF THE RECENT MESSAGES CONCERNING THE PERSON OF CHRIST AND HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must be so familiar with all the outlines of the recent messages concerning the person of Christ and His accomplishments in the three stages of His full ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can memorize them and use them spontaneously in our visiting and contacting of people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The churches in Taiwan have entered into the way of pray-reading, studying, reciting, and prophesying all the items of the outlines.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we practice this, we will be saturated and soaked with all these points, and we will have much of the truth to speak to others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we take this way, we can become very useful in going out to speak to people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What we speak concerning the person of Christ according to the new light we have received will be very attractive to people, because they have never heard such things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have spent over ten years to help the churches enter into a vital situation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Recently, I received a testimony from someone which shows that at least one church has become vital.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The contents of this testimony are printed below, and we have numbered the crucial points in it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church life here has been very sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Up until now, we have been in localities where the church was small or had some difficult situations.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the first time we feel like we ourselves are being 1 shepherded by the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>2 The saints here are genuinely pursuing Christ and building up the church according to the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It has also been exposing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I realize I have gotten somewhat old and cold.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But I am getting warmed up again!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>3 Many of the saints are actively shepherding new ones at various stages.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Also 4 at least half the saints still go out door-knocking each week.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>5 They have been practicing this for the last ten years!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>6 New ones mostly Caucasians steadily come into the church life through door-knocking, and 7 contacting of neighbors, co-workers, and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>8 In the meetings there has never been a gap in between the testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is hard to testify because there are so many who want to testify.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>9 My own appetite has been stimulated by 10 the saints' intense and serious appetite for the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The person who wrote the above testimony said that he was shepherded by the saints, not by the elders or co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that they practice the shepherding which the ministry teaches.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to pay attention to the phrase by the saints in the above testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The saints in this locality are pursuing Christ according to the New Testament ministry, not according to different teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Revelation 2 speaks of the teaching of Balaam v.14 , the teaching of the Nicolaitans v. 15 , the teaching by Jezebel v. 20 , and the teaching of the deep things of Satan v. 24 . In today's Christianity, there are many different teachings, but we should have only one teaching, the New Testament teaching, which is called the apostles' teaching Acts 2:42 . The unique teaching in the New Testament is the teaching of the apostles concerning God's eternal economy to produce the church for the Body that consummates the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we pursue Christ and build up the church according to the apostles' teaching, the New Testament ministry, we will be under the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may say that it is difficult to gain Caucasians, but in the place mentioned above, at least half of the saints have faithfully practiced door-knocking for the past ten years, and the new ones they have gained have been mostly Caucasians.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The contents of the above testimony are according to what I have been teaching for the past ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This testimony confirms that the God-ordained way to practice and build up the church life according to the New Testament ministry really works.</S>
