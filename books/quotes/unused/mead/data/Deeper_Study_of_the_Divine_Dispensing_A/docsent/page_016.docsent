   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A SUPPLEMENTARY WORD 1 THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Divine Trinity has passed through many processes for His divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, He came from heaven on high to the earth and was conceived in the womb of a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There He remained for nine months according to the law of the human life, and He was born as a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because of King Herod's jealousy, He escaped to Egypt and later returned to settle in Galilee, living in the little town of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a hidden way, He lived there for thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No one heard of Him or knew Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When He was thirty years old, He came out to fulfill His ministry, which was to seek and to save the lost sinners and to dispense God into them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One day, He was returning from Jerusalem to Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to His foreknowledge and predestination, He went to save a lost sinner, an immoral Samaritan woman.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this, He purposely went through Samaria and waited for the woman by the well at Secure.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He knew that the woman would go to draw water at that hour.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Lord Jesus met her, He asked her for water in order to point out her real need.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He spoke to her about her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By this He touched her conscience so that she would repent for her sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition, the Lord showed her that true worship is to drink of God as the living water and to contact in spirit God who is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Chinese way of worship is to kneel down three times with the head touching the ground nine times.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Arab way of worship is to prostrate the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But our God does not want us to worship in either of these ways.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He wants us to worship in spirit and in reality, which is to drink of Him as the thirst-quenching living water.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we drink of the water from the well of Jacob, we will be thirsty again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our thirst can never be satisfied by the earthly water.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only God's gift of Jesus as our living water can give us satisfaction in life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, every Lord's Day our breaking of bread for the remembrance of the Lord is not a form of worship, but an eating, drinking, and enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The symbols on the table the bread and the cup signify the Lord's body that was broken for us and the new covenant that was enacted by the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are there for us to eat, drink, and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do this in remembrance of the Lord Matt 26:26-28; Luke 22:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the Lord does want us to remember Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But He does not want us to kneel down and to think about Him in silence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, He wants us to open ourselves up and to contact Him with our spirit, eating and drinking Him in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the true remembrance of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the past messages we have seen that in eternity past, God had an economy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to accomplish this economy, He passed through many processes to dispense Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From His incarnation to His becoming the life-giving Spirit, every step was for the accomplishment of His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Take the crucifixion for an example.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man hanged Him on the cross for six hours.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the first three hours, He was persecuted for the carrying out of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the last three hours, He was judged by God for the accomplishment of redemption on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This death was indeed a process which accomplished many works.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After this, He entered into death and Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Three days later, He resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This was another process.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As soon as He entered resurrection, He was transfigured to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By that time, all the processes that He had to go through were completed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The whole Gospel of John shows us this matter clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the start of the book, it says that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Later it shows us how the incarnated God-man Jesus lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the end, He was crucified and entered Hades; then He came out again to enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, who is the holy breath breathed into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this way, they all received the Holy Spirit.</S>
