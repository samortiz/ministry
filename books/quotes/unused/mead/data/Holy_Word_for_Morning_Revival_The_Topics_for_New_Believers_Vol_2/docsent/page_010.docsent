   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 9 DAY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rom 9:5 ...The Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1 Tim 2:5 For there is one God and one Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2 Cor 3:17 And the Lord is the Spirit...</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What Christ Is Christ Being God</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the side of truth, Romans 9:5 says that Christ is God, who is over all and blessed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>47 We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that our Lord Jesus Christ is the very God who is over all and blessed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is the infinite God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Concerning Him, Isaiah 9:6 says, For a child is born to us...and His name will be called...Mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We praise Christ for His deity, and we worship Him as God...blessed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>48 Confucius of China was very good and was revered as the greatest sage, yet he never dared to say, nor has anyone else ever said, that he was above all and was God blessed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, he said, Anyone who sins against heaven can no longer pray to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that he admitted that he was man, not God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when Christ was on the earth, He not only lived out God, but He also told people plainly that He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, He proved that He was God by signs and wonders and by the words of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The words spoken by Christ were simple yet mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They were not only lofty but also full of life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He said, I am...the life John 11:25; 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have life, but we are not life; Christ, however, is life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our life is fragile, but His life is transcendent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Him is life 1:4 ; only He is life 1 John 5:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus is the life, the light, and the sovereign Master.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, His disciple John wrote in the very beginning of his Gospel, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was in the beginning with God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being 1:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is the Creator, the sovereign Master of heaven and earth, and the real and living One.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>49</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ Being Man</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Timothy 2:5 says that Christ is also man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is more difficult to speak of Christ as man than to speak of Him as God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man is very ordinary; there is almost nothing special about being a man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, the apostle Paul said, For there is one God and one Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that the Lord Jesus is not only God but also man; hence, He is qualified to be the Mediator, the go-between, of God and men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This does not mean that He tired of being God and became a man instead, after which He became God again.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, in eternity He was God and not man, but two thousand years ago He was born of the virgin Mary through the Holy Spirit to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since then He is both God and man; He is the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ Being the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus not only lived a human life but was eventually crucified for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, He was resurrected from death and became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, The Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the Lord were not the Spirit today, He could not have an organic relationship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord s intention is not only to live by Himself but to enter into us that we may become His members to be His corporate Body for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, for Him to enter into us He has to be the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Both in Greek and in Hebrew the word spirit may also be rendered breath.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Spirit is like the breath, the air.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This does not mean, however, that the Lord as the Spirit is no longer a person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As the Spirit, He is still God, and He is also man as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today the God-man Jesus Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is truly a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>50</S>
