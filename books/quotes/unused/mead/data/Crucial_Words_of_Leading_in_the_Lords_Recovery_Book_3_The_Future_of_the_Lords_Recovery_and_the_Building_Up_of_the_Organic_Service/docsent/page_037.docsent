   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord s recovery is multifaceted, and it requires us to care for the truth, life, the church, and the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will cover the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Concerning the preaching of the gospel, there are three basic requirements: being beside ourselves, being thick-skinned, and opening our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>FOR PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first basic requirement for gospel preaching is that we need to be beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Prayer makes people beside themselves 2 Cor 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A person who has prayed thoroughly cannot help but be beside himself when he preaches the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even in other things, he will be beside himself, crazy, after he has prayed thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In addition to being crazy, we need to be thick-skinned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The basic requirements for preaching the gospel can be summed up in two words: crazy and thick.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We say this from our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are not crazy or if our skin is not thick, all our efforts will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must learn to be crazy, and we must exercise to have a thick skin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must also be practical and open our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Holy Spirit was poured out upon all flesh long ago, but the shortage is that we are not crazy, our skin is not thick enough, and our homes are not open.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We would like to fellowship concerning opening our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even though opening our homes is not easy, it is the easiest thing we can do for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, it is very effective.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Opening our homes is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before we fellowship concerning opening our homes, we will study a few hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>NOT LIVING FOR JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>BUT LIVING BEING JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The hymn Living for Jesus Hymns, #456 was written by a famous American brother within the past fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the brothers in Shanghai translated this hymn in 1949 or 1950, the truth in the translated version was more advanced than the truth in the original.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first stanza of the original hymn says,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Living for Jesus a life that is true,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Striving to please Him in all that I do;</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yielding allegiance, glad-hearted and free,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the pathway of blessing for me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>O Jesus, Lord and Savior,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I give myself to Thee,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For Thou, in Thy atonement,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Didst give Thyself for me;</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I own no other Master,</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>My heart shall be Thy throne,</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My life I give, henceforth to live,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>O Christ, for Thee alone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In our translation we corrected all the inaccuracies concerning the truth that were in the original.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But I would ask you, is this hymn really that good?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This hymn is good, but it is not good enough, because Paul says, To me, to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Bible to live for Jesus is second best; to live is Christ is the best thing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Regrettably, however, Christianity does not understand to live is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a point of debate between Christianity and us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christianity is in the realm of for Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Their realm is for Jesus, not is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I would ask which is higher, for Jesus or is Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Which is easier, for Jesus or is Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those with experience can testify that for Jesus is very difficult, but is Jesus is much easier.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is because in to live is Jesus, everything is just Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is not I but He who does everything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is He who makes the plans; it is not I who endeavors.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The greatest weakness of this hymn is that it is not written according to God s central lane.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Believers in Christianity are encouraged to give themselves to preach the gospel after every revival meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When I was young, we would sing Must I Go, and Empty-handed Hymns, #930 at revival meetings because this hymn encourages people to give themselves to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, this is for Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not wrong to be for Jesus, but there is a shortcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are not according to God s central lane if we are only for Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Being for Jesus causes people to veer off from God s central lane.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God s central lane is Christ as life, which is the Triune God dispensing Himself into us, His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hymn #377 in the Chinese hymnal is on Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The first stanza reads, Glory!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Glory!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Christ is life to me, / Glory!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Glory!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Spirit leads me; / Weakness turns to power, / Darkness turns to light; / Glory!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Glory!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Christ is life to me.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This hymn is very simple, but it is on the central lane of God s economy.</S>
