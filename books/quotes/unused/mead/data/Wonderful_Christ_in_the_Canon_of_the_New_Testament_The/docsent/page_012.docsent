   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ALL-INCLUSIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we try to understand Matthew and John with our limited mentality, we will only be confused.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew wrote a book about Christ in which he tells us that He is the son of David and the son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But John tells us that He is the Word, and the Word is God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John makes it clear that He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So what is He?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Is He the son of David, or the Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot analyze, and we cannot systematize Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no -ology with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is just the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should learn not to analyze, but to simply take the true Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE LAMB AND THE BRIDEGROOM</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Matthew goes back to Abraham, but John starts from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before the foundation of the world, before creation, the Word was there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And the Word was God!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then one day, this Word who was God became something else.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And the Word became flesh John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He became flesh to dwell among us full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is a wonderful person!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then John continues by telling us that He is the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Following that, in chapter three, he tells us that Jesus is the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He that hath the bride is the bridegroom John 3:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jesus is so wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is not only the Lamb, but also the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For redemption, He is the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Mankind is fallen, and full of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, He must be the Lamb to take away the sin of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But He is the Bridegroom for the marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Redemption is not the goal; redemption is just the procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Marriage is the goal!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>So He is the Word, God and then the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And the flesh is the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He must be the flesh to shed His blood as the redeeming Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And He is also the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In just the first three chapters of John we see that He is five things: the Word, God, the flesh, the Lamb, and the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is so much.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the Word and God He became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means He became a man, a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then this human being is the Lamb of God to redeem man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is also the universal Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the whole universe, the most pleasant person is Jesus as the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>John the Baptist tells us that He that has the Bride is the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So He comes for the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>SO MANY THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then in the following chapters of John we are told that He is the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Moreover, in John 10 we are told that He is the door, not the door to heaven, but the door out of religion!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God s people in John, chapter ten, were confined in the Jewish religion, and Jesus came to be the door that they might come out.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He took the lead to come out of that Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Peter followed, John followed, and the blind man of John 9 came out also.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Eventually, even Saul of Tarsus followed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He came out of that religion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Jesus is the door out of religion!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is still true today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Jesus is the door for religion, not for people to enter, but for them to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then, when we come out of religion, He is our Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>And under His shepherding, He is our green pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We read furthermore that He is the life, the truth, and the way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is the light, and even the living air for us to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is so many things!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>THE SPIRIT OF REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>John in his Gospel makes us clear that for Jesus to be so many things to us He must become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In chapter fourteen the Lord says, And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I will not leave you as orphans.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I am coming to you.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you John 14:16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He said that He would ask the Father to send us another comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But we should not consider this other comforter as another one besides Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>No, this comforter is the Lord as the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is why He told the disciples that He was not going to leave them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He was coming to them.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>His going away for three days was for His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Those three days would be a kind of process to transform Him through death and resurrection into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After the resurrection, the Lord came back to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He had been fully processed through crucifixion, burial, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Now He is not merely God; neither is He only God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Now He is God in the flesh crucified, buried and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Now it is so easy to take Him in. This is why we read in John 20:22, And when he had said this, he breathed into them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit.</S>
