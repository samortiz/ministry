7:21; 13:33; 25:1, 14; 1:1</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The kingdom of the heavens&mdash;3:2; 4:17; 5:3, 10; 7:21; 13:33; 25:1, 14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Matthew is a book on the kingdom, with Christ as the King, the Messiah; everything written in this book is related to the kingdom&mdash;2:2; 21:5; 27:11.</li>
	<li>The kingdom of God is God&rsquo;s reign in a general way over the entire universe by power and authority and also God&rsquo;s reign in a particular way in the sense of life&mdash;Psa. 103:19; 145:11-13; 1 Chron. 29:11; Dan. 4:3, 34b; John 3:3, 5.</li>
	<li>As a specific section within the kingdom of God, the kingdom of the heavens is the heavenly rule&mdash;the kingdom of God in the third heaven where God exercises His authority over everything created by Him&mdash;Matt. 3:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s intention is to have the earth controlled by the heavens; thus, His heavenly reign must descend to the earth to be the authority over the earth&mdash; 6:10.</li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus came to bring the heavenly rule to earth so that the earth might be recovered for God&rsquo;s right and that the will of God might be done on earth as in heaven&mdash;4:17; 5:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In order to understand the Gospel of Matthew, we need to know the three aspects of the kingdom of the heavens:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the inward contents of the kingdom of the heavens in its heavenly and spiritual nature&mdash;chs. 5&mdash;7.</li>
		<li>The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the outward state of the kingdom of the heavens&mdash; ch. 13.</li>
		<li>The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the practical coming of the kingdom of the heavens in power&mdash;chs. 24&mdash;25.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The kingdom of the heavens is the heavenly ruling, the heavenly government, of the Lord Jesus&mdash;25:31, 34:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Christ in Matthew is the King-Savior who sets up the kingdom of the heavens over us and within us&mdash;5:3.</li>
		<li>The Christ who entered into our spirit through regeneration is the King with the kingdom&mdash;John 3:5-6; Rom. 8:10; 1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>When He came into our spirit, the kingdom arrived with Him.</li>
			<li>Now in our spirit we have the King with the kingdom; thus, to say that the Lord is with our spirit means that the kingdom is with our spirit&mdash; 2 Tim. 4:22.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s intention in regenerating us is to bring us under His heavenly rule&mdash;John 3:3, 5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We have been born into a royal, heavenly family, and we must be exercised in a heavenly way and be governed by a heavenly rule&mdash;Matt. 5:48.</li>
			<li>If we are under this ruling, we will be victorious and overcoming, we will be in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, and we will enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens to rule and reign with the Lord&mdash;25:21, 23; Rev. 20:4, 6.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Jesus Christ&mdash;the son of David, the son of Abraham&mdash;Matt. 1:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Gospel of Matthew emphasizes the fact that Christ is the son of David&mdash;9:27; 15:22; 20:30-31; 21:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Solomon, the son of David, is a type of Christ inheriting the kingdom (2 Sam. 7:12b, 13b; Jer. 23:5; Luke 1:32-33), having wisdom and speaking the word of wisdom (Matt. 12:42), and building the temple of God (2 Sam. 7:13a).</li>
		<li>As the son of David, Christ brings us into the kingdom of the heavens; thus, the title <em>son of David</em> signifies the kingdom&mdash;Matt. 5:3.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s being the son of David is also for us to participate in the divine authority&mdash;16:19; 18:17-18; 28:18-19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Isaac, the son of Abraham, is a type of Christ as the promised One who brought the blessing to all the nations (Gen. 22:18; Gal. 3:16, 14), who was offered to God unto death and was resurrected (Gen. 22:1-12; Heb. 11:17, 19), and who will receive the bride (Gen. 24:67; John 3:29; Rev. 19:7).</li>
	<li>God made a covenant with Abraham and also with David&mdash;Gen. 12:2-3; 15:4-18; 17:1-2; 22:17-18; 2 Sam. 7:8-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The covenant God made with Abraham concerned God&rsquo;s coming to be the blessing to His chosen people&mdash;Gen. 22:17-18:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>As a result of this covenant, the processed Triune God as the consummated Spirit has become our blessing&mdash;Gal. 3:14.</li>
			<li>Christ as the seed of Abraham became the life-giving Spirit to impart Himself into His believers for the blessing of all the nations of the earth&mdash;Gen. 22:18; Gal. 3:16, 14; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The covenant God made with David concerned the kingdom&mdash;2 Sam. 7:8-16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Once God has a kingdom filled with His authority, then in His administration He can carry out whatever is on His heart to be the blessing promised to His chosen people.</li>
			<li>Christ as the seed of David is the resurrected King as God&rsquo;s sure mercies for the dispensing of God Himself into all the believers of Christ that they might share His kingship for God&rsquo;s administration&mdash;2 Sam. 7:12-13; Acts 13:32-35; Isa. 55:3-4; Rom. 5:17; Rev. 20:4, 6.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must receive Christ first as the son of David and then as the son of Abraham&mdash;Matt. 1:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To receive Christ as the son of David is to recognize His kingly status and to realize that we should be under His kingship and sovereignty.</li>
		<li>By receiving Christ as our King and living under His ruling, we enjoy the processed Triune God as our blessing.</li>
		<li>As the son of David and the son of Abraham, Christ brings us into the Triune God&mdash;28:19.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Although the Gospel of Matthew is a book on the kingdom, it is also a revelation of the all-inclusive Christ; it is a great blessing to see the revelation of Christ in this book&mdash;16:16-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is the heavenly King&mdash;2:1-2; 21:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Matthew proves that Jesus is the King, the Messiah prophesied in the Old Testament&mdash;1:1, 17; 2:1-2; 27:11, 37.</li>
		<li>The heavenly King did not come with haughty splendor but with gentle, humble meekness&mdash;21:5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God&mdash;16:16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>The Christ</em> refers to the anointed One of God and speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s commission to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose through His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and second coming&mdash;vv. 21, 27.</li>
		<li><em>The Son of the living God</em> speaks of His person, which embodies the Father and consummates in the Spirit for a full expression of the Triune God&mdash; John 14:10-11a; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ is the Son of Man&mdash;Matt. 8:20; 11:19; 13:37; 16:13:

		<li>In order for the kingdom of the heavens to be established, the Lord Jesus stood as a victorious man&mdash; a man who could defeat Satan and withstand any hardship, opposition, or attack&mdash;4:4; 12:40; 26:64.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ is the Baptizer&mdash;3:11:

		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s baptism in fire, which is based on His judgment, will conclude the kingdom of the heavens, putting the unbelievers into the lake of fire&mdash; v. 12b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ is the light of life shining in the darkness of death&mdash;4:12-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s ministry for the kingdom of the heavens began not with earthly power but with heavenly light.</li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus did not start a movement or a revolution; rather, He attracted the disciples to Himself as the great light for the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In calling people to follow Him for the kingdom, Christ ministered as a Physician and revealed Himself as the Bridegroom&mdash;9:9-15:

		<li>He came as a Physician to heal and enliven us so that we might be reconstituted to be citizens of the kingdom of the heavens&mdash;vv. 9-13.</li>

	<li>The individual Christ is the new wine, and the corporate Christ is the fresh wineskin&mdash;Matt. 9:17:

		<li>In His humanity, as the Son of Man and the heavenly King, all authority was given to Christ after His resurrection&mdash;v. 18.</li>

<li>The Gospel of Matthew is full of the riches of Christ; we need to worship Him, enjoy Him, and experience Him as the wonderful, all-inclusive One&mdash;2:11; 28:9, 17; 17:5.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Divine Trinity<br />
in the Divine Move and in Our Experience<br />
to Make Us the Kingdom People</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 1:20-23; 3:16-17;<br />
6:9-10, 13; 12:28; 28:19</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In Matthew 1 the Holy Spirit (vv. 18, 20), Christ (the Son&mdash;v. 18), and God (the Father&mdash;v. 23) are present for the producing of the man Jesus (v. 21), who, as Jehovah the Savior and God with us, is the very embodiment of the Triune God:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Matthew 1:20 and 21 reveal the divine conception of the Holy Spirit and the birth of Jesus (the Son); then verse 23 tells us that this One was called by men, Emmanuel, which means God (God the Father) with us.</li>
	<li>God the Father&rsquo;s being with us was the issue of the divine conception of the Holy Spirit and the birth of Jesus, the Son&mdash;cf. Luke 1:35.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In Matthew 3 the Son was standing in the water of baptism under the open heavens, the Spirit like a dove descended upon the Son, and the Father spoke out of the heavens to the Son&mdash;vv. 16-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord Jesus was born of the Spirit (Luke 1:35), having the Spirit of God within Him essentially for His birth; then for His ministry, the Spirit of God descended upon Him economically to anoint Him as the new King and introduce Him to His people&mdash;Isa. 61:1; 42:1; Psa. 45:7.</li>
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s being baptized to fulfill God&rsquo;s righteousness and to be put into death and resurrection brought Him three things: the open heavens, the descending Spirit of God, and the speaking of the Father; it is the same with us today.</li>
	<li>By the descending of the Spirit of God like a dove upon Him, the Lord Jesus ministered in gentleness and singleness, focusing solely on the will of God.</li>
	<li>The Spirit&rsquo;s descending was the anointing of Christ, whereas the Father&rsquo;s speaking was a testimony to Him as the beloved Son.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In Matthew 6 the prayer which the Lord teaches us to pray begins with the Triune God, in the sequence of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (vv. 9-10), and also ends with the Triune God, but in the sequence of the Son, the Spirit, and the Father (v. 13); to pray in this way is to pray that the Triune God will be prevailing on the earth as He is prevailing in the heavens:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In Matthew 6:9-10 the Lord teaches the believers to pray by expressing three petitions, which imply the Trinity of the Godhead: &ldquo;Your name be sanctified&rdquo; is related mainly to the Father; &ldquo;Your kingdom come,&rdquo; to the Son; and &ldquo;Your will be done,&rdquo; to the Spirit:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>For His name to be sanctified, we should express Him in our living with a daily life separated unto God and saturated with God&mdash;1 Pet. 1:15-17; 2 Pet. 1:4; cf. Isa. 11:2.</li>
		<li>For God&rsquo;s kingdom to come, we must live a life of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit&mdash; Rom. 14:17.</li>
		<li>For the divine will to be done on earth is to bring the heavenly ruling, the kingdom of the heavens, to this earth&mdash;cf. Matt. 8:9a.</li>
		<li>This is being fulfilled in this age, and it will be ultimately fulfilled in the coming kingdom age, when the name of God will be excellent in all the earth (Psa. 8:1), the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of Christ (Rev. 11:15), and the will of God will be accomplished.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s pattern of prayer concludes by saying, &ldquo;For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 6:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The kingdom is of the Son and is the realm in which God exercises His power; the power is of the Spirit and carries out God&rsquo;s intention so that the Father can express His glory.</li>
		<li>Thus, the prayer taught by the Lord in His supreme teaching begins with God the Father and ends also with God the Father, who is the beginning and the end, the Alpha and the Omega, that God the Father may be all in all&mdash;1 Cor. 15:28.</li>
		</ol></li>

<li>In Matthew 12 the Son, in the person of man, cast out demons by the Spirit to bring in the kingdom of God the Father&mdash;v. 28:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The way He cast out demons, by another One and for another One, showed that He did not act individualistically but with humility and selflessness.</li>
	<li>The Son as the center of the Divine Trinity was altogether not by Himself, for Himself, or to Himself; whatever He did was by the Spirit of God and for the kingdom of God the Father.</li>
	<li>This shows us the harmony, beauty, and excellency in the Divine Trinity.</li>
	<li>The move of the Divine Trinity with the divine coordination in Matthew 12:28 is an excellent and beautiful example for us to follow; this is a good pattern our Head has set up for our coordination as members of His Body:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Today in the church life, the Body of Christ has not been built up adequately because of the shortage of the proper coordination.</li>
		<li>We may do something according to the will of God, but what we do should not be by ourselves but by some others; furthermore, what we do should not be for ourselves but for the interest, the right, of God on this earth.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In Matthew 28 after Christ as the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45b) had passed through the process of crucifixion, entered into the realm of resurrection, and become the life-giving Spirit, He came back to His disciples in the atmosphere and reality of His resurrection to charge them to make the nations the kingdom people by baptizing them into the name, the person, the reality, of the Divine Trinity&mdash;v. 19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s being the center of the processed Triune God is for the disciples to baptize people into the processed Triune God by baptizing them into Him&mdash;Acts 8:16; 19:5; Gal. 3:27; Rom. 6:3-4; 1 Cor. 12:13.</li>
	<li>To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to bring them into an organic, spiritual, and mystical union with Him.</li>
	<li>The one name for the Divine Trinity is the sum total of the Divine Being, equivalent to His person; to baptize someone into the name of the Triune God is to immerse him into all that the Triune God is.</li>

<h1 class="title">Taking the Way of Righteousness<br />
to Live in the Reality of the Kingdom of the Heavens</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 21:32a; 3:13-15; 5:6, 10, 20; 6:33</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>John the Baptist came in the way of righteousness&mdash; Matt. 21:32a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The New Testament dispensation, the dispensation of grace, that is, the dispensation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, began from the preaching of John the Baptist&mdash; Mark 1:1-4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>John came in the way of righteousness and charged the people to repent because of the kingdom of the heavens&mdash;Matt. 3:2.</li>
		<li>The kingdom of God is of righteousness (Rom. 14:17), and the kingdom of the heavens is particularly based upon righteousness (Matt. 5:20), which is the foundation of God&rsquo;s throne (Psa. 89:14).</li>
		<li>When the people received John&rsquo;s preaching and came to repent to him, he right away baptized them by putting them into the water to bury them, indicating that they were men of the flesh who had nothing good (Rom. 7:18) and were worthy of only death and burial.</li>
		<li>Following John&rsquo;s ministry, Jesus Christ came and baptized these people with the Spirit, joining them, in resurrection, to God, who saved them by justifying them according to His righteousness&mdash;Rom. 1:17; 3:21-25; 1 Cor. 1:30.</li>
		<li>Furthermore, after He died judicially for these repentant people, Christ resurrected to live within them that they may live by Christ&rsquo;s life a life of righteousness to be justified by God all the time&mdash; Rom. 4:25.</li>
		<li>All these people are called &ldquo;the righteous,&rdquo; who will shine forth like the sun in the coming kingdom (Matt. 13:43), and their righteousness will abide in the new heavens and new earth forever (2 Pet. 3:13).</li>
		<li>Thus, to repent and be baptized according to John&rsquo;s preaching and practice were ordained by God according to the righteous requirements of God&rsquo;s eternal economy; hence, this is to fulfill the righteousness of God (Matt. 3:15) as a matter of eternity.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Matthew 3:13-15 reveals the proper and righteous base of Jesus&rsquo; baptism:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The base for Jesus to be baptized was that He considered Himself, according to His humanity, a man, especially an Israelite, who is a man &ldquo;in the flesh&rdquo; (John 1:14); even though He was only &ldquo;in the likeness of the flesh of sin&rdquo; (Rom. 8:3), &ldquo;without sin&rdquo; (Heb. 4:15), yet He was &ldquo;in the flesh,&rdquo; which has nothing good but is worthy only of death and burial.</li>
		<li>Based upon this fact, at the beginning of His ministry for God, He was willing to be baptized by John the Baptist, recognizing that, according to His humanity, He did not have any qualification to be a servant of God.</li>
		<li>As a man in the flesh, He needed to be a dead man, buried in the death water to fulfill God&rsquo;s New Testament requirement according to His righteousness, and He did it willingly, considering it the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s righteousness.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s living for His ministry was based upon the significance of His being baptized by John, which declared to the whole universe that He did not depend at all upon the flesh for God&rsquo;s ministry:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We need to realize that as a natural man in the flesh, we are good for nothing except death and burial; we need to have ourselves absolutely terminated in the water of baptism.</li>
			<li>We all should declare in our life and work, &ldquo;I am a person in the flesh, worthy of nothing in the eyes of God but death and burial; so I want to have myself terminated, crucified, buried.&rdquo;</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Based upon the significance of water baptism, the Lord Jesus as the King-Savior lived and expressed God as righteousness by denying Himself in His humanity:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>He put Himself on the cross and lived under the shadow of the cross all the time denying His self and His natural man&mdash;Matt. 16:24.</li>
	<li>He had no resting place&mdash;8:20.</li>
	<li>He had a concern for God&rsquo;s flock&mdash;9:36; 11:5; cf. Luke 4:18-19.</li>
	<li>He lived under the yoke of God, being meek and lowly in heart&mdash;Matt. 11:28-29.</li>
	<li>He charged people not to make Him known, meaning that He did not want to be renowned&mdash;12:16.</li>
	<li>He loved the weak ones&mdash;vv. 19-20.</li>
	<li>He was flexible&mdash;17:27.</li>
	<li>He came to serve, not to be served&mdash;20:28.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to live in the reality of the kingdom today and participate in its manifestation in the future, we need to live out the indwelling Christ as our subjective righteousness&mdash;Matt. 5:20; 22:11-12; Rev. 19:7-8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>It is impossible for our natural life to gain this surpassing righteousness; it can be produced only by a higher life, the resurrection life of Christ.</li>
	<li>Both in nature and in standard, the righteousness of life far surpasses the lifeless righteousness practiced by the scribes and Pharisees&mdash;cf. Phil. 3:9.</li>
	<li>We need to hunger and thirst after Christ as our surpassing righteousness; then God will grant us the very righteousness that we seek, so that we may be satisfied&mdash;Matt. 5:6, 10; 6:33.</li>
	<li>The principle of the righteous deeds of the kingdom people who are under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom is that they are not allowed to do anything in the flesh for the praise of men, but must do all things in the spirit, in secret, for the pleasing of their heavenly Father&mdash;vv. 1-6, 16-18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We must do our righteous deeds in secret, for our Father is in secret and sees in secret&mdash;vv. 4, 6, 18.</li>
		<li>The effect of doing our righteous deeds in secret is that the flesh and the self are killed.</li>
		<li>The saints who know only to make a show of the self and a display of the flesh will not grow in life.</li>

	<li>In particular, the expression of the kingdom is with the virtues of meekness, righteousness, mercy, purity, and peacefulness&mdash;vv. 5-10, 20.</li>
	<li>The highest standard of morality is the living of One&mdash; the Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;whose life is a composition of the divine essence with all the divine attributes and the human essence with all the human virtues&mdash;1:18, 20; Luke 1:35:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The makeup of Christ&rsquo;s being, His constitution, is a composition of the divine nature with the divine attributes and the human nature with the human virtues.</li>
		<li>In Christ the divine attributes fill, strengthen, and sanctify the human virtues for the purpose of expressing God in the human virtues.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s human living was the living of a man who lived God to express the divine attributes in the human virtues.</li>
		<li>Christ is now seeking to live in us the kind of life He lived on earth&mdash;a life that is a composition of the divine attributes and the human virtues&mdash;John 14:19b; Gal. 2:20; 4:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s intention in His New Testament economy is that all the believers become a reproduction of Christ, living a life in which the attributes of God are expressed in the virtues of man&mdash;Phil. 1:19-21a.</li>
	<li>Eventually, through our growth in life we will be the same as God is in life and nature and live a life with the highest standard of morality for the expression of the kingdom in the divine attributes and human virtues&mdash;Matt. 5:48.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>If we intend to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, we need to practice the highest standard of morality as revealed by the Lord Jesus in 5:17-48:

	<li>The highest standard of morality involves keeping the principles of the law&mdash;vv. 17-20:

		<li>Christ&rsquo;s fulfilling the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross brought in the resurrection life to complement the law&mdash;vv. 22, 28, 32, 34, 39, 44.</li>
		<li>As children of the Father, we now need to fulfill the new, higher law by the resurrection life, which is the eternal life of the Father&mdash;vv. 9, 45:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This highest life, the life on the highest plane, within us can fulfill the requirements of the highest law.</li>
			<li>In this way we keep the principles of the law to have the highest standard of morality for the expression of the kingdom&mdash;v. 16; 13:43a.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In order to have the highest standard of morality, we need to overcome our anger and lust&mdash;5:21-32:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The new law of the kingdom deals with anger, the motive of murder&mdash;vv. 21-22:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We all are subject to dispositional anger, the anger hidden in our disposition&mdash;Jonah 4:1, 4, 9.</li>
			<li>The root of anger is the self; in order to deal with anger, we must deal with the self&mdash;Matt. 16:24.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The new law of the kingdom recovers marriage back to what God designed in the beginning&mdash; 5:27-32; 19:4-6.</li>
		<li>Because of the anger and lust within us, we need to remain in constant fellowship with the Lord, receiving the divine dispensing and experiencing and enjoying the divine life&mdash;1 John 1:3; Rom. 8:2, 6, 10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The requirements of the highest standard of morality can be met only by the Father&rsquo;s life, not by our natural life&mdash;Matt. 5:48:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the life of the Father is the highest supply to meet this demand.</li>
		<li>As children of God, we have a heavenly requirement within us demanding that we live on a high level; this level can be reached only by the supply of the divine life&mdash;vv. 9, 45.</li>
		<li>The requirements of verses 17-48 reveal how much the Father&rsquo;s life can do for us, the Father&rsquo;s children, having the Father&rsquo;s life and nature&mdash;1 John 3:1:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>These requirements are actually an expression of the divine life, which is within the regenerated kingdom people&mdash;John 3:3, 5-6, 15-16.</li>

<li>For the believers to be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect is to be perfect in His love&mdash;Matt. 5:48; 1 John 4:8, 16; Rom. 13:10; Gal. 5:14:

		<li>As God&rsquo;s species, we should not only love others; we should <em>be</em> love because God is love&mdash;1 John 4:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Only one kind of love is genuine, and that is the love which comes out of God&rsquo;s dispensing&mdash;Rom. 8:39, 35; 15:30; 5:5:

	<li>To be righteous is to give one what he deserves, whereas to be merciful is to give one what he does not deserve.</li>
	<li>If we are merciful to others, the Lord will give us mercy (2 Tim. 1:16, 18), especially at His judgment seat (James 2:12-13).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 5:8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To have a pure heart means that our heart is single, seeking nothing but the Lord Himself, so that Christ may grow in us without frustration&mdash;13:19-23.</li>
	<li>To be pure in heart is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God&rsquo;s will for God&rsquo;s glory&mdash;1 Cor. 10:31.</li>
	<li>If we are pure in heart in seeking God, our reward is that we will see God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Seeing God equals gaining God so that we may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
		<li>The more we see God, the more we abhor ourselves&mdash;Job 42:5-6.</li>
		<li>If we see the Lord, we will see that the things and objects of this world are trash&mdash;Phil. 3:7-8; cf. Jer. 15:19.</li>
		<li>Spiritual progress is the increase of the element of God in us and the decrease of things within us that usurp God&rsquo;s place&mdash;1 Tim. 4:15; Col. 2:19:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>As long as there is one thing, one event, or one person that takes possession of us, there is something in our heart usurping the place of God&mdash;cf. 2 Tim. 3:2, 4; Mark 12:30; Prov. 4:23.</li>
			<li>We must be pure; our heart should not be occupied by anything other than God&mdash;Matt. 13:19-23.</li>
			<li>Our spiritual progress depends on the degree to which our heart is turned towards God&mdash;Matt. 4:17; 2 Cor. 3:16; cf. 2 Kings 23:25.</li>
			<li>The more a person is in the word of God, the purer he becomes&mdash;Psa. 12:6; 119:140; John 17:17.</li>
			</ol></li>

<li>&ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 5:9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Satan, the rebellious one, is the instigator of all rebellion; for the kingdom of the heavens, under its heavenly ruling, we must be those who make peace among men&mdash;Heb. 12:14.</li>
	<li>Our Father is the God of peace (Rom. 15:33; 16:20), and we must walk in His peaceful life and according to His peaceful nature; in this way we will express His life and nature and be called the sons of God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 5:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The whole world lies in the evil one (1 John 5:19) and is filled with unrighteousness; if we hunger and thirst for righteousness, we will be persecuted for the sake of righteousness.</li>
	<li>For the sake of the kingdom of the heavens, we need to pay a price for the righteousness that we seek.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me. Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you&rdquo;&mdash; Matt. 5:11-12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When we live a life in the spiritual nature of the kingdom and according to the heavenly principles of the kingdom, we are reproached, persecuted, and evilly spoken of, mostly by the religious people, who hold to their traditional religious concepts&mdash;Acts 5:41; 13:45, 50; 2 Cor. 6:8; Rom. 3:8.</li>
	<li>This persecution is because of our following Christ, the new King&mdash;cf. Acts 13:50-52.</li>

	<li>The ultimate issue of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is the will of the heavenly Father&mdash;7:21.</li>
	<li>As the kingdom people, we are on earth to do the Father&rsquo;s will&mdash;7:21; 12:50.</li>
	<li>In order to do the will of the Father, we need to enter in through the narrow gate and walk on the constricted way&mdash;7:13-14:

		<li>The narrow gate excludes the old man, the self, the flesh, the human concept, and the world with all its glory; only that which corresponds with God&rsquo;s will can enter in.</li>

	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 16:18 is the greatest prophecy in the Bible: &ldquo;I will build My church&rdquo;:

		<li>In His heavenly ministry the ascended Christ is directing and managing the building up of His church&mdash;Eph. 1:19-23; 4:8-16.</li>

		<li>As the stone for God&rsquo;s building, Christ is the foundation stone, the topstone, and the cornerstone; in Him and through Him, we are becoming living stones to be built up as a spiritual house&mdash;Matt. 21:42, 44; Isa. 28:16; Zech. 3:9; 4:7; 1 Pet. 2:4-5.</li>
		<li>The Gospel of Matthew is concerned with the kingdom of the heavens, which is a matter of authority; thus, the church in this book represents the kingdom to reign&mdash;16:18-19; 18:18:

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 7:1-12; 18:1-35</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Matthew 7:1-12 concerns the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others and reveals that the heavenly ruling over the kingdom people requires that they take care of others:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The kingdom people, living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, always judge themselves, not others&mdash;v. 1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we judge others with righteousness, we will be judged with righteousness by the Lord.</li>
		<li>If we judge others with mercy, we will be judged with mercy by the Lord; mercy triumphs over judgment&mdash;James 2:13.</li>
		<li>For us to deal with others, we must reject ourselves and consider them, sympathize with them, and be merciful toward them.</li>
		<li>The splinter in our brother&rsquo;s eye must remind us of the beam in our own eye&mdash;Matt. 7:3.</li>
		<li>As long as the beam remains in our eye, our vision is blurred and we cannot see clearly&mdash;vv. 4-5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We should not give that which is holy to the dogs or cast our pearls before the hogs, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn and tear us&mdash;v. 6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>That which is holy</em> must refer to the objective truth, which belongs to God; <em>your pearls</em> must refer to the subjective experiences, which are ours.</li>
		<li>Dogs do not have hoofs, nor do they chew the cud; hogs have divided hoofs but do not chew the cud; thus, both are unclean&mdash;Lev. 11:27, 7; cf. Acts 10:1-15, 28.</li>
		<li>According to the revelation in 2 Peter 2:12, 19-22, and Philippians 3:2, <em>dogs</em> and <em>hogs</em> here refer to people who are religious but not clean.</li>
		<li>When we talk to others about the truth or our precious experiences of Christ, we must perceive and determine whether or not they have the capacity to receive what we intend to share.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As we are contacting people and dealing with them, we must ask, seek, and knock for the proper way to contact them&mdash;Matt. 7:7-8; 1 Tim. 5:1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To ask is to pray in a common way, to seek is to supplicate in a specific way, and to knock is to demand in the most intimate and most earnest way.</li>
		<li>The best way for the kingdom people to contact others is according to the kingdom and according to the Spirit&mdash;Matt. 7:9-12; cf. Luke 11:13.</li>
		<li>We need to pray ourselves into God to receive the riches embodied in His Spirit to feed ourselves and all those under our care&mdash;Luke 11:1-13.</li>
		<li>We must learn to do everything through the cross and by the Spirit to minister Christ into others for His Body&mdash;cf. 2 Chron. 1:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To live the kingdom life, the God-man life, the church life, we must be humble and not despise any believer, but love our brother and forgive our brother&mdash;Matt. 18:1-35; 5:48; 7:13-14; Rom. 14:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To live the kingdom life, we must humble ourselves and become like little children&mdash;Matt. 18:2-4.</li>
	<li>To live the kingdom life, we should not stumble others or set up any stumbling block&mdash;vv. 5-9; cf. 11:6.</li>
	<li>To live the kingdom life, we should not despise even a little believer&mdash;18:10-14.</li>
	<li>To live the kingdom life, we should hear the church and not be condemned by it&mdash;vv. 15-20; cf. 5:23-25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>What is unveiled in Matthew 18:15-22 unveils to us how to take care of a sinning brother in a vital group:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Go and reprove him between you and him alone; if he hears you, you have gained your brother&mdash; v. 15.</li>
			<li>If he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established&mdash;v. 16.</li>
			<li>If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church&mdash;v. 17a.</li>
			<li>If he refuses to hear the church also, the vital group should pray by exercising the authority of the church, which is the authority of the kingdom&mdash;vv. 17b-18; 16:18-19.</li>
			<li>Such a situation is dealt with by the vital group in harmony with the Lord in their midst and with a forgiving spirit&mdash;18:19-22.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>By this way the vital groups live the God-man life as Christ did when He was living on the earth.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To live the kingdom life, we should forgive our brother without limit&mdash;vv. 21-35:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We must forgive the offending brother even seventy times seven&mdash;vv. 21-22.</li>
		<li>We must forgive others as the Lord has forgiven us:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Our debt to the Lord is impossible to pay off&mdash; vv. 23-26.</li>
			<li>The Lord forgave our debts in our defeated Christian life for the restoration of our fellowship with Him&mdash;v. 27.</li>
			<li>Another&rsquo;s debt to us is very small compared with our debt to the Lord&mdash;v. 28.</li>
			<li>If we do not forgive the brother who sins against us, it will grieve the other brothers, and they may bring this matter to the Lord&mdash;vv. 29-31.</li>
			<li>If we do not forgive a brother from our heart today, we will not be allowed to enter into the kingdom in the coming age&mdash;vv. 32-35; cf. Mark 11:25-26.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>To have a religion is to worship God, to serve God, and to do certain things to please God, yet without Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To be religious means to do something for God without Christ and without the Spirit&mdash;Matt. 9:14-17.</li>
	<li>Christ did not come to establish an earthly religion of rituals and dead religious practices but a heavenly kingdom of life with Himself, the all-inclusive One, as the full enjoyment of His followers that they might become the constituents of His kingdom&mdash;21:41-46.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Gospel of Matthew reveals that Christ is versus religion and that the things concerning Christ are outside of religion:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The birth of Christ, the finding of Christ, the recommending of Christ, and the following of Christ were all outside of religion&mdash;1:18-23; 2:1-12; 3:1-12; 4:12-22.</li>
	<li>Any thought of doing things miraculously in religion is a temptation of the devil&mdash;4:5-7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The devil tempted the Lord Jesus to assume His position as the Son of God and to display His power and authority by casting Himself down from the wing of the temple and having a miracle of protection by the angels.</li>
		<li>If we would be the kingdom people, we must overcome the temptation to exhibit religious power and the desire to be a great one in religion.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the Physician and the Bridegroom, Christ is versus religion&mdash;9:12, 15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In dealing with the self-righteous and dissenting Pharisees, who were of the old religion, the Lord Jesus indicated that He was a Physician who had come to heal the sick&mdash;vv. 9-13.</li>
		<li>In dealing with the fasting and dissenting disciples of John, who were of the new religion, He revealed Himself as the Bridegroom who had come to take the bride&mdash;vv. 14-15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Old wineskins signify religious forms, rituals, and practices; all religions are old wineskins&mdash;v. 17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To put new wine into old wineskins is to put Christ as the exciting life into any kind of religion.</li>
		<li>We need to experience and enjoy Christ as the Forgiver, the Physician, the Bridegroom, the new garment, and the new wine so that we may be the fresh wineskin, the corporate Christ, to contain Him&mdash;vv. 1-17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus exposed the Sanhedrin and the synagogues as being opposed to God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;10:16-33:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord indicated that there were wolves in the synagogues, and He spoke of the synagogue of Satan; this proves that the synagogue had become satanic&mdash;v. 16; Rev. 2:9; 3:9.</li>
		<li>The religious world and the political world are the same in opposing the kingdom of the heavens, for both are under the usurping hand of the enemy; nevertheless, the heavenly King intends to establish His kingdom on earth within the territory of religion and politics.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>After the Lord called people to rest from striving to keep the law and religious regulations, He deliberately broke the regulation concerning the Sabbath&mdash;Matt. 11:28&mdash;12:8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord Jesus brought His hungry disciples into the grainfields so that they could be satisfied and enter into rest.</li>
		<li>As the real David, the greater temple, and the Lord of the Sabbath, He could do whatever He liked on the Sabbath, and whatever He did was justified by Himself&mdash;12:3-8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>On the Sabbath the Lord Jesus restored a man&rsquo;s withered hand, likening this man to a sheep&mdash;vv. 9-14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord cares not for religious regulations but for the healing of His members and for the rescue of His fallen sheep.</li>
		<li>Christ cares for Himself as the Head of the Body and for the members of His Body&mdash;vv. 8-13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus does not care for religious tradition; He cares for inward reality&mdash;15:1-20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The heavenly ruling of the kingdom requires inward reality, not mere outward practice, in that it deals with the condition of the heart&mdash;vv. 11-20.</li>
		<li>Since the Lord cares for inward reality, not outward practice, we also should care for inward reality, that is, for the inward experience of Christ.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In 16:6-12 the Lord Jesus warned His disciples concerning religious leaven:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The teaching of both the Pharisees and the Sadducees was likened to leaven, which was not to be seen among God&rsquo;s people&mdash;vv. 6, 12; Exo. 13:7.</li>

	<li>The revelation concerning Christ with His church was given outside of religion, in a place with a clear atmosphere&mdash;Matt. 16:13-19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we are under the influence of religious leaven, we cannot be clear regarding Christ and the church; this revelation is hidden from religious people.</li>
		<li>The living God is in contrast to dead religion; Christ is the embodiment of the living God, having nothing to do with dead religion&mdash;v. 16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s rebuke of the scribes and Pharisees in 23:1-36 affords an accurate picture of today&rsquo;s religion; the kingdom life and the kingdom people are the opposite of what is exposed here.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus stayed away from Jerusalem to lodge in Bethany&mdash;21:12-17:

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:16-28</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In Matthew 16 the way to build up the church and the enemy of the building are revealed:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ, the Son of the living God, builds the church on Himself as the rock, with stones such as Peter, a transformed person&mdash;vv. 16-18.</li>
	<li>The gates of Hades, Satan&rsquo;s authority or power of darkness, attacks the church to frustrate the Lord from building up the church&mdash;v. 18.</li>
	<li>In order to build the church, the Lord had to pass through death and enter into resurrection&mdash;v. 21:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church was produced through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection&mdash;John 12:24.</li>
		<li>The way to build the church is to be crucified and resurrected&mdash;cf. 2 Cor. 4:10-12; Gal. 2:20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Peter, with a good heart, rebuked the Lord and tried to prevent the Lord from going to Jerusalem to be crucified&mdash;Matt. 16:22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It was not Peter but Satan who came out through one of the gates of Hades, the gate of Peter&rsquo;s self, to try to frustrate the Lord from building up the church&mdash;v. 23.</li>
		<li>The self, the mind, and the soul-life are the main gates through which Satan comes forth to attack and damage the church&mdash;vv. 23-26.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The building up of the church depends on the shutting up of the gates of Hades through the exercise of three keys&mdash;Matt. 16:24-26:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need to learn to exercise the key of denying the self&mdash;v. 24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The self is the embodiment of Satan; the self is the soul plus the satanic mind, the mind of Satan&mdash; Gen. 3:1-6; Matt. 16:22-23:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The self is the embodiment of the soul-life, which is expressed through the mind; thus, the self, the soul-life, and the mind are three-in-one.</li>
			<li>Behind these three is Satan, who manipulates the self in order to damage the church&mdash;v. 23.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The self is the soul declaring independence from God:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Lord does not have regard for what we do; rather, He has regard for our dependence on Him&mdash;7:21-23.</li>
			<li>The enemy of the Body is the self; because the self is something independent, the self is the greatest problem, the greatest frustration and opposition, to the building up of the Body:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) We should depend not only on God but also on the Body, on the brothers and sisters&mdash; Exo. 17:11-13; Acts 9:25; 2 Cor. 11:33.</li>
				<li>2) The Lord and the Body are one; hence, if we are dependent on the Body, we are also dependent on the Lord, and if we are independent of the Body, we are spontaneously independent of the Lord.</li>
				<li>3) When we are dependent, the self is gone, and instead of the self, we have the Lord&rsquo;s presence and are full of peace.</li>
				<li>4) If we exercise the key of denying the self to lock up the self, it would be impossible for us to be offended&mdash;cf. Luke 23:34; Acts 7:60.</li>
				<li>5) Only when the self has been utterly dealt with by the cross are we able to touch the reality of the Body of Christ and come to know the Body.</li>

	<li>We need to learn to exercise the key of taking up the cross&mdash;Matt. 16:24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To take up the cross simply means to take up the will of God; the cross is God&rsquo;s will&mdash;cf. 26:39:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Lord Jesus was willing to be crucified so that through His death, His life might be released to produce and build up the church&mdash; John 12:24; 2 Cor. 4:12.</li>
			<li>The cross was a great suffering to the Lord, but He cared not for the suffering but for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;Heb. 12:2; Col. 1:24.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li><em>Let him...take up his cross</em> (Matt. 16:24) means that we are not forced to bear the cross but that we willingly take it up.</li>
		<li>The one church is God&rsquo;s will, and every brother and sister in the church is God&rsquo;s will; thus, to bear the cross is to bear the church and to bear all of the saints that we would have the genuine oneness&mdash;John 17:21-23; Eph. 4:3, 13; 1 Cor. 1:10; Phil. 2:2.</li>
		<li>We need to remain on the cross, keeping our old man under the termination of the cross day by day&mdash;Luke 14:27; Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20; Phil. 3:10; 1 Cor. 15:31.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to learn to exercise the key of losing the soul-life&mdash;Matt. 16:25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To save the soul-life is to please the self by allowing the soul to have its enjoyment; to lose the soul-life is to lose the enjoyment of the soul:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Receiving God into man&rsquo;s spirit and expressing God through the soul should be man&rsquo;s joy and amusement&mdash;cf. Neh. 8:10; Rom. 14:17.</li>
			<li>The Lord Jesus lost the enjoyment of His soul in this age so that He might find His soul-life in the coming age (John 10:11; Isa. 53:12); we must do the same.</li>
			<li>If we save our soul-life in this age, we will lose it in the coming age, but if we lose our soul-life in this age, we will find it in the coming age&mdash; Matt. 16:25.</li>
			<li>We need to love the Lord Jesus and to hate and deny our soul-life, not loving our soul-life even unto death&mdash;1 Cor. 16:22; 2:9; Luke 14:26; 9:23; Rev. 12:11.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>If we are willing to lose all our present soulish enjoyment for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, for the sake of the church, and for the sake of all the saints, others will be nourished by us and will be built up through us; this is not a suffering but a joy&mdash;Heb. 12:2.</li>
		<li>The kingdom reward of sharing the King&rsquo;s joy in ruling over the earth in the manifestation of the kingdom depends upon whether or not we save our soul-life in this age or lose it&mdash;Matt. 16:25-28; 25:21, 23.</li>
