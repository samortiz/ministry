   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Lord s recovery we are fighting a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Primarily we must fight against the use of good things as substitutes for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In his subtlety, the enemy, Satan, uses many things to attract people away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some are distracted from Christ by teachings or by their concept of what is correct Bible doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, some condemn the practice of calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They claim that this is not according to Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some have accused us of inventing new ways of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Others have asked us why we cannot go along with the methods of worship that have been practiced by Christians for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is wrong with calling on the name of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not my intention to cause other Christians trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the Lord has charged me to tell His people of the need to call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not a new teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such a practice is first spoken of in Genesis 4:26.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This verse says, Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This verse and dozens of other verses as well indicate that to call on the name of the Lord is certainly a scriptural teaching and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse after verse in both the Old Testament and in the New Testament encourages us to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>PRAY-READING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Others are offended by pray-reading and criticize us for this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to them, this is our invention.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not my desire to argue with anyone about things such as this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, I wish to point out that Ephesians 6:17 and 18 speak of taking the word of God by means of all prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, if we are truly scriptural, we will take the Word not only by reading, studying, and searching, but also by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With verses such as Ephesians 6:17 and 18 before us, who can say that to pray-read the Word is not according to the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How much we need to turn from the traditional understanding and come back to Christ Himself and to the pure Word of God!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>EXPRESSING CHRIST IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As Christians who live by Christ, whenever we come together we should follow the indwelling Spirit to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no need to have a set way in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit knows how to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In each meeting we should simply open to Him and follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not always necessary to open the meeting with a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps someone will stand and offer living praises to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not come to the meeting according to our concept, for it is too much under the influence of religious tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, if we would express Christ in the meeting, we need to experience Him in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some have very little of Christ with which to function and to minister because they have little experience of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, they are pew members.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the meetings of the recovered church life, the saints who live by Christ need to express Christ in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only the Spirit knows the way to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In some of the coming messages we shall consider the matter of speaking Christ to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ephesians 5:18 and 19 exhort us to be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to stand up to declare what Christ is to us and how we have experienced Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this way we shall speak Christ to one another, and Christ will be richly expressed in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then in a very practical way the church will be filled unto all the fullness of God, with the overflow of all that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church life will be not the expression of gifts, knowledge, or power, but the expression of the living Christ.</S>
