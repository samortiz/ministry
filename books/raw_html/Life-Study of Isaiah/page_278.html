<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Issuing in the Following Items</H2><P>As we have seen in this message, Christ's resurrection issued in the following items:</P><ol class="decimal"><li>The incarnated Christ becoming the compound, consummated, and all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</li><li>The preeminent Christ becoming the Firstborn from among the dead to germinate God's new creation and to be the Head of the Body.</li><li>The only begotten Son of God being begotten to be the firstborn Son of God in both divine and human natures.</li><li>Many sons of God to be the household of God as the kingdom of God:</li>	<ol class="lower-alpha">	<li>As the many brothers of Christ, forming the church.</li>	<li>As the many members of Christ, constituting the Body of Christ.</li>	<li>As the many grains of wheat, forming the one bread.</li>	<li>As the one corporate seed to be His continuation to extend His days and to carry out the pleasure of God according to God's New Testament economy.</li>	</ol><li>The all-inclusive Christ being all the members and in all the members of the new man.</li></ol><P>All these things were produced by the resurrection of Christ. This is the revelation of the all-inclusive Christ according to the holy Word. Although Isaiah wrote only a few lines concerning Christ in His resurrection, his writing comprises all the above-mentioned items as the explanation, the definition, of Christ's resurrection given by the apostle Paul.</P>
