You have given us the Father's name, the Father's life, and the Father's glory, and You have given us the sanctifying holy word
Oh, what a wonder and what a blessing that the Father loves You, and You love us, and now in turn we love You!
Lord Jesus, thank You that there is such a divine love, a mutual love, from the Father to You, from You to us, and now from us to You
Thank You, Lord, for the divine name, for the divine life, for the divine word, for the divine glory, and even for the divine love
The Father has given us to You, and You have given to us the Father's name, the Father's word, and even the Father's glory
We enjoy Your essence, we enjoy Your element, we enjoy Your presence, and we even enjoy Your countenance; we see You face to face
We need to stand on this promise and believe that our God, the God of peace, will surely crush Satan under our feet
The subject in these elders' meetings is the intrinsic problem in the Lord's recovery today and its scriptural remedy
According to my observation, the problem among us came in because of the shortage of the proper understanding of the genuine oneness
By considering the problems in the early church, we can find some examples that will help us to find a remedy for our present situation
The genuine oneness of the Body is nothing less than the Triune God, who is not only triune but also processed and consummated
At that time this oneness was not yet a reality however a model of this onenessthe oneness among the Three of the Divine Trinitywas there
To be in the Father's name is to be in the Father's person, for in the New Testament, the name always denotes the person
Since we have the Father's life, we also have the Father's nature, for the nature always goes along with the life
The oneness of all the believers in Christ is in the Triune God through sanctification by the reality of the word
To be in the Triune God as our oneness, we need to be sanctified, that is, we need to be separated from being mixed with the world
We must be separated from being mixed with the world, so that we can be holy unto the Triune God to have a pure mingling with Him
The first aspect concerns the source and the element of the oneness, and the second concerns the standing of the oneness
After many years of studying the New Testament, we have found out that God's glory is His divine life with His divine nature to express Him
If we did not have the Father's life with the Father's nature, it would be impossible for us to express the Father
The Father gave this glory to the Son that the Son may have the Father's life with the Father's nature to express the Father
The oneness of all the believers in the divine glory is the oneness in the expressed sonship with the Father's life and nature
We must not act or do anything to express ourself rather we must do things in the Fathers life with the Fathers nature to express the Father
Such an expression is a mingling of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected God with all His redeemed in their humanity
The model for the genuine oneness was there at the time of the Lord's prayer, but the actual oneness had not yet come
In the second kind of oneness, the oneness of the Spirit, we have only the actuality of the oneness; we do not yet have the practicality
On the day of Pentecost, the Triune God mingled Himself with His redeemed people, and this mingling became the actuality of the oneness
The Body as the object is mingled with the Divine Trinity as the elements to be the factors of the oneness of the Spirit
Faith is the means for the Body to be joined to Christ the Head and baptism is the means for the Body to be separated from Adam the old head
The genuine oneness is the Spirit, the Son, and the Father mingled with the Body through baptism and faith, with a hope of something to come
The one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one God, one faith, one baptism, and one hope make the Body one in every aspect as its attributes
When we experience this oneness, the actuality becomes our practicality; the actual oneness becomes our practical oneness
We keep the oneness by practicing the oneness, first diligently, then with all lowliness, all meekness, and all longsuffering
In this way we practice the possessed oneness and thus keep it to have a walk that is worthy of the calling with which God has called us
The faith mentioned in Ephesians 4:13 is the objective faith, denoting all the things in which we believe for our salvation
Some so-called Christians say that they believe that Christ is the Savior, but they do not believe that Christ is God
The believers in Christ need to go on until they all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God
In a similar way, we need to grow in the divine life until we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness, the Body, of Christ
The winds of teaching may have the appearance of truth, but in such teaching the truth may be applied for the purpose of causing division
In 1 Corinthians 1:12, some of the Corinthian believers said, 'I am of Paul,' some said, 'I am of Apollos,' and some said, 'I am of Cephas'
We all must be of Christ, but to say that we are of Christ so as to designate ourselves as different from other believers is divisive
It is not a matter of whether a certain kind of speaking is right or wrong; it is a matter of whether or not it is divisive
The oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God fulfills the aspiration and prayer of the Lord in John 17
In the second kind of oneness, the oneness of the Spirit, that aspiration and prayer was accomplished but was not yet fulfilled
Strictly speaking, the genuine oneness is not of the church but of the Body; it is the Body's own organic oneness
In Ephesians 4:4, after telling us to keep the oneness of the Spirit, Paul did not say, 'One church and one Spirit
If in a prayer meeting we each pray in our own way, without any accord among us, how could we say that we are practicing the oneness?
As a test of whether we are practicing the oneness or not, we may check to see whether there is one accord in our prayer meeting
Such a shaking and nodding of our head is strong evidence that we do not practice oneness, because we do not have the one accord
The one accord is the practice, the application, of the oneness, and the oneness is the basis on which we practice the one accord
If we each have our own opinion, our own intention, and our own goal, there will be no base on which we can pray in one accord
A little more than fifty days later, on the day of Pentecost, the oneness in the Lord's aspiration was accomplished
If you never write checks, it will seem as if you do not have a checking account at all, or that your account has a zero balance
Your writing of checks is the practice of your realization that there is one billion dollars in your checking account
We have the oneness as a deposit in our account, but we may not write 'checks of oneness' because we may not remain in the spirit
We all need to realize and to learn that not to be one with the saints, not to have one accord with others in the church, is serious
To keep the oneness to apply the oneness to use the oneness to enjoy the oneness to spend the oneness we need to practice the one accord
During the past two and a half years, the teaching of the absolute autonomy of the local churches was promoted among us
To make all the children the same in the growth in life is not to practice oneness; it is to practice uniformity
When we practice the proper one accord, we must realize the attributes of the church as the unique Body of Christ
According to Ephesians 4:4-6, there is one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one God, one faith, one baptism, and one hope
In Matthew 18:19, before the Lord prayed for the oneness in John 17, He trained His disciples to practice the one accord
We may be bodily sitting together in the same room, but if we are not one in our spirit, it is certain that we will not be one in our soul
To make circumcision a requirement for salvation in the New Testament jeopardizes the redemptive work of Christ
The seven lampstands were identical to the point that if they were placed side-by-side before our eyes, we could not discern which is which
Today a certain kind of teaching is being promulgated among the churches encouraging the churches to be different from one another
These epistles were addressed by the Lord to the seven particular churches separately but they were sent not as seven books but as one book
In 1 Timothy 1:3 Paul said that he urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently
To teach differently is to teach things different from what the apostles teach that is to teach things other than Gods New Testament economy
The one solution made at Jerusalem for the problem of circumcision became a decree for all the churches, both Jewish and Gentile, to keep
The one solution regarding the problem of circumcision was good for all the churches, making all the churches the same
In 1 Thessalonians 2:14 Paul wrote, 'For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus'
The one epistle of 1 Corinthians was written to the saints in Corinth, with all the Lord's callers in every place
Today there are those who are promoting differences among the churches, but the Bible indicates that the churches should imitate one another
They should imitate what is better in any church, that they may have some improvement and some advancement in the interest of the Lord
In 1 Corinthians 1:11-13, saying 'I am of Christ' was condemned, just as saying 'I am of Paul,' 'I am of Apollos,' or 'I am of Cephas'
In Philippians 1:15 and 17, the Apostle Paul condemned those who preached Christ because of envy and strife, out of rivalry
Any difference among the saints or among the churches in the degree of maturity in life is normal and is needed according to God's economy
Any differences among the saints or among the churches that are intentional are abnormal and are condemned by the Scripture
Many things may be mistakes and may cause us trouble, yet we should not be bothered by them; they are tolerable and can be taken care of
On the other hand, by all these examples we can find a few things that the Spirit would not tolerate; they are intolerable
Concerning these things, there is the need to exercise to quarantine those who are responsible for the contagious situations
At that time Brother Nee's ministry was the highest in the entire world, but the situation was not very encouraging
In less than six years, from 1949 to 1954, our number increased from fewer than five hundred to about fifty thousand
The first test of the oneness of the Body and of the one accord in the church was the test of the problem of language
Even in the glorious condition of the church after the day of Pentecost, murmurings arose over the matter of eating
Such a big problem must be solved in this way: by the presenting of facts that are fully according to the New Testament teaching, the truth
The contention among Paul and Barnabas, with no way to resolve it, resulted in a separation between the two co-workers
Such a thing as is described in Romans 16:17-18 has never taken place in the recovery in as serious a way as today
In Acts 20 Paul did not tell the believers to turn away from such persons, but in Romans 16, Paul did say that we should turn away from them
In dealing with this case, the apostle as a begetting father admonished the Corinthians as his beloved children
The apostle told them that he would come to them with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness, depending on their preference
The removal of the sinful brother in 1 Corinthians 5 was like the putting of a leper outside the camp in the Old Testament
To excommunicate someone is to give him up; but to remove a person is to quarantine him with the hope that he would become sound
Once a sinning brother has repented, the church should immediately forgive him and show its confirmed love to him
In Corinth brother went to law with brother, and that before unbelievers, to be judged before the unrighteous, and not before the saints
Paul made a defense for himself with the signs of his apostleship, and he took a strong stand concerning all his rights as an apostle
Our being approved indicates that we are experienced and thus, that it is not easy for us to participate in any kind of party
Paul did not say that they would take revenge on persons, but that they would punish the disobedience of the disobedient ones
Taking this as a base Paul said ironically that since they bore well with those heretical preachers they should bear well with his boasting
Later, however, Peter still recommended Paul and confirmed his teachings as having the same standing as the rest of the Scriptures
Paul was faithful to the truth of the gospel and honest toward Peter for his correction, and Peter was humble in bearing Paul's rebuking
In his old age, Peter wrote a letter in which he recommended Paul highly and confirmed the standing of his writings among the Scriptures
The apostle instructed the believers, saying that the spiritual ones should restore such a one in a spirit of meekness
In carrying out such a restoration, we must do it in fear and with consideration, not in a light and careless way
Paul considered those Judaic preachers dogs, evil workers, and the concision, and warned the saints in Philippi to beware of them as such
On the one hand, Paul rejoiced over their preaching, and on the other hand, he considered them dogs, evil workers, and the concision
We should not condemn the preaching because of the evil preacher, nor should we accept the evil preacher because of his good preaching
The apostle warned the believers not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed and not to be deceived in any way
The apostle urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently
The apostle also gave the correcting word according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, with which he was entrusted
To take care of such a case, we should not merely correct, but should supply the proper teachings to replace the wrong teachings
The Apostle Paul was altogether not affected; rather, he encouraged Timothy to be empowered in the grace of the Lord
We should refuse such a one after a first and second admonition, knowing that such a one has been perverted and sins, being self-condemned
When a believer is divisive, factious, sectarian, he becomes contagious; therefore, we need to refuse him, that is, to quarantine him
Because they are willfully ignorant, the truth in the word of God spoken by the prophets in the Scriptures is covered from their sight
Peter reminded the believers to remember the word of God spoken by the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament apostles
The spirit in this case is not out of God but is of the antichrist; it is not the Spirit of truth but the spirit of deception
There is the need of our boldness and frankness to keep the divine truth concerning Christ's divine person in His divinity and humanity
If the Apostle John would have come to the church, he would have brought Diotrephes' works to the remembrance of the believers
The apostle did not indicate that Diotrephes' sin was intolerable to the extent that he needed to be quarantined
We should follow the positive example of the church in Ephesus by trying these false apostles and finding them to be false
The removing of the lampstand implies the losing of the power to shine in the darkness and to testify for the Lord
The church in Pergamos became worldly and was even settled in the world, where Satan's dwelling and throne are
These three always go together, one along with another, damaging the people of God in their carrying out of God's economy
They constituted a hierarchy that was versus the building up of the Body of Christ, like the hierarchy in Catholicism and Protestantism
Every item of the positive things inherited and received by the present Protestant churches remains in a dying situation
To take care of these cases would force us to be enriched in the vigorous divine life and to be empowered in the powerful Holy Spirit
Even we would reject such a church in the practice of the church life, not to mention that the Lord would vomit it out
The above items, XLI to LI, are all the negative items in which the seven local churches in Asia were different from one another
The seven churches as the seven golden lampstands were all identical in the positive things concerning the testimony of Christ
Divisions damage the Body of Christ, and heresies insult the person of Christ and also damage the work of Christ
Divisions are related negatively to the Body of Christ, and heresies are related negatively to Christ in His person and His work
Even with those involved in the three intolerable sins, we must be careful to deal with them in our spirit by the Spirit
There has been a change of emphasis to the building up of the work or the ministry more than the local churches
We have received our ministry from the Lord with a definite commission, that is, to build up the churches as the organic Body of Christ
In the Apostle Paul's ministry, such a coordination and oneness were rendered to him by the churches and the saints
The church in Philippi with all the saints there, and the church in Corinth and the churches in Galatia with the saints, all did this
To carry out the New Testament economy of God, the ministry, the churches, and the saints all must be one with one another
There has been a great effort and promotion to unite the saints and the churches around a certain leader and organization'
At the end of that training, the brothers wrote a letter which, with perhaps two or three exceptions, we all signed
There is no precedent of that in the Word; furthermore there is no scriptural basis for the contents of such a letter
Those things are not according to the teaching of the Word, and we regret very much that we subscribed to them
At any rate, to be one is better than to be divided, than not to be one; to be in one accord is better than to be in confusion, in discord
In the Lord's recovery there is no such practice of a 'centralization of the churches' and a 'centralization of the work'
Is there among us such 'a pervasive control exercised over the church,' that is, a control that pervades all the churches?
Not only John, but all the elders of all the churches who have listened to my tapes are in a position to know this pervasive control
John went further to say that this outside influence 'has made it very difficult to go on by getting our leading directly from the Lord'
The New Testament teaches us to be subject not only to the Lord but also to one another in the fear of the Lord
It is hardly possible for us to receive a leading directly from the Lord without taking care of the ones with whom we work and serve
On the other hand, when we take care of the co-working ones' realization, we should also seek the Lord's leading directly
Church history reveals that in the history of one denomination after another, not all started as a denomination
The intention of John and of those who are for him in trying to put my ministry aside is the real issue and factor of the division among us
John said that 'our going on or our relationship with the saints and with the church is made to depend on our relationship to him '
The taking of the ground of oneness should not be condemned as 'an improper attitude and application of the truth'
We say that we're speaking only of the system, not of the people, but our attitude has definitely spilled over to the people
Whether in a local church or among all the churches, we should be Body-conscious, taking care not only of the Head but also of His Body
We should seek to obey the Head with a relationship to the Body, and we should also seek to obey the Body with a relationship to the Head
To take care of obeying both the Lord and the elders or the apostles at the same time is not an easy thing for us
We may unconsciously feel that the teaching concerning the obeying of God's deputy authority is overly stressed or even unscriptural
In Numbers 6:6-7, the Nazarites were charged not to be contaminated by any kind of death, even by the death of their blood relatives
We need to remember that whatever we do and whatever we say will be judged by the Lord's coming back at His judgment seat
Even the Apostle Paul was greatly criticized; hence, we should not be disappointed if we are criticized, defamed, and slandered
