   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FIRST STEP IN PRESENTING OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FULL-GROWN IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Only after their hearts had been comforted could the Colossians receive the revelation concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because this matter is so important, this book emphasizes the heart instead of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We cannot present others full-grown in Christ unless their hearts have been comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If their hearts have not been cherished, they will not be able to receive anything we minister to them concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the first step in presenting others full-grown in Christ is to comfort their hearts unto all the riches of the full assurance of understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Especially the leading ones should look to the Lord for the grace to be able to comfort all the distracted, dissatisfied, and disappointed hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the hearts of the saints have been comforted, it will be easy for us to minister the riches of Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if the saints have problems in their hearts, they will have trouble with their minds.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The only way to solve the problems in the mind is for the hearts to be adjusted through the Lord s cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a crucial lesson for us all to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>PAUL S STRUGGLE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1:29 Paul said that he struggled according to Christ s operation within him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This struggle was his labor to present every man full-grown in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He endeavored to do this by announcing Christ, by warning every man, and by teaching every man in all wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>CHRIST S OPERATION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to 1:29, the operation of Christ operates in us in power.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is a difference between Christ operating in us and Christ s operation operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because Christ as the hope of glory operates in us, there is an operation which also operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ Himself operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But Christ operating in us causes an operation which also operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This operation operates in us in power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every saved person has at least some experience of Christ s operation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be saved is not merely to have our sins forgiven and to be justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is also to have Christ imparted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Christ who dwells in us also operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we have pointed out, His operating becomes the operation that operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul s struggling for the saints was according to this operation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some saints may feel that they sense very little of Christ s operation within them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The reason for this lack is the shortage of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to go to the Lord with a repentant heart and say, Lord, I am still so natural, so much in the self and in the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Lord, forgive me and cleanse me with Your precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Lord, I desire to be enlightened, purified, and made transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I ask You to show me what You want of me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Expose me so that I may be filled with You.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we pray in this way, Christ s operation will have a way to operate within us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I can testify that I am energized by Christ s operation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more I pray, the more His operation energizes me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, if I fail to pray, I would become cold and quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The reason you may sense little of Christ s operation within you is that you strive too much and pray too little to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By opening to the Lord in prayer, you give ground for Christ s operation to operate within you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then you will be able to struggle according to this operation to present others mature in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ s operation operates in power.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul refers to this power in Ephesians 3:7 and 20.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Ephesians 3:7 he speaks of the operation of His power, and in 3:20, of the power which operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This power is the power of resurrection life Phil 3:10 within the believers Eph 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is the very power that operated in Christ to raise Him from the dead, to seat Him at God s right hand in the heavenlies, and to subject all things under His feet Eph 1:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, this power is the resurrection power, the transcending power, and the subduing power.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to Christ s operation in such a power, we may struggle to present others full-grown in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What Paul did in struggling to present others full-grown in Christ is an example which serves for the perfecting of the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is to struggle according to the operation of Christ that operates in us, that is, to labor by the resurrecting, transcending, and subduing power within us.</S>
