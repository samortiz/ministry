This portion of the Bible, however, is not easy to understand. As we read this chapter, we need the proper exercise of our mind. Otherwise, we may be led into the woods and not find the right direction. As we approach this chapter, we need to be calm and very sober.</p><p>More than fifty years ago, I was taught by certain Bible teachers that, according to the New Testament, all believers, whether old or young, whether experienced or beginners, are priests. I was glad to hear a word concerning this universal priesthood. Although I tried my best to practice the priesthood, I did not have the way to do it. When I was studying the Pentateuch with the saints in Taiwan in 1953, I began to see how we can serve God as priests.</p><p>It is possible to read through the New Testament dozens of times without finding the way to serve as a priest. But we can find the way by studying the types in the Old Testament. We should never disregard the value of the Old Testament types. Certain types are just as valuable as the plain words uttered in the New Testament.</p><p>First Peter 2:5 says that we are a holy priesthood offering up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. In verse 9 of that chapter we are described as a royal priesthood. Furthermore, Revelation 1:6 and 5:10 both say that we are priests. We are a royal priesthood and a holy priesthood. We are priests, and we can serve God as priests. Thus, we are neither the clergy nor the laity, but a priesthood.</p><p>The clergy-laity system has its source in the Devil; it certainly is not according to the Bible. The Bible reveals that all believers are priests. But the clergy-laity system kills and nullifies the priesthood. It is our birthright to be priests serving God. But the traditional system of clergy and laity has taken away our birthright. For this reason, I say strongly that this system has its source in the Devil, not in the Bible.</p><p>Although the New Testament tells us that we are priests, it does not tell us how to be priests. From the New Testament we learn that we have been saved, washed with the blood of Christ, regenerated by the Spirit, and endowed with certain gifts. Thus, we know that we are saved, washed, regenerated, and gifted. But we still need further help to know how to serve God as priests. It was when I studied Old Testament typology again with the saints in 1953 that the light came from Exodus 29 to reveal the way to serve as a priest.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT ORDAINED OR CONSECRATED<br />BUT SANCTIFIED</h2><p>Exodus 29 speaks of sanctifying Aaron and his sons to be priests. Hence, it does not speak of sanctifying sinners, unbelievers, or the unsaved. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;And this is the thing which you shall do to them to sanctify them to serve as priests to Me.&rdquo; Please notice that this verse does not speak of consecrating Aaron and his sons or of ordaining them. As far as this chapter is concerned, we need to avoid the use of the word consecration and instead speak of sanctification.</p><p>The word &ldquo;consecrate&rdquo; is somewhat traditional. Under the influence of this word, we may have a mistaken concept concerning the sanctification of God&rsquo;s saved ones to be His priests. Therefore, I would emphasize the fact that here we have the charge not to consecrate Aaron and his sons, but to sanctify them. The proper word to use to describe what is recorded in this chapter is &ldquo;sanctify.&rdquo; Aaron and his sons were sanctified to be priests serving God.</p><p>There is a great difference between consecration and sanctification, and an even greater difference between sanctification and ordination. When a person is ordained, some of the clergy lay their hands upon him and pray for him. Consecration, according to common, ordinary usage, means the presenting of ourselves to God. But Exodus 29 describes neither ordination nor consecration; it is a record of sanctification.</p><p>Suppose instead of being sanctified according to what is described in chapter twenty-nine, Aaron were ordained in a traditional, religious way. In such a case, others would lay their hands on him and pray for him. Aaron, however, would still be empty-handed. Both before and after his ordination, he would be the same in that he would be empty-handed. In order for him to be God&rsquo;s priest and to serve Him as a priest, he must have something with which to serve God.</p><p>Suppose instead of being ordained Aaron were merely consecrated to the Lord, offered to Him and presented to Him. But even after being consecrated in this way, Aaron would still be empty and have nothing with which to serve God. The sanctification of Aaron and his sons to serve as priests is very different from both ordination and consecration.</p>
