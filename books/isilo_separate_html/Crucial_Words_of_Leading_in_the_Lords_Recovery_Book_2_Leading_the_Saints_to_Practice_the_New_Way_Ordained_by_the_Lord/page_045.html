OF THE LIFE-STUDY OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Today the truth is among us, and we need to endeavor to enter into it. We have several meetings a week, which we should use to learn the truth, exercise in the truth, and enter into the truth. Everything in our Christian life depends upon the truth; hence, our goal should be to learn the truth. Beginning in 1974, I felt that my work in the United States should not focus on traveling to visit the saints and the churches as I had done for the previous ten years. Although this kind of visitation was able to bring people into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and gradually raise up churches in various places, I realized that the supply of the truth would be inadequate if I continued my work in this way. Hence, I made a firm decision to spend time to carry out a life-study of the entire Bible. The purpose of this kind of Bible study is to release messages based on the entire New Testament and according to the truth contained therein, not to release messages randomly according to an instant feeling or inspiration. As a result, we began the life-study trainings in the United States. Through the publication of the Life-study messages, several hundred churches have been raised up all over the earth. These few hundred churches are mainly the result of the Life-studies.</p>
<p>Sadly, few of the elders and co-workers in the churches in Taiwan know how to use the Life-studies. This is not to say that they do not use them but that they do not know how to use them. Using the Life-studies is not simple. When we do something, it makes a difference how we do it. It is one thing to do something in a matter of fact way, it is another thing to do something with our whole effort, and it is yet another thing to give our life for it. The outcome will naturally be different, depending on the way a matter is carried out. The more effort there is, the better the outcome will be. It is not that the churches in Taiwan do not use the Life-studies but that the elders and co-workers do not feel that it matters whether they use them. The leading co-workers have not entered into the Life-studies aggressively. The Life-study messages that were released, especially in the final stage, have focused on God&rsquo;s economy; nevertheless, I am concerned that the co-workers in Taiwan may have not entered into God&rsquo;s economy and may even have only a limited understanding concerning God&rsquo;s dispensing. Entering into the truth is a matter of degree. We have spent months and years leading the churches, but several decades have passed, and the churches remain more or less the same, without much progress or riches. Nevertheless, to the degree that the brothers have applied these spiritual riches in their leading of the churches, there are some visible results today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO BE CONSTITUTED WITH THE HIGH TRUTHS</h2>
<p>In 1961 I went to America, and as a result that year became a point of demarcation in my work. The following year I began my work in America. Prior to 1961, every time I returned to Taipei from abroad, I was afraid to go to the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting because everything was old. The hymns were old, and the prayers were old. However, during the few recent times I have come back to Taipei, I found that the singing at the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting has improved. The saints have learned to sing: &ldquo;In the bosom of the Father, / Ere the ages had begun, / Thou wast in the Father&rsquo;s glory, / God&rsquo;s unique begotten Son,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Once Thou wast the only grain, Lord, / Falling to the earth to die&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #203, stanzas 1 and 3). At the same time, I noticed that some older sisters, who are not highly educated, still knew to pray: &ldquo;O Lord, You are the only grain that fell to the ground and died to produce us as many grains. Thank You for dispensing Your life into us.&rdquo; The old hymns used in the remembrance of the Lord were gone. Thus, we can say that we have entered into a new age.</p>
<p>From our youth we have been taught that there is a big category in our hymnal for the breaking of bread. Those hymns are related to our attendance of the Lord&rsquo;s table, and we cannot say that they are not good. However, if we continue to sing the hymns belonging to that category, we will stay forever at that level. Now when we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table, we sing concerning the Lord being the only grain that died and brought us forth as the many grains and blended us together in spirit to make us the one Body. This is much higher. The Lord&rsquo;s table meetings in Taipei have been uplifted so that nearly all the old hymns are no longer used. For instance, <em>Hymns,</em> #806, &ldquo;Break Thou the Bread of Life, / Dear Lord, to me,&rdquo; is a good hymn, but its level is not high enough. This requires our learning.</p>
<p>In one of our meetings, a brother without a high level of education called <em>Hymns,</em> #152; this surprised me greatly, because this hymn speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s love on a high level. It not only speaks of how the Lord was crucified for our redemption, but concerning His love it says, &ldquo;It has caused Thee death to suffer / And to me Thyself impart&rdquo; (stanza 1). This is on a high level. Singing these kinds of hymns and being on this kind of level spontaneously affect our living. I have seen that some of the elderly brothers and sisters are very much influenced and uplifted in their living. These are examples related to leading the church. When there is the proper leading, the church will spontaneously advance. The evaluation that I am giving should also be a leading to us. With this kind of leading, we will know how to advance.</p>
<p>We need to lead the saints to have a foundation in the truth, the Lord&rsquo;s Word, and to enter into the experiences of life. Over a long period of time, these will become a deposit within us. Then when we come to the meetings, whether a group meeting, home meeting, or district meeting, our tongue will be the pen of a ready writer, because of our inward constitution; this is not merely a kind of composition but a constitution. If we are under the influence of such an atmosphere for a period of three years, the element of this atmosphere will be all the more constituted into us.</p>
<p>If a person stays for three hours in a house filled with the smell of garlic, when he walks out of the house, he will smell of garlic because garlic will have become his constitution. Likewise, if we sit in a seafood restaurant eating seafood for two hours, we will smell like seafood when we walk out. If on the contrary, we have been meeting for three years, attending three or four meetings per week, but are not constituted with anything, this indicates that our meetings are plain and flavorless. They do not carry a strong flavor like that of garlic or seafood; rather, our meetings are just like plain water. If, after meeting for three years, we do not have any special flavor, it would be like drinking plain boiled water for three years. The result depends upon the leading brothers motivating the saints. The way has been set, and the goal, the focus, and the path are clear. If we do not advance, I do not know how we can give an account to the Lord.</p>
<p>Today the riches of the truth are before us, and everyone has the opportunity to pursue them; moreover, the truth is not too mysterious for us to enter into. When a person is newly saved, he may feel that he does not fit in, but after pursuing for two years, he should begin to enter into the truth. Due to their intense pursuing, within a year some brothers may gain significant familiarity with the truth. Some brothers and sisters, who have come into the church life for only a short period of time, come to the prayer meeting, burning within and desiring to pray something to the Lord; nevertheless, they are not able to pray, so they try to recite a few sentences. Sometimes, however, they are not able to recite anything but still try to pray. In this regard, there is nothing to be embarrassed about. If all of us would go on in such a way, the practice of everyone speaking in the church meetings will succeed. I encourage all of us to try our best to promote this matter so that everyone will exert much effort in studying the Recovery Version and the Life-studies. In this way, after a few months or even a few years, we will have a significant constitution of the truth.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> </body></html>
