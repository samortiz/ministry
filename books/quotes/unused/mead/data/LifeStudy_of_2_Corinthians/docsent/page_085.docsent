   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FULL OF LIFE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Whenever the Spirit is expressed as life, there will be righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When there is righteousness, everything will be calm, peaceful, and orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you experience this in your family life, your children will be calmed down, and your husband or wife will be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such a life always calms down turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When others receive this life from you, they also will enjoy a peaceful state.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church life is a life of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the church life everything should be calm, peaceful, and orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be sure, the millennium, the thousand-year kingdom, will be filled with righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because there will be righteousness in the kingdom, there will also be peace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The kingdom is simply a realm of righteousness with peace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This righteousness is the result of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the Bible, in the millennium death will be greatly reduced and restricted Isa 65:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There will be abundance of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a result, the environment in the millennium will be peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible uses the term righteousness to denote this peaceful state and condition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the millennium, there will be the new heavens and the new earth with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Jerusalem, there will be no death, and life will flow to maintain a peaceful condition Rev 21:4; 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This will be an eternal righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we all shall live out the divine life in a state of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church life today should be a miniature of this kind of condition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The same should be true of our family life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By the Lord s mercy and grace, our church life and family life should be full of life and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A living that is full of life and righteousness is a confirmation of the new covenant ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to Paul s word in 2 Corinthians 3, the new covenant ministry is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This ministry supplies Christ as the Spirit and as righteousness to others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 2 Corinthians 4, Paul presents the experience of the Spirit and of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we experience the Spirit, life is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When life is manifested, we are brought into a condition of peace, where nothing is wrong or out of order.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is righteousness, a state where everything is living, right, and orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the sight of God, this is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The apostles experienced the Spirit, manifested life, and lived in a condition of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once again we see that their living and their ministry were one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>BEING CONSUMED</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have seen that renewing in chapter four corresponds to transformation in chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 4:16 Paul says, Wherefore we do not lose heart, but if indeed our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is being renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The rendering our outward man is decaying is a correct translation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, many of us would prefer to say that our outward man is being consumed, wasted away, worn out.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The difference is that is decaying is active, whereas being consumed is passive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may use the falling of leaves from a tree as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the autumn, many trees lose their leaves, and during the winter these trees are dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the one hand, the falling of the leaves from a tree is an active matter, but in another sense, it is passive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is active in the sense that the trees drop their leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No outside force causes the leaves to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is the tree itself that drops its leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may say that when a tree drops its leaves, the tree is decaying.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is active.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But in another sense, the trees are forced to drop their leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a tree could speak, it might say, Help me!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I don t want to lose my leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I would like the season to change from autumn directly to spring.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then my leaves will not be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A tree s losing of its leaves may also be regarded as passive.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul s word, our outward man is decaying, is active.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But it can also be understood as if it were in the passive voice.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, we can speak of our outward man being consumed or being wasted away.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let us now apply this understanding to our daily experience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Suppose a brother is afflicted on every side.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Surely one who is afflicted, attacked, in this way would be worn out, consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you were the one suffering such affliction, would you not cry out and say, Please rescue me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am being consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All of you are wearing me out and wasting me away.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I am being consumed by you all.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Nevertheless, this brother, along with all of us, needs to realize that just as a tree is destined to lose its leaves, so our destiny is for the outward man to be consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The One who created the trees destined that many kinds of trees would drop their leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As Christian trees, we also have been destined to drop our leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Because our destiny is to drop our leaves, eventually something or someone will compel us to drop them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God never intended that our outward man would survive such a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Rather, He has determined that our old man, our outward man, will decay, will be consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The destiny, therefore, for our outward man is to die.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You may live to be very old, but eventually your outward man will die.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is not God s intention to prolong the life of your outward man.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, do not cry out for help to preserve your outward man, and do not ask to be rescued from those things or persons who are consuming you.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Instead, you should say, Lord, I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All these persons and things are helping me to drop my leaves earlier and faster.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Lord, I want to cooperate.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I want to let go of my leaves quicker, for then I shall mature earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Lord, I praise You for this help!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord uses our married life to consume our outward man.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Before a young brother gets married, he may dream about the kind of sister he will marry.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then he will look for the sister who will be the fulfillment of his dream.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Likewise, the young sisters are looking for a hero to be their husband.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>All young people have a dream regarding their future married life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Some may travel from one local church to another hoping to find the brother or sister of their choice.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But, young people, no matter how clever you are, you cannot defeat God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He has already determined your destiny regarding married life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There is no need for you to expend so much energy searching for the wife or husband of your dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Instead, you should simply pray, Lord, You have already determined my destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I don t need to travel from place to place, looking for a spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I would rather be today s Isaac, waiting for You to send me the one You have destined for me.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>However, it is doubtful that very many young people will follow this way or take this word.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But I am certain that after some years of married life, they will worship the Lord and say, Lord, You are sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It has not been a matter of my choice, but of Your destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Brothers, I assure you that the Lord will give you the wife most suitable to bring you affliction and even attack you so that your outward man may be consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Every wife knows the best time to attack her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This certainly is sovereign of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Sometimes when you make a mistake, your wife will be very kind to you and tell you not to be concerned about it.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>But when you are not mistaken, she may attack you strongly for no reason.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Actually, there is a reason: God in His sovereignty allows her to do so in order that you, as a tree, may drop your leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>On the one hand, a tree drops its leaves on its own; on the other hand, the season and the environment force a tree to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>When autumn comes, a tree must drop its leaves, no matter how green and flourishing it has been during the summer.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>In like manner, when the autumn and winter seasons come in the Christian life, we may be afflicted by the members of our family.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>During a time of severe cold, we shall be forced to drop our leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This means that, on the one hand, our outward man is decaying and that, on the other hand, it is being consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>When we experience the decaying of our outward man, we may tell the Lord that we are not able to take it any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The Lord, however, may indicate that we shall take it much longer, for our destiny is to have the outward man consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is my understanding of this matter according to my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>THE RENEWING OF THE INWARD MAN</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Also from experience I can testify that something issues from this decaying, this consuming the renewing of the inward man.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Yes, our outward man is decaying, but our inward man is being renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If we had a choice, we would of course choose the renewing and avoid the decaying.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>But if we could avoid the decaying of the outward man, there would not be any renewing of the inward man.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We all would prefer to be like evergreen trees.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>In a sense, when springtime comes, an evergreen tree is not very fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>But those trees who drop their leaves and are dormant during the winter are fresh when spring arrives.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>In the same principle, when we experience the decaying of the outward man, we enjoy the renewing of the inward man.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul speaks of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>In the process of transformation a divine element is added into our being, and we are constituted of this element.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>This constitution produces transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>As we have seen, in 2 Corinthians 4, transformation becomes renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>This renewing does not merely involve the addition of the divine element into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Our old nature, the outward man, is actually taken away so that the life within us, that is, the Spirit of life, may have the opportunity to develop.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>This development of the life within is the renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Once again we may use trees as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>During the winter they are dormant, but in the springtime we can see the development of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>This is not only transformation; it is renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Transformation is a matter of constitution; renewing involves replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>To be renewed means that the outward man is being consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>As a tree drops its leaves, so the old element of the outward man decays.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>The result is that the inner life develops in a fresh way.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>When spring arrives, the tree becomes lively, fresh, and vigorous.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>New leaves come out, and eventually the tree blossoms and brings forth fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>This is a picture of the renewing of our inward man.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>By the experience of this renewing, we go on from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>The glory is uplifted from one level to another, from the present glory to the eternal glory.</S>
