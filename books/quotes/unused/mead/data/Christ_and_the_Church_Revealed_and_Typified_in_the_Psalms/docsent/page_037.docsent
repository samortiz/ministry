   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE ENJOYMENT OF THE HOUSE AND THE CITY OF GOD THROUGH CHRIST Psalms 49 to 67 Scripture Reading: Psa 50:2; 51:18-19; 52:8; 53:6a; 55:14; 61:4; 63:1-2; 65:1, 4; 66:13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Book I of the Psalms Christ is emphasized and the house of God is then sweetly presented.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many dear Christians who love the Psalms have failed to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A few have seen Christ, but hardly one has really seen the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Book I of the Psalms has both Christ Himself and the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Book II presents Christ and the house again, but it brings us on in a marvelous way to see the strengthened, enlarged, and built-up house, the city.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Psalms 46, 47 and 48, we are brought to the climax of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These Psalms describe the city to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Following these three Psalms, we still have many wonderful and precious verses concerning the house and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such verses as these are not found in the first book and especially not before Psalm 22.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>MORE CONCERNING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Psalms 49 through 67 tell us how the saints enjoy the house and the city of God through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Firstly we must indicate the various verses in this section which speak further concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1 He suffered the plot of men Psa 56:6, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Luke 11:54; John 11:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2 He was betrayed by His friend Psa 55:13, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matt 26:50 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>3 He was falsely accused by the people Psa 55:3, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Matt 26:59-68; John 18:30; 19:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>4 He was assailed by the assembly of the adversaries Psa 62:3-4, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Matt 26:3-4, 57, 59 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE SAINTS' ENJOYMENT OF THE HOUSE AND THE CITY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Secondly, we come to the saints' enjoyment of the house and the city of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to spend some time to consider these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Firstly we see that the church, the dwelling place of God, is the perfection of beauty out of which God shines.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined" Psa 50:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Zion in typology is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It does not say that the church is the perfect beauty, but the perfection of beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the eyes of God the most beautiful object in the entire universe is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the first day of God's recovery of creation, as recorded in Genesis 1, God only said, "It is good."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the second day God made the firmament, which divided the waters above from the waters beneath.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, on that day God did not say, "It is good," because in the waters beneath there were the demons, and in the air above there was the subtle one, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even though the firmament was good, God would not say that the work of that day was good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But on the third, fourth, and fifth days, God continually said, "It is good."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then on the sixth day, when man was created, God said, "It is exceedingly good."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In God's eyes, nothing in all His creation is so beautiful as man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But today, in all God's creation plus His redemption, nothing is so beautiful as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church is the perfection of beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Have you ever looked at the New Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Oh, the New Jerusalem!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Look at it!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Is that not the perfection of beauty?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Is there anything in the universe more beautiful than the New Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The entire city is of gold, transparent gold, with nothing opaque.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are twelve gates, and each gate is one tremendous pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The foundation is made of precious stones, layer upon layer, and the wall is also built up of gems.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God is within the city as the shining light, and the entire city radiates the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Could anything be more beautiful than this?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is the perfection of beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One day, when we are all there in the New Jerusalem, we will exclaim, "O Lord, now we are really in the perfection of beauty!"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not only beautiful; it is the perfection of beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nothing could be more perfect; nothing could be more beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the church!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>While we are still in this old age, while we are still on this old earth, in my realization, the church is even now the perfection of beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You may say that it is not so perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In a sense, it is not, but in another sense, I would ask if you can find anything better.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Never!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I have passed through all kinds of human societies: I have been with the poor; I have been with the rich; I have been with the low-class as well as the high-class; I have been with the educated and with the uneducated.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>According to my experience, I must testify that in my entire life on this earth I have never found anything better than the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To me this is the perfection of beauty, out from which God shines.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Praise the Lord!</S>
