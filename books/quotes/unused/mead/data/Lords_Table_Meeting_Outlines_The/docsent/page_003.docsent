   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There are two major aspects of the Lord's table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eating the Lord's supper is for the remembrance of the Lord 1 Cor 11:24-25.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This could be called the vertical aspect of the Lord's table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is a remembrance of the Lord's person, not His work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our prayer and praise rendered to the Lord should be concerning the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Corinthians 11:24 speaks of breaking the bread "unto the remembrance of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We come to the Lord's table not to remember the Lord's death, But rather Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Corinthians 11:25 speaks of drinking the cup "unto the remembrance of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We come to the Lord's table not to remember the Lord's work, But rather Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To attend the Lord's table meeting and automatically eat the Lord's supper in remembrance of the Lord's death is a natural concept; to remember Christ Himself, we need a vision regarding His person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should remember the person much more than the work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By eating the Lord's bread and drinking the Lord's cup, we eat the Lord's supper in remembrance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Attending the Lord's table is for us to have the fellowship with all the members of the Body of Christ 1 Cor 10:16-17.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This could be called the horizontal aspect of the Lord's table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have this fellowship because of the Lord's body, which He gave for us on the cross and the Lord's blood which He shed for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The cup, which we enjoy together and which symbolizes the blood of Christ, removes all barriers between the saints; the bread, which we partake of together and which symbolizes the individual body of Christ, comes into us to make us one bread, signifying the corporate Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our eating and partaking of one bread and drinking and sharing one cup imply mutual fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such a fellowship becomes the fellowship of the blood of Christ and the fellowship of the body of Christ 1 Cor 10:16.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1 Corinthians 10:16-17 and 21, both the vertical and horizontal aspects of the Lord's table are seen the fellowship with Christ and the fellowship with the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we eat and drink together, sharing in the Lord's bread and the Lord's cup, "we partake of the table of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must partake of the Lord's table with other saints; otherwise, we would only have the vertical aspect.</S>
