   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Marriage Supper of the Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Having considered the organic unity of believers as indicated by the figure of the "Body of Christ," let us now consider their unity from the standpoint of love and devotedness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In connection with this subject another figure is employed by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We find its most complete mention in Revelation 19:7 and 21:9-27.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In these passages, the figure of a marriage ceremony is used, to convey most precious truths concerning the relation of the regenerated ones to the Lord and also to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A marriage, in its true sense, implies the union of two beings upon the same plane of life, whose hearts are indissolubly linked in the bonds of undying love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This marriage is between Christ, the Lamb, and glorified believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The words, "His wife hath made herself ready," seem to imply that the marriage ceremony depends upon her preparedness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Alas, that the Lamb has been kept waiting so long for His Bride to make herself ready!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some of those constituting this Composite Bride will make ready only when the Tribulation period destroys their earthly perspective.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We read in Revelation 7:9 that during the short but dreadful Tribulation period, "a great multitude which no man could number," but whose names were written in the book of the Life of the Lamb from the foundation of the world, suddenly perceive God's glorious Plan of Redemption in its full-robed splendor and quickly appropriate all that they behold, and are taken out of the more terrible tribulation woes, and stand before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes and palms the symbol of victory in their hands, and they join in the song of the redeemed who have preceded them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nowhere in the whole Bible is the tender, unutterable Love of God more blessedly shown than in this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Read it carefully, and note every word that is used in reference to this great company of tribulation overcomers; for perhaps some for whom we are now praying will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Says Mr. Mead in his most helpful exposition of the Apocalypse,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is significant that this most glorious event the Marriage Supper of the Lamb is placed by the inspiring Spirit of truth just here in chapter 19 , and not in chapter 4 or 5; for there is where it would seem necessary to assign it a place if they are right who hold that the Church of God, the Bride of Christ, is wholly removed, once and for all, from the world before the time spoken of in the vision of chapter 4.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By these it is affirmed that the saints and martyrs made during the Tribulation are not members of the Body of Christ, that they belong to another order of redeemed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not only do we find nothing in the whole Word of God to favor of this view, but many things have been pointed out in the course of this study which indicate that all those who are saved during the entire Tribulation period are also "fellow members of the Body," which is the Church of Christ, the "Church of the Firstborn."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And now, as a further and most conclusive witness to the same, is the passage we are now considering; for it is not till the last saint shall have been caught up in the rapture of the gleaning time, that the Announcement is made that "His wife hath made herself ready."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The teacher should deal as simply and logically with the subject of "the Bride of Christ" as has already been done with the subject of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"The Body speaks of oneness in life and nature; the Bride, of union in mutual love and devotion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no contradiction whatever" Max I. Reich . How a Believer Becomes a Member of the Bride</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have already seen that one becomes a member of the Body of Christ the instant he accepts the Life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He enters into that deep, loving heart union with Him which indicates the attitude of the Bride, when he says the "irrevocable, inclusive yes" to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Love is more than emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The test of love is not what one feels, but what he will do for another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, before the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, each human being who is organically one with Him will have become one with Him in love and devotion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, each saint will be glorified before the marriage takes place; i.e., the created human personality of each will have been filled with the Uncreated Life of God; even the earthy bodies will have partaken of Immortality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Note that the individual personality is not destroyed, but emptied of sin and filled with Eternal Life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The "Supper" indicates the rejoicing over the realization of this long looked for, ardently desired consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Words fail to describe the beauty of this Bride of the Lamb as she stands by His side radiant with the "glory of God."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And He shall lead His Bride, His Joy and Care,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With blissful singing to His Father's throne.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With eyes undimmed shall she her God behold,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Behold Him face to face, and walk by sight,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not trusting only, as in days of old,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But seeing with her eyes Eternal Light.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The great Salvation mystery shall unfold</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In that high vision of Love infinite.</S>
