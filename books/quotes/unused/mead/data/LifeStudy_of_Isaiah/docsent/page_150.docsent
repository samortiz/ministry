   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE CHRIST AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH 10 THE MINISTRY OF THE ANOINTED OF JEHOVAH,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ISSUING IN THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL Scripture Reading: Isa 61 63; Rev 14:17-20; 19:11-16, 19-21</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Isaiah 61 through 63 reveals that the ministry of the Anointed of Jehovah, Christ as the Servant of Jehovah, issues in the restoration of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we will consider these three chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. THE MINISTRY OF THE ANOINTED OF JEHOVAH,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>CHRIST AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ is the Anointed of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is the equivalent of the Hebrew word Messiah, which means "the anointed."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our Christ today is the anointed One and also the anointing One who anoints us with Himself as the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, He was anointed by God and with God, and then through His death and resurrection He became the ointment for the anointing of others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His ministry to us is thus a ministry of anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, the ministry of Christ, the Anointed of Jehovah, will issue in the restoration of Israel, His elect people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The history of Israel is mainly a history of tragedy, although there were times of glory, such as the building of the temple under Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The temple was destroyed by the Babylonians, and the vessels for the service of God in the temple were carried away to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From that time until the present, Israel has not been fully a free nation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, Israel still needs restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ's coming is of two parts and at two times.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In His first coming, Christ came to minister, to dispense, Himself into His followers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way He carried out the New Testament ministry to dispense the Triune God into the disciples under His ministry, most of whom were Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This ministry in Christ's first coming laid a solid foundation for His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He comes the second time, He will come mainly in an outward way to rescue Israel from their circumstances and to bring in their restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This restoration will be expanded to include all things created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This period of restoration will last for a millennium, for the thousand-year kingdom.</S>
