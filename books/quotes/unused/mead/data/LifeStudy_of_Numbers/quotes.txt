[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: Num 1:1-4, 42-46; 10:33-36
[2]  In this introductory word to the Life-study of Numbers, we will consider the advancement of the divine revelation, a comparison of Numbers and Leviticus, the general sketch of Numbers, the central thought of Numbers, and the sections of Numbers.
[3]  Always the children of Israel were going on from place to place to gain ground that God might have a people to be built up for His kingdom and His house.
[4]  In a general way, we may say that the central thought of the entire Bible is Christ, for the Bible is focused on Christ as the center.
[5]  The central thought of Numbers is that Christ is the meaning of life, the testimony, the center of God's people, and the Leader, the way, and the goal of their journey and fighting.
[6]  This shows us that as the church today we should take Christ as our meaning of life, our testimony, and our center.
[7]  If Christ were not all this to us, there would not be a way for God to gain the ground on earth to build up His kingdom with His house, which eventually will consummate in the New Jerusalem.
[8]  The entire Bible shows us one thing that God's intention is to have a people formed into an army to take Christ as their meaning of life, testimony, center, Leader, way, and goal and to proceed on and fight for God that He may gain the ground on earth and have a people built up as His kingdom and His house, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.
[9]  The book of Numbers has three sections: being formed into an army 1:1 9:14 , journeying 9:15 20:29; 21:4-20; 33:1-49 , and fighting 21:1-3; 21:21 32:42; 33:50 36:13 .
[10]  The picture portrayed in Numbers chapter one shows us the entire New Testament, from the incarnation of the Triune God to be a man, living and dwelling among men, to the consummation of the incarnation, the New Jerusalem.
[11]  To see the incarnation of the Triune God in Numbers 1 is difficult, because we do not have such a concept.
[12]  If we would see the incarnation of the Triune God in this chapter, we need to consider the matter of the tabernacle with the ark.
[13]  The law is a testimony of God because it testifies, shows us, God.
[14]  The formation of the children of Israel into a body to fight for God and to serve God typifies the New Testament believers being built up into the organic Body of Christ to fight for God for the carrying out, in its service to God, of God's eternal economy.
[15]  Nevertheless, Paul told the Corinthian believers that they might have had "ten thousand guides in Christ, yet not many fathers," for in Christ Jesus he had begotten them through the gospel 1 Cor 4:15 , imparting the divine life into them so that they became children of God and members of Christ.
[16]  The numbering of Israel was recognized by the authorities in three aspects: first, by Moses, signifying Christ as the Head exercising His authority; second, by Aaron, signifying Christ as the High Priest carrying out His priesthood; and third, by the leaders of the twelve tribes, signifying the elders of the churches taking the lead among God's people.
[17]  In this message we will consider the matter of the children of Israel encamping in array.
[18]  The more we consider the picture of the children of Israel encamping in array around the tabernacle, the more we must adore God for His plan, His sovereignty, and His creating ability.
[19]  In this message we will begin to consider the holy service, which is covered in chapters three and four of Numbers.
[20]  The altar refers to Christ's redemption, and the tabernacle refers to Christ as the embodiment of God, through whom God dwells among men and through whom men can enter into God to enjoy all that He is.
[21]  Numbers 3 has much to say about the persons and their duties.
[22]  In presenting Christ as the ark, the embodiment of God, we may further tell the ones we visit that in the typology of the Old Testament, God met with His people not at the altar or at the showbread table or at the lampstand or at the incense altar but on the cover of the ark.
[23]  In this message we will consider the duties of the priests and the Levites in the tabernacle's setting out.
[24]  Thus, what is covered in the holy service is not for a Christ who is inactive but for a Christ who is very active.
[25]  In order for God's people to be formed into an army, certain terms, or conditions, must be met.
[26]  First, God's people are His dwelling place and habitation v. 3 ; second, God's people are His warriors fighting for Him 1:20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42 ; and third, those who are formed into an army are also priests to serve God 3:3 . For God to have a dwelling place, an army, and a priesthood, His people must deal with defilement.
[27]  After the corporate dealing with defilement, there is the individual dealing 5:5-10 .
[28]  In the individual dealing, we must first deal with the guilt of our sinning against God v. 6 . This is to deal with the defilement of unrighteousness, of being guilty before man and condemned before God.
[29]  of the Wronged One or to God for the Priest
[30]  In this message we will continue to consider the dealing with defilement described in chapter five of Numbers.
[31]  This case reveals that God is not only sovereign over each of His children but also that He may even do something miraculous in dealing with a particular kind of defilement.
[32]  The typology in the Bible is a great thing and has many aspects.
[33]  Probably, in the Old Testament the divine revelation conveyed through typology may equal that in plain words.
[34]  The people gained by God to be formed into an army that can fight for Him and a priesthood that can serve Him should be altogether clean in their being, nature, speaking, appearance, behavior, the way they move and act, and even in what they possess.
[35]  We may not be rebellious leprous , we may be quite self-controlled and restrained not discharging , and our behavior may be altogether right with both God and man, but as a wife to Christ, are we chaste?
[36]  "The man shall bring his wife to the priest, and bring her offering for her, a tenth of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it and put no frankincense on it, for it is a meal offering of jealousy, a meal offering of remembrance, bringing iniquity to remembrance" v. 15 . The priest was then to place this meal offering of jealousy into the hands of the woman v. 18 . The meal offering signifies Christ in His humanity offered to God that God's people may be acceptable.
[37]  I really admire the sequence of the arrangement of the chapters in the book of Numbers.
[38]  Chapters one through four record the formation of the divine army, which fights for God and serves God.
[39]  In this message we will continue to consider the matter of being sanctified to be a Nazarite covered in chapter six of Numbers.
[40]  A Nazarite is a superior person, one who is absolutely, utterly, and ultimately for God.
[41]  This means that when we offer the burnt offering to God, laying our hands on the offering and making ourselves one with the offering, we promise God that from that time we will be just like this offering, living a life absolutely for God in the seven days of the vow of the Nazarite.
[42]  While we are offering ourselves to God to live absolutely, utterly, and ultimately for Him, we realize that we are still sinful.
[43]  We and God enjoy Christ as the burnt offering and as the sin offering, and this issues in the enjoyment of Christ as the peace offering.
[44]  For Christ to be our peace offering means that we and God mutually enjoy Christ and have fellowship in Christ.
[45]  Finally, the Nazarite was to bring "a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal offering and their drink offerings" v. 15 . In this verse, "a basket" signifies fullness, "unleavened" signifies without sin, "bread" signifies formed, "cakes" signifies more formed, "fine" signifies even and balanced, "flour" signifies Christ ground in His humanity, "mixed" signifies mingled, "with oil" signifies the Holy Spirit divinity , "wafers" signifies easy to eat, "anointed" signifies poured upon, "meal offering" signifies holy food, and "drink offerings" signifies holy drinks for God.
[46]  All this typifies Christ in His humanity with His divinity offered to God for us as food both to God and to us and also as holy drinks to God.
[47]  LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE ELEVEN BEING FORMED INTO AN ARMY 10 Scripture Reading: Num 6:22-27; 2 Cor 13:14
[48]  In this message we come to a wonderful section of the book of Numbers 6:22-27.
[49]  These verses cover the matter of being blessed by God in His divine trinity.
[50]  The traditional and even the basic theology concerning God's divine trinity does not have the view that the divine Trinity is for God to dispense Himself into us.
[51]  This light has come to us only in the last thirty years.
[52]  Ephesians chapter one gives us a record of how the Triune God blesses His chosen, redeemed, and transformed people in His divine trinity.
[53]  The church as the Body of Christ is the total issue of the divine Trinity as a flow to dispense all that God is into His chosen people.
[54]  Jesus came as the face of God, and the Holy Spirit comes as the countenance of God.
[55]  The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as life to us for our enjoyment, the love of God is God Himself as the source of the grace of the Lord, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God for our participation.
[56]  In this message we come to a new section of Numbers, chapter seven.
[57]  After the dealing with defilement, the testing of suspicion, the vow of the Nazarite, and the blessing of the Triune God, the situation between God and Israel came to a new stage.
[58]  Numbers 7:1 speaks of "the day when Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed and sanctified it, and all its furnishings and the altar with all its utensils."
[59]  In offering these for the service of God, they cooperated with God in His services by offering the silver and gold vessels with the incense, signifying Christ in His redemption and His divine nature as a fragrant satisfaction to God.
[60]  When we have the proper worship of God, God is satisfied by the burnt offerings, sin offerings, and peace offerings.
[61]  "When Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with Him, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the propitiatory cover that was upon the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim; and he spoke to Him" v. 89 . At the propitiatory cover upon the ark of the testimony, there was a conversation between man and God.
[62]  LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE THIRTEEN BEING FORMED INTO AN ARMY 12 Scripture Reading: Num 8
[63]  In this message on chapter eight of Numbers, we will briefly consider two matters lighting the lamps vv.
[64]  After the Levites were cleansed, they were presented to God.
[65]  "You shall present the Levites before Aaron and before his sons, and shall offer them as a wave offering to Jehovah" v. 13 . Aaron first offered the Levites to God as a wave offering before redemption v. 11 . Afterwards, Moses offered the sin offering and the burnt offering to make propitiation for the Levites.
[66]  "I have given the Levites as ones given to Aaron and his sons from among the sons of Israel, to do the service of the sons of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make propitiation for the sons of Israel, that there may be no plague among the sons of Israel when the sons of Israel approach the sanctuary" v. 19 . Here we see that God gave the Levites to Aaron, the head priest, and to his sons, the priests, to do the service in the tent of meeting and to make propitiation for the sons of Israel.
[67]  C. The Age for the Service of the Levites
[68]  Verses 23 through 26 speak of the age for the service of the Levites.
[69]  LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE FOURTEEN BEING FORMED INTO AN ARMY 13 Scripture Reading: Num 7:1, 87-88; 8:12; 6:14-17
[70]  In this message I would like to give a word concerning the divine provisions revealed in chapters six through nine.
[71]  By the time of Numbers 7, the tabernacle and the altar had been built up by God through His people and belonged to God.
[72]  The completed, or consummated, God is symbolized by the ointment, which was compounded with four spices and olive oil Exo 30:22-25 .
[73]  In His New Testament economy, God does not want us merely to be good men He wants us to be God-men, those who are mingled with the processed Triune God.
[74]  The more the ointment, the completed Triune God, is applied to us, the more we become God-men.
[75]  The more we are painted by Him and with Him, the more we are mingled with Him to become God-men.
[76]  Although God has prepared this provision for us, we may not come to Him, or we may come to Him without offering ourselves to Him and submitting ourselves to Him.
[77]  Along with the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering, we have a basket of bread, cakes, wafers, and the drink offering.
[78]  As the real drink offering, Christ has been poured out to satisfy God and also to satisfy us.
[79]  In this message we will consider 9:1-14, a record concerning the keeping of the Passover.
[80]  Numbers 1 8 are the words spoken by God to Moses on the first day of the second month in the second year after the exodus from Egypt, whereas the words in 9:1-14 were spoken in the first month of the same year v. 1 . However, in this portion of Numbers, the word concerning the unclean ones and the ones on a journey still partaking of the Passover was to be applied on the fourteenth day of the second month vv.
[81]  This shows the importance of keeping the Passover in relation to the move of God's redeemed people with God in His activity.
[82]  We should not think that partaking of the Lord's table has nothing to do with God's move or with our move with God in His activity.
[83]  But for us who should die under His righteous judgment, God prepared a replacement, Christ, who died a vicarious death for us, thus saving us from the death-judgment of God's righteousness.
[84]  LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE SIXTEEN JOURNEYING 1 Scripture Reading: Num 9:15 10:10
[85]  After the children of Israel had been formed into an army, they were ready to journey to fight for God so that He could gain the ground on earth to build up His kingdom with His house.
[86]  In typology the cloud from the heavens signifies God in the sense of God's presence.
[87]  When the cloud was in a certain place with God's people, God's actual presence was with His people.
[88]  But when the cloud moved, that was a sign that God was ready to move and that the people should also get ready to move.
[89]  First, Israel's guidance was God Himself in the form of a cloud.
[90]  "The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets" v. 8a . Only the sons of Aaron, the most spiritual persons, those closest to God, those who knew His heart and intention, could blow the trumpets.
[91]  "When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, and you shall be remembered before Jehovah your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies" v. 9 . This verse speaks of the adversary, the enemy, and being remembered before God.
[92]  The burnt offering signifies Christ as our acceptance by God and as our living; the peace offering signifies Christ as our peace and enjoyment with God.
[93]  LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE SEVENTEEN JOURNEYING 2 Scripture Reading: Num 10:11-36
[94]  In the foregoing message we considered the guidance given to the children of Israel.
[95]  The remaining verses in chapter ten reveal the leading of the ark the crucified and resurrected Christ in His resurrection vv.
[96]  When the ark set out, Moses said, "Arise, O Jehovah, and let Your enemies be scattered; and let them that hate You flee before You" v. 35 . We are not the enemies of God or the haters of God; we are His army and His lovers.
[97]  LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN JOURNEYING 3 Scripture Reading: Num 11
[98]  In this message we will begin to consider the failures recorded in chapters eleven through fourteen of Numbers.
[99]  For Meat to Eat a. Remembering the Food in Egypt
[100]  Numbers 11:4 and 5 say, "Now the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly; and the sons of Israel also wept again, and said, Who will give us meat to eat?
[101]  "The people went about and gathered it, and ground it between millstones or beat it in a mortar, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it" v. 8a . The fact that the manna could be ground, beaten, and boiled indicates that it was solid.
[102]  "Jehovah said to Moses, Gather for Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them; and bring them to the tent of meeting, that they may take their stand there with you" v. 16 . Here we see that God raised up seventy elders as helpers to Moses.
[103]  God put the Spirit that was upon Moses upon the seventy elders v. 25 . When this Spirit came upon them, they prophesied.
[104]  LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE NINETEEN JOURNEYING 4 Scripture Reading: Num 12
[105]  In this message we will be concerned with another failure recorded in the book of Numbers slandering.
[106]  First, those on the extremities of the camp of Israel murmured evil against Moses and against God, and then the mixed multitude lusted for meat.
[107]  One of the germs hidden within Miriam and Aaron was jealousy.
[108]  God vindicated Moses as His servant, one who was faithful in all His house v. 7 . God also vindicated Moses as one with whom He spoke mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in obscure words, and as one who beheld the form of Jehovah v. 8a .
[109]  LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE TWENTY JOURNEYING 5 Scripture Reading: Num 13:1 14:10
[110]  Students of theology are commonly taught that they should not invent any new theological terms.
[111]  The concern is that new terms might be used to introduce heresy into orthodox theology.
[112]  However, during the past sixty years, the Lord has opened His Word to us and has shown us many items that had been veiled for centuries.
[113]  Thus, when we speak of the arrangement of the divine government, or of God's arrangement in His economy, we use the word dispensation, but when we speak of God's dispensing Himself into us, we use the word dispensing.
[114]  In this message we will first continue to consider the failure of the children of Israel in not believing in God vv.
[115]  At the time of Exodus, the entire earth was occupied by the Gentiles, who were under the hand of Satan.
[116]  Not even a small part of the earth created by God was under His control.
[117]  The children of Israel were in Egypt, but Egypt was not their land.
[118]  They had to find a land, and God had prepared a land for them.
[119]  and Make of Moses a Nation Greater Than They
[120]  In His abhorring of the people of Israel, God wanted to strike them with a pestilence and make of Moses a nation greater than they Num 14:11-12 .
[121]  Therefore, he did not pray according to his concept; rather, he prayed according to God's concept, according to what God is, what God speaks, and what God promises.
[122]  Moses did not argue with God, but he did pray to God.
[123]  In 14:39-45 we see that the people failed again by transgressing the word of God.
[124]  The people of Israel, after hearing the word of Moses to them, mourned greatly v. 39 . Then they rose early in the morning, went up to the top of the mountain, and said, "We will go up to the place which Jehovah has spoken of; for we have sinned" v. 40 . Their word indicates that they were not only a rebellious people but also a stubborn people.
[125]  In this message we will consider the ordinances in Numbers 15.
[126]  In 15:1-31 we have the ordinances concerning the offerings.
[127]  Whenever we offer a burnt offering or a peace offering, we need to match this offering with a meal offering of fine flour mingled with oil v. 4 . Such a meal offering signifies Christ in His humanity mingled with the Holy Spirit to be the food of God and man.
[128]  Christ in His death is signified by the burnt offering and the peace offering.
[129]  The meal offering signifies Christ in His humanity mingled with the divine Spirit, and the drink offering signifies Christ being poured out for God's satisfaction.
[130]  "Of the first of your dough you shall offer a cake as a heave offering" v. 20a . A cake of the first of the dough signifies Christ as the firstfruit 1 Cor 15:20, 23 . The Christ whom we offer in His ascension to God as God's food is the Christ who is the firstfruit in resurrection.
[131]  For the sin of ignorance, the assembly of Israel was to "offer one young bull for a burnt offering, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah" v. 24a . This burnt offering signifies Christ in His freshness to satisfy God.
[132]  The burnt offering for the sin of ignorance was to be offered with its meal offering and its drink offering v. 24b . As we have pointed out, the meal offering signifies Christ in His humanity to be the food of God and man, and the drink offering signifies Christ pouring out Himself to satisfy God.
[133]  "If one person sins through ignorance, he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering" v. 27 . This goat signifies Christ, who knew no sin, being made sin for us by God 2 Cor 5:21 . This matter, which is according to God's righteousness and His governmental administration, is deep and mysterious.
[134]  In the New Testament, which we all love, we are charged to enjoy Christ, to seek Christ, and to pursue Christ, but we are not shown the way to enjoy Christ.
[135]  In verses 32 through 36 we have the ordinance concerning breaking the Sabbath.
[136]  The man was put into custody "because it had not been made plain what should be done to him" v. 34 . God spoke to Moses concerning this, saying, "The man shall surely be put to death; all the assembly shall stone him with stones outside the camp" v. 35 .
[137]  In verses 37 through 41 we have the ordinance concerning the people's dress.
[138]  The people were to look upon the tassel and remember all the commandments of God and do them, not seeking after their own heart and after their own eyes, according to which they committed fornications v. 39 . Thus they would remember and do their God's commandments and be holy to God.
[139]  In this message we come to another rebellion, the rebellion described in Numbers 16.
[140]  In verses 9 and 10 Moses said, "Is it too small a thing for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the assembly of Israel to bring you near to Himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the assembly to minister to them; and that He has brought you near to Him, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you?
[141]  Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram v. 12a , but, speaking in a very eloquent manner, they answered that they would not come up vv.
[142]  The history of Christianity is a history of the struggle for power.
[143]  Concerning the serious rebellion in chapter sixteen, we have already considered the rebels, the cause of the rebellion, and the reaction of Moses.
[144]  In this message we will see how God judged this rebellion 16:19-50 .
[145]  Korah gathered all the assembly, not just his company or party, against Moses and Aaron at the entrance of the tent of meeting v. 19a . This forced God to come out and appear in His glory to all the assembly v. 19b . God's appearing in such a way was a very significant event.
[146]  Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces and said, "O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will You be angry with all the assembly?" v. 22 .
[147]  The censers of the two hundred fifty men who had sinned against their souls, that is, against themselves, were made into hammered plates as a covering for the altar, as a sign to the sons of Israel and a reminder to them, so that no one who was a stranger, who was not of the descendants of Aaron, would draw near to burn incense before Jehovah, lest he become as Korah and as his company vv.
[148]  LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE JOURNEYING 10 Scripture Reading: Num 17
[149]  After His judgment, God commanded that twelve rods be laid before the testimony the Ten Commandments in the ark , which typified Christ and was the place where God met with His people vv.
[150]  This signifies that everything had to be brought into the presence of God to let God deal with the real situation by speaking the truth to all the people through His vindication.
[151]  The budding rod of Aaron was to be kept as a sign for the sons of rebellion, that their murmurings against God might be ended, lest they die v. 10 . Verse 5 refers to the murmurings as being against Moses, but verse 10 refers to them as being against God.
[152]  Before we turn to 18:1-14, I would like to give a further word on the two signs in chapters sixteen and seventeen.
[153]  These two signs, signifying Christ in resurrection and His judging cross, are with us today as a reminder and a warning to us regarding our service to God.
[154]  On the positive side, the budding rod the budding Christ in His resurrection, who not only buds but also blossoms and bears fruit to maturity is with anyone who truly stands with God and is one with Him.
[155]  Numbers 18:7a says, "You and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood for all that concerns the altar and that is within the veil."
[156]  The ark, which was within the veil, contained three items: the testimony of God the law , the hidden manna, and the budding rod.
[157]  "I give you your priesthood as a service of gift" v. 7b . The priesthood, as the highest service rendered by God's people to God, was a great gift given by God to Aaron and his sons.
[158]  The portions of the offerings reserved for the priests were to be most holy to them because these offerings were food for God v. 9 . The priests ate not man's food but God's food, food which is most holy.
[159]  The holy portions were eaten by every male the stronger ones of the priests' houses in a most holy place v. 10 . The most holy place here signifies the church, the Body of Christ.
[160]  In order to enjoy that part of Christ which God enjoys, we need to be in a most holy place.
[161]  "This also is yours, the heave offering of their gift, all the wave offerings of the sons of Israel; I have given them to you, and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual due" v. 11a . This verse speaks of two particular portions the heave offering the ascended Christ and the wave offering the resurrected Christ . To heave is to lift up.
[162]  1 To the Sons and Daughters of the Priests
[163]  The heave offering and wave offering were given not only to the priests but also to the sons the stronger ones and daughters the weaker ones of the priests.
[164]  This indicates that as long as we belong to the priestly family, whether we are strong or weak, we can enjoy such a Christ.
[165]  The fat of the oil signifies Christ's best part, which was for God, and the best of the new wine and of the grain signify the Christ who was poured out to God.
[166]  In this message we will continue to consider the Levitical service and the Aaronic priesthood, with their reward, which is Christ.
[167]  First, we will see some further matters related to the reward to Aaron and his sons as the priests.
[168]  Offered to God by the Sons of Israel Being Given
[169]  "All the heave offerings of the holy things which the sons of Israel offer to Jehovah I give to you, and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual due; it is a covenant of salt forever before Jehovah for you and for your seed with you" v. 19 . A particular portion the heave offerings of the things offered to God as holy things was always to be set aside for the priests and for their sons and daughters.
[170]  "So shall you also offer a heave offering to Jehovah from all your tithes, which you take from the sons of Israel; and from it you shall give Jehovah's heave offering to Aaron the priest" v. 28 . This verse tells us clearly that the heave offering offered by the Levites to Jehovah was to be given to Aaron the priest.
[171]  by the Levites and Their Households in Any Place
[172]  "You may eat it in any place, you and your households; for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting" v. 31 . The tithe offered to the Levites by the sons of Israel could be eaten by the Levites and their households in any place.
[173]  LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT JOURNEYING 13 Scripture Reading: Num 19
[174]  In this message we will cover chapter nineteen of Numbers, which deals with the water for impurity.
[175]  However, before I come to this matter, I would like to say a word about the way the book of Numbers is sectioned.
[176]  The next matter we need to see is how the water for purification was used.
[177]  LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE JOURNEYING 14 Scripture Reading: Num 20:2-13, 24; 27:12-14; 1 Cor 10:4, 6 VIII.
[178]  Moses failed to sanctify God in being angry with the people of Israel and in wrongly striking the rock twice.
[179]  In being angry, he did not represent God rightly in His holy nature toward His people.
[180]  From the case of Moses in Numbers 20 and the case of Elijah in 1 Kings 19, we learn that we should be careful whenever we pray to God concerning His people.
[181]  The people's worshipping the golden calf offended God to the uttermost, and He said to Moses, "I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation" vv.
[182]  When Moses heard this, he prayed to God, saying, "Lord, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?
[183]  Here he rightly represented God, but in Numbers 20 he forgot about sanctifying God and wrongly represented Him.
[184]  We need to learn that, especially when we have been offended by the saints in the church, we should not go to God for the purpose of accusing His people.
[185]  Being careful about the way we speak concerning God's people when we are offended will help us remain in the kingdom of God.
[186]  Regarding this, I recommend that you consider Matthew 18:1-35, where we see that the best way to be kept in God's kingdom is to forgive others.
[187]  LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE THIRTY JOURNEYING 15 Scripture Reading: Num 20:2-13, 24; 27:12-14; 1 Cor 10:4, 6
[188]  In chapter twenty of Numbers there are two lines: the line of life and the line of the types.
[189]  Now that the Spirit has been given, there is no need for Christ to be crucified again that the living water may flow forth.
[190]  To have the living water, we simply need to take the rod and apply it to our situation today.
[191]  God is fair, rich, bountiful, loving, kind, and gracious.
[192]  In order to serve Him, we must know Him in all these aspects.
[193]  Because He is fair, bountiful, and gracious, He has no problems with His people when they contend for food and water.
[194]  Since He is not angry with His people when they contend for their necessities, those who serve Him should likewise not be angry with them in such a situation.
[195]  He should have also considered that since water is a necessity, God in His fairness would not be angry with His people but would instead supply them with water.
[196]  Having accomplished everything related to God's economy, Christ is now in the heavens and in us, waiting to be the supply to meet our need.
[197]  To receive this supply, there is no need for us to beg or even to pray.
[198]  We should simply speak a direct word to Christ as the smitten rock.
[199]  In chapters twenty and twenty-one of Numbers, there are some important matters which we need to see.
[200]  In chapter twenty Moses was angry with the people, but God was not angry with them.
[201]  The book of Numbers shows us that the result of those failures was death, not only of the common Israelites but also of Miriam 20:1 , Aaron 20:22-29 , and Moses 27:12-14 .
[202]  THE STATIONS OF THE JOURNEY A. In Total, Forty-two Stations,
[203]  LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO FIGHTING 1 Scripture Reading: Num 21:1-3, 21-35
[204]  In this message we will begin to consider the fighting of the children of Israel.
[205]  Numbers 21:1-3, 21-35 reveals that the children of Israel defeated the kings of Arad, of the Amorites, and of Bashan.
[206]  In 21:1-3 the children of Israel defeated the king of Arad.
[207]  King Og and all his people came to do battle against Israel at Edrei v. 33 . Jehovah said to Moses, "Do not fear him; for I have given him into your hand, as well as all his people and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon" v. 34 . Therefore, Israel slew Og, his sons, and all his people, until there was none left, and possessed his land v. 35 .
[208]  LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE FIGHTING 2 Scripture Reading: Num 22:1-40; 2 Pet 2:15-16; Jude 11 IV.
[209]  God said to him, "You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed" v. 12 . Balaam then told the officers of Balak that the Lord would not allow him to go with them.
[210]  LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR FIGHTING 3 Scripture Reading: Num 22:41 23:26 B. Balaam's Prophesying in Parables
[211]  In the foregoing message we saw Balak's evil intention.
[212]  In this message we will consider Balaam's third and fourth parables.
[213]  The Spirit of God came upon Balaam, and he took up his parable and said, "The word of Balaam the son of Beor,/The word of the man whose eye is opened,/The word of him who hears the speaking of God,/Who sees the vision of the Almighty,/Falling down, but having his eyes uncovered" vv.
[214]  Balaam ended his third parable with a word concerning blessing and cursing: "Blessed is he who blesses you,/And cursed is he who curses you" 24:9b .
[215]  In this message we will consider Israel's fall into fornication and idolatry.
[216]  Chapter twenty shows us Christ as the smitten rock who, in resurrection, is flowing out living water to meet our need v. 8 . Christ has been smitten, crucified, and there is no need for Him to be smitten again.
[217]  As long as we have Him, God has no problem with us and we have no problem with God.
[218]  Let us first consider what these parables show us concerning the church.
[219]  "Behold, a people that will dwell alone, /And will not reckon themselves among the nations!"
[220]  This indicates that the church is composed of a separate people, a particular people, a people sanctified to God.
[221]  This iniquity comprises two ugly things: fornication, which destroys the person of the God-created man, and idolatry, which insults the divine person of God.
[222]  God created the universe in such a way that we have both day and night.
[223]  In 26:5-51 we have the numbering of the twelve tribes, with the number being 601,730.
[224]  The children of Israel were a peculiar people, a people who were for God and thus stood apart from the nations.
[225]  Among this peculiar people there was an extraordinary tribe the Levites and this tribe was not numbered among the sons of Israel.
[226]  When Moses brought the case of the five daughters of Zelophehad before Jehovah v. 5 , He said to him, "The daughters of Zelophehad speak rightly; you shall surely give them possession of an inheritance among their father's brothers and cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them" v. 7 . The Lord seemed to be saying, "Their request is right.
[227]  It is pleasing to Me. I do not like to see one of My people dying without having a remembrance in the history of My people.
[228]  "He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, and he shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah; at his word they shall go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he and all the sons of Israel with him, even the whole assembly" v. 21 . Exodus 28:30 speaks of putting the Urim and the Thummim in the breastplate of judgment, which was worn by the high priest.
[229]  LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE FORTY FIGHTING 9 Scripture Reading: Num 28:1-31 VIII.
[230]  Numbers 27:12-23 is concerned with the death of Moses and with Moses' successor.
[231]  Moses was one hundred twenty years old, and the Lord told him that the time had come for him to be gathered to his people.
[232]  When God told him that he would now be gathered to his people, Moses said, "Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the assembly, who will go out before them and come in before them, who will lead them out and bring them in; that the assembly of Jehovah may not be as sheep which have no shepherd" vv.
[233]  God's food was to be offered to Him "at its appointed time" v. 2b . As we will see, God needs to eat daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly.
[234]  e. A Burnt Offering for the Feast of Weeks
[235]  Numbers 28:26-31 is concerned with the burnt offering for the feast of weeks.
[236]  This burnt offering was offered in the day of the first fruits, that is, the fiftieth day of the feast of weeks v. 26 , when a new meal offering was offered to Jehovah Lev 23:10-11, 15-16 . A holy convocation was held on the same day with no laborious work.
[237]  The Passover typifies Christ, who is our Passover 1 Cor 5:7 , and Pentecost typifies the processed Triune God, who has become the consummated, life-giving, dispensing Spirit.
[238]  Then as we are having fellowship with God, we and God will have the mutual enjoyment of Christ by eating and drinking Him.
[239]  At this point, I would like to say a further word concerning the first four of the seven yearly feasts, from the Passover to the feast of weeks, which is the feast of Pentecost.
[240]  The Passover signifies the beginning of our Christian life.
[241]  Christ became the Lamb of God who took away our sin and our sins so that God, in His righteousness, might pass over us.
[242]  In this message we will consider further the statutes concerning the offerings in Numbers 28 and 29.
[243]  In the present age, the age of grace, we are enjoying Christ as our Passover, as our unleavened bread, and as the firstfruit offered to God in resurrection.
[244]  The food offered to God by the believers who experience Christ as the reality of all the feasts from Passover to Pentecost has nothing to do with the old creation but is altogether in the new creation.
[245]  God desires to have His economy fulfilled by Christ, with Christ, and in Christ.
[246]  The more we enjoy Christ and experience Christ, the more we fulfill God's economy, and the more we participate in the fulfillment of God's economy, the more we will be able to offer Christ to God as food.
[247]  Likewise, living a life in Christ without sin after we have been saved is a part of the fulfillment of God's economy with Christ, by Christ, and in Christ.
[248]  Numbers 28:1 30:16 is a section dealing with statutes, which are additional laws.
[249]  In this message we will begin to consider the overcoming of the Midianites by the children of Israel 31:1-54 .
[250]  God would not forget that and He charged Moses to avenge Israel on the Midianites.
[251]  Therefore, out of the thousands of Israel, there were twelve thousand armed for war v. 5 . In addition, Moses sent Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the war, "as well as the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand" v. 6 . Because Phinehas had a heart filled with God's jealousy and had done something very acceptable to God when Israel fell into fornication and idolatry, God wanted Moses to send him out with the vessels of the sanctuary and with the trumpets.
[252]  They realized that there was something concerning them which was not right or fitting and that they needed to make propitiation for themselves before God so that their situation with God could be appeased.
[253]  In this message we will begin to consider the prearrangement of the distribution of the good land 32:1-42; 33:50 36:13 .
[254]  Because of What They Had and of What They Saw
[255]  The two tribes made their request because of what they had a very great multitude of cattle v. 1 and because of what they saw a land good for livestock v. 4 . This was the reason for their choice.
[256]  Self-choice, even in the church life, comes from two things considering what we have and need and considering how a particular situation or opportunity that we see in front of us fits in with our needs.
[257]  In this message on the prearrangement of the distribution of the good land, we will consider the statutes for inheriting the good land 33:50-56 and the boundaries of the good land and its distributors 34:1-29 .
[258]  "You shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; for a large one you shall enlarge his inheritance, and for a small one you shall decrease his inheritance; wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his; according to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit" v. 54 . Here we see that the children of Israel were to inherit the land according to two things: according to their tribes and according to the lot.
[259]  In this message we will consider the cities given to the Levites and the cities of refuge.
[260]  Before we consider chapter thirty-six of Numbers, I would like to say a further word on two matters concerning the refuge cities in chapter thirty-five.
[261]  First, according to 35:25b-29, the rescued killer was to remain in the city of refuge and live in it until the death of the high priest, who signifies Christ, who died for our sins.
[262]  Since we, the believers in Christ, have God's direct salvation, how should we apply the type of remaining in the refuge city until the death of the high priest?
[263]  In the Old Testament time, Christ had not yet died, and those who fled into Him as their refuge had to wait there until He came and died on the cross.
[264]  Because this matter had yet to be settled, God authorized Moses to add a portion to deal with it.
[265]  "The inheritance of the sons of Israel shall not pass from one tribe to another; for every one of the sons of Israel shall cleave to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers" v. 7 . This signifies that as our inheritance Christ is not transferable and that we should cleave to Him as this inheritance.
[266]  "They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father" v. 12 . Once again we see that the freedom we have from God is not unlimited.
[267]  We may use four slogans to summarize certain crucial aspects of this sketch: "Purchased, redeemed, and saved from the bondage of the fall"; "Enjoying Christ, receiving revelation, and being built up in the Triune God"; "Formed into a priestly army to fight for God and to journey with God"; and "Possessed by God to possess the all-inclusive Christ as the good land."
[268]  God brought the people out of Egypt to the mountain of God, Mount Sinai, and there gave them a full revelation of His dwelling place among the human race on earth.
[269]  When God sent Moses to rescue the children of Israel out of the hand of Pharaoh, God told Moses that after he had brought the people out of Egypt, they would serve the Lord upon this mountain Exo 3:12 .
[270]  At Mount Sinai God's people received the revelation concerning God Himself that they might be separated unto the holy God as His sanctified people Exo 20 24 .
[271]  Before the children of Israel received the revelation concerning God's building, God gave them a portrait of Himself to show them what kind of God He is.
[272]  In the New Testament we have a description of God, but we do not have a picture of God.
[273]  John tells us clearly that God is love and light, and Paul tells us that the very God who is love and light is absolutely holy and righteous.
[274]  In addition to receiving the divine revelation concerning God Himself, the children of Israel received the divine revelation concerning God's economy that they might be built up together with God in His divine Trinity as His dwelling place on earth for His testimony Exo 25 40 .
[275]  In their journey with God, the children of Israel had the presence of God, signified by the cloud in the day and by the fire in the cloud at night Exo 33:14; 40:36-38; Num 9:15-23 .
[276]  As a priestly army, God's chosen and redeemed people fought together with God and for God.
[277]  Only in this way can we be qualified to fight together with God.
[278]  The children of Israel fought not only with God but also for God.
[279]  This indicates that in the church life today we are bearing God's testimony with God Himself.
[280]  Actually, the dwelling place of God is the testimony of God.
[281]  LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE A VITAL SKETCH
[282]  Numbers 12:1-15 records the rebellion of Miriam, who was Moses' older sister.
[283]  Moses was the God-chosen leader, and Miriam was a prophetess who, after the crossing of the Red Sea, led the women in praising God Exo 15:20-21 .
[284]  Another frustration to God's chosen and redeemed people was Balaam's plot and teaching Num 31:16; Rev 2:14b .
[285]  Balaam taught Balak to stumble the God-chosen and God-redeemed people by seducing them to commit fornication with the daughters of Moab, which led them into idolatry Num 25:1-2 .
[286]  the God-chosen and God-redeemed People Provoking God to Consume
[287]  Through this fall into fornication and idolatry, the God-chosen and God-redeemed people provoked God to consume twenty-four thousand of them with the plague Num 25:3, 9 .
[288]  In this message we will consider the matter of God's chosen and redeemed people being ready to take possession of the God-promised good land.
[289]  The vital sketch of the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers first involves God's need for a people to be saved and to go on with Him to enjoy His Christ, to receive His revelation, and to be built up with Him as the processed Triune God that they may be formed into a priestly army to journey with Him and to fight with Him.
[290]  God's people were made ready to take possession of the God-promised land by being redeemed from God's judgment by the Passover and by being saved from Egypt by the saving power of the Triune God Exo 12, 14 .
[291]  The children of Israel were also made ready to take possession of the God-promised land by passing through all the frustrations, trials, and disciplines for their purification.
[292]  God's people were also ready to be built up with Him in His divine Trinity as the mutual dwelling for God and His redeemed people for the expression and testimony of the Triune God on earth among men.
[293]  Having been redeemed from God's judgment and saved from the bondage of the fall, we, like the children of Israel in the Old Testament, are now enjoying the divine care and Christ as the heavenly and divine provisions Exo 15 17 .
[294]  Under God's care, we enjoy His nourishing and cherishing us with Christ as our provisions as the manna, as the living water which flows out of the smitten rock which follows us, and as the tree the crucified Christ cast into the bitter water.
[295]  The full type of the church in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers is a type of the church in the mystical union with the all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed and dispensing Triune God.
