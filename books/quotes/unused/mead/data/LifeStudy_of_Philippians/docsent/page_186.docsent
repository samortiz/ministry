   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECRET OF SATISFACTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we are truly one with the Lord in our experience and something negative happens to us, we need not be anxious or troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are not one with the Lord in a practical way, virtually every person, every matter, and every thing will bother us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may be disturbed by our husband or wife or by our children.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we are not one with the Lord, nothing will be satisfactory to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, apart from the Lord, no job is satisfying.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The secret of satisfaction is to be one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we are one with the Lord, we can be satisfied with our circumstances, and we can be forbearing with everyone, every thing, and every matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only when we are one with Christ can we be forbearing to the uttermost and be satisfied in all situations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we would not have any anxiety, we must recognize that all afflictions, sufferings, calamities, disasters, and catastrophes are assigned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We also must be one with the Lord in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yes, we may realize the necessity of passing through suffering and affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if we would be free from anxiety, we need something more than this realization.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must also be one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Otherwise, eventually our circumstances or the things which happen to us will cause anxiety, and we shall not be satisfied with anything or anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The older a person becomes, the more difficult it is for him to be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Throughout the years I have observed a good number of elderly persons who did not have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The older they were, the more dissatisfied they became.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some were disgusted with almost everything and everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not practice being one with the Lord, our situation will also become worse as we grow older.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Out of a feeling of dissatisfaction, we may blame our circumstances or the members of our family.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is easy to satisfy a child or a young person, but difficult to satisfy someone who is older.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This fact should motivate us to be one with the Lord in a practical way that we may be free from anxiety and have a life of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>PRAYER AND PETITION WITH THANKSGIVING</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 4:6 and 7 Paul says, In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul certainly composed these verses in a very thoughtful way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verse 6 he speaks of prayer, petition, and thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Prayer is general and includes the essence of worship and fellowship; petition is special and is related to particular needs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to Christian experience, to pray is to have fellowship, communion, with the Lord and to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Daily we need to have a time to contact the Lord, to have fellowship with Him, and to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During the course of our fellowship, we may have particular requests.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, we not only pray in a general way, but make petitions to the Lord in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We offer our petitions to the One with whom we are having fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Petition, therefore, is a special request made during the course of our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is significant that in 4:6 Paul does not speak of prayer, petition, and thanksgiving, but of prayer and petition with thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both our prayer and petition should be accompanied by thanksgiving to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Recently I once again learned the lesson of being thankful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When I asked the Lord to restore my health, I was rebuked by Him for not thanking Him for the measure of health I still had.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever we are ill, we need to say, Lord, I thank You that I am still healthy to a certain degree.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Lord, I am ill, but I am not so ill that I cannot minister Christ to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But, Lord, You know that I am not altogether healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, I ask You to improve my health and make me fully healthy again.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all need to learn to petition the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose a brother prays that the Lord will change his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If he prays in this way, the Lord may ask him why he does not offer thanks for his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then the brother should pray, Lord, I thank You for giving me a good wife.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After offering thanks to the Lord, he then may proceed to ask Him to transform his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Another brother may lose his job and pray to the Lord concerning employment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead of saying, Lord, I have lost my job and I need You to have mercy on me, he should first thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Perhaps he should say, Lord, I thank You that I did not lose this job before now.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Lord, I also thank You for the means I still have to support my family.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>O Lord, I have many things for which to thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then along with his thanksgiving, he may ask the Lord to give him another job.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But even as he prays concerning a new job, he should still be thankful and say, Lord, I believe that You will give me a new job.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Lord, You know what I need.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I even thank You ahead of time for the job You will give me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let us all learn to pray and petition with thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are thankful to the Lord, this will keep us from anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But if we pray to the Lord out of worry, our anxiety will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Praying about our situation may actually cause our anxiety to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But if we pray and petition with thanksgiving, our anxiety will be driven away.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I must testify that I have learned to pray and petition with thanksgiving not from doctrine, but from my experience with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When I was ill recently, the Lord did rebuke me for not thanking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He reminded me that I am still healthy enough to function by releasing the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He rebuked me for allowing a little illness to disturb me and for complaining about my situation instead of exercising forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>By rebuking me for not thanking Him sufficiently, the Lord helped me to be satisfied in Him and not to be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I thank the Lord for this training, which has come through a time of illness and through the Lord s rebuke.</S>
