   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A CONCLUDING WORD CONCERNING THE JUDAIZERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In summary there are three basic errors with the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first concerns the law, the second concerns the Lord's redemption, and the third concerns man's salvation after death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are a few problems associated with them: First, according to their 1887 statistics, they had 260,000 converts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By now they must have over a million.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But their teaching says that the Bible only grants 144,000 to be the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only these ones will be able to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If this is the case, they cannot preach their gospel anymore because the more they preach the more their elect will be displaced.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second, they consider all those who make Sunday the Sabbath to be sealed by the beast.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Third, they even say that the tribulation will not be seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather it will be seven plagues within a year.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How absurd this is!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Fourth, some of them even claim that they are the third angel who blows the trumpet in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we can see the confusion of the Judaizers' system.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They take advantage of the deadness of Protestantism to gain power for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the one hand, they have the Ten Commandments on their chapel walls.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the other hand, they will not read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If they are willing to read the Bible, they will not understand the verses we present to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are trained in their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They will bring out many unrelated passages to argue with us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we talk with them, we have to be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must not be led away by them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is better for new ones not to contact them at all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we reject them, they will not come back again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They act in the same principle as the Jews in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Seventh-day Adventists can be considered Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is very difficult to bring a Seventh-day Adventist to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more a person is of the devil, the harder it is for him to turn to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We get an uneasy feeling whenever we are around a Hindu.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Men like Gandhi may love to talk about the truth of love, but this cannot cause them to be saved because their love is not the love of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we listen to them, something bothers us within.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The same is true, if not more so, when we talk with the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Their teachings are too far off from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to protect the brothers and sisters from falling into this darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Their teachings are too dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should only speak such things to the new ones briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no need to enumerate the names of all the heretics and evil teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We know the seriousness of the danger, but the new ones do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to help them not to contact these teachings so that they will be spared from such troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A hundred years ago when the Brethren were raised up, they refuted the teaching of the Judaizers in the course of shaking up the Protestants.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Brethren are very good at Bible exposition.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They are also very knowledgeable about the Lord's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The proper attitude towards the Judaizers is to touch them as little as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Protestantism has disregarded one thing in the Bible the Lord's second coming, and the Judaizers seize this point and use it to confuse the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Among the Brethren, there are sixteen different interpretations concerning Daniel 9 in regards to the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All of them are trustworthy interpretations.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Judaizers are simply talking nonsense when it comes to interpreting Daniel and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These two books are not that hard.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If any brother is distracted by the Judaizers, we have to bear the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Their propaganda rests heavily on the fact that Protestants do not read their Bible and that they have something to say about the Lord's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to help new ones know the errors of the Judaizers so that they will guard themselves against the wrong teachings.</S>
