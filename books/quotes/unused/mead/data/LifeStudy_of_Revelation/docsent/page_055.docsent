   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. To Receive a White Stone</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>with a New Name Written on It</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord also promised the overcomer, saying, I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Enjoying Christ as the hidden manna produces transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can we say this?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because after referring to the hidden manna, the Lord speaks of a white stone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A stone in the Bible signifies material for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man was not made with stone but with dust Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In a sense, man is just clay, and Romans 9 reveals that man is simply a clay vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, when the Lord first met Simon Peter, He immediately changed his name from Simon to Cephas, which means a stone John 1:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Recall Jacob s dream in Genesis 28.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When he awoke from that dream, he took the stone which he had used for a pillow and called it the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul indicates that precious stones are to be used for the building of the church, and in Revelation 21 we see that precious stones are materials in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we put all these verses together, we see that a stone signifies a transformed person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We cannot understand a verse like 2:17 by itself; we must consider it in the context of the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord promises the overcomer to eat of the hidden manna and to give him a white stone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that if we eat the hidden manna, we shall be transformed into white stones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In our natural being we are not stones, but clay.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because we have received the divine life with its divine nature through regeneration, we can be transformed into stones, even precious stones, by enjoying Christ as our life supply 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By eating Jesus as the hidden manna we shall be transformed into white stones for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do not follow the worldly church, but enjoy the Lord in the proper church life, we shall be transformed into stones for the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These stones will be justified and approved by the Lord, as indicated by the color white, while the worldly church will be condemned and rejected by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the book of Revelation the color white denotes approval.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we are transformed into a stone, we shall be approved by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This will make Him very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The white stone is for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God s building, the building of the church, depends upon our transformation, and our transformation issues from the enjoyment of Christ as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord said that on the stone would be a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A name designates a person, and the new name here is the designation of a transformed person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every transformed believer as a white stone bears a new name...which no one knows but he who receives it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a new name is the interpretation of the experience of the one being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, only he himself knows the meaning of that name.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A certain brother may still be quite muddy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, he loves the Lord, has forsaken the world, and has given up every separation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, the Lord would say to him, I shall give you to eat of the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more this brother eats the hidden manna, the more he will be transformed into a white stone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As this brother eats the Lord Jesus as the hidden manna, he will have certain experiences and the Lord will write a new name upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This new name is simply the new designation of what this brother is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since this new name is based upon what this brother is according to his experiences, others cannot know what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Revelation 2:17 is a word spoken by the Lord to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not take it objectively but as your biography.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Consider it as a word for you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In a sense, we are living in the age of Pergamos, for the so-called church has become worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But, being an anti-witness, we are here fighting for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, the Lord gives us this word in verse 17, and we all need to understand it and say, Amen, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thank You for this promise.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I may eat of You as the hidden manna, and this eating will transform me from clay into a stone which will please You, be approved by You, and be used by You for the building up of Your dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Lord, I agree with Your promise.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From now on, I shall eat You in a hidden way and be transformed to become a white stone for Your building.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Is this not a wonderful promise from the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yes, the church may become worldly, but the Lord has promised that we may become a white stone for God s building.</S>
