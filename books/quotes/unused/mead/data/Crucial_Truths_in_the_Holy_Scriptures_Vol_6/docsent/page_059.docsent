   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The rapture of the believers is a great matter in the Bible, and it directly relates to the believers future.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>While worldly people do not know about this matter, many newly saved brothers and sisters also do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, the Bible clearly says that when the Lord Jesus returns, He will rapture those who are saved and belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a promise given to all who belong to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, it is a blessed hope to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Throughout the centuries Bible readers and expositors have held differing views concerning the rapture of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Consequently, this matter has been a source of unending arguments among believers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Views concerning the rapture can be divided into three schools.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One school argues that all the believers will be raptured before the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This school has the greatest number of adherents, including J. N. Darby and those with him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>C. I. Scofield, D. L. Moody, and R. A. Torrey also share this view, which is the most common among believers today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Another school argues that all believers will be raptured at the end of the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This school has the fewest adherents, but among them are George M ller, B. W. Newton, A. J. Gordon, and A. B. Simpson, the founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The view of these brothers is not held by many.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A third school argues that overcoming believers will be raptured before the tribulation, but defeated believers will pass through the great tribulation and be raptured at the end of the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This school includes Hudson Taylor, the founder of the China Inland Mission, R. C. Chapman, Robert Govett, and D. M. Panton.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The co-workers among us also believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to look at the Bible to see that this is the correct view.</S>
