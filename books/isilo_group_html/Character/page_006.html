Broad&mdash;Having a Wide Perspective</h2>
<p>A person who practices being genuine, exact, strict, and diligent can very easily become narrow. By nature all sloppy people are broad. However, those who serve the Lord need to be broad in their character. The heart of Solomon was as broad as the sand on the seashore. Since the sand surrounds the sea, it must be broader than the sea. We must practice being broad. Only people who are broad can discover the great things in the Bible. A narrow person can only study the trivial matters and give messages on minor topics; furthermore, he may even make a message on a major topic become insignificant. A worker must learn to be broad, to study the Bible with a broad perspective, and to study the great items in the Scriptures. He must learn to pay attention to the significant things and to be magnanimous toward people. Such a person commands a wide view, and his leading of others and his knowledge of the Lord are likewise broad.</p>
<h2 class="head2">6. Fine&mdash;Not Careless or Negligent</h2>
<p>Although we should not be narrow, we should be fine. In the last two thousand years, those who were greatly used by the Lord were both broad and fine. Those who were narrow and coarse were invariably of little use. The Lord leads us according to the grace that God gives us. Too often, however, His leading is dependent on our character. Some brothers and sisters can study the Bible and pray, but they cannot bear responsibilities. Because of their character, we dare not entrust the Lord&rsquo;s business to them. They receive much grace and know how to pray, but they have not built up the proper character that enables them to accomplish things. Although they may be placed in some areas of service, they cannot be entrusted with the service. The service of the Lord requires a broad and fine person. To study the Bible well, one must find the scriptural basis of any matter with a broad and fine eye.</p>
<h2 class="head2">7. Stable&mdash;Steady, Not Easily Moved or Changed,<br />
and Not Panicky</h2>
<p>To be stable is to be steady, immovable, and unchangeable. What a stable life the Lord lived on the earth! He was not stirred by His brothers&rsquo; suggestion that He go up to Jerusalem to gain recognition, and when His opposers tried to stone Him, He walked past them straightly. Had we been in that situation, we either would have been stoned or would have quickly fled. Once the Lord knew that Lazarus was sick, He remained in the same place for two days more. Our Lord never wavered. He was stable. Those who know God&rsquo;s will do not panic. An unstable person is like a reed in the wilderness blown by the wind. Never steady or stable, he leans west when blown by the east wind and east when blown by the west wind. A person who fluctuates can never understand the will of God. He can neither work with others nor serve the church.</p>
<p>However, to be stable is not to be slow. Stability includes not speaking uncertainly or doing things about which one is unsure. A stable person is not easily changed by his environment. He controls his time well and takes action only after he has waited and is sure of God&rsquo;s will. To be stable is not to be stubborn, stiff-necked, or obstinate, but to have an inner quality that is immovable and unchangeable. Luther was a stable and strong person; therefore, God could use him. Stability is an important qualification in serving the Lord and in selecting a co-worker. Time works, but only with a stable person. Once a stable person realizes God&rsquo;s will, he will act immediately, regardless of the cost. Yet until God&rsquo;s time has come, no one is able to influence him. Hence, we need to learn to be stable. Panicking does not help. We must remain steady through the storm, knowing that when it is over, the difficulties also will cease. Those riding in a boat well understand the importance of stability. When riding in a small boat on a stormy sea, one simply cannot afford to panic.</p>
<h2 class="head2">8. Deep&mdash;Searching Downward and<br />
Digging Deeper, Not Being Superficial</h2>
<p>The book of Proverbs says that a foolish person is a shallow person. The observation of a shallow person is not accurate. His understanding of the church, people, matters, and things is superficial. Being deep is closely related to being thorough and serious. A shallow person always makes superficial observations, whereas a deep person always searches and digs when he looks at things. To a shallow person, it may seem that there is nothing to do, even if a church is committed to him. While others have much to speak in a message, he has nothing to say. While others labor to obtain light in studying the Bible, he is satisfied with merely a literal understanding. In listening to people, a deep person does not easily believe others and listens beyond superficial remarks. However, a shallow person readily believes others&rsquo; words, and his relaying of information is often inconsistent and incomplete. As a result, gossip is created. Those who serve the Lord must be deep in truth, in experience, and in leading others. A shallow person cannot serve the Lord, because he will make God&rsquo;s work shallow. Those who like to represent others are shallow people. One who is deep is neither complicated nor shallow. Such a person is three-dimensional, always investigating and researching.</p>
<h2 class="head2">9. Patient&mdash;Being Able to Wait<br />
and Not Being Anxious</h2>
<p>According to James chapter five, the farmer who wishes to obtain the fruit of the earth cannot be anxious (v. 7); he must wait for the appointed time. A patient person can wait. Contrary to the common understanding, patience is different from endurance. To be patient is not to be slothful and sloppy but to work diligently without anxiety. Everything we do takes time. The amount of effort put forth will determine how much one can accomplish. No work can be done cheaply. Those who hope for instant accomplishments can never do the work of God. To do God&rsquo;s work a person must work daily yet without anxiety. A patient person is not distracted by anything temporary, since he knows his commission. This is like the farmer, to whom waiting is normal: on one hand, he works in the fields; on the other hand, he waits. In leading others one may often be disappointed, but those who are patient never give up hope. When our work suffers a setback, we must be patient. Time will prove and time will tell. Time will vindicate and manifest the truth. The manifestation of the glory of God may be only half a minute away.</p>
<p>One should be aggressive but not anxious. This requires practice. A character produced out of patience is invaluable. We should not draw conclusions quickly concerning people or matters. After only a few more days of waiting, the real situation will emerge. We must learn to be patient when we are in need. If we are patient when in need, we will never have to borrow. When Paul wrote to the Corinthians, though he felt heavy and pressed, he was nonetheless patient. Those who serve the Lord must possess such a quality. Many people make a clamor over minor hardships, make known their smallest problem, and make an instant judgment concerning any matter which comes their way. Such are useless people. To be patient is to wait. It is different from being slow. Whether one has a quick or a slow disposition, one must learn to be patient. To be slow is to fail to grasp opportunities; this must be dealt with. A patient person is prompt and nimble. We should be patient before opportunity arises and should grasp it immediately when it does. As we serve the church daily, we should wait patiently concerning all the situations which confront us and concerning the results of our work. Before the harvest season arrives, we should not be anxious; neither should we relax and be lazy. We should be full of feelings toward people and things. We should be sensitive and concerned and should have proper foresight. We must finish whatever work we have to do and leave the rest to time. In many ways time represents God.</p>
<p>Those who would be proper persons, and especially be weighty in the hand of the Lord, must possess all of the preceding nine characteristics. Without these nine qualities, we will not be enlightened in our study of the Bible; neither will we meet the requirements of the spiritual life in our dealings with people, things, and the Lord&rsquo;s work. Also, it is very unlikely that we will have much spiritual growth. Our being must correspond with the work we wish to accomplish, and our character must match the business we plan to do. In a character that is fit for the Lord&rsquo;s use, acquired habits are much more important than inborn nature. This all depends on the building up of a character that is suitable to the Lord.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Character &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
