   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3 Therefore all that they tell you, do and keep; but do not do according to their works, for they say things and do not do them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>5 And all their works they do to be seen by men, for they broaden their 1 phylacteries and enlarge the 2 fringes of their garments.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the Lord had been examined and tested by the religious leaders, in His wisdom He muzzled them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, He reached the point where He did not talk to them any further.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, in chapter twenty-three, He gave them a final word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In His rebuke of the Jewish religionists, the Lord first spoke against their hypocrisy 23:1-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He exposed their hypocrisy in the following areas: 1 seating themselves in Moses' seat and saying but not doing vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>2-3 ; 2 binding heavy burdens and laying them on the shoulders of others, but not moving them with their finger v. 4 ; 3 doing all their works to be seen by men v. 5a ; 4 broadening their phylacteries and enlarging the fringes of their garments v. 5b ; 5 loving the place of honor at the dinners and the chief seats in the synagogues v. 6 ; 6 loving the salutations in the market places and being called Rabbi by men v. 7 ; and 7 a behavior that is in contrast to the humility of the kingdom people vv.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord's rebuke of the scribes and Pharisees affords us an accurate picture of today's religion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything found in 23:1-36 resembles the situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Remember, this rebuke is found in the book of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Matthew's intention is certainly to present the negative in order to reveal the positive.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The kingdom life must be the opposite of what is exposed in 23:1-36.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It must be an absolute contrast to this black and hellish picture.</S>
