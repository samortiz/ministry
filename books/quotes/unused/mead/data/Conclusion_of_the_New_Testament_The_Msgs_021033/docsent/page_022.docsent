   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Born of a Human Virgin,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Having the Essence of Man</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the God-man, Christ was born of a human virgin and therefore has the essence of man Luke 1:31; Gal 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ was born of a human virgin with the human essence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Luke 1:27 and 31 we see that a virgin named Mary conceived in her womb and bore a son whose name was Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because the God-man was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence and was born of a human virgin with the human essence, He has two essences, the divine and the human.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such a conception of the Holy Spirit in a human virgin, accomplished with both the divine and the human essences, constitutes a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature, producing the God-man, the One who is both the complete God and a perfect man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctively, without a third nature being produced.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the most wonderful and excellent person of Christ in His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The conception of the God-man was God s incarnation, constituted not only by the divine power but also of the divine essence added to the human essence, hence producing the God-man of two natures divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through this, God joined Himself to humanity so that He might be manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some Bible teachers have failed to understand the matter of mingling in Christ s conception.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In ancient times there was a debate regarding the word mingling, a debate concerning the mingling of the divine essence and the human essence in the person of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some who did not understand this mingling said that it caused a third nature to be produced, something which is neither divine nor human.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is a great heresy to say that Jesus Christ is not quite God nor quite man but a third entity with a third nature, something neither God nor man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To say that with respect to the Lord Jesus the mingling of the divine essence with the human essence produced a third nature, a nature that is neither fully human nor fully divine, is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first definition of the word mingle given in Webster s Abridged Dictionary is: to combine or join one thing with another, or two or more things together , especially so that the original elements are distinguishable in the combination.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to this definition, when two or more things are mingled together, their original natures are not lost but remain distinguishable.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This certainly is the situation regarding Christ as the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was conceived of two essences, the divine and the human.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, He is a mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But in Him both the divine essence and the human essence remain and are distinguishable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These essences are mingled in Him as one person without the producing of a third nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the God-man He possesses two natures, and in Him each nature is distinguishable.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Holy Thing</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Luke 1:35 Christ is called the holy thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the conceiving was of the Holy Spirit, what was born of this conception was a holy thing, something intrinsically holy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the holy thing, Christ was absolutely for God and separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was absolutely unto God and one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The name Jesus was given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The angel Gabriel told Mary that the child she would conceive was to be called Jesus Luke 1:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph and also told him to call the child Jesus Matt 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, Jesus was a God-given name.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Luke 1:31 says, Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua Num 13:16 , which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, Jesus is not only a man but also Jehovah, and not only Jehovah but Jehovah becoming our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>a. Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The name Jesus includes the name Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Hebrew God means the mighty One, and Jehovah means I Am Exo 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The verb to be in Hebrew refers not only to the present but also includes the past and the future.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, the correct meaning of Jehovah is I Am That I Am, the One who is now in the present, who was in the past, and who will be in the future and in eternity forever.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only God is the eternal One.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From eternity past to eternity future, He is the I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because the Lord Jesus is God incarnate, He could say of Himself, Before Abraham came into being, I am John 8:58 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, He could say to the Jews, Unless you believe that I am, you shall die in your sins, and, When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am John 8:24, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to realize that Jesus is the I Am and believe in Him as the I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Jesus is whatever we need.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we need salvation, He Himself will be salvation to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whatever we need, He is.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is life, light, power, wisdom, righteousness, holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everything we need is found in Him.</S>
