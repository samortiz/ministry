The occupations that are right are those that earn wages through manual labor. Those occupations that do not increase the value of goods make a poor testimony before God and even before Satan. In addition, they corrupt a person's heart.</p><p>We have two brothers who were business students. Now they no longer want to study business. Commerce turns a person's mind immediately to money. Before the Lord we have to be delivered from money. Our occupations must be such that they increase the value of goods or improve the goods. Only those who are undefiled in their occupations can serve God in a useful way. If there is a group of people who are delivered from money and on whom money has no effect, God will have a way through these ones. In Chefoo the brothers with lowly jobs were sent out first. These brothers were all engaged in occupations that increased the value of goods. Some occupations are involved with commerce. Those saints who are involved with these kinds of occupations have to learn to drop them. The assignment of co-workers is an absolute matter today. The assignment of the saints' occupations should also be an absolute matter. The co-workers cannot choose their own place of work. Neither can the brothers and sisters choose their own occupations. Those who have jobs need to be coordinated in the same way as those in the Lord's work need to be coordinated. God can only use clean money. The need today is too great, yet we cannot lower God's standard.</p><h2 class="head2">Occupations Having Much to Do<br />with God's Testimony</h2><p>Brother Chang's occupation is not very good. It has too much to do with government and politics. A job in the post office does not have much to do with politics. Working with the customs department is not very good, because it can involve taking bribes from others. An occupation has much to do with God's testimony. Here is the need for one to pay a great price.</p><h2 class="head2">Offering Up Ourselves<br />and Our Occupations to God</h2><p>Our views have to be enlarged. A man cannot say on the one hand that he is learning to serve God, while holding on to money on the other hand. The Lord has no intention that we serve Him while engaging in some money-making occupation. I hope that we can offer up ourselves and our occupations to God for the accomplishment of His purpose.</p><h2 class="head2">The Long-term, Normal Way&mdash;<br />Providing for Those of One's Own Household<br />and Accepting the Arrangements<br />Made by the Church</h2><p>During the time of revival of a church, there are special measures taken. These special measures are different from the long-term measures. During the time of revival we have to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. But for the long run there is the need for the church to make some arrangements. At the time of revival Ananias could not keep back anything for himself. The minute he kept back anything, he was lying and sinning against the Holy Spirit (Acts 5:1-5). But in Paul's Epistles, we are told that a person has to provide for those of his own household and that we have to care for the widows who have no support (1 Tim. 5:8-16). For the long run we do not expect the church to do the same things as it does during the time of revival. During revivals we feel constrained to offer up everything. But during ordinary times we have to take care of our family. Particularly, we have to take care of the children when they are young.</p><p>The long-term way for the church to deal with money is different from the way it takes during the time of revival. During revivals we cannot quench the Holy Spirit. But for the long run the church has to make some arrangements. In the early churches there were arrangements. The brothers and sisters should also make their own arrangements before the Lord; they should save something for their own use, and they should set aside the rest as available funds. In this way, even the jobs of the brothers and sisters become something that is for the gospel. Everyone has to consider and reckon before God. Where there are burdens that individuals cannot take up, other brothers and sisters have to come in to help. The church should not bear all the burdens. For this reason, the saints' relatives should be taken care of first by the saints themselves.</p><h2 class="head2">The Whole Body Coordinating Together<br />for the Accomplishment of God's Will</h2><p>Our occupation must be such that we earn our wages through labor and through increasing the value of the goods. Today it is not a sin to receive much, but it is a sin to have excess. It is not wrong to take in much, but it is wrong to keep the excess. We have to simplify our own living, and we have to save money for others. Only those who have given to others know that indeed it is more blessed to give than to receive.</p><p>The increase in bank deposits is just the increase in zeros; it will not give you joy. Only those who save for God, who labor for God, and who increase the value of goods will have true joy in their hearts. If we will practice this, the whole of China will be won by us. Even the whole of Southeast Asia will be won by us. We can carry out our work under the best arrangements. During the past years there was not much coordination among the co-workers, and there was not much coordination among the brothers and sisters in their occupations. This is why we have not done well in both areas. Today the occupations of the working brothers and sisters have to be coordinated, and the work of the co-workers also has to be coordinated. If the coordination is solid and good, all the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs will become our true co-workers.</p><p>If the Lord comes back soon, we will all see Him. If the Lord delays His coming for another one or two hundred years, those coming after us will watch the way we conducted ourselves today. We believe that the Lord has set a straight path before us. Our conference this time has much to do with God's business, the church's work, and the whole counsel of God. This is not a question of individuals doing business or making money.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_071.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_073.html">Next</a> </body></html>
