   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE JUDGMENT OF CHRIST UPON THE DESOLATORS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 75 is concerned with the judgment of Christ upon the desolators.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some may wonder how with respect to this psalm I can speak of the judgment of Christ, since this psalm does not mention Christ or the Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The basis for my speaking here is the fact that, according to John 5:22, God has given all judgment to Christ the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, the very God who judges in Psalm 75 should be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ, as the second person of the Divine Trinity, is the One who will execute judgment upon all sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here Christ's judgment is upon the desolators.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. At the Time Appointed by Him</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ's judgment upon the desolators will be at the time appointed by Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"When I choose the appointed time,/It is I who judge with equity" v. 2 . The "I" must refer to Christ, the just Judge.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. Cutting Off the Uplifted Horns</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>of the Wicked to Vindicate</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That Exaltation Comes from Him in the North</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verses 4 through 10 the psalmist speaks of the cutting off of the uplifted horns of the wicked to vindicate that exaltation comes from Him in the north.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verses 6 and 7 say, "Neither from the east nor from the west,/And neither from the south, does exaltation come;/For God is the Judge:/He puts this one down and exalts that one."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here we see that exaltation comes from the north, where God dwells cf.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Isa 14:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For exaltation to come from the north means that it comes from God, who dwells in the north.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, this indicates that Christ is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Exaltation should not come from any direction other than where He dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, preeminence should be given to Him.</S>
