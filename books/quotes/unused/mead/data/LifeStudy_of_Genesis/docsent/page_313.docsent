   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A GLORIOUS INTERCESSION 2 A Glorious Intercession</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to another seed of the divine revelation sown in the book of Genesis the seed of intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the first seventeen chapters of Genesis, there is no record of any intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although we may suppose that Melchisedec was interceding behind the scene for Abraham, there is no record of this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first clear mention of intercession in the Bible is in Genesis 18, where we see that Abraham was the first intercessor.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This record of intercession is not simply a seed, for it contains a certain amount of development.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Genesis 18 we not only have a story of intercession but a clear revelation of the basic principles of intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Intercession is a great thing in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without it God's economy cannot be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The excellent ministry of Christ today as our kingly and divine High Priest is a ministry of intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Romans 8:34 and Hebrews 7:25 both tell us that Christ is interceding for us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since this matter of intercession is so important, we must devote an entire message to it, mainly considering the basic principles of intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>a According to God's Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first basic principle of intercession is that it must be according to God's revelation 18:17, 20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The only intercession that counts in the eyes of God is that which is according to His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that proper intercession is not initiated by us but by God in His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is clearly portrayed in Genesis 18.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Abraham did not wake up one morning concerned for Lot and then kneel down to pray to the One on the throne in heaven regarding him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No, while Abraham was sitting at his tent door to cool himself in the heat of the day, God came to him in the form of a mortal man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since God did not come to Abraham in His glory with His majesty, Abraham did not recognize at first that it was Jehovah God who was visiting him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, Abraham realized that this One was the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, Abraham was not terrified; he was very restful, conversing with God as with an intimate friend.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This conversation must have lasted for several hours, for it took time to prepare the meal and to eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When God and the two angels were about to leave, Abraham did not bid them good-bye but conducted them on their way, probably walking with them for a good distance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here we see that our God is not only a loving God but also a testing God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although He loves us and knows everything, He often tests us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He knows our heart, the innermost part of our being, but He often says nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By testing He draws out what is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What was God's purpose in coming to Abraham in Genesis 18?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He surely did not come for a meal; neither did He come to confirm His promise regarding Sarah's giving birth to a son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God came to Abraham because He was seeking an intercessor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On His throne in heaven, God had decided to execute His judgment on the wicked city of Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But God would never forget that one of His people, Lot, was in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Lot did not even realize that he had to be rescued from Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What could God do?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He had to find someone to intercede for Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God knew that there was no one on earth who was as concerned for Lot and who was so much with God as Abraham was.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, God came to Abraham for the purpose of finding an intercessor.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without an intercessor to intercede for His people, God cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has His divine principles.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One of them is that without intercession He cannot save anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The salvation of every Christian has been accomplished through intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God did not stay on His throne in heaven waiting for such intercession to occur.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, He came down to visit Abraham in the form of a mortal man so that Abraham might easily talk with Him and intercede for Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Genesis 18 Abraham did not pray to God or call on the name of God; he talked to God as with an intimate friend.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, the purpose of God's visit to Abraham in this chapter was that Abraham might take up the burden to intercede for Lot according to God's desire.</S>
