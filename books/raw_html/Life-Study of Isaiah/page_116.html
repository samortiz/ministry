<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. ISRAEL'S UNTRUTHFULNESS,<br>UNRIGHTEOUSNESS, OBSTINACY, AND TREACHERY</H2><P>In chapter forty-eight the prophet Isaiah uses certain extraordinary words to describe Israel. Israel makes mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth or in righteousness (v. 1). Verse 4 says that Israel is obstinate, and verse 8 indicates that Jehovah knew that Israel would deal treacherously. In verse 5 Jehovah says, "Therefore I declared them to you long ago; / Before things came to pass I let you hear; / Lest you should say, My idol has done them, / And my graven image and my molten image commanded them."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. JEHOVAH'S WISE CONSIDERATION<br>IN DEALING WITH ISRAEL</H2><P>Chapter forty-eight also reveals Jehovah's wise consideration in dealing with Israel. When He dealt with Israel, He exercised His wisdom. In verses 9 through 11 Jehovah says, "For My name's sake I will defer My anger,/And for the sake of My praise restrain it from you,/In order not to cut you off./Behold, I have refined you but not like silver;/I have tried you in the furnace of affliction./For My own sake, yes, for My own sake, I will do it,/For how can My name be profaned?/And I will not give My glory to another."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. JEHOVAH'S LOVE FOR CYRUS<br>AND HIS USING HIM TO DO HIS PLEASURE</H2><P>Another matter revealed in this chapter is Jehovah's love for Cyrus and His using him to do His pleasure, that is, to subdue Babylon and release the captives of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah Being the First and the Last</H2><P>In verses 12 and 13 Jehovah makes a declaration concerning Himself. He says, "I am He; I am the First,/I am also the Last./Indeed, My hand laid the foundation of the earth,/And My right hand spread out the heavens;/When I call to them,/They stand together."</P>
