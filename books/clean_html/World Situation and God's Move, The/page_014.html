<h2 class=head1>THE PRESERVATION OF AMERICA</h2><p>The continent of North America was created by God along with all the other continents. Yet it was concealed from the majority of mankind for thousands of years. God preserved it until His time was ripe. Then it was found by a new people, many of whom were God-loving and Bible-loving. These new, freethinking people founded a new nation. Surely these were not accidental events. Surely they did not happen without any meaning. The times have been appointed by God; the boundaries have been drawn by Him. The location of the United States, between two large oceans and in the temperate zone, is ideal. It is rich in natural resources.<p>We are here not by accident. Whether we were born here, or came here because of circumstances, our being here is by God’s sovereign arrangement. When I was young, my family had considerable contact with American missionaries. We were quite westernized. From my youth I loved America. But I had no thought of ever coming to this country. Nor did Brother Watchman Nee. Before 1950 none of us thought that our work would be in the Western World. We thought China was the field God had appointed to us. But God thought differently. He sovereignly brought the recovery to this country.<h2 class=head1>THE DECLINING QUALITY OF CHRISTIAN PUBLICATIONS</h2><p>Some thirty-two years have passed since the recovery first went to Taiwan and then spread to the United States and the rest of the Western World. I have been observing the Christian publications these years. In the Chinese-speaking world hardly one book of spiritual weight has come out during this period. How about in Europe and in America? It is difficult to name one book with light and spiritual weight that has come out, like the ones that were published in the previous century.<p>One day in 1936 we were at a brother’s house in Tientsin for lunch. Our work was being opposed, and Brother Nee was the target of their attack. At the dining table Brother Nee turned to me and said, “Witness, these people are opposing us, yet they still use our publications. I am going to stop our publications for a time. Let’s see what other Christian groups will produce.” And he did. In the years 1936 through 1938 there were nearly no publications by us. And in those few years no spiritual writings by others came out either.<h2 class=head1>THE SPREADING OF THE CENTRAL VISION</h2><p>According to the present development of the world situation, the Lord will further isolate Gog and Magog (Russia). The Middle East is still a problem, but I believe in time the situation there also will result in the increased isolation of Russia. Russia’s isolation will help the United States stay on top so that the world will be kept peaceful and free. For what? Not for the first century’s spread of the gospel. Not for the Sixteenth Century’s Reformation. Not for the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries’ Bible teaching and scriptural meetings. No! Rather, it is for the central vision of the Apostle Paul’s completing ministry.<p>It is my earnest expectation that many saints will be burdened for this. Many, I hope, would be ready for the Lord’s leading to go to other countries. Some may go to Athens, others to Jerusalem, others to Vienna and elsewhere, in order to spread the Lord’s up-to-date, ultimate move on this earth.<h2 class=head1>THE FOUR GOSPELS</h2><p>You will notice that the Scripture Reading at the beginning is from all four Gospels. Matthew says, “All authority has been given to Me.…Go therefore and disciple all the nations…” (28:18-19). Matthew is for the kingdom, to disciple people to be citizens of the heavenly kingdom. Mark says, “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature” (16:15). The gospel is to be preached to every creature. Luke says, “That repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations…” (24:47). Here the preaching is of repentance and forgiveness of sins in His name. The Gospel of John does not mention the preaching of the gospel. It says, “You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit” (15:16). It is not a matter of preaching, but a matter of living to produce some fruit!
