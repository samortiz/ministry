   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HIS TRAINEE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Chang Wu-chen, a leading co-worker on the island of Taiwan, was one of Watchman Nee's trainees.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The following is his testimony regarding Watchman Nee:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Saved through Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I first met Watchman Nee in Chefoo, Shantung province, in the summer of 1935.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I was then twenty-one years old.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I was raised in a Christian family and studied in a Christian school.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Though my mother's father had been a Free Methodist pastor, Christianity left me with a very poor impression, and I became an atheist.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God was merciful to me, however, and caused me to meet Watchman Nee and Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was through them that I received salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>My aunt, who was quite concerned for my salvation, found occasion to introduce me to Watchman Nee in Witness Lee's living room.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He began to preach the gospel to me, and we debated the matter of God's existence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He gave many reasons to prove God's existence, but I argued that since I could not see God, I could not believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then he asked, "Can you see everything with your eyes?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you deny the existence of something simply because you cannot see it?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, there are electrical waves and air in this room.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Can you deny their existence?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is not physical; God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You cannot contact God with your eyes; you must use your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you seek God with your spirit, you will find Him."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then I asked, "How do I contact God with my spirit?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His reply was, "Just speak to God from deep within, according to your need and inner sense."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I went home and began to pray according to his instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He answered my prayer and changed me from within.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The following Sunday I attended the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Witness Lee preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His words were so powerful that the Lord was able to conquer me, deliver me, and clearly save me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Helped through His Publications</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After being saved, I secretly consecrated myself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord was so dear and so precious to me that I was willing to give up the world and serve Him the rest of my life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then for twelve years I did not see Watchman Nee, but continued to receive much help through his spiritual publications.</S>
