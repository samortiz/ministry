   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PERFECTING TO EQUIP THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to go on from nourishing the new ones in the home meetings to perfecting the saints, to equipping them Eph 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these small group meetings, we need to teach the believers as a father 1 Thes 2:11 so that they can carry out the practical church life for the work of the New Testament ministry the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can bring three or four new families together to form a group.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The perfecting of the saints can take place in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 4:11-12 says that Christ, the Head, has given some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers for the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may have thought that the evangelists were just for the preaching of the gospel, but Ephesians 4 tells us that they are for the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The perfecting carried out in the small groups is by the way of fellowship, prayer, and mutual care.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can fellowship with the newly baptized ones to know their condition so that we can take care of their spiritual, physical, or financial situation and pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can also take about fifteen minutes to teach them the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we teach the truth to them for fifteen minutes a week, they will accumulate the proper knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We also have to help them to seek after the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In these meetings are fellowship, prayer, mutual care, the teaching of the truth, and the encouragement to seek after the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After six months of these kinds of meetings, the new ones will be equipped to carry out the practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, the practical church life is carried out in the small groups, not in a big congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The practical church life cannot be carried out with a big congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With the traditional church meetings in which one person speaks and the rest listen, general teaching can be released but no particular perfecting can be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For people to be productive in human society, they must receive some particular training, or perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In colleges, students study a particular major.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Others may go to trade schools to learn a particular trade.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the past, we mainly had general teaching without particular perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nearly every Lord s Day a message was given, but the teaching was too general.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By having the small groups, however, everything will be particular.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everyone in the small group meetings will be perfected to do what the gifted persons do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They will be perfected to go to preach the gospel to gain new ones, to take care of home meetings, and to take care of small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The twenty in one group may eventually become ten groups.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this way, the saints will be perfected and the church will be increasing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need the begetting through preaching the gospel, the nourishing of the new ones for remaining fruit, and the perfecting for the teaching, instructing, and educating of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This will afford us a very practical church life that is full of life, altogether organic.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such a church will grow fast not only in numbers but also in life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a church of one hundred saints doubles every year, this church can grow to one million within thirteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a thousand percent increase.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We had little increase in the past because we did not have the proper, scriptural practice.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now we need to rise up to take this organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to take this organic way, we need more prayer and even fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to have a thorough dealing with the Lord concerning our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must be living persons, right persons, and dealt with persons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then the power and the life will be with us, and all the riches of Christ will be our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Surely we will be living, strong, and full of the uplifted Christian virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This will make us prevailing in our service to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To visit people with the gospel, to have home meetings with the new ones, and to have small group meetings with them should be considered as a part of the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The unbelievers spend their leisure time on worldly entertainment and amusement, but the best entertainment and amusement is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to reconsider our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These crucial matters for the organic building up of the Body of Christ begetting, nourishing, and perfecting are not just the responsibility of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They are the duty of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we would devote two three-hour sessions a week to the Lord for the purpose of begetting, nourishing the new ones, and perfecting, equipping, the saints, we will see the positive results.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All of us will be able to bear two remaining fruit yearly.</S>
