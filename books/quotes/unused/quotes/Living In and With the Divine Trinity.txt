In this book we want to fellowship concerning the crucial matter of our experience and growth in the divine life
As believers in Christ, we have such a marvelous, wonderful, excellent life, the uncreated life of God Himself, the eternal life
If we are going to experience and grow in the divine life, we must be those who are living in and with the Divine Trinity
Even when we go to visit people, our burden is to bring the Triune God to them and share with them the Triune God
The book of Ephesians reveals the church, and the church revealed in Ephesians is composed of and expresses the Triune God
The Greek word for with in John 11 is pros and here this word is a preposition of motion implying living acting in union and communion with
The Wuest translation of the New Testament says that Christ was delivered up by the counsel of God 'in the council held by the Trinity'
In the divine nature there is no blood, but in the human nature there is blood; so the blood of Jesus is considered as the blood of God
Acts 20:28 says that God obtained the church 'through His own blood,' and 1 John 1:7 refers to the blood of Jesus, the Son of God
The death of Christ was not only the death of the man Jesus but also the death of the Son with the Father and by the Spirit
Acts 10:40 and 41 show us that, on the one hand, God raised this One on the third day; on the other hand, He rose from the dead
God our Savior saved us through the renewing of the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior
In the Christian life, the believers possess the Divine Trinity and should live in and with the Divine Trinity
In 2 Corinthians 1314 Paul said The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all
Corinthians 12:28 reveals that God has placed some in the church: firstly apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers
Acts 20:28 says that the Holy Spirit placed overseers in the church, and 9:31 says that the church went on in the comfort of the Holy Spirit
The vision of the Divine Trinity in eternity without ending can be seen in the last two chapters of the book of Revelation
In order for us to live in and with the Divine Trinity, we need to have a vision concerning the Divine Trinity
There was a council held by God in His divine person the Trinity in eternity past in order to make a decision which is His determined will
Dispensation refers to God's plan, and dispensing refers to the actual dispensing of God into His chosen and redeemed people
That means that God has seven plans, and these seven plans are seven different dealings of God with man in different periods of time
God's dispensation is His divine plan to dispense Himself with all His divine riches into His chosen and redeemed people
We may use an illustration of a person planning a trip to show the meaning of good pleasure will counsel purpose dispensation and mystery
Verse 5 says, 'Having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will'
Verse 9 says, 'Having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself'
It is in our spirit that we can see the divine revelation of God's good pleasure, which eventually became God's economy, God's eternal plan
In 1 Timothy 134 Paul urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently from Gods economy which is in faith
In the Lord's ministry, we are not teaching the saints to observe something, to keep something, or to do something
In eternity past God had the desire to dispense Himself into His chosen people to make them all the Body of His embodiment, Christ
Our physical body is an organism to match us and to complete us in order to express us in a full and adequate way
We go out to visit people with the gospel to gain more bottles for God, and we fill these bottles with God Himself
We need to be those who are one with God's heart to gain some new bottles, some new people, into whom He can dispense Himself
The New Jerusalem is actually a divine couple composed of the processed Triune God married to the transformed tripartite man
Such a mingled spirit is the means by which the New Testament revelation concerning God's economy is revealed to the apostles and prophets
Paul said in Ephesians that he had been commissioned to reveal, to make known, to bring to light, the mystery of God's economy
We need a revelation of the mystery of Christ , which is the church produced out of the unsearchable riches of Christ
When the New Jerusalem comes in the new heaven and the new earth, all things will be headed up in Christ through the church
The ministry we have must correspond with God's dispensing of Himself into His chosen people for the producing of the Body of Christ
Many believers in the province of Galatia had been distracted by the Judaizers from the New Testament faith to the Old Testament law
The Judaizers were those who were telling people that in addition to believing in Jesus, they still needed to keep the law
Galatians 3:1-2 says, 'O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed crucified?
The Spirit is the unique blessing of the New Testament gospel, the consummated Triune God dispensed into our being
Faith is related to the Spirit, trusting in the operation of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the realization of Christ
To keep the law by the flesh is man's natural way; it is in the darkness of man's concept, resulting in death and wretchedness
To receive the Spirit by faith is God's revealed way; it is in the light of God's revelation, issuing in life and glory
It is by the hearing of faith that we have received the Spirit that we may participate in God's promised blessing and live Christ
It altogether dispensationally belongs to the New Testament faith, which is the contents of the entire New Testament
The divine economy in faith must be made fully clear to the saints in the administration and shepherding of a local church
In the first two chapters, we saw the vision concerning the Divine Trinity and the vision concerning the economy of the Divine Trinity
God's dispensation, His economy, is His plan to dispense Himself as the rich supply to all of His chosen people
God is giving Himself, imparting Himself, distributing Himself, dispensing Himself, into His people for their enjoyment
The incarnation of the Divine Trinity is for the dispensing of Himself into us for our enjoyment and for our inheritance
John 3:16 says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him should have eternal life
John 4:9 says that God sent His Son, the only begotten, into the world that we might have life and live through Him
By sending His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin, God came to dispense Himself into us as the gift of eternal life
The brass serpent lifted up by Moses was in the likeness of a serpent, but within it there was not the poison of a serpent
John 6:40 says that the will of the Father is that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life
We can also see the dispensing of the Father in John 8:29, which says that He who sent the Son is with the Son
The natural thought is that the Father remained in the heavens when He sent the Son to us to be our food supply
The blood deals with sins, and the water is the flow of the divine life to quench our thirst and swallow up our death
When the Lord Jesus established His table, He gave the bread to the disciples and said, 'Take, eat; this is My body'
One day a week we come together to give a testimony to the entire universe with a declaration that this is the way we live
In John 6 the Lord compared Himself to the heavenly manna that was given to the children of Israel in ancient times
In the seven epistles in Revelation written by the Lord Jesus to His seven churches, Jesus is revealed as the hidden manna
In eternity future, we will be in the New Jerusalem enjoying Christ as our life supply, as the fruit of the tree of life
Even today when we are sick, we can exercise our faith to say, 'Lord, send Your Spirit from my spirit into my body to enliven it
When she asked the Lord to help her, He replied, 'It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs'
The holy land of Israel was the table on which Christ, the heavenly bread, came as a portion to the children of Israel
They threw Him off the table to the ground, the Gentile country, so that He became broken crumbs as a portion to the Gentiles
We want to see the portions in the New Testament revealing the Divine Trinity in the divine move and in our experience
The nature and essence of the divine blessing are of the Spirit, but the very element of this blessing is Christ Himself
When we say that Christ is the element of God's blessing, we are saying that Christ Himself is the divine blessing
Verses 7 through 12 of Ephesians 1 go on to reveal the Son's redemption for the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose
After the accomplishment of the Sons redemption the Spirit comes to apply what the Son has accomplished according to the Fathers selection
Now we can see that Ephesians 1:4-14 reveals that the Triune God has been wrought into us for the fulfillment of His eternal economy
In 1 Peter 1:2 the sanctification of the Spirit is first, and then the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ follows this sanctification
The Son is the good shepherd, the Holy Spirit is the seeking woman, and God the Father is the loving and receiving father
In Luke 15 the seeking woman lights a lamp, sweeps the house, and seeks carefully until she finds her lost coin
God the Father's being with us was the issue of the divine conception of the Holy Spirit and the birth of Jesus, the Son
In verse 6 the Lord said, 'I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me'
Verses 7 through 14 show the Father embodied in the Son seen among the believers the Son being the Father's embodiment among the believers
Now that we have the Spirit as the realization of the Son abiding in us, we also have the Father's embodiment and the Father as our object
The Father as our object is within us, because the object is embodied in the Son and the Son is realized as the Spirit who indwells us
The Father as the object, the Son as the embodiment, and the Spirit as the realization are in us, the container
Verses 21 and 23 show the Son manifesting Himself to His lover and the Father coming with Him to make an abode with the Son's lover
We need to be brought more and more into the manifestation of the Son to us, with the Father and the Son making an abode with us
When the electricity is switched on, there is a current of electricity, a moving of electricity, and that moving is the transmission
All things of the Father are Thine; All Thou art in Spirit is mine; The Spirit makes Thee real to me, That Thou experienced might be
Couldn't the Lord have said that He cast out demons by Himself in order that His own kingdom might come upon the people?
Now there was One, condemned by them and standing in front of them, telling them that He did something in a different way
Today in the church life, the Body of Christ has not been built up adequately because of the shortage of the proper coordination
If we want to be coordinated with all the members in the Body, we have to learn of Christ our Head, taking Him as our pattern
Christ offered Himself as one sacrifice to be the reality of all the various offerings to God in the Old Testament
He is the aggregate reality of all the offerings in the Old Testament as the unique offering to God in the New Testament
Now we need to ask whether the Spirit through which the Lord offered Himself was the essential Spirit or the economical Spirit
Whether the eternal Spirit here is essential or economical depends upon our definition of what the Lord is doing here
The issue of His offering is that His blood purifies our conscience from dead works that we may serve the living God, the Triune God
The move of the Divine Trinity as seen in Hebrews 9:14 and Matthew 12:28 is an excellent and beautiful example for us to follow
While He was on this earth as a slave He acted in a way of not trusting Himself and not doing anything by Himself to Himself or for Himself
In Matthew 2819 the Lord charged His disciples to baptize people into the name of the Divine Trinity the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit
For the Divine Trinity to be completed, to be consummated, He needed to go through a process to pick up humanity
The death of Christ is lovable and dear, and the Triune God needed it for His completion, for His consummation
The Divine Trinity is undoubtedly omnipotent, but if He were short of this beautiful death, He would not be able to solve our problems
After He had passed through the process of crucifixion, He entered into the realm of resurrection and became a life-giving Spirit
The Lord revealed this divine title in the context of His desire to put the people who have received our preaching into the Triune God
The disciples were to disciple the unbelieving nations by baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
God bears witness to the great salvation by signs and wonders and by various works of power and by distributions of the Holy Spirit
All the beauty, the excellency, the attributes, and the virtues found in the Godhead depend upon the divine Godhead being three yet one
In the corporate constitution of the Body of Christ, composed of millions of members, there is much beauty, excellency, and virtue
Suppose that in the church life there is a group of sisters and brothers who are serving and living in the reality of the Body of Christ
If there were thousands of saints on the earth living and serving in such a way, what beauty and excellency there would be!
In the church life in the Body life in the new man it is marvelous to see saints from every race and background meeting together in oneness
The Spirit enters into our heart to enlighten us, to search us, and to sweep away all the 'dirt' in order to find us, to gain us
When we tell the Lord that we love Him, the Lord would secretly impress us within to obey the Spirit and honor the Father
Ephesians 2:18 tells us that if we come to approach God our Father, our access must be through the redeeming Son and in the guiding Spirit
The divine revelation of the divine economy shows us the Divine Trinity in all His excellencies, beauties, and virtues
These verses speak of the kindness and love to man of our Savior God having appeared God the Father having saved us
Eventually, what God has given us is the complete, consummated, all-inclusive, compound, life-giving, indwelling, processed Spirit
Our God, the Father, has given us of this all-inclusive Spirit, who is the bountiful supply of Jesus Christ, the Son
His redemption obtained the sonship, and now His indwelling Spirit is bringing us into the reality of the sonship
We are the beneficiaries, receiving all the benefits of the operating One, the ministering One, and the gift-giving One
In Ephesians 1 Paul prayed that God would give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation that we might know Him and His economy
In chapter one his prayer is for our seeing the vision, but in chapter three his prayer is for our experience of the depths of Christ
The Father is the source, the Spirit is the means, the Son is the object, and the fullness of the Triune God is the issue
The source is the Father, the means is the Spirit, and the aim, the goal, is the Son because the Son is the center
Whatever the Triune God does is for the Son as the center, out of the Father as the source, and through the Spirit as the means
To the family of the faith, the Father is not only the source as the creating One, but also the source as the begetting One
Christ's making His home in the believers' hearts was actually initiated, not by the Triune God but by the apostle Paul
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the three 'parts' of this universal 'machine,' and the Body is the operator
The picture presented in Ephesians 3:14-19 again shows us the very beautiful, fine, and deep coordination of the Triune God
The Three coordinate together in a beautiful way so that Christ the embodiment of the Triune God can become fully settled in our inner being
We must believe that today Christ as the very embodiment of the Triune God is settling Himself in our inner being
We can apprehend with all the saints the dimensions of Christ the breadth and the length and the height and the depth
If a cup is filled up with water until it is overflowing with water, the overflow of the water is an expression
Because the believers' inward parts have been taken over, occupied, by the settling Christ, the Spirit can be the very essence of the Body
We need to be those giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God and the Father
We render our singing, our psalming to the Son, and we thank our Father in the name of the Son with the essence of the Spirit
Very few Christians realize that whenever we sing or speak a hymn, we are enjoying the Three of the Divine Trinity
The Son is the power and the strength for our fighting, the Father's armor is our covering, and the Spirit's sword is our offensive power
Again we see the Three working together for one goal to exalt the Son as the very embodiment of the Triune God
Peter 4:14 says, 'If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you'
When the believers of the Son are reproached, the Triune God is enjoying His rest by staying with them in their persecution
Corinthians 13:14 speaks of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , the love of God , and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit being with us all
In the second stage, the sanctification which we receive in God's full salvation is both positional and dispositional
Positional sanctification is mentioned in Hebrews 13:12 which says that Jesus sanctified us through His own blood
Once we are bought back by the Lord's blood, we are separated from the world, receiving a sanctified position and being made holy unto Him
Salvation in sanctification of the Spirit is the procedure, and the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son, is the goal
Jesus Christ as the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth, is God the Son
Out of the throne proceeds a river of water of life, and along the two sides of this river grows the tree of life
The water saturates and the tree supplies so that the entire city will live forever to express the Divine Trinity
In eternity past God appointed the Son to be His Christ, His Messiah, to carry out what God planned to do for His eternal purpose
The appointed Christ was in the water under an open heaven and was anointed by the Triune God with the economical Spirit
He was conceived with the essential Spirit for His birth in order for Him to be a God-man to exist on this earth
The receiving of the Spirit by the Son from the Father was the beginning of the operation of God's New Testament economy
God has given the Holy Spirit to us, and through this Holy Spirit God's love has been poured out in our hearts
Based upon this the Spirit was given to us, and through this Spirit given to us, the love of God has been poured out in our hearts
Now we enjoy the love of God through the Holy Spirit given to us on the foundation of the death of Christ for us, the ungodly
In His resurrection, the personal Christ, the individual Christ, was expanded, extended, increased, into the corporate Christ
After His resurrection, this personal Christ was expanded, extended, increased, to be the Body of Christ, the corporate Christ
The Head was anointed first, and the Body was anointed later, but these should not be considered as two anointings
Eventually, we must say that God has anointed 'the Christ,' the corporate Christ, to carry out His New Testament economy
In the entire universe there is only one anointing, and the anointing of the corporate Christ took place in two stages
All the Jewish believers were anointed on the day of Pentecost , and all the Gentile believers were anointed in the house of Cornelius
All of us believers were anointed to be the corporate Christ for the purpose of carrying out God's New Testament economy
As the corporate Christ, we are the partners of Christ, cooperating with Him to carry out God's New Testament economy
For His purpose, the Father has sealed us and given us the sealing Spirit as an inward pledge to guarantee that God is our inheritance
The shape, the form, comes into being, not by outward regulation, such as hammering, but by the inward growing with the life element
The growing of this divine life within us will shape us into a certain form that fits our coming transfiguration
Our new body will be our old body which has been transfigured with the divine element under the divine working
Presently, we are at home in the body and away from the Lord, the Son, until the day when He returns and we are raptured to meet Him
Eventually, this divine element, which is actually the Triune God Himself, will be our eternal dwelling place in our transfiguration
Eventually, the result of his work was to offer the nations to God as a sanctified entity through the Holy Spirit
Eventually, the believers become a letter to communicate the Son, and this letter is written with the Spirit as the ink
The entire New Testament speaks concerning the Divine Trinity with different expressions and from different angles
The Spirit testifies, His testifying is the Father's testimony, and the Father's testimony is concerning the Son
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are moving in this scene to carry out the eternal economy of the Triune God
He has the qualifications and the standing to open the scroll, to open the mystery of the universe, the mystery of God's economy
After we have received the gospel in the power of the Spirit and with the joy of the Spirit, we become imitators of the Lord
To abide in Christ is to live in the Divine Trinity, and to have Christ abiding in us is to live with the Divine Trinity
The truth concerning living in and with the Divine Trinity is greatly expounded in the Epistles, especially in those written by Paul
To see our living in and with the Divine Trinity, we have to know, to realize, and to apprehend our initial experience of the Divine Trinity
We have a foundation as a strong base for us to have a life of living in the Divine Trinity and with the Divine Trinity
When we go out to visit people to preach the gospel to them, this can be considered as a kind of calling to them
Due to the enlightening and searching of the Spirit depicted by this fine woman, the prodigal son in the following parable came to himself
Outside of the divine revelation of the Bible, there is no religion or philosophy that says that we can live in another person
The Greek word for 'abide' means not only to remain or to stay but also to have your home, or to make your home
The Lord told us that in His Father's house there were many abodes and that He would come to make an abode with His lovers
To live in Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God means that we take Christ as our dwelling place for our daily life
As long as the branches abide in the tree, they have their daily life in the tree because they are living there
The Lord is the One who possesses all things, who rules over all things, who exercises His sovereignty over all things and over all people
In the New Testament, the Son is the One who possesses the Father's life with the Father's nature to express the Father
We need to have the faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and we need to have the love to love all the brothers
We abide in God because we are keeping His commandments which charge us to believe in His Son and to love all the brothers of His Son
If we are going to enjoy a life of abiding in God, we must exercise our spirit, turn to our spirit, touch our spirit, and use our spirit
We abide in the Triune God by the person of the linking Spirit and according to the teaching of the anointing of the Triune God
In this divine paint are the element of the Father, the element of the Son, and the element of the eternal life
We have to abide in such a wonderful One, not only by the linking Spirit but also according to the teaching of the move of this ointment
When we are in the meetings of the church or of the ministry, we have a deep and clear sensation that something is moving within us
The sonship the fatherhood and the eternal life are compounded into the compound ointment which moves in us and that moving is the anointing
To abide in the Triune God is to dwell in the Triune God, to have our home in the Triune God, to live in the Triune God
The Lord was talking about Himself in the flesh, but in verse 63 He said, 'It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing'
We are now in the One who is in resurrection, and the One who is in resurrection, the pneumatic Christ as the life-giving Spirit, is in us
On the evening of the day of His resurrection, He came back to His disciples as the pneumatic Christ and breathed Himself into them
When He breathed into them, He told them to receive the holy breath, the Holy Spirit, the holy pneuma, which was just Himself
All of these divine secrets have been written down in the Bible, but very few throughout the centuries have seen them
Christ as the bread of life became a life-giving Spirit, and this life-giving Spirit has been embodied in the Word
The life-giving bread is the Spirit with the Word, and the Spirit with the Word is the very Christ in resurrection, the pneumatic Christ
We are not merely remaining in Him or staying in Him; we are living in Him and having our being in Him in the way that we live in a home
As we live in this living, organic One, His living Body is built up to express God and to fulfill God's eternal purpose
If we are going to live in the Divine Trinity, to abide in the Divine Trinity as our home, we must enjoy Christ as our food
The resurrected Christ as the disciples' life supply had been breathed into them, but Peter took the lead to go away from this life supply
The more we reject ourselves, our flesh, our old man, and the more we become nothing, the more the life within us will rise up'
When we reject ourselves, our natural man, our old man, this gives the indwelling, pneumatic Christ the opportunity to grow within us
On another occasion, Brother Nee gave a message telling us that the reality and essence of resurrection is the Spirit
Resurrection is the expression of life which has passed through death and has been tested, checked out, by death
The factor, the element, and the sphere of our living should be the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ as the bountiful supply
We can live in the Divine Trinity because the very embodiment of this Divine Trinity is in our spirit as the resurrection
Whenever we deny ourselves, renounce our soul, we enter into the full realization and experience of this resurrection
All of the spiritual things, especially Christ being resurrection within us, must be substantiated by our faith
As we hear the word, the good things concerning Christ, we see a vision, and this seeing produces an appreciation, a faith, within us
The closing verse of the book of Galatians says, 'The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers
Answer: Hymn 481 in Hymns is an excellent hymn on being identified with the Lord in His death and resurrection
We can see in Philippians 3 that Paul had Christ as life and that he lived by that life, yet he aspired to know more
The conformity to His death is the renouncing of ourselves, the denying of ourselves, the rejecting of ourselves
In order for this to happen, we have to cooperate with Him by putting every action, every deed, of our body to death
The final revelation of the entire Bible, in Revelation 22, is the eternal part of our living with the Triune God
On the two sides of this river grows the tree of life, yielding its fruit each month to be the food of God's redeemed for eternity
According to Revelation 22:5 we will not need the light of a lamp made by man or the light of the sun created by God
To live in the Divine Trinity is to abide in Christ, and to live with the Divine Trinity is to have Christ abide in us
In John 15:7 the Lord said, 'If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you'
If we do not have the word of Christ abiding in us, we may go out to reach people, but what we do will be in a poor way
If we are going to do a rich work, a work full of the riches of the Triune God, we must have the word of Christ abiding in us
When we talk to people we will not talk to them with our own opinion our own thought our own word our own expression or our own utterance
In chapter fifteen the Lord mentions His words abiding in us, and in chapter fourteen He speaks of the Spirit of reality abiding in us
When we have the words of Christ, the Spirit of reality, and the very God abiding in us, we surely have the Son and the Father abiding in us
When Peter and the other disciples went fishing, as recorded in John 21, they thought that they were absent from the Lord
When we love the Son, both the Father and the Son love us, and at the same time, the Son manifests Himself to us
In Galatians 2:20 he declared that he was crucified with Christ and that it was no longer he who lived, but Christ lived in him
Such a housing of the Spirit with the pneumatic Christ and the resurrecting God, gives life even to our mortal bodies
The Triune God is a housing factor to impart life into our entire tripartite being into our spirit, our mind, and our body
When we live with the Divine Trinity, we have the Spirit as the firstfruit, which means that we have the Spirit as our enjoyment
The law of the Spirit of life referred to by Paul in Romans 8 is not the law in letters but a natural principle
When the Triune God is moving within us, there is a spontaneous force, a spontaneous power, to carry out something
By Christ as our righteousness, we have been justified by God that we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life
By Christ as our sanctification we are being sanctified in our soul that is transformed in our mind emotion and will with His divine life
The unveiling Spirit reveals the depths of God to us through God's holy Word for our deep experience and deep enjoyment
We have to treasure the fact that our body is a holy temple, sanctified for the consummated Spirit of the Triune God
The relationship between us and God has arrived at such a marvelous state that we and God are one in the spirit
When we go out to visit people for the preaching of the gospel, they should be able to breathe in the fragrance of Christ
We are experiencing Him and enjoying Him as captives, as incense-bearers, as letters, as mirrors, and as vessels
Corinthians 5 goes on to show us that God has wrought us for our transfiguration with the Spirit as the pledge
Eventually, 2 Corinthians reveals that we need to express the virtues of Christ as meekness, forbearance, and truth
It means that we are humble, that we can give in to others, and that we are able to fit any situation and any circumstance with anybody
When God the Father comes to strengthen us, that strengthening will bring us back to our spirit, which is our very inner man
When we are weak, we are remaining in our outer man, in our flesh, in our self, in our natural man, and in our soul
Paul prayed to the Father, asking the Father to strengthen all the saints, who are weak in their outer man, into their inner man
He strengthens the weaker saints through the Spirit with power, and He does this strengthening according to the riches of His glory
In our heart there are four rooms the room of the mind, the room of the will, the room of the emotion, and the room of the conscience
We need to be those who love the Lord, who love His rooting, and who love His grounding that we may grow and be built up
We will love the rooting and the grounding and we will have the strength to apprehend the universal dimensions of Christ with all the saints
We need all the saints to apprehend the dimensions of the Lord Jesus the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth
We have been put into Christ, taking Christ as our clothing, and now Christ takes us as His dwelling by living in us
Philippians 2:13 says, 'For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure'
In order to see God's operating in us, it would be helpful for us to have a brief review of the book of Philippians
He uses a metaphor concerning a person being initiated into a secret society with instruction in its rudimentary principles
Chapter two gives us the overall thought, the all-embracing thought, the all-inclusive thought, of the book of Philippians
They like a big, outward display, but God's inward operating in us does not necessarily have such an outward display
The operating of the electricity in the building enables all the appliances, machines, and devices in the building to move and function
What matters is not whether we are good or bad according to our natural constitution, but the fact that we have received the operating God
To be justified by God is to be forgiven of our sins so that we can be delivered from God's condemnation out of the lake of fire
Both frustrate us from carrying out our salvation to the fullest extent, from experiencing and enjoying Christ to the uttermost
The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is 'the bountiful groceries,' and God's operating is 'God's cooking'
Paul said that he was magnifying Christ, as always, through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Our Christian life is a life of holding forth the word of life to present it to others as an offering, a contribution
Paul tells us to work out our own salvation, and then he mentions that we need to do all things without murmurings and reasonings
As we have pointed out, both murmurings and reasonings frustrate us from carrying out our salvation to the fullest extent
We need to carry out our salvation, to bring it to its ultimate conclusion, by our constant and absolute obedience with fear and trembling
No one is in a situation in which everything is complete, perfect, satisfactory, fine, and in the third heavens
We cannot reach or obtain this out-resurrection without the power of Christ's resurrection to conform us to the mold of His death
We need to let this virtue of forbearance be known to others, and this is to manifest the forbearance of Christ
We also need to express the virtue and praise of God in whatever is true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, and well-spoken of
We manifest forbearance and express the virtue and praise of God by the secret in taking Christ as our satisfaction
Vincent said that the word 'into' in Matthew 28:19 indicates that baptism brings us into a spiritual and mystical union with the Triune God
At the end of the New Testament in Revelation 22, a marvelous picture is presented, revealing the Triune God for our enjoyment
God's desire in Genesis 2 was for man to eat the tree of life, but man fell by eating the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Because of man's fall, Genesis 3 records that God closed the tree of life to man, keeping man away by His righteousness, holiness, and glory
He declared in Revelation 2 that if we would overcome according to His will, He would give us to eat of the tree of life
The way to the tree of life has been opened again for all the redeemed ones who are willing to overcome according to the Lord's demand
John 7:38 and 39 show clearly that the Spirit will be rivers of living water flowing out of our innermost being
We have been baptized into the Triune God who is to be our enjoyment, our food and our drink, that we may live by Him
To enjoy the Divine Trinity in full is to participate in the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
The love of God the Father is the source, and the grace of Christ, God the Son, is the course of the love of God
The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the transmission, the communication, of the grace of Christ with the love of God the Father
It depends upon the love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Spirit to flow as a current within our spirit
If the current within us is cut off while we are listening to the ministry of the word, our listening is empty
We need to pray in the Holy Spirit that we may touch the source, the love of God, in which we await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ
When we pray, call on the name of the Lord, and get into the Word, we enjoy the Triune God as our divine vitamins
We may not fully understand the Triune God, but we must learn to enjoy Him, to receive the full benefit of all His riches
Matthew 28:19, 2 Corinthians 13:14, Jude 20-21, and Revelation 1:4-5 reveal to us the enjoyment of the Triune God
The Son prayed that we would be perfected into one by having the Divine Trinity in us by living with the Divine Trinity
In order to keep the oneness, we need to reject, renounce, and deny anything that we have that is outside of the Triune God
Regardless of how much we are enjoying the Divine Trinity today, we are still not enjoying Him to the fullest extent
In eternity we all will be God's eternal priests, and God Himself will be our dwelling in whom we live and serve
Because of this revelation, we have the boldness to say that the holy city, the New Jerusalem, is not a material city, but a person
The holy city is a corporate person and this corporate person is a couple the processed Triune God married to the transformed tripartite man
The holy city as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in , and God and the Lamb as the temple are for us to dwell in
In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place for both God and man for eternity
The throne of God and of the Lamb is the center of the holy city for the divine administration and the source of the divine enjoyment to us
It is also the source of our divine, eternal enjoyment because the river with the tree of life comes out of the throne
We will serve the Triune God as His priests , and reign to the ages of the ages as the kings of the Triune God
The Triune God is our dwelling place, the Son is our food, the Spirit is our drink, and the redeeming God is our light
