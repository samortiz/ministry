   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GIVER, THE GIFT, AND THE ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 1:1 we see God and in John 1:14 the Word who is God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Son in His humanity is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In John 1:17 we see that grace came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Grace is the enjoyment of the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The giver was God, the gift was the Son, and the enjoyment is the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John 1:1, 14, and 17 unveil the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Father is the giver, the Son is the gift and the Spirit is the gift applied and enjoyed the grace Acts 2:38; 10:45; Heb 10:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 3:16 tells us that God gave His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This shows us God is the giver and the Son is the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 3:34 also tells us that the Son, who is the gift, gives the Spirit without measure.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The giver gives the gift, and the gift gives the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Also, in John 15:26 the Lord tells us that He will send the Comforter from with lit. the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Son sends the Spirit as the Comforter from with the Father, and the Comforter proceeds from with the Father to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this verse we see that the Father is the source as the giver and the Son as the gift is the second giver.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Comforter, the Spirit, is the One who is our enjoyment, and this enjoyment is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First Corinthians 1:2 refers to all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This simply means that this very Christ is yours and mine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you bought a house, you would like to tell your friends that it is yours.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps you would feel glorious that such a big house is actually yours.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Have you ever realized, however, that in the universe you have One that is yours?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ who is yours and who is mine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A little baby only cares for his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Babies do not care for mansions, cars, diamonds, or gold.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As long as a baby has his mother, everything is all right with him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It does not even matter that much to the baby where he is just as long as his mother is there with him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As Christians we need to be like the little babes who only care for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all need to say happily, triumphantly, and rejoicingly Jesus is mine!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all know the familiar hymn that says, Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine; Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The chorus of this hymn says, This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Savior all the day long Hymns, #308 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are not praising the Lord all the day long for a good house, for an expensive car, or for a heavenly mansion with golden streets and pearly gates.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are praising the Lord all the day long for the fact that Jesus is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are those who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is both theirs and ours.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To fully understand 1 Corinthians 1:2, you need John 1:1, 14, and 17, John 3:16 and 34, and John 15:26.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Also, 1 Corinthians 1:9 tells us that we have been called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Greek word for fellowship means joint participation, common participation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has called us into the participation in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We could even say that God has called us into the enjoyment of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 1 Corinthians 15:45 we see that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John 1:14 tells us who the last Adam is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Word which was God became flesh, and this flesh is the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The last Adam is the last Man in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This One who was the last Adam in the flesh became the enjoyment because He became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This Spirit is not the giver but the gift enjoyed the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God is the giver, the Son is the gift, and the Spirit is the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The basic problem among many of today s Christians is that they only have the giver and the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They do not experience the Spirit as their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We Christians may come together to worship God and to praise the Lord without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If this is the case, we worship in deadness and we pray, not in life but in death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As Christians we believe in Jesus Christ and we worship God, but we must ask ourselves whether or not we have tasted the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, cheesecake is wonderful but have you eaten it?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Have you tasted it and has it become your enjoyment?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you have never eaten it, you have the cheesecake in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All of us must see that we must come to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Son of God is not a separate Person from the Spirit; rather, the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Son is the embodiment of the Triune God and the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means that the Triune God has been consummated in this Spirit for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus we do not get the Son nor the Father directly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we call on the name of the Lord we get the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We all can testify that whenever we call O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>, we get the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whether we repent or we praise the principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may say, O Lord Jesus, I repent from my sins, or Lord Jesus, I praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The point is that whenever we call on Him we get the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Person of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If I call out a certain person s name, that person will come to me if he is real.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we call on the Lord Jesus, the Spirit comes because the Spirit is the Person of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even in 1 Corinthians we can see that God gave us Christ as our portion, and we have been called by God into the enjoyment of this Person.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The very enjoyment of this Person is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This Person was the last Adam and this last Adam eventually became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Oranges cannot be swallowed whole by a person.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The orange must first be sliced and then the slices are placed into the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When the mouth chews the slices they become orange juice to get into the person who is eating them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God may be considered as a big orange and Christ may be considered as the orange slices.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The juice is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The orange juice is the extract of the orange, and the extract of the orange is the spirit of the orange.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In like manner, the Spirit of God is the extract of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When we have the Father, it is like having a big orange.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When we believe in the Son, this is like having many orange slices which are still outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When we receive these slices into us as juice, we get the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is the experience of the Spirit which all of us must have.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The all-inclusive Christ as the portion of the saints Col 1:12 becomes our enjoyment as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have already seen that in the book of Hebrews God speaks in the Son and eventually, the actual speaker in the book of Hebrews is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Furthermore, there is another verse in Hebrews which is more excellent and wonderful than John 3:16 according to our experience this verse is Hebrews 6:4.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>John 3:16 tells us that God loved us and gave us His only begotten Son that we may have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is wonderful, but Hebrews 6:4 tells us that we have become partakers of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This verse does not tell us we are partakers of material blessings, such as good homes, high degrees, or high positions.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We, the believers, are the partakers of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Spirit is the totality, the sum total, the aggregate, the consummation, of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We all need to see that we have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, who is the totality of the Triune God!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>NOT INSULTING THE SPIRIT OF GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Hebrews 10:29 warns us not to insult the Spirit of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Ephesians 4:30 tells us not to grieve the Holy Spirit of God, which means to make Him unhappy by disobeying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>However, to insult, despise, put aside, ignore, or neglect the Spirit is more serious.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>None of us should do this.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We all need to experience the Spirit as the totality of the Triune God for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>LOVE, GRACE, AND FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In 1 Corinthians we saw that Christ is ours and that we have been called into the participation in this portion, who as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The conclusion to Paul s second Epistle to the Corinthians says, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Love, grace, and fellowship are altogether wrapped up with the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Love is the very source, the very substance or essence of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is just like cheese being the essence of cheesecake.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Love is the essence of the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The love is the essence of the grace, the grace becomes our enjoyment, and this enjoyment is the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Love is with the Father as the source, grace is with the Son as the course, and enjoyment is with the Spirit as the very consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>GRACE WITH OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Finally, Philemon 25 says, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This verse does not say that the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is with our strong mind, our strong will, or our fluctuating emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This verse proves that the grace of the Lord must be the Spirit because it is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship in spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Only our spirit can participate in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>For example, I am not able to enjoy cheesecake by looking or even by smelling.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Neither can I enjoy cheesecake by doing scientific research to find out the vitamins, the ingredients, and the elements for the cheesecake.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The only way to enjoy the cheesecake is to use my mouth to eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>In like manner, we need to use our spirit to enjoy the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>God is the giver, the Son is the gift, and the Spirit is the enjoyment in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>THE SPIRIT OF ENVY</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>James 4:5 says that the Spirit who dwells in us longs to envy.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>James mentions God s indwelling Spirit negatively concerning the abolishing of the friendship of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>This indwelling Spirit always envies when He sees us loving something other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>When you love the world or any material thing other than God, the indwelling Spirit envies.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>He longs to see you loving God absolutely just like a husband.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>When a husband sees his wife loving someone else other than him, this husband longs to envy.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>God as the indwelling Spirit is our Husband and He longs to envy when He sees that we love something, someone, or some matter other than Him.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>This requires us to deal with whatever we love other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>The word dwells in James 4:5 can also be translated makes His home.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>The indwelling Spirit makes His home in us that He may occupy our entire being cf.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Eph 3:17 for God, causing us to be wholly for our Husband.</S>
