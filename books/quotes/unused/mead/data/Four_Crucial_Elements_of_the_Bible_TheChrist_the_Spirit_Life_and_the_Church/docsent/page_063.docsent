   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION CONCERNING THE CHURCH The Relationship between Christ and the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church comes out of Christ, through the Spirit, and by life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, the church is a product of Christ, the Spirit, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First of all, we need to know the relationship between Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church is in Christ and comes out of Christ, as Eve came out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God created only Adam, but after Adam was created, God said that it was not good for the man to dwell alone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that God Himself felt a lack.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, God caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep and took a rib from his side to build it into a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This signifies that the church came out of the side of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Lord Jesus was crucified, His side was pierced and out came blood and water John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Blood is for redemption, to deal with sins for the purchasing of the church John 1:29; Heb 9:22; Acts 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Water is for imparting life, to deal with death for the producing of the church John 12:24; 3:14-15; Eph 5:26-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This proves that the church comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Second, the church is of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since the church is out of Christ, it is also of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Out of denotes the source, whereas of denotes the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The essence of Eve was the same as that of Adam; there was no difference in essence because Eve was of Adam, being built with a rib of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, Eve was not only out of Adam but also of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In like manner, the church is not only out of Christ but also of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The essence of the church is nothing other than Christ Himself Col 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Third, the church is joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The union of the church with Christ is not only like the joining of a wife to a husband, but even more like the union of a body with a head.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even though a couple may be joined, they are still somewhat separate, but a head and a body cannot be divided because once they are divided, they are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that the union of the church with Christ is an organic union, not an organizational association.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A table is made up of pieces of wood joined together; this is organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, a head and a body are joined together not organizationally, but organically.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Fourth, the church is based upon Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus said that He would build His church upon "this rock" Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This rock refers to Christ and also to the revelation concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that Christ is the foundation of the church and that the church takes Christ as its starting point.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is the unique foundation of the church 1 Cor 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church is out of Christ, of Christ, joined to Christ, and based upon Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Relationship between the Church and the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We also need to see the relationship between the church and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to the Bible, the church is first baptized in the Spirit into one Body 1 Cor 12:13 ; second, the church is given to drink the Spirit; third, the church lives in the Spirit; and fourth, the church is for the manifestation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, the church is out of Christ, of Christ, joined to Christ, and based upon Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the other hand, the church is baptized in the Spirit into one Body and is given to drink this one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be baptized is to be immersed in the Spirit; to drink is to have the Spirit saturating us within.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the area around Nanking and Yangchow in China, there is a saying: "In the morning, the skin wraps the water; at night, the water wraps the skin."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When a person sits in the tea house in the morning drinking tea, that is the skin wrapping the water; when he goes to soak himself in a bath at night, that is the water wrapping the skin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the local people's secret to health.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For a Christian to be healthy, there is also the need to have "the skin wrapping the water" and "the water wrapping the skin."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First, it is the "water wrapping the skin," that is, to be baptized in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then, it is the "skin wrapping the water," that is, to drink the Holy Spirit moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this way, our living is in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once we live in spirit, the issue is that Christ is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is similar to what Revelation says concerning each golden lampstand having seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The seven lamps are the expression of the golden lampstand; this is the manifestation of the Spirit because the seven lamps are the seven Spirits Rev 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, the church is baptized in the Spirit, is given to drink the Spirit, lives in the Spirit, and is for the manifestation of the Spirit.</S>
