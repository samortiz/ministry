<h1 class="title">The Need for Christ as Our Unique Portion and Desire<br />
to Be Properly Appreciated and Exalted by Us</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 73; 80</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The intrinsic reason for the desolation of God&rsquo;s house was that Christ was not properly appreciated and exalted by God&rsquo;s people; they did not give Him the preeminence, the first place, in everything&mdash;Psa. 74:1-11; 2 Chron. 36:19; Col. 1:18; Rev. 2:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Their failure to give Christ the preeminence and to honor and exalt Him was the cause of their becoming sinful and evil&mdash;Jer. 2:13.</li>
	<li>The desolation of the church as the house of God always issues from the negligence of the experience of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 1:9-13, 23-24, 30; cf. 3 John 9.</li>
	<li>The real revival in the church depends upon everyone in the church life giving Christ the first place in everything&mdash;Psa. 73:25; 80:15, 17; cf. Hab. 3:2; Hosea 6:1-3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To give the Lord the first place in all things is to love Him with the first love, the best love, regarding Him as everything in our life&mdash;Rev. 2:4; Col. 1:18; 3:11.</li>
		<li>We must not love anyone or anything above the Lord, including our soul-life&mdash;Matt. 10:37-39; Rev. 12:11.</li>
		<li>We love the Lord because He first loved us, infusing His loving essence into us and generating within us the love with which we love Him&mdash;1 John 4:19, 7-8, 16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ&rsquo;s love of affection constrains us to live and to die to Him&mdash;2 Cor. 5:14-15; Rom. 14:7-9.</li>
			<li>Christ&rsquo;s love makes the believers martyrs for Him&mdash;Rev. 2:10; 12:11; Rom. 8:35-37.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We love the Lord according to the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity as love&mdash;5:5; 8:39, 35; 15:30.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The enjoyment of God in the house and city of God can be maintained and preserved only when Christ is properly appreciated and exalted by God&rsquo;s people:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>An idol is anything within us that we love more than the Lord and that replaces the Lord in our life&mdash;Ezek. 14:3.</li>
		<li>Any thing, matter, or person that preoccupies us and keeps us from the full enjoyment of Christ is an idol&mdash;1 John 5:21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 73 is on the sufferings of the seeking saints and unveils God, Christ, as our unique portion and desire&mdash;1 Cor. 1:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Psalm 73:2-16 records the sufferings and puzzles of the God-seeking psalmist:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The psalmist was nearly stumbled by the situation concerning the prosperity of the wicked&mdash;vv. 2-3.</li>
		<li>The psalmist said that he had purified his heart in vain and that he had been plagued all day long&mdash;vv. 13-14.</li>
		<li>If the psalmist had spoken to others about his situation, they would have been stumbled&mdash;v. 15.</li>
		<li>The more the psalmist considered his situation, trying to understand it, the more he was troubled and perplexed&mdash;v. 16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Through the revelation given in the sanctuary of God, the psalmist obtained the solution to his troubling and perplexing situation&mdash;vv. 17-28:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The sanctuary of God is the place where we may obtain the revelation that we need&mdash;Lev. 24:2-4; Dan. 2:17-23; cf. 5:12, 14.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s sanctuary is in our spirit and in the church&mdash;1 Cor. 3:16; Eph. 2:22.</li>
		<li>We enter into the sanctuary of God by exercising our spirit and living in the church&mdash;1 Tim. 4:7; 3:15.</li>
		<li>Once we are in the sanctuary&mdash;in the spirit and in the church&mdash;we receive another view, a particular perception&mdash;Psa. 73:17-20:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Certain secrets in the Bible were not made known to us until we came into the twofold sanctuary&mdash;our spirit as the personal sanctuary and the church as the corporate sanctuary.</li>
			<li>God&rsquo;s way is made known in the sanctuary; when we exercise our spirit and live in the church, God&rsquo;s way becomes clear to us&mdash;77:13.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Psalm 73:25-26 is the revelation given in the sanctuary of God to the suffering and seeking saints:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;Whom do I have in heaven but You? / And besides You there is nothing I desire on earth&rdquo;&mdash;v. 25:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Verse 25 reveals that God&rsquo;s pure seeker would have God as his only possession in heaven and his unique desire on earth:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) God was the psalmist&rsquo;s unique goal; the psalmist did not care for anything except God and gaining Him.</li>
				<li>2) In this matter Paul was the same as the psalmist, counting all things as refuse in order to gain Christ&mdash;Phil. 3:8.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>The psalmist was pure in heart&mdash;Psa. 73:1:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) To be pure in heart is to have God as our one goal&mdash;Matt. 5:8.</li>
				<li>2) A pure heart is one that is set on nothing but God:
					<ol class="none">
					<li>a) God Himself is the reality; anything other than God is vanity.</li>
					<li>b) If we continue to seek something other than God, our heart is set on vanity.</li>
					<li>c) Only a seeker with a pure heart can say that he has nothing but God and desires nothing besides God.</li>
					</ol></li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>&ldquo;My flesh and my heart fail, / But God is the rock of my heart and my portion forever&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 73:26:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The psalmist realized that God was working to deprive him of all material things so that he might enjoy God in an absolute way:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Through the revelation given in the sanctuary, he learned why God does not allow the seeking saints to prosper as the worldly people do.</li>
				<li>2) God intends that nothing should distract us from the absolute enjoyment of Himself.</li>
				<li>3) God&rsquo;s intention with the seeking saints is to remove all material blessings and physical enjoyments so that they may find everything in God.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>When the psalmist went into the sanctuary of God, he received the revelation that nothing in heaven or on earth can be his enjoyment but God Himself, and he took God as his all&mdash;the rock of his heart and his portion forever&mdash;Deut. 32:4, 15, 18, 30-31; Psa. 18:2, 31, 46; 31:2-3; 61:2; 62:2, 6-7; 71:3; 78:35; 89:26; 92:15; 94:22; 95:1; Matt. 16:18; 1 Cor. 10:4; Eph. 3:17a; Col. 1:12; Eph. 3:8.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 80 reveals that restoration comes by exalting Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In verses 1 through 7 the psalmist prays that the Shepherd of Israel would give ear (v. 1); in both verses 3 and 7 he prays, &ldquo;O God, restore us; / And cause Your face to shine, and we will be saved.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>In verses 8 through 13 the psalmist speaks regarding God&rsquo;s dealing with Israel as His vine, which He brought out of Egypt and planted; whereas the vine once was flourishing, it eventually became desolate.</li>
	<li>In verses 14 through 19 the psalmist asks God to visit His vine (Israel) for the sake of Christ as the man of His right hand:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Son</em> in verse 15 refers to the Lord Jesus; when He became a man, He joined Himself to Israel&mdash;He is &ldquo;the son whom You have strengthened for Yourself&rdquo;&mdash;Hosea 11:1; Matt. 2:15.</li>
		<li>In Psalm 80:17 the psalmist goes on to say, &ldquo;Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand, / Upon the son of man whom You have strengthened for Yourself&rdquo;; this verse reveals that Christ is at the right hand of God, the highest place in the universe; the first place, the highest position, the preeminence, has been given to Christ&mdash;Mark 16:19; Acts 2:33; 5:31; Phil. 2:9-11.</li>
		<li>The way to be restored from desolation is to exalt Christ as the full solution to every problem&mdash;1 Cor. 1:9, 24, 30:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Whenever God&rsquo;s people do not give Christ the preeminence, the house of God, signifying the church, becomes desolate.</li>
			<li>Whenever God&rsquo;s people exalt Christ, giving Him the preeminence in every aspect of their living, there is restoration and revival&mdash;Psa. 80:18-19.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Christ is now at the right hand of God (Rom. 8:34; Col. 3:1; 1 Pet. 3:22), and whoever calls upon Him as such a One will be restored and revived (Acts 2:33, 21; Rom. 10:12-13).</li>
		<li>As regenerated people, we need to come together in the meetings of the church to exalt Christ by praising, singing, and shouting&mdash;1 Cor. 14:26:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Instead of being silent, we should exercise our spiritual birthright to exalt Christ.</li>
			<li>The more we exalt Christ, giving Him the preeminence in everything, the more we will be revived and restored.</li>
			</ol></li>

<h1 class="title">The Secret Revelation<br />
concerning the Enjoyment of Christ<br />
as the Incarnated Triune God, the God-man</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 84</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The deeper love and sweeter experience of the house of God in Psalm 84 come after the experience of God&rsquo;s dealing and stripping and are recovered by the experience of God as our unique portion and by Christ being given the unique position&mdash;vv. 1-12; 73:17, 25-26; 80:15, 17; Col. 1:17a, 18b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s purpose in dealing with His holy people is that they would be emptied of everything to receive only God as their gain and be rebuilt with the Divine Trinity to become the masterpiece of God, fulfilling God&rsquo;s eternal economy for His expression&mdash;Job 10:13; Eph. 3:9-11; 2:10.</li>
	<li>God is faithful to take away all our idols and to lead us into His economy for us to enjoy Christ so that He may have a recovery purely and wholly of the person of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 1:9; 1 John 5:21; cf. Jer. 2:13; Lam. 3:22-24.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The intrinsic content of Psalm 84 is the secret revelation concerning the enjoyment of Christ as the incarnated Triune God, the God-man&mdash;Col. 2:9; 1:12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The center of this secret revelation is the house of God (Psa. 84:4, 10a), typified by the tabernacle (Exo. 40:2-8) and by the temple (1 Kings 6:1-3; 8:3-11).</li>
	<li>Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9) is the fulfillment of the types of the tabernacle and the temple:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This fulfillment commenced in His incarnation as the individual Christ (John 1:14; 2:21) and will continue (1 Tim. 3:15-16) until it consummates in the New Jerusalem as the corporate Christ, the great God-man (Rev. 21:2-3, 22).</li>
		<li>The New Testament, from Matthew through Revelation, covers the entire span of the incarnation of the Triune God and is a record of the divine incarnation.</li>
		<li>The enjoyment of Christ as the incarnated Triune God in God&rsquo;s house is portrayed by the arrangement of the tabernacle and its furnishings (<a href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/9780736361057_tabernacle.jpg">see diagram</a>).</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The psalmist&rsquo;s longing and even fainting to be in God&rsquo;s tabernacles indicates to what extent the psalmist loved God&rsquo;s tabernacles; this love was matured through many trials&mdash;Psa. 84:2.</li>
<li>&ldquo;At Your two altars even the sparrow has found a home; / And the swallow, a nest for herself, / Where she may lay her young, / O Jehovah of hosts, my King and my God&rdquo;&mdash;v. 3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The two altars&mdash;the bronze altar for the sacrifices and the golden altar of incense&mdash;signify the leading consummations of the work of the incarnated Triune God, who is Christ as the embodiment of God for His increase&mdash;Exo. 40:5-6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>At the bronze altar, a type of the cross of Christ, our problems before God are solved through the crucified Christ as the sacrifices; this qualifies us to enter into the tabernacle, a type of Christ as the incarnated and enterable Triune God, and to contact God at the incense altar (the bronze altar for the sacrifices is related to God&rsquo;s judicial redemption accomplished by Christ in His earthly ministry)&mdash;Rom. 5:10a; 8:3; Heb. 9:14; 7:27; 10:10.</li>
		<li>At the golden altar of incense in front of the Holy of Holies (9:4), the resurrected Christ in His ascension is the incense for us to be accepted by God in peace; through our prayer at the incense altar we enter into the Holy of Holies&mdash;our spirit&mdash;where we experience Christ as the Ark of the Testimony with its contents (the golden altar of incense is related to God&rsquo;s organic salvation carried out by Christ in His heavenly ministry)&mdash;Rom. 8:34; Heb. 7:25; 9:24; 10:19.</li>
		<li>Through such an experience of Christ we are incorporated into the tabernacle, the incarnated Triune God, to become a part of the corporate Christ (1 Cor. 12:12) as God&rsquo;s testimony for His manifestation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Through these two altars God&rsquo;s redeemed, the &ldquo;sparrows&rdquo; and &ldquo;swallows,&rdquo; can find a nest as their refuge and a home with God in rest&mdash;cf. Psa. 90:1; 91:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The cross of Christ, typified by the bronze altar, is our &ldquo;nest,&rdquo; our refuge, where we are saved from our troubles and where we &ldquo;lay&rdquo; our young, that is, produce new believers through the preaching of the gospel.</li>
		<li>When we experience the resurrected Christ in His ascension, typified by the golden altar of incense, we are accepted by God in such a Christ and find a home, a place of rest, in the house of God.</li>
		<li>This house is the processed and consummated Triune God united, mingled, and incorporated with all His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed elect (John 14:1-23) to be the Body of Christ in the present age and the New Jerusalem as the mutual dwelling place of God and His redeemed in eternity (Rev. 21:3, 22).</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Blessed are those who dwell in Your house; / They will yet be praising You. Selah... / O Jehovah of hosts, blessed is the man / Who trusts in You&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 84:4, 12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In type, the house is the church as a totality (1 Tim. 3:15), and the tabernacles (Psa. 84:1) are the local churches (Rev. 1:11).</li>
	<li>Praising the Lord should be our living, and our church life should be a life of praising&mdash;Psa. 22:3; 50:23; 1 Thes. 5:16-19; Phil. 4:4, 11-13.</li>
	<li>In the church life we trust in God, not in ourselves or in our natural human ability to work out a solution to our difficult situations&mdash;2 Cor. 1:8-9, 12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Blessed is the man whose strength is in You, / In whose heart are the highways to Zion&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 84:5; cf. Phil. 4:13; John 15:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The highways to Zion signify our intention to enter into the church as the house of God and are the blessed highways for seeking the incarnated Triune God in His consummations, typified by the furniture in the tabernacle&mdash;Heb. 10:19-22.</li>
	<li>On the one hand, we have entered into God; on the other hand, we are still on the highways to enter into God.</li>
	<li>That the highways to Zion are in our heart means that we need to take the way of the church internally, not merely externally; when we are deeply in the inner life, we will certainly be in the way of the church; the highways to Zion will be within our heart&mdash;cf. 1 John 1:3-4.</li>
	<li>Zion is the very spot where God is, the Holy of Holies; the overcomers become Zion, and the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to build up Zion&mdash;Rev. 21:16; cf. Exo. 26:2-8; 1 Kings 6:20; Rev. 2:7.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Passing through the valley of Baca, / They make it a spring; / Indeed the early rain covers it with blessings&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 84:6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Baca</em> means &ldquo;weeping&rdquo;; on the one hand, those on the highways to Zion are strengthened in God (v. 5); on the other hand, they are opposed by Satan, who causes them to suffer persecution.</li>
	<li>The trouble and persecution caused by Satan can make the highways a valley of weeping; this special term indicates that the psalmist had been disciplined by God and had been stripped by Him.</li>
	<li>The highways to Zion are not external, superficial, or cheap; we must pay a price to take the way of the church&mdash;Phil. 3:7-8; Matt. 25:9; Rev. 3:18; Acts 20:19, 31; Psa. 56:8.</li>
	<li>When we pass through the valley of Baca, God makes this valley a spring (cf. Col. 1:24; Heb. 10:34); this spring is the Spirit (John 4:14; 7:38-39).</li>
	<li>The more we weep on the highways to Zion, the more we receive the Spirit; while we are weeping, we are being filled with the Spirit, and the Spirit becomes our spring.</li>
	<li>Those who come into the church life by passing through the valley of weeping find that this weeping eventually becomes a great blessing to them; this blessing is the Spirit.</li>
	<li>The tears they shed are their own, but these tears issue in a spring, which becomes the early rain, the Spirit as the blessing&mdash;Zech. 10:1; Gal. 3:14; Eph. 1:3.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;They go from strength to strength; / Each appears before God in Zion... / For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand; / I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God / Than dwell in the tents of the wicked. / For Jehovah God is a sun and a shield; / Jehovah gives grace and glory&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 84:7, 10-11a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The more we go on in the church life, the more strength we will gain&mdash;cf. Prov. 4:18; 2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
	<li>If our service is intrinsically according to God&rsquo;s will in the church life, each day will be worth many days in God&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;Joel 2:25a.</li>
	<li>The blessings of our dwelling in the house of God are our enjoyment of the incarnated and consummated Triune God as our sun to supply us with life (John 1:4; 8:12), as our shield to protect us from God&rsquo;s enemy (Eph. 6:11-17), as grace for our inward enjoyment (John 1:14, 17), and as glory for the outward manifestation of God in splendor (Rev. 21:11, 23).</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 87; 2:6; 48:1-2</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Psalm 87 reveals that God&rsquo;s heart is set on Zion, the city of God, with Christ within it&mdash;vv. 2-3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Zion is central in God&rsquo;s heart&mdash;2:6; 48:1-2; 50:2; 99:2; 132:13; 135:21.</li>
	<li>Restoration, salvation, and release from sufferings are the desires of the saints, but God&rsquo;s desire is for Zion with His Christ&mdash;85:4; 86:2; 88:1-3; 87:2-3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Salvation is not for ourselves&mdash;salvation is for God&rsquo;s purpose and economy.</li>
		<li>God saves people for His Christ, for His house, and for Zion, the city of God, in order that one day He might gain the entire earth through Christ with His overcomers&mdash; 51:18; Eph. 2:4-6, 8, 10, 21-22; Rev. 11:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;His foundation is in the holy mountains&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 87:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This divine foundation, typifying Christ as God&rsquo;s unique foundation for the building up of His house, the church, is built in the &ldquo;holy mountains,&rdquo; which typify the local churches&mdash;1 Cor. 3:11.</li>
	<li>As the Christ and the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus is the unique foundation laid by God for His building&mdash;Matt. 16:16, 18; 1 Cor. 3:11.</li>
	<li>According to Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Corinthians 3, Christ is a living foundation, a foundation that grows:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God gives the growth, and to give growth is a matter of growing Christ; the Christ who grows within us is a living, growing foundation&mdash;vv. 6-7, 11.</li>
		<li>The foundation grows in us, and this growth produces gold, silver, and precious stones for the building up of the church&mdash;v. 12a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As Christ, the unique foundation, holds and supports God&rsquo;s building, He dispenses Himself into every part of the building, imparting His element into all the believers&mdash;Col. 2:19.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Jehovah loves the gates of Zion&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 87:2a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Gates are for coming in and going out, signifying fellowship&mdash;1 Cor. 1:9.</li>
	<li>Fellowship is related to oneness; fellowship brings all the members of the Body of Christ into oneness&mdash;10:16-17; Eph. 4:3-6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The fellowship among the churches is the fellowship of the body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 10:16.</li>
		<li>Fellowship is the reality of living in the Body of Christ&mdash;12:12-13, 27.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The fact that the New Jerusalem has twelve gates indicates that God&rsquo;s holy city will be full of fellowship&mdash;Rev. 21:12, 21.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Glorious things are spoken of you, / O city of God&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 87:3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Zion</em> is a poetic title of the church in both the universal sense and the local sense&mdash;v. 2.</li>
	<li>Zion was the city of King David (2 Sam. 5:7), the center of the city of Jerusalem as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Zion within Jerusalem typifies the body of overcomers, the perfected and matured God-men, within the church as the heavenly Jerusalem&mdash;Heb. 12:22; Rev. 14:1-5.</li>
		<li>As the highlight and beauty of the holy city Jerusalem, Zion typifies the overcomers as the high peak, the center, the uplifting, the strengthening, the enriching, the beauty, and the reality of the church&mdash;Psa. 48:1-2, 11-12; 50:2; 20:2; 53:6a; 87:2.</li>
		<li>The overcomers as Zion are the reality of the Body of Christ and consummate the building up of the Body in the local churches to bring in the consummated holy city, New Jerusalem, the Holy of Holies as God&rsquo;s dwelling place, in eternity&mdash;Rev. 21:1-3, 16, 22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>For the Lord to do good in His good pleasure unto Zion is for Him to build up the church, fill the church with His glory, and grant the church His rich presence with Himself as joy, peace, life, light, security, and every spiritual blessing&mdash;Psa. 51:18; cf. Eph. 1:3.</li>
	<li>Although the Lord has the right, the title, to the earth, today the earth is usurped by His enemy; yet on this usurped earth there is the mountain of Jehovah, Mount Zion, which is absolutely open to the Lord and absolutely possessed by Him&mdash;Psa. 24:1-3, 7-10; 2:6; 87:3.</li>
	<li>In the new heaven and new earth the entire New Jerusalem will become Zion, with all the believers as overcomers&mdash;Rev. 14:1; 21:1-2, 16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;But of Zion it will be said, / This one and that one were born in her, / And the Most High Himself will establish her. / Jehovah will count / When He records the peoples: / This One was born there&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 87:5-6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In verses 5 and 6 God&rsquo;s intention is to make a contrast, a comparison, of all other places with Zion.</li>
	<li>Psalm 87 unveils Christ with all the saints to be God&rsquo;s house for God&rsquo;s city and for God to gain the whole earth&mdash;27:4; 36:8-9; 48:1-2; 72:8.</li>
	<li><em>This One</em> in 87:6 and <em>this one</em> and <em>that one</em> in verse 5 indicate that Christ Himself and all the saints were born in the heavenly Zion&mdash;Matt. 1:20; Gal. 4:26-31; Heb. 12:22-23a.</li>
	<li><em>This One</em> is the unique One, Christ, who is the totality of all the saints (Psa. 87:5) as the One who is all the saints and in all the saints&mdash;Col. 3:11.</li>

		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ was born as the Firstborn, and we were regenerated as His many brothers, the many sons of God; hence, that birth in resurrection was a corporate birth&mdash;the birth of the firstborn Son and His many brothers&mdash;Rom. 8:29; Heb. 1:6; 2:10-11.</li>
		<li>The birth of a new corporate child comprising Christ and His believers was the birth of the new man&mdash;Col. 3:10:

<h1 class="title">The Highest and Fullest Experience of God&mdash;<br />
Taking God as Our Habitation,<br />
Our Eternal Dwelling Place</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 90&mdash;92</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>To take God as our habitation, our eternal dwelling place, is the highest and fullest experience of God&mdash;Psa. 90:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Psalm 36:8 speaks of eating the fatness of God&rsquo;s house and drinking the river of God&rsquo;s pleasures, indicating that we can experience the Lord by eating and drinking Him&mdash;cf. John 6:48-58, 63; 7:37; 1 Cor. 10:3-4; 12:13.</li>
	<li>According to Moses, the giver of the law and the writer of Psalm 90, we can also dwell in the eternal Triune God as our Lord&mdash;v. 1; 91:9; Deut. 33:27; cf. John 15:4; 1 John 4:15-16; Rev. 21:22.</li>
	<li>To dwell in God is to have our living in God (Col. 2:6; 3:3; 1 John 4:16), taking Him as our everything; this is deeper than eating and drinking Him.</li>
	<li>Book Four of the Psalms (Psa. 90&mdash;106) unveils the saints&rsquo; deeper experience of God in the identification with Christ, and it unveils God&rsquo;s recovery of His title and right over the earth:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This indicates that our experience of dwelling in God paves the way for Christ to come to possess the earth so that God may recover His title (ownership) and right over the earth.</li>
		<li>Without the saints&rsquo; deeper experience of God, God has no way to recover this title and right.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;The days of our years are seventy years, / Or, if because of strength, eighty years; / But their pride is labor and sorrow, / For it is soon gone, and we fly away&rdquo;&mdash;90:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we take God as our dwelling place, we will realize that the span of our life on earth is brief and full of sins and afflictions&mdash;vv. 3-11.</li>
		<li>We need to dwell in God, living in Him every minute, for outside of Him there are sins and afflictions&mdash;v. 8; John 16:33.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 91 concerns the saints&rsquo; identification with Christ in His taking God as His dwelling place&mdash;v. 9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In their identification with Christ, the saints make Jehovah the Most High their habitation, dwelling in His secret place and abiding in His shadow under His wings&mdash;vv. 1-9.</li>
	<li>This is the genuine oneness with God; here, we are constituted with Him, and we and God live together as one.</li>
	<li><em>You</em> and <em>Your</em> in verses 9 through 13 refer to Christ, as proven by the fact that verses 11 and 12 of this psalm are quoted by Satan in Matthew 4:6 in reference to Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This indicates that in Psalm 91 it is Christ who takes God as His habitation, His dwelling place.</li>
		<li>Thus, not only Moses took God as his dwelling place (90:1), but even the Lord Jesus, while He was on earth, took God the Father as His habitation.</li>
		<li>Moses, the lawgiver, and Christ, the grace-giver, were the same in taking God as their dwelling place, as their habitation.</li>
		<li>Thus, the saints (represented by Moses) and Christ are identified as one.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To be identified with Christ is to be identified with Him not only in His death, in His resurrection, and in His ascension but also in His taking God as His habitation.</li>
	<li>If we would be identified with Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension, we need to abide in Christ (John 15:4), and to abide in Christ is not only to remain in Him but also to dwell in Him, taking Him as our everything:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We abide in Christ according to the teaching of the anointing inwardly and according to the walk of the Lord outwardly&mdash;1 John 2:27, 6.</li>
		<li>In order to abide in Christ, we must keep God&rsquo;s commandments, God&rsquo;s charges to us, and be those who are submissive to God&mdash;3:24.</li>
		<li>To abide in Christ, taking Him as our dwelling place, and to allow Him to abide in us, taking us as His dwelling place, are to live in the reality of the universal incorporation of the processed and consummated Triune God with the redeemed and regenerated believers&mdash;John 14:2, 10-11, 17, 20, 23:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate incorporation of the processed and consummated Triune God with the regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite church&mdash;Rev. 21:3, 22.</li>
			<li>The New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God, and the center of the tabernacle is Christ as the hidden manna; the way to be incorporated into this universal, divine-human incorporation, the mutual abode of God and man, is to eat Christ as the hidden manna&mdash;v. 3; Exo. 16:32-34; Heb. 9:4; Rev. 2:17.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We abide in Christ so that He may abide in us by dealing with the constant word in the Scriptures, which is outside of us, and the present word as the Spirit, which is within us&mdash;John 5:39-40; 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6; Rev. 2:7:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>By the outward, written word we have the explanation, definition, and expression of the mysterious Lord, and by the inward, living word we have the experience of the abiding Christ and the presence of the practical Lord&mdash;Eph. 5:26; 6:17-18.</li>
			<li>If we abide in the Lord&rsquo;s constant and written word, His instant and living words will abide in us&mdash;John 8:31; 15:7; 1 John 2:14.</li>
			<li>We abide in Him and His words abide in us so that we may speak in Him and He may speak in us for the building of God into man and of man into God&mdash;John 15:7; 2 Cor. 2:17; 13:3; 1 Cor. 14:4b.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>If we abide in Christ by loving Him, by always rejoicing, by unceasingly praying, and by giving thanks in everything, He will abide in us to dispense His riches into us&mdash;John 14:23; 1 Thes. 5:16-18; John 15:4.</li>
		<li>If we abide in Christ, we will bear much fruit to glorify God&mdash;v. 8.</li>
		<li>If we abide in Christ, when He is manifested, we will boldly meet Him and not be put to shame and depart from His glorious presence&mdash;1 John 2:28; cf. Matt. 25:30.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li><em>He, Him,</em> and <em>His</em> in Psalm 91:14-16 refer to Christ; these verses are a prophecy concerning Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ loved God the Father (John 14:31); He has been set on high, exalted to the highest place in the heavens (Phil. 2:9-11); and He is now seeing God&rsquo;s salvation in the extension of His days in resurrection (Psa. 91:16; Rev. 1:18a).</li>
		<li>In all these matters we should be identified with Christ; then we will live with Him and love God; thus, we will be exalted, and we will see God&rsquo;s salvation in the extension of our days.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 92 shows the issue of the deeper experience of God in the saints&rsquo; identification with Christ in taking God as their dwelling place:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first issue is that the saints rejoice in the great works of Jehovah (vv. 1-9); when we dwell in God, taking Him as our habitation, we see His great works in the accomplishing of His economy and rejoice in them.</li>
	<li>Before we dwell in God as our habitation, we may be low and frequently defeated; a further issue of our dwelling in God is that our horn (fighting strength) is exalted over our spiritual enemies&mdash;v. 10; Eph. 6:10-13.</li>
	<li>Another issue of our dwelling in God as our habitation is our being mingled with fresh oil, which signifies the consummated Spirit, who is fresh and present&mdash;cf. Exo. 30:23-25.</li>
	<li>Still another issue of our dwelling in God, taking Him as everything in our living in His house, is that we are securely planted in His house and flourish in the riches of His divine life to such an extent that we bear fruit even in old age&mdash;Psa. 92:12-14.</li>

			<li>In Psalm 102:7 Christ is likened to a lone sparrow on a housetop, referring to the flat roof of a Jewish house, where people would often go to pray&mdash;Acts 10:9.</li>
			<li>This indicates that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, probably there were times when in the night He, like a lone bird on a housetop, would watch and pray, caring not for His own interest but for the interest of God and of God&rsquo;s house&mdash;Matt. 14:23; Luke 6:12.</li>

		<li>Because of His eternal and unchanging existence in His resurrection, Christ is the key that turns the earth to the Lord&mdash;Psa. 102:12-27; Rev. 1:18; Heb. 13:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The product of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection is the church, typified by Zion with God&rsquo;s house and God&rsquo;s city&mdash;Psa. 102:13-16, 21; Heb. 12:22-23:

		<li>The rebuilding of the devastated church, typified by the rebuilding of Zion, will turn all the nations to the Lord, and the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of God and of Christ&mdash;v. 16; Rev. 11:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>It is in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, by Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, and through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection that the church continues its existence&mdash;Psa. 102:21-28; Matt. 16:18; Eph. 1:19-23; 2:6:

		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This word, which concerns Christ in His ascension, has been quoted directly more than twenty times in the New Testament and has been quoted indirectly approximately another twenty times&mdash;cf. Matt. 22:44; Mark 12:36; 16:19; Luke 20:42-43; Acts 2:33-35; Rom. 8:34; Heb. 1:13.</li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus quoted this verse to reveal His divinity as the Lord of David&mdash;Matt. 22:41-46.</li>
		<li>The highest place in the universe is at the right hand of God&mdash;cf. Ezek. 47:1.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s ascension to the right hand of God is not merely a matter of His being in a place but of His being in a person, the Father; in His ascension Christ entered into the Father&rsquo;s being and sat down there&mdash;Heb. 1:3b; John 16:28.</li>
		<li>This word about Christ&rsquo;s sitting at the right hand of God implies Christ&rsquo;s kingship&mdash;Psa. 80:17; Col. 1:17a, 18b; Rev. 22:1; Ezek. 1:22, 26; cf. Isa. 14:13; 3 John 9; 1 John 5:21.</li>

		<li>Christ is on the throne, but He is still in need of a footstool:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God is endeavoring to subdue all of Christ&rsquo;s enemies and to make them His footstool.</li>
			<li>Our fighting today is for the subduing of Christ&rsquo;s enemies&mdash;Rom. 5:17, 21.</li>

	<li>God will send forth from Zion the scepter of Christ&rsquo;s strength to rule over all the nations at His return&mdash;Psa. 110:2.</li>

<li>We need to cooperate with Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry in the day of His warfare by presenting ourselves as freewill offerings to the Lord in the splendor of consecration and by being His young men who are to Him like the dew from the womb of the dawn&mdash;v. 3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the eyes of the Lord our willing consecration, our offering ourselves to Him, is a matter of splendor:

		<li>Although the church has become degraded, throughout the centuries there has been a line of those who have offered themselves willingly to the Lord in the splendor, the beauty, of their consecration.</li>
		<li><em>Splendor</em> may also be translated &ldquo;adornment&rdquo;; the splendor of consecration is an adornment; if we offer ourselves willingly to the Lord, we will be beautified with a divine, heavenly splendor.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Here Christ likens Himself to a plant that needs the watering of the mild, soft, gentle dew:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As Christ is on the way to carry out God&rsquo;s economy, He needs to be watered; Christ is watered by those who offer themselves willingly to Him.</li>
		<li>Whoever volunteers himself to Christ as an offering is a young man likened to the dew conceived in the womb of the dawn for watering Christ.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In order to cooperate with Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry in the day of His warfare, we need to have an absolute and thorough consecration to the Lord of our whole being with everything that we have for the accomplishment of His eternal economy; the fullness of one&rsquo;s experience of life depends on the fullness of one&rsquo;s experience of consecration&mdash;Matt. 26:6-13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The basis of consecration is God&rsquo;s purchase&mdash;1 Cor. 6:19-20; Rom. 14:8.</li>
		<li>The motive of consecration is God&rsquo;s love&mdash;2 Cor. 5:14-15; Rom. 12:1.</li>
		<li>The meaning of consecration is to be a sacrifice&mdash;v. 1; Num. 28:2-3.</li>
		<li>The purpose of consecration is to let God work in us so that we might work for God&mdash;Eph. 2:10; Isa. 64:8; Phil. 2:12-13; 1 Cor. 15:10.</li>
		<li>The result of consecration is to abandon our future&mdash;Lev. 1:9; cf. 6:10-13.</li>

	<li>In order to cooperate with Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry in the day of His warfare, we need to live a life of the altar and the tent, keeping ourselves empty, open, fresh, living, and young with the Lord for His new move&mdash;Gen. 12:7-8:

		<li>We need to be emptied and unloaded in our spirit, in the depth of our being, so that we may receive Christ as the reality of the kingdom of the heavens&mdash;Matt. 5:3; Luke 1:53.</li>

		<li>We need to receive the Spirit as the fresh oil&mdash;Zech. 4:12-14; Matt. 25:8-9; Rev. 3:18.</li>
		<li>We need to walk in newness of life and serve in newness of spirit&mdash;Rom. 6:4; 7:6; cf. Ezek. 36:26-27; 2 Cor. 3:16; Matt. 5:8; 26:29.</li>
		<li>We need to be vitalized by the Lord to be the living and functioning members of His Body&mdash;1 Cor. 14:4b, 31; cf. Rev. 3:1; 14:4.</li>
		<li>We need to be renewed day by day with the fresh supply of the resurrection life to stay young in the Lord&mdash;2 Cor. 4:16; Eph. 5:26-27.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In order to cooperate with Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry in the day of His warfare, we need to fight for the brothers in oneness with Him to cherish the churches in His humanity and nourish the churches in His divinity to produce the overcomers through His organic shepherding&mdash;Gen. 14:13-20; Rev. 1:13; 2:7; 1 Pet. 5:4; Heb. 13:20; 1 John 5:16; cf. Acts 6:4; Rev. 1:20.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God has sworn and will not change in ordaining Christ a Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek&mdash;Psa. 110:4; Heb. 5:6, 10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is not only the King with power and authority (Psa. 110:1-2) but also the High Priest&mdash;Heb. 2:17; 4:14; 6:20; 8:1; 9:11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry in His ascension includes both His kingship and His priesthood&mdash;7:1-2; Zech. 6:13.</li>
		<li>As the King, He has the scepter to rule over the earth and to manage our affairs, and as the High Priest, He is interceding for us and taking care of our case before God&mdash;Heb. 4:14-16; 7:25-26; 9:24; Rom. 8:34; Rev. 1:12-13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the kingly High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, Christ ministers God into us as our supply to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose&mdash;Heb. 7:1-2; 8:1-2; Gen. 14:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In His earthly ministry Christ was a High Priest according to the order of Aaron for the putting away of sin&mdash;Heb. 9:14, 26.</li>
		<li>Then, in His heavenly ministry Christ was designated a High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek (5:6, 10), not to offer sacrifices for sin but to minister to us the very God who was processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, signified by the bread and the wine (Matt. 26:26-28), as our life supply so that we may be saved to the uttermost (Heb. 7:25).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the High Priest, Christ cherishes the churches in His humanity and nourishes them in His divinity with His divine love&mdash;Rev. 1:12-13; 2:1.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ, who is the Lord <em>(Adonai)</em> and who is at God&rsquo;s right hand, will shatter kings in the day of His anger at His coming back with His overcomers and will execute judgment among the nations over a great land&mdash;Psa. 110:5-6; Dan. 2:34-35, 44; Joel 3:11-12; Rev. 17:14:

	<li>He will come with His bride, a composition of all His overcomers, as His army, and with her He will fight against and defeat Antichrist and his armies&mdash;19:11-21.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ will drink from the brook by the way and will lift up His head triumphantly&mdash;Psa. 110:7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The brook signifies the overcomers; as Christ is taking the lead to fight through to the end, He will need water to drink, and this water will be the overcomers.</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s lifting up His head is a sign of His victory, His triumph, in overcoming all the enemies.</li>
	<li>To the enemies Christ is the Victor, but to us He is the Drinker.</li>
	<li>In this psalm we see Christ as the King, the Priest, the Warrior, the Victor, and the Drinker (the Coming One).</li>

		<li>In Ephesians 2:20 we see Christ as the cornerstone that joins together the two walls, one wall being the Jewish believers, and the other, the Gentile believers.</li>
		<li>Christ as the cornerstone is for the building up of the church in the New Testament age&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:20-22; 1 Pet. 2:5:

	<li>&ldquo;This is the day that Jehovah has made; / Let us exult and rejoice in it&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 118:24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This day is the day of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection; on the day of His resurrection the Lord Jesus was made the cornerstone by God&mdash;Acts 4:10-12.</li>
		<li>Christ was chosen by God in eternity past to be the cornerstone for God&rsquo;s spiritual building&mdash;1 Pet. 1:20; 2:4.</li>
		<li>However, the Jewish leaders as the builders rejected Christ to the uttermost, to such an extent that they put Him on the cross&mdash;Matt. 21:38-42a.</li>
		<li>God chose Christ as the cornerstone a second time in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, thereby confirming His initial choosing of Christ in eternity past&mdash;Acts 4:10-12.</li>
		<li>After God resurrected Christ, God uplifted Him to the heavens in His ascension&mdash;Luke 24:51; Acts 1:9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ&rsquo;s ascension to Zion in the heavens was a further confirmation that God had chosen Him to be the cornerstone&mdash;Rev. 14:1; Isa. 28:16; 1 Pet. 2:6.</li>

	<li>As the all-inclusive stone, Christ is the centrality of God&rsquo;s move for the building up of His eternal habitation&mdash;Matt. 21:42, 44; Zech. 3:9; 4:7; cf. Rev. 5:6; Acts 4:10-12; Isa. 28:16; Eph. 2:20-22; 1 Pet. 2:4-8; Dan. 2:34-35; Rev. 21:11; cf. 4:3:

	<li>The Lord said that He would build His church, but the religious ones rejected Him as the cornerstone for God&rsquo;s building, and thus they could not be a part of the building of God&mdash;16:18; 21:42.</li>
	<li>As revealed in the Gospel of Matthew, the Father&rsquo;s will is to build up the church with Christ as the rock and the cornerstone&mdash;6:10; 7:21; 12:50:

<h1 class="title">The Functions and Blessings<br />
of God&rsquo;s Law as His Living Word to His Loving Seekers</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 119</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>In Psalm 119 Christ is the reality of the law:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is the reality of the law as the testimony of God, the expression of God; the testimony of God signifies Christ, the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9), as the living portrait of what God is.</li>
	<li>Christ is the reality of the law as the word of God, signifying Christ as the living Word of God breathed out by Him&mdash;Rev. 19:13b; 2 Tim. 3:16-17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The written words are the letters, but the living Word is the Spirit, who is the reality of the letters&mdash;John 6:63; Eph. 6:17.</li>
		<li>The law is the person of Christ, and the person of Christ is the Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17.</li>
		<li>The Spirit is the reality of whatever God is (John 16:13; 1 John 5:6); hence, as the Spirit, Christ is the reality of the law.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>There are two aspects of the law&mdash;the aspect of the letter and the aspect of the Spirit as the reality of God&rsquo;s blessings&mdash;2 Cor. 3:6; Eph. 1:3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If our attitude in coming to the law is to care for the commandments in letters, we will have the law in the aspect of the killing letter.</li>
	<li>However, if we take every part of the law&mdash;all the commandments, ordinances, statutes, precepts, and judgments&mdash;as the word breathed out by the God whom we love, we will have the law in the aspect of the life-giving Spirit.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>There are two aspects of the function of the law:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The law has a negative aspect:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As God&rsquo;s commandments, the law exposes man&rsquo;s sin and subdues sinners before God&mdash;Rom. 7:7b; 3:19-20; 5:20a; 4:15b.</li>
		<li>As God&rsquo;s regulations with statutes, ordinances, and rituals, the law functioned to guard God&rsquo;s chosen people in its custody that they might be conducted to Christ&mdash;Gal. 3:23-24.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The law has a positive aspect:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As God&rsquo;s living word, the law functions to minister the living God to His seekers&mdash;Psa. 119:2, 88.</li>
		<li>As God&rsquo;s living word, the law functions to dispense God Himself as life and light into those who love the law&mdash;vv. 25, 50, 107, 116, 130, 154.</li>
		<li>As God&rsquo;s living word, the law functions to restore man&rsquo;s soul and make man&rsquo;s heart joyous&mdash;19:7-8.</li>
		<li>As God&rsquo;s living word, the law functions to bring us salvation&mdash;119:41, 170.</li>
		<li>As God&rsquo;s living word, the law functions to strengthen (v. 28), comfort (v. 76), and nourish us (v. 103).</li>
		<li>As God&rsquo;s living word, the law functions to uphold us, keep us safe, and cause us to hope&mdash;vv. 116-117, 49.</li>
		<li>As God&rsquo;s living word, the law causes us to enjoy God as our portion&mdash;v. 57.</li>
		<li>As God&rsquo;s living word, the law causes us to enjoy God&rsquo;s countenance (v. 58) and the shining of His face (v. 135).</li>
		<li>As God&rsquo;s living word, the law causes us to enjoy God as our hiding place and shield (v. 114) and also enjoy God&rsquo;s help and well-dealing (vv. 175, 65).</li>
		<li>As God&rsquo;s living word, the law functions to make us wise and give us understanding&mdash;vv. 98-99.</li>
		<li>As God&rsquo;s living word, the law functions to give us proper discernment and knowledge&mdash;v. 66.</li>
		<li>As God&rsquo;s living word, the law functions to keep us from sinning and from every evil way&mdash;vv. 11, 101.</li>
		<li>As God&rsquo;s living word, the law keeps us from stumbling (v. 165), establishes our footsteps, and causes us to overcome iniquity (v. 133).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Whether in our experience the law is positive or negative depends on the condition of our heart in receiving the law:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we love God, humble ourselves, and regard the law as His living word through which we contact Him and abide in Him, the law will become a channel through which the divine life and substance are conveyed to us for our supply and nourishment; being infused with God&rsquo;s substance through the law as God&rsquo;s word, we will become one with God in life, nature, and expression and will spontaneously live a life that expresses God and corresponds to His law&mdash;Rom. 8:4; Phil. 1:21a.</li>
		<li>However, if in coming to the law we do not seek God in love but rather separate the law from the living God as the source of life, the law, which was intended to result in life but cannot give life of itself, will become a condemning and killing element to us&mdash;Exo. 19:8; John 5:39-40; Rom. 7:10-11; Gal. 3:21; 2 Cor. 3:6-7, 9; cf. Exo. 23:19b and footnote 2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>There are two kinds of people in relation to the law:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first kind is the letter-keepers, illustrated by the Judaizers and Saul of Tarsus&mdash;Phil. 3:6b, 2.</li>
	<li>The second kind is the God-seekers, illustrated by the psalmists, especially by the writer of Psalm 119, and by the apostle Paul&mdash;2 Cor. 3:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>They seek God with all their heart&mdash;Psa. 119:2.</li>
		<li>They love God&rsquo;s name and remember it&mdash;vv. 132, 55.</li>
		<li>They entreat God&rsquo;s face&mdash;v. 58.</li>
		<li>They ask for God&rsquo;s face to shine on them&mdash;v. 135.</li>
		<li>They walk in God&rsquo;s presence&mdash;v. 168.</li>
		<li>They consider God&rsquo;s law to be God&rsquo;s word&mdash;vv. 17-18, 28-29.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s word is sweeter than honey to their mouth&mdash;v. 103.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s word is more precious than fine gold to them&mdash;v. 127.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s word is a lamp to their feet and a light to their path&mdash;vv. 105, 130.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 119 expresses the attitude of God&rsquo;s loving seekers toward God&rsquo;s law as His living word:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>They choose God&rsquo;s word&mdash;vv. 30, 173.</li>
	<li>They believe God&rsquo;s word&mdash;v. 66.</li>
	<li>They lift up their hand to God&rsquo;s word, indicating that they receive the word of God warmly and gladly and say Amen to it&mdash;v. 48a; Neh. 8:5-6.</li>
	<li>They love God&rsquo;s word&mdash;Psa. 119:47-48, 97, 113, 119, 127, 140, 159, 163, 165, 167.</li>
	<li>They delight in God&rsquo;s word&mdash;vv. 16, 24, 35, 47, 70, 77, 92, 174.</li>
	<li>They taste God&rsquo;s word&mdash;v. 103.</li>

	<li>They sing God&rsquo;s word&mdash;v. 54.</li>
	<li>They regard God&rsquo;s word&mdash;vv. 6, 117.</li>
	<li>They have a perfect heart in God&rsquo;s word&mdash;v. 80.</li>
	<li>They incline their heart to God&rsquo;s word&mdash;vv. 36, 112.</li>
	<li>They seek God&rsquo;s word (vv. 45, 94), long for it (vv. 20, 40, 131), and hope in it with prayer (vv. 43, 74, 114, 147).</li>
	<li>They trust in God&rsquo;s word&mdash;v. 42.</li>
	<li>They muse on God&rsquo;s word&mdash;vv. 15, 23, 48, 78, 99, 148:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Rich in meaning, the Hebrew word for <em>muse</em> implies to worship, to converse with oneself, and to speak aloud; to muse on the word is to taste and enjoy it through careful considering.</li>
		<li>Prayer, speaking to oneself, and praising the Lord may also be included in musing on the word; to muse on the word of God is to enjoy His word as His breath (2 Tim. 3:16) and thus to be infused with God, to breathe God in, and to receive spiritual nourishment.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>They consider God&rsquo;s word&mdash;Psa. 119:95b.</li>
	<li>They esteem God&rsquo;s word to be right in all things&mdash;v. 128a.</li>
	<li>They learn God&rsquo;s word&mdash;vv. 73, 71.</li>
	<li>They treasure God&rsquo;s word&mdash;vv. 14, 162, 72, 127, 111.</li>
	<li>They treasure up God&rsquo;s word in their heart&mdash;v. 11.</li>
	<li>They remember God&rsquo;s word and do not forget it&mdash;vv. 52, 16b, 93.</li>
	<li>They stand in awe of God&rsquo;s word&mdash;vv. 161b, 120.</li>
	<li>They cling to God&rsquo;s word&mdash;v. 31.</li>
	<li>They do not forsake God&rsquo;s word, do not swerve from it, do not turn aside from it, and do not stray from it&mdash;vv. 87, 51, 157, 102, 110.</li>
	<li>They turn their feet toward God&rsquo;s word&mdash;v. 59.</li>
	<li>They keep, observe, and do God&rsquo;s word&mdash;vv. 33, 69.</li>
	<li>They walk in God&rsquo;s word and run the way of God&rsquo;s word&mdash;vv. 1, 32a.</li>

		<li>The church is the heavenly Jerusalem, and the overcomers are Zion as the high peak and the highlight&mdash;Heb. 12:22; Rev. 14:1.</li>
		<li>The church life is today&rsquo;s Jerusalem, and in the church there must be a group of overcomers; these overcomers are today&rsquo;s Zion.</li>
		<li>The overcomers are for the building up of the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5; Eph. 4:16; Rev. 3:12.</li>
		<li>The overcomers conquer the satanic chaos in the old creation and carry out the divine economy for the new creation&mdash;1 Tim. 1:4; Eph. 1:10; 3:9-10; 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15.</li>
		<li>The Lord needs the overcomers to carry out the economy of God to have a Body and to destroy His enemy&mdash;Eph. 1:10; 3:9-10; Rev. 12:11.</li>
		<li>Without the overcomers the Body of Christ cannot be built up, and unless the Body of Christ is built up, Christ cannot come back for His bride&mdash;Eph. 4:16; 5:23, 27, 32; Rev. 19:7-9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to build up Zion&mdash;14:1; Eph. 4:16; Rev. 21:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Zion is the reality of the Body of Christ consummating in the New Jerusalem, and in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today we must endeavor to reach this high peak&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 4:4-6, 16; Rev. 21:2.</li>
		<li>The highest peak in God&rsquo;s economy is Zion, the reality of the Body of Christ, and in the church life we need to reach this high peak&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5; 1 Cor. 1:2; 12:12-13, 27.</li>
		<li>The reality of the Body of Christ (Zion) is the corporate living of the perfected God-men, who are genuine men but live by the life of the processed and consummated Triune God, whose attributes are expressed through their virtues&mdash;Gal. 2:20; Phil. 3:10; 1:19-21a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the new heaven and new earth, the entire New Jerusalem will become Zion; the New Jerusalem, the eternal Mount Zion, will be the Holy of Holies, the place where God is&mdash;Rev. 21:1-2, 16, 22; cf. Ezek. 48:35.</li>
	<li>The only way to reach the high peak of Zion is by praying; in order to reach Zion by praying, we need to know the significance of prayer for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;1 Tim. 1:4; 2:8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Prayer is man breathing God, obtaining God, and being obtained by God; real prayer is an exhaling and inhaling before God, causing us and God to contact each other and to gain each other&mdash;1 Thes. 5:17.</li>
		<li>Prayer is man cooperating and co-working with God, allowing God to express Himself and His desire from within him and through him and thus accomplish His purpose&mdash;Rom. 8:26-27; James 5:17; Eph. 1:16-23; 3:14-21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the Psalms of Ascents&mdash;Psalms 120 through 134&mdash;we see the preciousness of Zion and Jerusalem to the saints; in all these psalms the house and the city are the center:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In Psalm 122 we see the saints&rsquo; love for the house of God in Jerusalem&mdash;v. 1.</li>
	<li>Psalm 125 speaks concerning Jehovah&rsquo;s surrounding of His people:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Those who trust in Jehovah are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved but abides forever; they love Mount Zion and liken themselves to Mount Zion&mdash;v. 1.</li>
		<li>As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so Jehovah surrounds His people from now and to eternity&mdash;v. 2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Psalm 127 reveals Jehovah&rsquo;s care for and blessing to His people; instead of laboring in ourselves, we should trust in God, for He will take care of us and He will bless us.</li>
	<li>Psalm 128 speaks of Jehovah&rsquo;s blessing to Israel from Zion; God always blesses people from Zion, that is, from the overcomers&mdash;v. 5; cf. Num. 6:23-27.</li>
	<li>In Psalm 131 a saint speaks about his humbled heart and quieted soul before Jehovah:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The psalmist has calmed and quieted his soul within him; he has been weaned, or stripped, of everything except the Lord&mdash;v. 2.</li>
		<li>When our heart is humbled and our soul is quiet, we are in a condition that is suitable for God to come in to rest&mdash;132:14:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In such a situation God can have a resting place, a dwelling&mdash;v. 14.</li>
			<li>Only when we are humble, calm, and quiet is the situation right for God to rise up, enter us, and take us as His resting place; this is Zion becoming God&rsquo;s habitation, His resting place, as revealed in Psalm 132.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 132 speaks concerning Jehovah&rsquo;s habitation and rest in Zion through David (typifying Christ) His anointed:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In verses 2 through 5 we see David&rsquo;s desire for the house of God.</li>
	<li>David wanted Jehovah to arise and enter with the Ark into His resting place in Zion; today this resting place is the overcomers in the churches&mdash;vv. 6-8.</li>
	<li>Verses 7 and 8 are figurative of the recovery of the church life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Ark was separated from the tabernacle; this signifies that Christ was with the church but that He has been separated from the church.</li>
		<li>Now is the time for us all to say, &ldquo;Arise, O Jehovah, unto Your resting place, / You and the Ark of Your strength&rdquo;&mdash;v. 8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Verses 14 through 18 are Jehovah&rsquo;s speaking concerning Zion; this is a picture of the top church life&mdash;the situation of the overcomers in Zion, the highest peak of God&rsquo;s mountain:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Psalm 132 mentions seven items related to the overcomers: resting in God, dwelling with God (v. 14), food for satisfaction (v. 15), glorious clothing (v. 16), the horn of victory (v. 17), the enlightening lamp (v. 17), and the shining crown (v. 18).</li>
		<li>These items portray the situation of the overcomers in Zion, the highest peak of God&rsquo;s mountain.</li>

<h1 class="title">Jehovah&rsquo;s Commanded Blessing of Life<br />
 on Brothers Who Dwell Together in Oneness</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 133&mdash;134</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Psalm 133 is the praise of a saint, in his going up to Zion, concerning Jehovah&rsquo;s commanded blessing of life on brothers who dwell together in oneness; the blessing that is commanded whenever brothers are united under the anointing is &ldquo;life forever,&rdquo; a full, free, unceasing stream of life:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The brothers&rsquo; dwelling together in oneness is likened to the inestimable goodness of the precious ointment on the head of Aaron and to the incalculable pleasantness of the dew of Hermon on the mountains of Zion&mdash;vv. 1-3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As a person typified by Aaron, the church as the one new man includes the Head with the Body as the corporate Christ, the corporate priesthood&mdash;Eph. 2:15; 1 Pet. 2:5.</li>
		<li>As a place typified by Zion, the church is the dwelling place of God&mdash;Deut. 12:5-7, 11, 14, 18, 21, 26; Eph. 2:21-22; Rev. 21:3, 22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The genuine all-inclusive oneness (the oneness of the all-inclusive Spirit) is constituted with the spreading ointment and the descending dew for the gradual building up of Christ&rsquo;s Body in the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Psalm 133 is equivalent to Ephesians 4; when we are in the Body and are diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit, we have the anointing of the all-inclusive Spirit (vv. 3-6); the anointing oil as the compound ointment is a type of the processed Triune God, the all-inclusive compound Spirit (Exo. 30:23-25):
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The compound Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God with the divine attributes, the human virtues, Christ&rsquo;s death with its effectiveness, and Christ&rsquo;s resurrection with its power&mdash;Phil. 1:19.</li>
			<li>We are in the oneness that is the processed Triune God anointed, or &ldquo;painted,&rdquo; into our being&mdash;2 Cor. 1:21-22; 1 John 2:20, 27.</li>
			<li>Day by day in the church life, all the ingredients of the divine and mystical compound ointment are being wrought into us; through the application of these ingredients to our inward being, we are spontaneously in the all-inclusive oneness&mdash;Eph. 4:3-4.</li>
			<li>The ground of oneness is simply the processed Triune God applied to our being; the anointing of the compound, all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is the element of our oneness&mdash;v. 4; cf. John 4:24:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) If we act apart from the Spirit, who is in our spirit, we are divisive and lose the oneness&mdash;Eph. 4:3; cf. 1 Cor. 1:10; 2:14-15; 3:1.</li>
				<li>2) If we stay in the life-giving Spirit, we keep the oneness of the Spirit&mdash;cf. John 4:24; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>The compound Spirit is not for those who are individualistic; He is in and for the Body and for the priestly service that builds up the Body&mdash;Psa. 133:2; Exo. 30:26-31; Phil. 1:19; Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The dew of Hermon descending on the mountains of Zion signifies the descending, refreshing, watering, and saturating grace of life (3:7), the Triune God as our life supply for our enjoyment (2 Cor. 13:14):
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In typology Hermon signifies the heavens, the highest place in the universe&mdash;cf. Eph. 1:3; Matt. 17:1-2.</li>
			<li>The mountains of Zion typify the local churches; there is one Zion, one church as one Body, but many mountains, many local churches&mdash;Rev. 1:11-12.</li>
			<li>Grace is God in Christ as the Spirit experienced, received, enjoyed, and gained by us&mdash;John 1:16-17; 1 Cor. 15:10; Gal. 2:20-21; Rom. 5:2, 17, 21.</li>
			<li>By remaining in the church life, we are preserved in the Lord&rsquo;s grace&mdash;Acts 4:33; 11:23.</li>
			<li>By the grace we receive on the mountains of Zion, we can live a life that is impossible for people in the world to live&mdash;20:32; 2 Cor. 12:7-9.</li>
			<li>The Christian living must be the living of grace, the experience of grace&mdash;1:12; 1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Tim. 4:22:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) We have faith and love through the Lord&rsquo;s superabounding grace&mdash;1 Tim. 1:14.</li>
				<li>2) By grace we receive the salvation in life through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension&mdash;Eph. 2:5-8.</li>
				<li>3) We have obtained access into and stand in God&rsquo;s abounding grace&mdash;Rom. 5:2.</li>
				<li>4) In this grace we can enjoy God&rsquo;s eternal comfort and good hope&mdash;2 Thes. 2:16.</li>
				<li>5) We can come forward with boldness to the throne of grace to find grace for timely help&mdash;Heb. 4:16; cf. Eph. 2:22.</li>
				<li>6) We can receive God&rsquo;s abounding supply of all grace&mdash;2 Cor. 9:8.</li>
				<li>7) We can constantly enjoy God&rsquo;s multiplying grace&mdash;1 Pet. 1:2b; 2 Pet. 1:2; Rev. 22:21.</li>
				<li>8) We can enjoy God&rsquo;s greater grace through humility&mdash;James 4:6; 1 Pet. 5:5.</li>
				<li>9) In our experience of the grace in God&rsquo;s economy, we enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence in our spirit&mdash;2 Tim. 4:22; cf. Luke 1:28, 30.</li>
				<li>10) We need to live out Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness by the grace of God&mdash;Gal. 2:20-21.</li>
				<li>11) We need to experience the perfecting of the Lord&rsquo;s sufficient grace, Christ&rsquo;s overshadowing power, in our weakness&mdash;2 Cor. 12:9.</li>
				<li>12) By grace we can overcome the usurpation of temporal and uncertain riches and become generous in ministering to the needy saints&mdash;8:1-2.</li>
				<li>13) The God of all grace perfects, establishes, strengthens, and grounds us through our sufferings&mdash;1 Pet. 5:10.</li>
				<li>14) We need to be good stewards of the varied grace of God&mdash;4:10; Eph. 3:2.</li>
				<li>15) Our word should convey Christ as grace to others&mdash;4:29-30.</li>
				<li>16) We need to experience Christ as grace to be a surpassing one and to labor abundantly for the Lord&mdash;1 Cor. 15:10.</li>
				<li>17) We need to receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness to reign in life&mdash;Rom. 5:17, 21.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>The grace given to the local churches in the dark age of the church&rsquo;s degradation is for the believers who seek to answer the Lord&rsquo;s calling to be His overcomers&mdash;Rev. 1:4.</li>
			<li>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ dispensed to His believers throughout the New Testament age consummates in the New Jerusalem as the consummation of God&rsquo;s good pleasure in joining and mingling Himself with man for His enlargement and eternal expression&mdash;22:21.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In the church life we are daily anointed and graced&mdash;Eph. 1:13, 6.</li>
		<li>The anointing of the Spirit and the supply of grace make it possible for us to live in oneness.</li>
		<li>The more we experience Christ as the life-giving Spirit, the more our natural constitution and disposition are reduced; as they are reduced through our experience of the Triune God with His divine attributes, we are perfected into one&mdash;John 17:23; Eph. 4:1-3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As the conclusion to Psalm 133 and as the last of the Songs of Ascents, Psalm 134 is the praise of a saint, in his going up to Zion, concerning the charge and the blessing of the children of Israel to the serving priests in the house of God:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Psalm 134 indicates that the highest people, those who are in Zion, can bless everyone and teach everyone&mdash;vv. 1-2; cf. Gen. 47:10; 48:20; 49:28.</li>
	<li>The blessing comes from Zion, from the highest peak, from the ones who have attained to the top, to the position of the overcomers&mdash;Psa. 134:3.</li>
	<li>In every age and century God&rsquo;s blessing has come to the church because of the overcomers&mdash;cf. Rev. 2:7; Num. 6:23-27.</li>

	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The spirit, the reality, the characteristic, of the divine revelation in the book of Psalms is Christ as the centrality and universality of the eternal economy of God&mdash;Luke 24:44.</li>
	<li>Christ is first the embodiment of the Triune God, then the house, the habitation of God (signified by the temple), the kingdom of God (signified by the city of Jerusalem), and the Ruler of the entire earth from the house of God and in the kingdom of God&mdash;Psa. 2:6-8; 36:8-9; 46:4; 48:1-2; 72:8, 19.</li>
	<li>God desires to have an organic habitation on earth, and this habitation is the aggregate of the saints gained by God through the terminating death and germinating resurrection of the all-inclusive Christ&mdash;22:22; 26:8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The saints will be the eternal manifestation and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God, and He will be everything to them in His all-inclusive Christ&mdash;Rev. 21:2, 11, 23.</li>
		<li>The Triune God will reign on the earth through such an organism in the new universe&mdash;11:15; 22:1-5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God created a corporate man to express Himself with His image and to represent Him by exercising His dominion over all the earth&mdash;Gen. 1:26-28:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s intention in giving man dominion is to subdue God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan, who rebelled against God; to recover the earth, which was usurped by Satan; and to exercise God&rsquo;s authority over the earth in order that the kingdom of God may come to the earth, the will of God may be done on the earth, and the glory of God may be manifested on the earth&mdash;Matt. 6:10, 13b; Rev. 11:15.</li>
	<li>Man is especially related to the earth, and the area where God desires man to rule is the earth; God needs man to recover the earth from the usurping hand of Satan, causing Satan to suffer loss on the earth&mdash;Gen. 1:26-28; Psa. 8:1.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s intention that man would express God in His image and represent God with His dominion is fulfilled not in Adam as the first man, the old man, but in Christ as the second man, the new man, comprising Christ Himself as the Head and the church as His Body&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 2:15; 4:15-16, 24; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus, the King, taught us to pray, saying, &ldquo;Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 6:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The kingdom is a realm in which God exercises His authority so that He can express His glory&mdash;v. 13.</li>
		<li>After the rebellion of Satan, the earth fell under his usurping hand; thus, the will of God could not be done on earth as in heaven; hence, God created man with the intention of recovering the earth for Himself&mdash;Ezek. 28:17; Isa. 14:13-15; Gen. 1:26-28.</li>
		<li>After the fall of man, Christ came to bring the heavenly rule to earth so that the earth would be recovered for God&rsquo;s interest and so that the will of God could be done on earth as in heaven&mdash;Matt. 2:2; 27:11; 4:17; 12:28.</li>
		<li>The church brings in the kingdom; the work of the church is to bring in the kingdom of God&mdash;6:10; 12:22-29; Rev. 11:15; 12:10.</li>

	<li>Psalm 89 unveils God&rsquo;s intention that Christ, His Anointed, would possess the entire earth&mdash;vv. 3-4, 19-29, 34-37:

	<li>Verse 18 refers to the kingdom: &ldquo;Jehovah shall reign forever and ever&rdquo;:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s habitation, God&rsquo;s house, brings in God&rsquo;s kingdom, God&rsquo;s reign.</li>
		<li>Today the church is first God&rsquo;s house and then His kingdom; the church brings the kingdom to the earth&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15; Rom. 14:17; Eph. 2:19; Matt. 16:18-19.</li>
		<li>Exodus 15:1-18 indicates that the goal of God&rsquo;s salvation is the building of His dwelling place for the establishing of His kingdom, and for this we, like Moses and the children of Israel, should praise the Lord&mdash;cf. Rev. 15:2-4.</li>

<li>The book of Psalms is a book of praise; in the Psalms we find the greatest and highest praise:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The following verses reveal crucial aspects of praise in the Psalms:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;O Jehovah my God, I will praise You forever&rdquo;&mdash;30:12b.</li>

		<li>&ldquo;That the name of Jehovah may be declared in Zion, / And His praise, in Jerusalem&rdquo;&mdash;102:21.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Let the high praises of God be in their throats, / And a two-edged sword in their hand, / To execute vengeance on the nations / And punishment among the peoples; / To bind their kings with fetters / And their nobles with chains of iron; / To execute upon them the judgment written. / This honor is for all His faithful ones. / Hallelujah!&rdquo;&mdash;149:6-9.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;You are holy, You who sit enthroned / Upon the praises of Israel&rdquo;&mdash;22:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The praise of Jehovah in Psalms 103&mdash;106 issues in Hallelujahs, beginning in 104:35, because the earth has been fully recovered by God and brought under the reign of Christ in His kingdom&mdash;cf. Rev. 19:1-6; 11:15.</li>
	<li>Psalms 146 through 150&mdash;the Hallelujah psalms&mdash;are the consummate praise:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Psalm 146 concerns the praising of Jehovah for His reigning from Zion&mdash;v. 10.</li>
		<li>Psalm 147 is a praise to Jehovah for the rebuilding of Jerusalem.</li>
		<li>Psalm 148 is a praise to Jehovah for His exalted name and for His transcending majesty&mdash;v. 13.</li>
		<li>Psalm 149 is a praise to Jehovah for His taking pleasure in His people, Israel, and His adorning of the lowly with salvation&mdash;v. 4.</li>
		<li>Psalm 150 is on praising Jehovah God:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This psalm is a concluding charge to everything that has breath to praise God&mdash;v. 6.</li>
			<li>Psalm 150 is not only the conclusion of the Psalms&mdash;it is the consummation of the entire Bible, for the Psalms are a miniature of the whole Bible.</li>
			<li>The consummate praise in Psalm 150 corresponds with the praise at the end of Revelation&mdash;Rev. 19:1-6.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Psalms reveal that the Lord has turned us from the law to Christ, that Christ has brought us to the house, that He is enlarging the house into the city, and that from the city He will gain the earth; then God&rsquo;s purpose will be fulfilled, and we will declare, &ldquo;O Jehovah our Lord, / How excellent is Your name / In all the earth!&rdquo;&mdash;2:6-7; 27:4; 48:1-2; 72:8; 8:9. </li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the church life and in our personal life, we need to offer consummate praise to God&mdash;22:22b; Heb. 2:12b; 13:15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;In the midst of the assembly I will praise You&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 22:22b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The assembly here refers to the church, in which the resurrected Christ sings hymns of praise to God the Father.</li>
		<li>This is the firstborn Son&rsquo;s praising of the Father within the Father&rsquo;s many sons in the church meetings&mdash;Heb. 2:10, 12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>When we, the many sons of God, meet as the church and praise the Father, the firstborn Son praises the Father in our praising; He praises within us and with us through our praising&mdash;v. 12b.</li>
			<li>The church on earth today is one corporate Body with the firstborn Son of God&mdash;Rom. 8:29; 12:4-5:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) To gain more of the firstborn Son, we need to praise the Father; the more we praise the Father, the more we gain the firstborn Son.</li>
				<li>2) The more we sing, the more we will enjoy His singing in our singing; the best way to cooperate with Christ and to have Him work together with us is by singing praises to the Father&mdash;Heb. 2:12.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of lips confessing His name&rdquo;&mdash;13:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When we pass through reproach and suffering, we should continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God&mdash;vv. 12-14.</li>
		<li>Since in the church life we enjoy the unchanging Christ as grace and follow Him outside religion, we should offer through Him spiritual sacrifices to God&mdash;vv. 8-10, 15:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In the church we should offer up through Christ a sacrifice of praise to God continually&mdash;v. 15.</li>
			<li>In the church He and we, we and He, praise the Father together in the mingled spirit&mdash;2:12b; 1 Cor. 6:17:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) He, as the life-giving Spirit, praises the Father in our spirit, and we, by our spirit, praise the Father in His Spirit&mdash;15:45b; John 4:24; Eph. 2:18; Jude 20-21.</li>
				<li>2) This is the best and highest sacrifice that we can offer to God through Him&mdash;Heb. 2:12b; 13:15; cf. Hosea 14:1-3.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Through the Christ whom we have experienced and enjoyed, we need to offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually&mdash;Heb. 1:2-3; 2:9, 17; 3:1; 4:14; 6:20; 7:25; 8:1; 12:2; 13:8, 15:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The real praise to the Father comes out of our experience and enjoyment of Christ in our daily life; this is a very pleasing praise to the Father, gladdening and rejoicing His heart&mdash;Eph. 3:8, 17a; John 4:24.</li>
			<li>The praises out of our experience and enjoyment of Christ&mdash;the spiritual praises about Christ&mdash;are the best praise to the Father&mdash;Psa. 45:1-2; 145:1.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;I will praise You, O Lord my God, with all my heart; / And I will glorify Your name forever&rdquo;&mdash;86:12.</li>
