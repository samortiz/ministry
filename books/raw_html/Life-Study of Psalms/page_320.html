<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. THE PRAISE OF THE SAINT<br>IN HIS GOING UP TO ZION CONCERNING<br>THE PERSECUTORS OF ISRAEL<br>AND THE HATERS OF ZION</H2><P>Psalm 129 is the praise of the saint in his going up to Zion concerning the persecutors of Israel and the haters of Zion. Here Israel signifies the New Testament believers, and Zion signifies the overcomers in the church. The more we love the Lord Jesus, the more we will be hated. In some cases, parents have hated their children because the children loved the Lord Jesus so much.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Many Times the Persecutors<br>Having Afflicted the Believers<br>since the Beginning of Their Christian Life</H2><P>Many times the persecutors have afflicted the believers since the beginning of their Christian life, but they have not prevailed against them. As the plowers, the persecutors plowed on the believers' back, making their furrows long, but Jehovah is righteous and has cut the cords of the wicked persecutors (vv. 1-4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. All the Haters of Zion Being Put to Shame</H2><P>All the haters of Zion shall be put to shame and turned back like grass on the housetops, withering before growing up, having no multiplication of sheaves for the reapers (vv. 5-7). They will have no blessing from those who pass by saying, "The blessing of Jehovah be upon you!/We bless you in the name of Jehovah" (v. 8). This is the way God deals with the persecutors and the haters.</P>
