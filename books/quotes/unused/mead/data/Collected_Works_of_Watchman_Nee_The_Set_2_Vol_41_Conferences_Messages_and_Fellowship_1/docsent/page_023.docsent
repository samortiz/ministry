   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE OVERCOMING LIFE Date: November 12, 1935, evening</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Chuenchow</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Phil 1:21; Col 3:4; 1 Cor 1:30 GOD'S ETERNAL PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God has no intention for man to live by his own life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In eternity past God ordained that man would live out the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why God is not satisfied with man simply living by his human life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to His eternal purpose, God intends for man to live by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man did not realize this in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even if he did realize this, he did not accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, one day Christ came into the world as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was crucified on the cross; He died, resurrected, and came back as the Spirit so that man might receive God's life through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way, Christ became the receivable Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who have believed in Him have received such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many people know that they receive the forgiveness of sins when they receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, God is not satisfied with forgiving sins alone; He wants man to no longer live in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He wants man to accept this receivable Christ into him to be his life so that he can live victoriously.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>WRONG CONCEPTS AMONG CHRISTIANS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>CONCERNING OVERCOMING Trying to Meet God's Demand</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>by One's Own Strength</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When a Christian first believes in the Lord, he surely has God's life in him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet many people do not have a clear understanding of how Christ becomes their life and how He lives within them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They develop many wrong concepts about this matter because they lack the proper knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After a Christian is regenerated, he begins to have new inclinations.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He wants what he formerly did not want and rejects what he formerly embraced.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man's wrong concepts come in when he strives to walk in God's will, resolving not to sin anymore and trying to live out the virtues of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many are renewed in their conscience after they are saved, and they are more sensitive toward sin, yet they do not have the power to do God's will and do not have the strength to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a result they live in deep remorse.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Previously, when they lived in sin, they did not know that it was sin and did not feel any sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They simply lived in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But now they have obtained a new life with a new nature and new inclinations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is now living within them as their life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This brings in new demands that they find impossible to fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Formerly, they suffered under sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now they suffer under the burden of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, they may realize that Christians should not be proud or jealous or lose their temper, and they may resolve not to be proud or jealous or lose their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To their dismay, however, they find that they can do none of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Formerly, they did not realize that these were sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They did not know what holiness is, and they had no desire to live a holy life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now they know what holiness is, and they have a desire to live a holy life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But in spite of their knowledge and desire, they find that they cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the kind of suffering that many Christians experience after they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This suffering for holiness is often more painful than the suffering they experienced before they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some people can act like good Christians before men, but they realize their own evil before God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some can pretend to be zealous and faithful in serving the Lord before men, but they know that their life is a series of failures.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Their experience tells them that they are zigzagging between victory and failure; they alternate between overcoming and failing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Their life is a perpetual cycle of victories and failures.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They know very well that they do not have the strength in themselves to do what they desire to do.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Their thoughts and concepts are changed; they are clearly more noble than before.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, their inward being urges them to change for the better.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yet the life they have and the source of power within them have not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They are unable to supply adequate strength to meet their inward demands.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Daily they are clear what they should do, and daily they aspire to overcome and be holy, yet daily they fail.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>During this period, many Christians acquire new knowledge and experience new demands.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As a result, they often make up their minds to do something, to fulfill the inner demands, and to act according to their new aspirations.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They try hard to deal with their own sins and to be humble and meek before the Lord, hoping that they will be inwardly free from unclean thoughts and outwardly free from unkind words.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They hope to live a life before men that is according to the God-prescribed pattern shown in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They remind themselves repeatedly that they have to do good and that they have to strive to achieve their goal.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yet they find to their surprise that when they do not consciously try to do anything, they live in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But once they make up their mind to do anything, they fail no matter how hard they try.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At this stage many Christians become discouraged and disheartened.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some even begin to doubt if they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the common experience shared by many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What we have just described is an interesting phenomenon.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is the first mistake Christians commit in their Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They think that God gave them a new life so that they could have a new knowledge and a new understanding of what is good and evil, right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When they were living in sin, they did not know to differentiate between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But once they desire to meet God's standard, they fall into a different kind of misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What a tragedy this is!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They think that God gives them a new life for no other reason than to give them new desires, new cravings, new inclinations, and new hopes so that they will strive for heavenly and spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Since they are Christians, they think that they should act according to these new desires.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They think that receiving a new life means nothing more than receiving a new attitude, a new hope, and a new inclination, and that they still need to exercise their own strength to fulfill these new demands.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is a great mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The new life is God's new law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This new law, of course, has new demands.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Because it has demands, we exert as much strength as we can to act according to this new law.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Yet the new demands that God puts within us can never be met by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Man only has the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This human life is natural and common; it cannot meet the needs of the new law.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The old life cannot satisfy the demands of the new law.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>For example, consider a fish.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Even if I could give it a new demand to fly and even if I had the power to put a new desire to fly within it, the fish could not fly because there is no flying power within the life of the fish.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Although it can aspire to fly, it cannot actually fly.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The same is true with Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The new life brings new desires and new inclinations.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Yet the old life cannot meet the demands of the new life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is the kind of Christians we find in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Christian in Romans 7 is one who aspires to meet the demands of God's law by his own strength, but who fails.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I have never seen a Christian who can meet God's demand by his own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Nothing that comes out of our old life can meet God's demand.</S>
