On the one hand, he failed God's original purpose in creating man, and on the other hand, he sinned and became a sinner. Therefore, God had to deal with him not only as a man, but also as a sinner. To this end, God sent Christ to the world. He shed His blood and solved the problem of man's sins. This remedial work took care of the sinner. But God's work is not complete if He only saves us from our sins with His blood. The forgiveness of our sins is not the end of God's goal. The forgiveness of sins, by itself, will not bring us back to God's heart's desire. Therefore, we cannot be satisfied, happy, or at peace with just the forgiveness of sins.</p><p>Sin is like the product from a factory, while the sinner is like the factory itself. The sin-products have to be removed, but as long as the sin-factory still exists it will easily continue to bring its product back into the market. Our heart is unclean and deceitful above all things. No one can open his heart for others to examine. Such a deceitful and unclean heart cannot be cleansed by the blood. Man has to have his heart changed. The Lord's blood does not cleanse man's heart; it only cleanses man of his sins. The blood cannot wash man's filthy heart; it only washes the conscience of condemnation.</p><p>At the time of our salvation, we accepted the blood, and its efficacy brought us the forgiveness of sins. Yet His blood did not change our heart. We may have been dishonest before we were saved. However, we can still lie after we are saved. We may have been covetous before we were saved, and we can still be somewhat covetous after we are saved. We may have been unrighteous before we were saved, and we can still be unrighteous after we are saved. We may have been unclean before we were saved, and we can still be unclean after we are saved. We may have been unforgiving before we were saved, and we can still be very mean after we are saved. At the time we were saved, we might have thought that being a Christian was a smooth-sailing journey. Yet we discovered that things were contrary to our anticipations. We discovered that a continuous succession of sinful acts continued to be found in us even though we had been washed of our past sins by the precious blood of the Lord. Hence, the Lord's blood not only must wash away the sins that we have committed, but He must come up with a way to deal with the sin-factory that manufactures these sins. If the factory is not dealt with, the removal of only the sin-products would be like putting the cart before the horse. Soon products will roll out of the factory again. In order to deal with the products thoroughly, the factory itself must be destroyed. Sins have been dealt with already, but the person who produces the sins may still be there. Therefore, there is still the need to deal with the person.</p><p>There was a believer in Chuenchow who experienced much victory and peace during the first two or three weeks after his salvation. But after a few weeks, he began to lose his temper just as he once did. He was bothered very much. When I spoke to him, I illustrated his condition in the following way. Once I met a young child who asked me to wash his clay doll. I told him that a clay doll could not be washed. However, he insisted that I do it for him. Eventually, I had to give in. The more I washed the doll, the dirtier it became. Eventually, all the hair of the doll came off, and the child cried bitterly at the sight. I said, "I told you so. A clay doll cannot be washed. Do not cry anymore. I will buy you a new doll." We are like the clay doll; if we try to wash our sins in an outward way, the more we wash, the dirtier we will become. We must deal with the problem from within. Only then can we settle the problem of sin once and for all.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S TWOFOLD SALVATION&mdash;<br />THE BLOOD AND THE CROSS</h2><p>Man is filled with sin inwardly and outwardly. Whatever man does is sin, and whatever man has not done is also sin. Man is truly corrupted from within. We are like a heavy debtor who owes a great deal of money. We have no means to pay our debts, yet the Lord paid all of our debts. Thank the Lord that He has paid all of our debts. This is a tremendous relief to us. However, we are the kind of person who makes a thousand dollars, but spends twelve thousand. Our Lord has paid our debts, but we continue to borrow. We are habitual borrowers, and we live by borrowing. Our sins are forgiven, but we continue to sin. We, our person, are sinners, and we are constituted with sin. Hence, there is a need to not only deal with our acts of sins, but the person who sins as well. Sins are dealt with by the blood of Christ, whereas the person is dealt with by the cross of Christ.</p><p>The blood washes us of our sins and removes our outward acts of sins. Without the blood, man cannot be redeemed by God. But there is also the cross that puts to death the old man and annuls man's inward nature of sin. The Bible never says that the blood can wash away the "I," the self, the old man, the ego, or the flesh. The clay doll can never be washed clean. The biblical way to deal with the sinner is to "remove him." This is the work of the cross. The cross takes away the old man and crucifies it (Rom. 6:6). There is no place in the Bible that indicates the blood washes away our self, our old man, our lusts, or our flesh. A friend wrote a hymn that said, "The blood washes clean all lusts and evils." This is wrong. Lust can only be crucified by the cross (Gal 5:24), because lust is not an outward act; it is related to our inward nature. We must be careful to differentiate between the function of the blood and the function of the cross.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_065.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_067.html">Next</a> </body></html>
