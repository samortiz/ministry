<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ISSUE OF:</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the issue of something. First, it is the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God. Second, it is the issue of the transfusing of the ascended Christ.</P><P>Ephesians 1:3-14 reveals that the Body of Christ is the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God in the Father's nature and life, in the Son's redemption and His constituting us into God's inheritance, and in the Spirit's sealing and pledging. This is so mysterious and profound! The Body of Christ is the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God. Something out of the Father, something out of the Son, and something out of the Spirit issue in the Body of Christ.</P><P>The Body of Christ is also the issue of the transfusing of the ascended Christ in His attainment to be the Head over all things (Eph. 1:19-23). Furthermore, the Body of Christ is the consummation of the ministering of the riches of Christ (3:8-11). The totality of the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God, the issue of the transfusing of the ascended Christ, and the consummation of the ministering of the riches of Christ is the Body of Christ. The dispensing is of the Triune God, the transfusing is of the ascended Christ, and the consummation is of the ministering of the riches of Christ. Then we have the Body of Christ.</P><P>Furthermore, the Body of Christ is the divine-human constitution with the Triune God and the transformed humanity. It is a constitution of divinity and humanity. This is in Ephesians 4:3-6. We need to remember these five words: issue, dispensing, transfusing, consummation, and constitution. The Body of Christ is the issue of the dispensing and transfusing and it is a consummation and constitution.</P>
