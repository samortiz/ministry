   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX CHRISTIAN LIFE AND ITS SUFFERINGS 8 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 4:1-4 ARMED WITH THE MIND OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 4:1-6 Peter comes to the matter of the believers arming themselves with the mind of Christ for suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 1 says, Christ, therefore, having suffered in the flesh, you also arm yourselves with the same mind, because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word arm indicates that the Christian life is a life of battle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One main purpose of this book is to encourage and exhort the believers to follow the footsteps of Christ in their persecution 1:6-7; 2:18-25; 3:8-17; 4:12-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They should have the same mind Christ had in His suffering 3:18-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The main function of our mind is to understand and realize.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To live a life that follows the footsteps of Christ, we need a renewed mind Rom 12:2 to understand and realize the way Christ lived to fulfill God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In our practical daily life, the strongest part of our being is our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whatever we do in our living is directed by our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not the will but the mind that directs our life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All our activities are under the direction of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because the mind directs our living, the preaching of the Word must change a person s thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One goal of preaching and teaching is to change people s mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we think in a certain way, we shall be directed in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if we change our mind and think in another way, our living will then have a different direction.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What we think governs what we do, say, and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this reason, Peter charges the believers in 4:1 to arm themselves with the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To arm ourselves with the mind of Christ is to be armed with the thought and concept of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This implies that we change our way of thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many Christians think that as long as we love God and do His will, we shall be under His blessing, and we shall not suffer in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is common for Christians to have the concept that those who love the Lord should not expect suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But consider the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Did He not love God?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Did He not do the will of God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ loved God to the uttermost, and He did God s will fully and absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But what happened to Him in His living?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It seems that throughout His life on earth there was not any blessing, but only suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was born into a poor family, a family not considered of a high class.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Of course, that family was descended from David and so was of royal lineage.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But when the Lord Jesus was born, that royal family was very poor economically.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, this family did not live in Jerusalem, but in the despised town of Nazareth in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Galilee can be compared to one of the poorer states in the United States, a state that cannot compare with other states that are wealthy and have a large population.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus lived in Nazareth for more than thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the beginning of His life, He was put into a manger, and at the end of His life, He was put on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Where do we see God s blessing in the life of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He endured suffering upon suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He did not have a good name, and He did not have a place to lay His head.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the way the Lord Jesus lived when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His life was a life of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The concept that the Christian life is a life of suffering is versus the natural, religious mentality, especially the natural mentality of many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A great many Christians think that as long as we belong to God, are the people of God, love God, and do God s will, everything concerning us will be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to this concept, we shall be blessed and may have a good job, a nice house, and an excellent family life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christians who hold this concept may expect all their children to become well-educated, wealthy professionals.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some Christians who are successful and wealthy may say, What blessings I have received from the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All that I have and all that I have attained is because I love the Lord Jesus and do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Look how God has blessed me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This concept of a Christian life is altogether contrary to Peter s teaching in this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Peter knew that the more we love the Lord, the more we shall be deprived of things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He also knew that the more we do the will of God, the more trouble we may have.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may have trouble with our job, with our finances, and with our family life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When some hear this, they may say, Brother Lee, don t say these things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This kind of teaching will frighten Christians away.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the reason we all need to pay attention to Peter s charge to arm ourselves with the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What kind of mind is the mind of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we have the mind of Christ, we shall realize that we are living in a rebellious age and in a crooked, perverted generation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because the age is rebellious and the generation is perverse, the more we love God and do His will, the more we shall suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We shall suffer because we cannot go along with the trend of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We care to do the will of God, but the will of God is absolutely contrary to the trend or tide of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We would love the Lord Jesus, but this is utterly against the trend of this corrupted world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, if we love the Lord and do God s will, we are bound to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This will be our outlook if we have the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to arm ourselves, equip ourselves, with the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This indicates that the mind of Christ is a weapon, a part of the armor needed in fighting the battle for God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we arm ourselves with the mind of Christ for suffering, we shall be willing to endure suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We shall say, Praise the Lord that my suffering is part of my destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God has appointed this for me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Suffering is the portion of God s children in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In 1 Thessalonians 3 Paul tells the believers that God has appointed us to suffering and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God has not appointed us to material blessing; He has appointed us to suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, knowing that Christ suffered in the flesh, we also need to arm ourselves with the same mind.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should not have the mind to pray for material blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>That is to have the wrong kind of mind.</S>
