   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another part or function of our human spirit is the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 4:24 says, "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit..."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This worship is a kind of fellowship, a kind of contact.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Romans 1:9 Paul said that he served God in his spirit and in 7:6 that he served God in newness of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 6:18 says to pray at every time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To pray also is to fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Luke 1:47 Mary said that her spirit exulted, rejoiced, in God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That surely is a kind of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 8:16 and 1 Corinthians 6:17 show that our spirit is one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That oneness is also a kind of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All of the above verses can be used to prove that in our spirit there is something called fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>C. Intuition</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The intuition is also a part of man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Corinthians 2:11 says that the spirit of man knows the things of man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It can know what the soul cannot know.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verses 14 and 15 say that a soulish man cannot receive the things of God but that the spiritual man can.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The direct sense in our spirit regardless of reason or circumstances is the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The intuition is a direct sense of God and a direct knowledge from God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Mark 2:8, Mark 8:12, and John 11:33 are other verses which show that the intuition is a part of the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These verses show that in the human spirit, there is a direct sense of discernment to know God and the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This direct sense is the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, we can see that the conscience functions to discern right from wrong, the fellowship functions to contact God, and the intuition functions to know God and to know God's will, God's intention.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>ITS FUNCTION A. To Contact God</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>B. To Receive God</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ezekiel 36:26 says that God gives us a new heart and a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The new heart is for loving God and seeking after God, whereas the new spirit is for receiving God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The heart is the loving and seeking organ, and the spirit is the receiving organ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all have a heart to love certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A person may love tea, but if he does not have a stomach, he has no organ to receive the tea.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This shows that we need a new heart to love God and a new spirit to receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>C. To Contain God</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord be with your spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our spirit is the place where God stays within us, so our spirit is a container of God.</S>
