<P>There are too many errors in the teachings of the Judaizers. They cause man to doubt the assurance of his salvation; they rob man of his freedom and put him under the heavy yoke of the law again (Gal. 5:1). In addition to these, there are many other effects.</P><P>God has come out of obscurity. Darkness has departed from God, and the true light has shone. Yet the Judaistic teaching put God back into obscurity: Baptism and the "Communion" have replaced the ordinances of Judaism. The clergy system has replaced the Levitical priesthood. When the church is joined with the Old Testament saints, its claim to orthodoxy becomes all the stronger! The church has inherited all the promises God gave to Abraham and has thus become richer in its inheritance! Man can no longer draw near to God. The common priesthood of all the believers has degenerated into the private possession of a group of clergymen. They become the go-between between God and man, the representative of Christ, and to come to them is considered as coming to Christ. What a pity it is that even in Protestantism such poison is still found! The "high church" is of course poisoned by it, but the "low church" is not free from its damage either. One cannot help but sigh at the present system of the church. Ninety percent of it is no longer according to the original pattern, but has become Judaistic. Although there are specially gifted ones in the Bible, there is not a special class of "clergymen" who stand between the laity and God, performing many things which the laity are not supposed to do. Baptism was originally committed to all the disciples, instead of to the apostles (Matt. 28:19). The Lord's supper was a time for the believers to break bread together (Acts 2:41-42; 20:7). But now, these matters have been monopolized by the clergymen. The system of pastors, of one man ruling over a church, and of the affiliation of churches, are all products of the Judaizers. They are not found in the New Testament and are in fact opposed by the New Testament. The effect of these things is to cut off the direct traffic between God and the believers in various things, so that there seems to arise between God and man an intermediary class. This is the result of the Judaistic teaching.</P><P>The Judaistic teaching is a religion that belongs to man's flesh. As such, it places man under the law and adds to him many ordinances and titles of the flesh. We worship God in spirit and in truth. However, the Judaistic teaching would take us away and rob us of our original position. Is it not true that many things in the church are only Christian in name but are actually works of the flesh? The cross has terminated the fleshly man in God's holy judgment. The Holy Spirit has been sent to continue the judgment of the flesh in the saints' hearts. It is an abominable thing to recover the things that God has already judged. All the things that are orderly and proper in the eyes of man are but of "the synagogue of Satan" in the eyes of God. These people are again mentioned in the letter to Philadelphia. There they are filled with the hypocrisy of the fleshly religion, and they oppose those who keep the Lord's word and confess the Lord's name at the end of the period of the church's testimony on earth. This is the Judaistic teaching; it robs the Christians of the enjoyment of the position they inherit from God. It is also this teaching that takes them away from any portion in the world, because grace has already called them out. It is this teaching that has established a class of priests as an intermediary group between the men full of mixture and the far-away God. Although God has the ultimate authority in everything, such teaching is a big victory for the enemy. Hence, there is no title more fitting than "the synagogue of Satan" to describe these Judaistic teachers. They have shamed the church of the Lord and have lowered it to become the synagogue of Satan. Hence, the Lord no longer considers them as His people, but as those of the synagogue of Satan. This is like what the Lord told these people before: "You are of your father the devil" (John 8:44).</P><P>This term shows the change in the church. Originally, the church of God is different in every way from the synagogue of Satan. If we translate the word "church" as "the called-out assembly" according to the original language, much misunderstanding and many mistakes will be avoided. For example, although the church is the spiritual temple of God, there are still those who consider a physical building as the church. In the Bible, the church of God is the Body of Christ. In the church of God, there is only the fellowship among the members of Christ; no one else can participate in this fellowship. Although outwardly the church has many errors which are not in keeping with God's ordained standard, God's intention will not change because of this. What we are demonstrating at the Lord's table is the one great truth: "Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread" (1 Cor. 10:17).</P><P>The word "church" in the original language is ekklesia, which means the called-out congregation. It is composed of the members of the Body of Christ called out by God's grace from the world. The word "synagogue" in the expression "the synagogue of Satan" is completely different from the word ekklesia. The former only carries the meaning of a gathering. "Synagogue" is a Jewish term, whereas "church" is a Christian term. These two terms identify the differences between these two groups. The Body of Christ is a union of all the members called out from the world. The synagogue of Satan is not called out from anywhere. Rather, it is merely a motley group gathered together. If the church of God is a church, that is, an ekklesia, it should not have any mixture of people among it other than the regenerated and called-out ones. If it does, it will be only a synagogue. This shows how the church has degraded from the position of an ekklesia into a synagogue.</P><P>The Lord is not speaking to these people here. These people do not seem to be the recipients of the epistle. Neither does the Lord consider it the responsibility of the messengers that these people exist. However, the Lord did not speak directly to the Nicolaitans or the disciples of Balaam in Pergamos nor to Jezebel in Thyatira either. Yet no one can deny that these people were part of those in the two churches. The Judaistic teachers here are also members of the church then. Alas, the church has become almost fully degraded and desolated from the beginning! What a solemn thing this is! This is true in all generations. How long did man's ancestor remain in Eden? What about mankind before the flood? What about the descendants of Noah? What about the Israelites in the wilderness, and what about them after they had entered Canaan? The day the priesthood was established, it was defiled. The first king died on the battlefield. The builder of the temple was also the builder of idol sanctuaries. Those who waited for the Messiah were the ones who crucified the Son of God on the cross. The special grace that God bestowed on the church only made her degradation all the more pitiful. Has God ever made up for the failure of the fallen ones? No, instead He turns and creates something new. Can the church be an exception to this rule? As far as the organization of the church is concerned, God has rejected the church already. Now His eyes are turned to the kingdom. This is fully shown in every epistle. When we realize this, we will know how we ought to be faithful.</P><P>We should be careful. "The synagogue of Satan" is a severe rebuke. We should not impose this title on all those who had fallen prey to the heresy of Judaism, nor should we apply the same principle to those of today. According to the Bible, this title is applied only to those who vehemently promote the heresy; it does not apply to those who are deceived to follow the heresy. The word of God points out to us the real condition of everything; it also shows us the reason behind every heresy. Yet to man, love is always the best hope. However, we should not become blind through love, taking evil as good, and bitter as sweet. Love in fact does not have any slight toleration for sinful teachings. Can one consider it love to tolerate poison in the food of others? But then, to men, we must have love and must hope that they would also receive the truth. Today, all around us, we see the effect of the Judaistic teachings: God has retreated behind the veil, man has departed from God, everywhere there is darkness and uncertain hopes, the church is mingled with the world, believers have lost their joy and blessing, and the church has degenerated. All these are the results of this teaching. As to its full development, that is recorded in the other epistles.</P><P>Hence, we see that the Judaistic teaching is the source of failure in the outward form of the church, in the same way that the departure from the first love was the cause for the degradation of the inward content of the church. The reason the Judaistic teaching is mentioned here is so that we would understand the severity of the condition of desolation of the day. First, God rebuked the departure from love. Next, He pointed out the error in doctrine. The former leads to the latter. When one departs from the first love and loses the intimate fellowship with God, spontaneously it will become difficult for him to be preserved in the pure doctrine. Once there is a barrier between God and man, spontaneously one will be drawn back into the teaching of the flesh. The failures of Ephesus and Smyrna are matters of cause and effect. To preserve the purity of doctrine, one must preserve the purity of love.</P>
