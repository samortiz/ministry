   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD DESIRES TO MAKE THE NATIONS THE KINGDOM OF GOD THROUGH THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If the church does not take God's authority, He has no way to establish His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, God gained the kingdom in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then He established His kingdom in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the end His kingdom will be established on the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One day there will be a declaration, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ" Rev 11:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Between the time in which the kingdom was in the Lord Jesus individually and the kingdom of the world becomes the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only when the kingdom was established in the Lord Jesus could it be established in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only when the kingdom is established in the church can the kingdom of the world become the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without the Lord Jesus, there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without the church, there is no expansion of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the Lord was on earth, He was obedient even in the smallest thing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, He was not negligent in the matter of paying the temple tax.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even when there was no money, a coin was found in the mouth of a fish to pay it Matt 17:24-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He also said, "Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar and the things that are God's to God" 22:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although Caesar was rebellious, he was set up by God, and as such, one must obey him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When our obedience is perfect, the Lord will rebuke the disobedient ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we become submissive, the kingdom can be expanded to the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many have strong feelings concerning sin, but they have no feeling concerning rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Man must not only have the consciousness of sin; he must also have the consciousness of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without the consciousness of sin, one cannot be a disciple of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without the consciousness of authority, one cannot be a disciple of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE CHURCH MUST SUBMIT TO GOD'S AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to know how to submit in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is not a single authority in the church that we can ignore.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God wants to see the kingdom issuing forth from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He wants all authority to be executed through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the church is so submissive, the earth will submit to the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the church will not give the kingdom of God a free way, the kingdom of God will have no way among the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason, the church is the highway to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If this is not the case, the church will become a hindrance to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today if the church cannot submit to God because of a little difficulty, how can the kingdom of God be manifested?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When men reason with one another and argue with one another, how can God's kingdom come?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have delayed God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must rid ourselves of all disobedience so that God will have a free way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the church submits, the nations will submit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this reason, the church bears a great and heavy responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When God's life, God's will, and God's commands are executed in the church, the kingdom will come.</S>
