   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ALL THE ACTIVITIES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE MEETINGS BEING LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How should a Christian meeting be conducted?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Currently, while we are waiting for everyone to arrive and take their seats, some saints talk and others pray.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then after everyone is seated, we wait for a brother to call a hymn, for another brother to read some verses, and for still another brother to give the message; then after the message we have a time for testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a degraded, religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A meeting of the church should be a gathering of the saints with their riches that are released with a strong, rich spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everyone should release his spirit and function according to his spirit, not according to any procedures.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not have written procedures among us; most of our procedures are unwritten.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These unwritten procedures are our customs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to these customs, we do not function in the meetings; we only wait.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to have a change.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not be concerned about what we should do in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether we pray, praise, or sing, it should be living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to be delivered from our old way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a sister is the first saint to arrive at the meeting hall, she may begin to pray, and as the rest of the saints arrive, they can join the prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The brother who gives the message should not follow the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whether he reads the verses in the Scripture reading depends on the sense in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If he has the sense in his spirit to read the verses first, he should read them; otherwise, he does not need to.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During the message a saint may feel led by the Spirit to call a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everyone should sing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This meeting is according to 1 Corinthians 14:26, which says, Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let all things be done for building up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>SINGING THE HYMNS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>ACCORDING TO THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The brother who is speaking may consider that calling a hymn during the message would be a distraction, and the saints may think that this would cause confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, if everyone is exercising their spirit, we must believe that the leading of the Spirit will not be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The leading of the Spirit needs human cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Suppose everything in a meeting is focused on life: the prayers are for life, and the burden of the message is also on life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When a saint feels led by the Spirit to call a hymn, which hymn should he select?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If he does not know the hymns well, he will not be able to select a proper hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, we need to know the hymns as well as the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The hymns in the Chinese hymnal are classified into twenty-nine main categories and three hundred forty-five subcategories.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the saints want to study theology, they should spend four years to study the theology in our hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This word is not an exaggeration.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If someone really wants to study the hymns, he will need to spend much time and effort to learn the twenty-nine categories and the three hundred forty-five subcategories.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we compiled the English hymnal in America from 1963 to 1964, our purpose was to show American Christianity that the truths in our hymns are high and comprehensive.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We accomplished that purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are one thousand eighty hymns in the English hymnal, but we regularly use less than three hundred hymns in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are seven hundred eighty hymns in the Chinese hymnal and six hymns in the appendix, but less than three hundred hymns are regularly used in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The hymns that we do not sing serve as a contrast.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is difficult for new ones to select a hymn, because they do not know which hymn is appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There should be only one line of hymns in our hymnal, and that is the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All the hymns should be under the category of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We will now learn how to use the hymns in the meetings with Hymns, #499.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Stanza 1 says, Oh, what a life!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Oh, what a peace!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>/ The Christ who s all within me lives.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>/ With Him I have been crucified; / This glorious fact to me He gives.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>/ Now it s no longer I that live, / But Christ the Lord within me lives.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to our custom, when we call a hymn, we ask the sister at the piano to play the tune once before the saints sing the entire hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From now on, we should not remain in our old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a brother senses that we should sing this hymn, he can call it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We do not have to sing all four stanzas.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may sing only stanza 1.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The sister at the piano needs to be alert.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If she waits for a brother to ask her to play the tune once and then plays the tune, the meeting will be deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every saint needs to kindle the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If the sister serving at the piano is not quick enough to respond when a hymn is called, any saint in the meeting should begin to sing the hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then everyone else will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After we sing stanza 1, a brother might stand up and say, Brothers and sisters, I have a deep sense today concerning this stanza: Oh, what a life!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Oh, what a peace!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Christ who s all within me lives.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I never saw so clearly that Christ lives in me and that I am crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is a glorious fact that He gives to me.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now it is no longer I that live, but Christ the Lord lives within me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These few sentences are sufficient; if he speaks too long, there will be less time for the message.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After he sits down, we do not have to sing the next stanza.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we do sing stanza 2, the saint at the piano needs to play immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The entire process should be living, and everyone should follow the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is proper to abide by the law in society, but we should not abide by the law in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This does not mean that we want confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need to follow the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Our standard and our law are the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Everyone needs to follow the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The saints who play the piano need to play in a tempo that is suitable for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When a person learns to play the piano, he will play at a certain tempo.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, the saints who play the piano should not be mechanical when they play in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Some hymns should be played a little faster.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Otherwise, it will seem as if an old ox is pulling a cart.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The tempo used in singing a hymn does not need to be so consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>For example, the first stanza of a hymn used to open the meeting can be a little faster and the rest of the stanzas slower to stabilize the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Furthermore, all the hymns should not be played at the same tempo.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Music is expressive; it should not be rigid like steel.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Therefore, the saints who are experienced in playing the piano can play a hymn fast or slow; they can also play it in a higher key or in a lower key.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We all need to learn the hymns so that we are not limited by the piano.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we sing stanza 2, it will be more meaningful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Formerly, our singing was not that much in the spirit, because we sang in a habitual way.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Now we can touch the reality because our singing is the result of the Spirit s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>From now on, we should not sing in a routine way.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I remind myself not to give messages or read the Scriptures in a routine way.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This fellowship should help us to understand that the meetings in the churches should be living.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>They should not be routine and follow a set of rules or procedures.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In a big meeting it is appropriate to have a concluding prayer on certain occasions.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>However, it is not necessary to have a concluding prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Whether there should be a concluding prayer depends on the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If the meeting needs a concluding prayer, a leading brother does not have to be the one to give the prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Every brother and sister in the meeting should exercise their spirit and follow the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It would be wonderful for a young brother in junior high school to be led by the Spirit to release a concluding prayer after the message.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>His prayer will be refreshing and living.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Our meetings in the past were killed by procedures and routine.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Christianity annuls the function of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We should not repeat the mistakes of Christianity and become dead.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Therefore, everyone needs to rise up and stand against our customs, but there should not be confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>After hearing this word, some of the saints may think that they are now free to do what pleases them.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This will not be permitted.</S>
