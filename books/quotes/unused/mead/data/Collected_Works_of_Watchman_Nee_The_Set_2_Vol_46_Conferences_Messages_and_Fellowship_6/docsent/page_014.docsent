   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FREE FROM LAW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Editor's Note: The following message was given by Watchman Nee in Denmark in 1938.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Part of this message is incorporated in chapter nine of The Normal Christian Life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that in delivering us from sin God did not deal with sin directly, neither did He touch the body of sin; rather, He crucified our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The picture in Romans 6 is of a slave and his master.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's way of delivering the slave from the tyranny of his master is not to slay the master, but to kill the slave.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The master may still live and be the cruelest of masters, but he can no longer touch the slave, because the slave has been taken out of his way by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The mastery of sin cannot reach the other side of the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Romans 6 the subject is one of deliverance from sin; in Romans 7 the subject is one of deliverance from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many Christians see the necessity of being delivered from sin, but they fail to see the need for deliverance from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In my early years I was told by many teachers that I must be freed from the law, and I read books which taught the same thing, but I did not understand my need for this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was clear to me that I needed to be delivered from sin, but why I needed to be delivered from the law was beyond my comprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Praise the Lord, I see it now!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He who makes no mistakes deemed it necessary to deliver us from the law, and now I see that only by being redeemed from the law can we be kept from lapsing into sin again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the meaning of the law?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The existence of the law implies that God requires certain things of us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us be perfectly clear that there is nothing wrong with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul said, "The law is holy, and the commandment holy and righteous and good" Rom 7:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is nothing wrong with the law, but there is something decidedly wrong with us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The demands of the law are righteous, but the persons upon whom the demands are made are unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The trouble is not that the demands of the law are unjust, but that we are unable to meet them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It may be right for the government to require payment of a thousand kroner a unit of Danish currency , but I will be wrong if I have only ten kroner to meet the demand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are men "sold under sin" v. 14 . Sin has full sway over us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As long as others leave us alone, we seem to be rather fine, but as soon as others ask us to do something, our sinfulness comes to light.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we have a very clumsy servant who just sits still and does nothing, his clumsiness does not show.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If he does nothing all day, he will be of little use, but at least he is doing no damage.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if we say to him, "Now come along.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not idle your time away!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Get up and do something!", the trouble will begin immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He will knock the chair over as he gets up, stumble over a footstool a few paces further on, and smash some precious dishes when he handles them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we make no demands upon him, his clumsiness is never noticed, but as soon as we ask him to do anything, his awkwardness is seen at once.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The demands were right, but the man was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was just as clumsy when he was sitting still as when he was working, but our demands made the clumsiness within him, whether he was active or inactive, manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are sinners by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If God asks nothing of us, everything seems to go well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, as soon as He demands something of us, an occasion is provided for a grand display of our sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The law makes our weakness manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>While others let us sit still, we appear to be all right, but whenever they ask us to do anything, we are sure to spoil that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are entrusted with a second thing, we will spoil that as well.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When a holy law is applied to a sinful man, his sinfulness is fully displayed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have seen both the law's demands and its effect, but what is the meaning of deliverance from the law?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the meaning of the law is the demands of God upon us, then the meaning of deliverance from the law is the deliverance from the demands of God upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Deliverance from the law means that God asks us to no longer do anything for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In other words, He ceases to make any further demands upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Romans 6 we see how God delivered us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Romans 7 we see how He delivered us from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In chapter six we are shown the way of deliverance from sin in the picture of a master and his slave.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In chapter seven we are shown the way of deliverance from the law in the picture of the two husbands and the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The relationship between sin and the sinner is that of a master and his slave; the relationship between the law and the sinner is that of a husband and his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Note that in the picture of our deliv- erance from law there is only one woman, while there are two husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The woman is in a very difficult position because she can only be the wife of one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Unfortunately, she is married to the less desirable one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose a woman is married to a good man, yet the husband and wife are totally unsuited for each other.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the one hand, he is very particular and accurate to a degree.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the other hand, she is decidedly haphazard.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Everything is definite and precise with him, but everything is vague and hazy with her.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He wants everything just so, while she simply accepts things as they come.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How could there be any happiness in this home?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The husband is so exacting!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is always making demands of his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Yet there is nothing wrong with him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As a husband he has a right to expect something of her; all of his demands are perfectly legitimate.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is nothing wrong with the man or with his demands.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But he has the wrong kind of wife to carry them out.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The two cannot get along at all; they are utterly incompatible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The poor woman is in great distress.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>She is fully aware that she often makes mistakes, but in living with him, it seems as though everything she says and does is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What hope is there for her?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If only she were married to another man, everything would be well!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He could be no less exacting than her first husband, but instead of just making demands, he could also help her carry them out.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He could be very exacting, but also very helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>She wants to marry him, but her husband is still alive.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What can she do?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Unless he dies, she cannot legitimately marry another man.</S>
