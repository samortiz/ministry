   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Dispensing of the Triune God In the Father's Nature and Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we Christians come to spiritual things, we mostly would care only for the terms.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We would not dive into the depths to get the intrinsic significance of these terms.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For instance, Ephesians 1:4 says that before the foundation of the world, God the Father chose us to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even a young child may be able to read this, but what is the intrinsic significance here?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some think that God chose us in eternity that we should go to heaven, so we have been chosen unto heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But Paul does not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He says God chose us to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the entire universe, nothing is holy except God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Holiness is God's divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates strongly that in God's choosing of us He had the intention to dispense His holy nature into us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We were sinners and worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How could we be holy?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is like asking a turtle to fly like a bird.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A turtle cannot do this because it does not have the flying nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The only way we can be holy is for God, the holy One, to dispense Himself into our being so that our whole being may be permeated and saturated with His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible tells us God's salvation is first to regenerate us and then to sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To sanctify us is to make us holy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, God's salvation is to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's holy nature sanctifies us to transform us by making us holy as God is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, we can see that God's choosing us to be holy in eternity indicates that God is going to dispense Himself as the holy nature into our intrinsic being so that we can be as holy as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Brethren teachers spoke much on Ephesians 1, but they did not see that God's choosing in its intrinsic significance indicates that God is now dispensing Himself as the holy nature into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ephesians 1:5 says that God the Father not only chose us but also predestinated us, marked us out beforehand, unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we need to see the intrinsic significance of God's predestinating us unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Unto sonship means unto the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Surely this indicates that God is going to dispense His divine life into us to make us His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What can make you a son of a certain person?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nothing can except that person's life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Your father's life has made you his son, and this is sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the same way, our heavenly Father has dispensed His divine life into us to make us His sons, the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ephesians 1 first tells us that God in Christ gives us all the spiritual blessings in the heavenlies v. 3 , and the very God here surely is the Divine Trinity, the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Father's blessing is His choosing of us and His predestinating of us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In His choosing He intends to impart, or to dispense, His nature into us, and in His predestinating He intends to dispense His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In time He caused us to believe into Christ, and we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In our regeneration we received the Father's divine life and divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Second Peter 1:4 says that we are today the partakers of the divine nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today we have the life of God and the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first stanza of Hymns, #841 says that the Lord is our life, that He lives in us, and that we are sanctified by His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God the Father has put His life into us that we might be His sons, and He has put His nature into us that we might be made holy as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These are the blessings of the Father revealed in Ephesians 1:3-6.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 6 concludes this section of the blessings given to us by the Father by saying, "To the praise of the glory of His grace."</S>
