<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JOB</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SEVENTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT AS THE CONSUMMATION<br>OF THE PROCESSED AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Job 42:5; John 7:39; Rom. 8:2, 9, 11, 14; Gal. 3:14; 6:18; Eph. 1:13-14; Phil. 1:19; Gal. 5:25; Rom. 8:16, 4</H1><P>We have seen that the divine revelation in the New Testament is the answer to the sufferings of Job and to the great question concerning God's intention in His creation of man and in His dealing with His chosen people. In this message I would like to give a further word regarding this answer, focusing on the matter of the all-inclusive Spirit as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S MOVE</H2><P>The Old Testament time was a time not of God's move but of preparation for God's move. The incarnation was the beginning of God's move, which is for God to come out of eternity into time to enter with His divinity into humanity. Then God moved through human living and through His wonderful, all-inclusive death into resurrection. In resurrection Christ was begotten to be God's firstborn Son. Through resurrection He also became the life-giving Spirit, and He regenerated all God's chosen people to be God's many sons as His many members to constitute the church as His Body, as the new man, and as the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TRIUNE GOD BEING THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Today the Triune God is the Spirit&#151;the consummated, all-inclusive, compound Spirit. The title "the Spirit" is used in a particular way in John 7. While the Lord Jesus was still on earth, He said that His believers would be full of the Spirit (vv. 38-39a). At that time "the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified" (v. 39b). This indicates clearly that when the Lord Jesus was glorified, the Spirit was there. This Spirit is the processed and consummated Triune God.</P>
