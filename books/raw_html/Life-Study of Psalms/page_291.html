<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE PRAISE OF GOD'S ELECT<br>FOR GOD'S GREAT WORKS<br>ACCORDING TO HIS COVENANT</H2><P>In Psalm 111 we have the praise of God's elect for God's great works according to His covenant which He made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In verse 2 the psalmist declares, "Great are the works of Jehovah,/And sought out by all who delight in them." Verse 4 says, "He has caused His wondrous deeds to be remembered;/Jehovah is gracious and compassionate." In verse 5b we are told that He remembers His covenant forever, and in verse 9, that He has commanded His covenant forever.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE PRAISE OF GOD'S ELECT<br>FOR GOD'S BLESSING DUE TO THEIR FEAR OF HIM<br>AND THEIR VIRTUES THEREOF</H2><P>Psalm 112 is the praise of God's elect for God's blessing due to their fear of Him (vv. 1-2) and their virtues thereof, mainly in giving to the poor (vv. 4-5, 9; cf. 2 Cor. 9:6-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE PRAISE OF GOD'S ELECT<br>FOR GOD'S EXALTATION AND HUMILITY<br>IN TAKING CARE OF THE LOWLY AND NEEDY ONES</H2><P>Psalm 113 is the praise of God's elect for God's exaltation and humility in taking care of the lowly and needy ones. Verses 4 through 6 say, "Jehovah is high above all the nations, /And His glory is above the heavens./Who is like Jehovah our God,/Who has set His throne on high,/Who humbles Himself to behold/The heavens and the earth?" This is a praise both of God's exaltation and His humility. His humility was manifested in His incarnation. If we compare these verses with Philippians 2:7-11, we will see that Christ humbled Himself and, due to His humility, He was exalted.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE PRAISE OF GOD'S ELECT<br>FOR GOD'S MARVELOUS DEEDS TO THEM<br>IN EGYPT AND IN THE WILDERNESS AND<br>THEIR BECOMING GOD'S SANCTUARY AND DOMINION</H2><P>Psalm 114 is the praise of God's elect for God's marvelous deeds to them in Egypt and in the wilderness and their becoming God's sanctuary and dominion. God did many things to make the rebellious people of Israel His sanctuary and His dominion under His rule. Concerning this, verse 2 says, "Judah became His sanctuary,/Israel, His dominion."</P>
