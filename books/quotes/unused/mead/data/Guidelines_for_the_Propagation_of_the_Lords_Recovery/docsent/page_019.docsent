   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE BEARING THE RESPONSIBILITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO SHEPHERD AND TEACH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE HOMES AND SMALL GROUPS OUTLINE The responsibility of the whole church coming together in one place 1 Cor 14:23.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The responsibility of the meetings in the halls Acts 2:46; 5:42.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The responsibility of serving in the homes 2:46; 5:42.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The responsibility of leading in the small groups cf.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mark 6:39-40.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The responsibility of shepherding John 21:15-17.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The responsibility of teaching 2 Tim 2:2, 24; Heb 13:17.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>RISING UP QUICKLY TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We hope that by giving these messages the churches in Taiwan, especially the saints in the church in Taipei, will rise up quickly to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today every aspect of society in Taiwan is advancing; the government is stable, and the economy is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is an excellent opportunity for the church to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are not being faithful to the Lord or to our fellow countrymen if we do not grasp this opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Taipei is like a big fishpond; there are millions of fish all around us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must preach the gospel and deliver salvation to them, or we will be indebted to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul said, Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If I do this of my own will, I have a reward 1 Cor 9:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He also said, I am debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish Rom 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul was not cursing himself when he said, Woe to me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, he was saying that if we lose the race of our Christian life, we will not receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The condition of woe does not refer to being cursed; it refers to not receiving a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we preach the gospel, we will receive a reward; if we do not preach the gospel, we will not receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord knows whenever a sinner repents, because the Bible says that there is joy in heaven over one sinner repenting Luke 15:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever a sinner repents, the angels in heaven rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A sinner s repentance is significant to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not think that it does not matter whether or not we lead a person to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever a person is saved, there is a record before God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not lead anyone to salvation, we will suffer loss instead of receiving a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we need to rise up and preach the gospel to save people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hymns, #921 says, Rescue the perishing, / Care for the dying, / Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave; / Weep o er the erring one, / Lift up the fallen, / Tell them of Jesus the mighty to save.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>/ Rescue the perishing, / Care for the dying; / Jesus is merciful, / Jesus will save.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After singing the hymns in a thorough way, we need to begin to take action and go forth to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The fire of the gospel needs to be kindled, and everyone needs to pick up this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Preaching the gospel is the primary obligation of Christians to society.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the reason that some Christians refer to preaching the gospel as the great commission.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Mark 16:15 the Lord charged us to go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Chinese Union Version to all the creation is rendered as to all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is also a note which says, Nations, lit., creation .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this verse the Greek word means creation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to preach the gospel until every person on earth has heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we can continue to preach the gospel to the rest of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus said, Go therefore and disciple all the nations Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All the nations refers to every tribe, tongue, people, and nation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first commission we bear before God is to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we do not preach the gospel, we are not fulfilling our obligation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul said that he was a debtor Rom 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As long as our obligation is not fulfilled, we are debtors.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>GOSPELIZING TAIWAN</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every saint needs to resolve to save one person every year.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is not difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not think that we are unable to catch one fish in a year even though we live in a fishpond.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have no excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God in His sovereignty has arranged for many people to be around us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some of the streets in Taipei seem to be filled with people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Moreover, we all have relatives, friends, classmates, and colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we contact them every day, we will be able to lead at least one person to salvation in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If every one of the seven thousand saints in this meeting leads one person to salvation, by next year there will be fourteen thousand saints.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some saints may have a stronger desire and lead two or more people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is also good.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then we will not have an increase of merely seven thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We all need to make such a vow.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the past we neglected the matter of gaining people.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now we need to forget the past and press on by opening to the Lord and receiving His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to begin a new page in the history of the churches in Taiwan by gaining a twofold increase every year.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>According to statistics, the population of Taipei and its suburbs is 3,000,000, and there is a floating population of around 800,000.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, the total population is about 4,000,000.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There are around 50,000 saints on the name list of the church in Taipei, and about 5,000 saints meet regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If the 5,000 saints gain one person every year, after one year there will be 10,000 saints; after two years, 20,000; after three years, 40,000; after four years, 80,000; after five years, 160,000; after six years, 320,000; after seven years, 640,000; after eight years, 1,280,000; and after nine years, 2,560,000.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After ten years our number will reach 5,120,000.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we are faithful to practice diligently, lay a foundation, and build up the habit of leading one person to salvation in a year, we will have a twofold increase every year, and in ten years our increase will be a thousandfold.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>For us to succeed, every saint will need to lead one person to salvation every year.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The older saints, the middle-aged saints, and even the younger saints need to consider how they can lead one person to salvation in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we are able to do this, we will have a twofold increase in one year and a thousandfold increase in ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We will be able to gospelize Taiwan in ten years, and Taiwan will be a gospel nation that is filled with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In order to gospelize Taiwan we must pray.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We need to rise up corporately to pray for the gospelization of Taiwan in ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then we need to endeavor to preach the gospel in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Whether we are at school, at work, or in the market, we must preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The churches should cooperate and print gospel tracts for the saints to distribute in large quantities.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When the sisters buy groceries, they can give gospel tracts to the cashier and to other women who are buying groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There is no need for us to be timid.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They should distribute gospel tracts day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Distributing gospel tracts can be compared to digging a well.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Water does not come forth as soon as we begin to dig.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Rather, we need to dig persistently until we reach water.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In 1939 in Tsinan, Shantung Province, there was an official who held a prominent position at the Provincial Bureau of Construction.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>A brother, who held a low position, also worked at the bureau.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Because the brother was very burdened to preach the gospel to this official, he and his wife prayed for the official.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Every morning the brother put a gospel tract on the official s desk.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When the official saw the gospel tract, he threw it into the trash can.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This went on for almost half a year.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Then one day the official picked up the gospel tract and read it.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Eventually, he believed in the Lord and attended the meetings in the church in Tsinan and was greatly blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The official threw away the gospel tracts he received, but he could not do this for three hundred and sixty-five days.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He was eventually gained by our brother s perseverance.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We should not worry if people dislike the fact that we distribute gospel tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>People will know that we are crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>However, there will also be a continual result.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We must build up such a gospel atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In 1949, when we arrived in Taiwan, we preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We posted gospel banners of different colors in the streets and alleys and in train and bus stations.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This created a good atmosphere for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>When we saw a house with a banner on the door, we knew that a brother or sister lived there.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If the environment permits, the church should print some banners and post them in different places in order to create an atmosphere for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The banners can read, God so loved the world, or Christ came to the world to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In 1949 we also had gospel marches in which we all wore gospel robes.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Some saints beat large drums and everyone else sang, You need Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>These marches enhanced the gospel atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Praying, speaking, and preaching are our weapons for preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Christians need to pray, speak, and preach.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Prayer is the greatest weapon, because it can shake the authority of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>In order to preach the gospel, we can have gospel marches, post gospel banners, distribute gospel tracts, and speak in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We can distribute gospel tracts at work, at school, and even when we are in a store.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We should also distribute tracts when we are on a train or a bus.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Wherever we are, we should distribute gospel tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Some people need to receive more than ten gospel tracts before they decide to read one.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>They will eventually believe in the Lord after being besieged with gospel tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>If we distribute only one or two gospel tracts, we will not create an atmosphere of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Suppose five thousand brothers and sisters in Taipei distributed gospel tracts every day.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>A person may receive your tract today, my tract tomorrow, and another person s tract the day after.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>This would be very effective.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>In order for the gospel to spread, we should not be silent or quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>We should go out to speak to people and to distribute gospel tracts.</S>
