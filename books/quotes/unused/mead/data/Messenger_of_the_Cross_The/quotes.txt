[1]  Recently many people seem to be tired of hearing the word of the cross.
[2]  However, we thank and praise God the Father that He has reserved for His own great name many faithful ones who have not bent their knees to Baal.
[3]  The message Paul preached was the Lord Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[4]  If we forget the cross and do not make the cross and Christ our unique subject, how much will we and our audience miss!
[5]  Many times what we preach is the cross, but our attitude, our words, and our feeling do not seem like we are preaching the cross!
[6]  The reasons why no one gains life through our preaching of the cross are: 1 we ourselves do not have the experience of the cross, and 2 we do not use the spirit of the cross to preach the word of the cross.
[7]  Those who are not crucified cannot be and are not worthy to preach the message of the cross.
[8]  The message we preach should burn in our life first so that our life and our message can be mingled together.
[9]  If we do not have the experience of crucifixion in our life, if we do not have the experience of dying together with the Lord in overcoming sin and self, if we do not have the experience of bearing the cross and following the Lord to suffer for Him, and if we only know the word of the cross from others' speaking and writings but have no experience of it ourselves, we surely cannot give life to others.
[10]  Only when we are transformed by the cross and when we receive the life and the spirit of the cross can we dispense the cross to others.
[11]  We have said that our work is to dispense life to others.
[12]  However, we ourselves do not have the life to give to others, to enliven others, and to nourish others.
[13]  In this way, our spirit will constantly bear the cross of the Lord to the extent that our life becomes the life of the cross.
[14]  Since we are saturated with the Holy Spirit and have the life of the cross, the Holy Spirit will use us to pour out the life of the cross from within to those who are surrounding us.
[15]  If we truly allow the cross to do a deep work in us, to the extent that we become filled with the Holy Spirit, we will spontaneously flow out life to nourish those whom we touch whenever we speak or preach in public or to individuals.
[16]  His life was a manifestation of the life of the cross.
[17]  He not only knew the Lord Jesus' substitutional death, but he took the Lord Jesus' cross as his own cross in experience.
[18]  We know that Paul not only preached the cross as a crucified person, but he preached the cross in the spirit of the cross.
[19]  Because he preached the Savior of the cross with the way of the cross, he had the demonstration of the Spirit and of power v. 4 . We ought to be able to say with Paul that "our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance" 1 Thes 1:5 . If the Spirit and His power are not working behind our speaking, our words are useless even if they are enticing.
[20]  Herein lies the key to the difference between fruitfulness and fruitlessness in an evangelist.
[21]  Sometimes, we see two evangelists having the same utterance and expressions.
[22]  We have mentioned earlier the matter of our natural abilities.
[23]  In our practice, every time and anywhere the Lord burdens us to testify for Him, we should drive away afresh any desire that is in us to rely upon our natural abilities.
[24]  Even at times when we have no feelings at all, or when our emotions are as cold as ice, we need to kneel down before the Lord and ask Him to do a deeper work of the cross in us so that we can be able to direct our emotions and can act according to the Lord's command, regardless of whether our emotions are cold or hot.
[25]  Rather, we humble ourselves before God and ask Him to freshly enlighten us with the teachings that we have known before and to freshly impress such teachings upon our spirits so that what we preach does not become merely a recollection of our old experience but a fresh encounter in our life.
[26]  We should open up our spirit before the Lord and should allow the Holy Spirit to pour out His words and His message through our spirit, so that we may first be infused in our spirit by the Lord's word and by the message we preach.
[27]  Satan does not like our preaching of the cross at all.
[28]  When we are faithful in speaking about the cross of the Lord, he surely will raise up many oppositions.
[29]  If we are truly identified with the cross in this way, if we allow the cross to do a deeper work in our lives and our work, and if we fully trust in the victory of the cross, God will grant us the victory everywhere we go.
