   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Romans 8 there are at least four terms used to describe the Spirit: the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The aspect of the Spirit in Romans 8 that is most crucial is not the Spirit of God, the Spirit of life, or the Spirit of the One who raised Christ from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The crucial aspect in this chapter is the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The title Christ includes incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As God s anointed One, Christ passed through birth, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today the Spirit of Christ contains the extract of His death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It even contains the extract of His birth and human living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit, the extract, of Christ s birth, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have seen that the spirit of a substance is the extract of that substance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Applying this principle to the Spirit of Christ, we may say that the extracts of Christ s birth, living, death, resurrection, and ascension are now all elements of the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, in this one Spirit we have the effectiveness of Christ s birth, living, death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is only through experience that we can have this understanding of the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we walk according to spirit, we have Christ s incarnation and His human living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not have merely an imitation of the way Christ lived.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, we also have His death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>CONTACTING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Apart from the Spirit of Christ, we cannot have the experience of being seated with Christ in the heavens Eph 2:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some Bible teachers present Ephesians 2:5-6 merely as a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They claim that being seated with Christ in the heavenlies is a positional matter and that we should simply take the fact by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, when we believe as a matter of position that we are seated with Christ in the heavens, nothing happens.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not the way Paul teaches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to Paul s teaching, the extract of Christ s ascension is included in the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Spirit we have the experience of sitting with Christ in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Most of today s Christians are lacking in spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In His recovery, however, the Lord is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We cannot deny that, by His mercy and grace, we have learned much concerning the Spirit throughout the years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We received light doctrinally from other Bible teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From experience we have learned that reckoning and taking our position by faith do not work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some teachers of the Word claim that what we need to do is take the accomplished facts by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to this understanding, we should not do anything except believe the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I practiced this, but it did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more I tried to believe the facts, the more dead I became.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I did not experience any of the divine stimulation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, I can testify that when I prayed and contacted the Spirit, I did experience the Lord s stimulation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the past centuries a number of saints experienced the Spirit, even though they had not been enlightened concerning the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When they prayed, they were stimulated by the Spirit and spontaneously experienced the element of the death of Christ included in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They experienced this because they prayed themselves into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because they were in the Spirit, they experienced the extract of the death of Christ contained in the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There was no need for them to reckon themselves dead, and it was not necessary for them to take the position by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Simply by being in the Spirit, they experienced the effectiveness of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>NO IMITATION OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today we also need to experience the effectiveness of Christ s death in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we are in the Spirit experiencing the extract of Christ s death, our flesh, our temper, and our natural disposition are put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, our natural goodness is terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We even come to hate this natural goodness because we realize that it is something derived from our natural birth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After praying and contacting the Spirit, we realize that God does not want anything that has its source in our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Natural goodness is an imitation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When I was in China, I was bothered by the fact that the behavior of many disciples of Confucius was better than that of many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These disciples of Confucius were patient, kind, sympathetic, and helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, all that good behavior was natural.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It had nothing to do with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The majority of Christians live a life of imitation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Unbelievers can also be kind, humble, patient, and helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This certainly has nothing to do with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we Christians live like this, we are making an imitation of the ointment, something that is strictly forbidden in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Nevertheless, in many religious gatherings, Christians are taught and encouraged to live a life of imitation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They are urged to be kind, loving, and honest, all without Christ and without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is an abomination in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is possible that we may practice the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we do not see the matter of the compound Spirit, in our daily living we may be the same as those who imitate the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The disciples of Confucius practice his ethical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They claim that they have been taught by Confucius and they respect him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is an aspect of Oriental culture.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But in the West something very similar is practiced under the name of Christ and in the atmosphere of Bible teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In both cases, people behave in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The culture of the West has been influenced by the Bible, in much the same way as the culture of China has been influenced by the ethical teachings of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This means that the teachings of Confucius exert a moral influence in China and that the teachings of the Bible exert a moral influence on western culture.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we live according to this influence, we shall have an imitation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Actually, every kind of living that is according to ethics is artificial.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>People may act patient, but this patience is artificial.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There are artificial flowers, and there are real flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Because real flowers are organic, they live and grow.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In these flowers, there is the element of life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Artificial flowers may have the same color, shape, and appearance as real flowers, but they do not contain the element of life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Certain Christians and certain disciples of Confucius may behave in a way that is humble, patient, and loving.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Their humility, patience, and love outwardly may seem to be the same as the fruit of the Spirit described in Galatians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, the fruit of the Spirit is organic and full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But good natural behavior according to ethics is a dead work.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It does not have anything of life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Those who live according to the ethics of Confucius have dead works.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then what about those Christians who imitate the Spirit by living according to their natural goodness?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In their case also there is a kind of living that is artificial and lifeless, an imitation of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should not take this word concerning the compound Spirit merely as a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Rather, we need to understand it in an experiential way and learn to apply it in a practical way.</S>
