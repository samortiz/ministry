You need to emphatically make an announcement to the church in your locality and beg the brothers and sisters to pray for the practice of the new way. You need to pray specifically for this matter in the prayer meeting of the church. If the Lord so leads you, you may declare a fast with prayer for that day. That would be the best thing to do. You should also ask the brothers and sisters to pray privately and daily for the practice of the new way. They should pray not only for one or two months, but for a long time, perhaps for at least a year, and see how the Lord will hear their prayers. You know, and I truly believe, that the prayer of the church is particularly effective. This is not a small matter. You must do this. Although the practice of the new way requires human labor and striving, we still need to trust in prayer. What the Lord wants us to do can only be accomplished by Himself. He cannot do it without us, but even if He has us, we still need to pray to cooperate with Him. Personally, I feel that in the Lord's work, regardless of what we do, if prayer is overlooked, there will be a great lack. Therefore, we need to pray in everything. The more prayer there is, the more we will see the Lord work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEARING FRUIT FOR THE LORD</H2><P>Second, you need to explain to the brothers and sisters and even beg them to realize that the first step of this new way that the Lord is leading us to take is to bear fruit for the Lord. If we do not bear fruit, we will offend the Lord, and we will owe the Lord something because He has sent us to go to preach the gospel (Matt. 28:19) and has also appointed us to bear fruit (John 15:16). We need to bear at least one fruit a year. If we cannot do even this, it will be hard for us to give an account to Him. For this reason, you need to speak clearly to the brothers and sisters that they all have to pick up this burden to preach the gospel to save sinners. It does not matter whether or not one takes the new way; as long as he is pursuing the Lord, he must bear fruit. Here in Taiwan, where we are, there are people everywhere. It is as if fish were jumping at our feet, yet we still ignore them. We do not need to go to the sea to catch fish; the "fish" are already before us. If we still would not stretch forth our hands to save others, we will really have no words with which to defend ourselves.</P><P>Moreover, it is to our loss if we do not bear fruit. One day we will all have to stand before the judgment seat of Christ. Matthew 25 clearly shows us that every saved person has received gifts from God, some more and some less, and that they should exercise these gifts to make more profit for the Lord. When He comes back, we all must go before Him to give an account. If we have not borne fruit and have not brought people to the Lord, we will be condemned by Him as slothful and evil slaves and will lose the kingdom reward (Matt. 25:14-19, 24-30). Therefore, from this time on, every brother and sister needs to receive grace to bear fruit for the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY TO BEAR FRUIT</H2><P>Regarding the way to bear fruit, everyone first needs to make a list of all their unsaved relatives, friends, colleagues, classmates, or neighbors. You should keep one copy for yourself and should give one copy to the church. When you write down the names, you must do it in a clear way. The list should include one's name, relationship, age, address, and telephone number. Second, have all those who are willing to set aside three hours a week for the definite preaching of the gospel sign their names. If there are some who cannot do this due to their poor health or lack of time, yet are burdened to pray, they can also submit their names, together with the time and frequency for which they have committed themselves to pray. In this way, you will know and will have a record of the number and condition of those who will go out to preach the gospel and of those who will pray at home.</P><P>Third, you should check occasionally with those who have submitted their names to be the praying ones for the practice of the new way. You may do this once every three months or once a month. During the group meetings or after the Lord's table meeting, you may ask them to give some testimonies in order to remind them. This can be done very easily. Those for whom the greater effort is required are the ones who have submitted their names for going out to preach the gospel every week. As elders you yourselves must first learn how to go out to visit people and bring them to the Lord. Only after you have learned this can you gather others together and train and teach them to do the same. Then, according to the practical situation, you may divide them into groups. Every elder must personally take the lead in a group. At the beginning, you need to demonstrate everything to them. This is to deliver them from their natural way and to put their trust in the way we have discovered through our study. After a while, you can let them work by themselves while you take oversight over them.</P><P>Furthermore, in training others, you need to have definite principles concerning every point. You must not be vague, but must be clear and definite. You should not speak things which leave others bewildered, but should apply the exact medicine needed for the sickness. When we go out to preach the gospel, we do not need to socialize or to try to compliment people. We need only to exercise the Lord's authority and act according to the Lord's command, bringing people to believe, to be baptized, and to be saved (Mark 16:16). You have to believe that whatever we do in the Lord's name will count. We are the ambassadors of Christ and are here to preach the gospel of peace, bringing people into subjection to Christ and to a reconciliation with God. While our attitude needs to be meek, our words need to be definite and strong. In short, we all need to be trained in God's New Testament economy and in God's ordained way. In addition, we need to teach and perfect others to speak for God and to lead people to salvation.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
