   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Loving Greetings and Warning</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 19 says, The churches of Asia greet you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Aquila and Prisca greet you much in the Lord, with the church which is in their house.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that the church in Ephesus met in the house of Aquila and Prisca when they lived there Acts 18:18-19, 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When they lived in Rome, the church in Rome met in their home Rom 16:5; see Col 4:15-16; Philem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verses 10 through 21 present a picture of the actual practice of the Body life in a beautiful harmony, not only among the apostle and his co-workers, but also between them and the churches for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we have seen, this building up is emphasized strongly in chapters twelve through fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 22 Paul declares, If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord comes!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Greek word anathema denotes a thing or person accursed; set apart, devoted, to woe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To love God makes us those who are blessed of God to share the divine blessings He has ordained and prepared for us beyond our apprehension 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not to love the Lord makes us those who are accursed, set apart to a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a serious warning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The sentence, The Lord comes! is actually a translation of the Greek word maranatha, a phrase taken from Aramaic.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It may also be rendered, Our Lord come!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is an exclamation that reminds us of the Lord s second coming with judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 23 says, The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we pointed out in a foregoing message, this grace is the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit to bring the processed God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a rule, Paul concludes his Epistles with a word concerning grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in this Epistle he ends with a word of love: My love be with you all in Christ Jesus v. 24 . This is not natural love, but love in Christ, love in resurrection 4:21 , the love of God that becomes ours through the grace of Christ and the fellowship of the Spirit 2 Cor 13:14 . Of Paul s fourteen Epistles, only this one ends with such a word of the assurance of love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is because of the apostle s dealings with strong rebukes 1:13; 3:3; 4:7-8; 5:2, 5; 6:5-8; 11:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is faithful, honest, and frank to them in the love of God in Christ 2 Cor 2:4 , without any politics.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, the Lord honors his dealings so that the Corinthians accept his rebuke and gain much benefit through their repentance 2 Cor 7:8-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Corinthians concludes in a pleasant spirit with a pleasant picture of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although it is a book of dealings and rebukes, it ends in such a pleasant way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It shows us that in the ancient time there was a sweet fellowship among the co-workers, between the co-workers and the churches, and among all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The co-workers and the churches were all in this pleasant fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have seen that the second section of this Epistle covers five matters related to God s administration: headship, the Body, the gifts, resurrection, and material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s administration requires the headship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then to carry out the divine administration under God s headship, there is the need of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the Body is to carry out God s administration, all the members of the Body need gifts for functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, we have the headship, the Body, and the gifts, the abilities.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, there is the need for power, strength.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Resurrection life enables the members to function with their gifts so that the Body may operate to carry out God s administration under His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The last item covered in this section money and material possessions is a test to prove how much we are living in resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The very practical test of material possessions is a matter related to the first day of every week.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A day refers to our living.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The kind of living we have depends on the kind of day we have.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are defeated in our living, this means that we have a day of defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moreover, if we live in the old creation, we are living in the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if we are living in the resurrection life, we are living in the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are not in resurrection, we are through with the gifts, the Body, and God s headship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, if we live in the first day of the week, that is, live in resurrection life, then we are surely under God s headship, we are in the Body, and we exercise our gifts in a profitable way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then we shall have a daily living that declares to the universe that we are those who live a life absolutely in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To Christ, the last enemy is death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But to us, the last enemy is mammon, material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Resurrection life enables us to overcome the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Resurrection is also the power for Christ to rule over the rebellious ones and subdue all His enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The last enemy that will be subdued by Him is death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As the continuation of chapter fifteen, chapter sixteen indicates that the resurrection life in us overcomes our final enemy material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From observation and experience, I can testify that with many spiritual people, the last matter to be overcome is the matter of money.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some Christians are victorious over their temper, their weakness, and their sin, but they are not victorious in the area of material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From the time I was a young Christian, the Lord began to discipline me in the matter of money and material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord trained me to use money for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even as a young person, I used any money I had to print gospel tracts I had written.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After some experience, I can truly testify that material possessions are the last enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, from experience I realize that the overcoming of material things in chapter sixteen is both a continuation and a conclusion of the matter of resurrection dealt with in chapter fifteen.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Praise the Lord that we have the headship, the Body, the gifts, the resurrection, and the victory over material possessions!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The victory proves that we are living in the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are not those living in the Sabbath, that is, in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are a people of the Lord s Day living in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By resurrection life, we have overcome everything, and everything is under our feet.</S>
