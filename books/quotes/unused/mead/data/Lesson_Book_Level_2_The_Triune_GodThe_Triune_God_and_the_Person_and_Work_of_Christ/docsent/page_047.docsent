   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. HIS TRANSFIGURATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Next we would like to see that in His resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although the Lord Jesus was resurrected with a physical body, a body with flesh and bones Luke 24:39 , He was also resurrected spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that in His resurrection He was transfigured into the Spirit John 7:37-39; 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We cannot explain how He could both have a body and at the same time become the Spirit, but that is what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a major point in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We see that Christ is sitting on the throne in the heavens with a physical body, yet at the same time, He is dwelling in us as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's economy is to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His death redeemed us, but without His resurrection He could not dispense His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We were not only sinful, we were also dead Eph 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the Lamb of God, Christ can redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But as the life-giving Spirit He can enliven us and regenerate us to become the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now, day after day, we can enjoy the rich supply of life that is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can pray, call on His name, and pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is now so available to us because of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ's resurrection is not just a historical event; it is very much for our inward experience and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>HIS PRODUCING OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The death and resurrection of Christ were very productive steps in God's economy: He released His divine life and propagated spread Himself into many people to make them the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the Gospel of John, prior to His resurrection, the Lord never called His disciples "brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The most intimate term He used was "friends."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But after His resurrection, His "friends" were regenerated to become His "brothers" John 20:17; 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the evening of the day of His resurrection, Christ came back to His disciples as the Spirit and breathed Himself into them to be their life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was through His resurrection that the Lord was able to impart Himself as the life-giving Spirit into all His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By receiving His life, they were regenerated and became His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, in His resurrection, the only begotten Son became "the Firstborn among many brothers" Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through Christ's resurrection, the divine life of the Father has been imparted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, we all have become sons of God and brothers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Praise the Lord that Christ, the God-man, is our elder Brother!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is not ashamed to call us His brothers Heb 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What a wonder!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do you realize who you are?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You are a brother of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the same principle as that of the grain of wheat in John 12:24.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The many brothers are the many grains of wheat, and these many grains are blended together to form the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore 1 Corinthians 10:17 tells us that "we who are many are one bread, one Body."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The many grains have become one loaf, one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The one Body, of course, refers to the church as the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church is just the duplication and multiplication of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Praise the Lord for His resurrection!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many Christians speak a great deal about Christ's death on the cross, but rarely do they talk about Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When they do, they only speak about how the Lord rose up from the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They consider His resurrection to be only a historical event that happened two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They celebrate it one day of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That is too shallow!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In just two lessons we have seen some of the tremendous items of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must be thankful for the wonderful riches that the Lord has shown us from His Word in these days.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We encourage you to dig into these matters even more and to enjoy Christ as the resurrected One in us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>QUESTIONS Explain how Christ's divine life was glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ was the Son of God before His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Why does Romans 1:3-4 say that He was designated the Son of God out of the resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Which two verses clearly tell us that Christ is now the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Why was Christ called the "only begotten Son" in John 1:18, but was called the "Firstborn" in Romans 8:29.</S>
