   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INQUIRING OF THE LORD IN ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND DOING EVERYTHING WITH HIM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today our greatest lack is that we do not exercise to live with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all need this kind of exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you go to buy a suit, you should say, Lord, what should I do in this situation?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Which kind of material do you think that I should get?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Should I buy this style or that style?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those of us who love the Lord and are of the Lord are truly different from the rest of the people on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who do not love the Lord and are not of the Lord are merely who they are in themselves and nothing more.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As such, they are under Satan s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We, however, are different.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are not solely who we are in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have the Lord Jesus living with us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He lives in our mind, emotion, will, wisdom, and in our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since the Lord is with us and in us, we must allow Him to live in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all need to make the decision to practice to live with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Making this decision is like signing our name to an agreement.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once we have made this decision, it is as if we have signed our name.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From that time on we must have this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not enough to practice only when we are pray-reading or when we are in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must practice in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a sister speaks to her husband, she should not think in her heart, Since I am not talking to the president or to a judge but only to my husband, it is does not matter how I speak.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The married sisters should not think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is probably true that your husband is not the president or a judge, but the Lord Jesus is within you while you are speaking to your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus is higher than the president.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is within you as life, and He wants you to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When you are about to converse with your husband, you must check with the Lord within.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You should say to the Lord, Lord Jesus, how would You speak?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this situation be my thinking, my joy, my anger, my sorrow, my delight, and my everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the practical way to exercise to live with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In every matter, great or small, we must exercise to take the Lord Jesus as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is our destiny to live by the Lord Jesus moment by moment, to live constantly with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When you are about to lose your temper, immediately you should call, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am about to lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Please come and lose Your temper!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You have to invite the Lord Jesus to lose your temper for you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sisters often give their husbands a long face.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, from now on whenever you are about to have a long face, right away you should call, O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you want the Lord to live with you, you also have to live with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I also suggest to the brothers that whenever you are about to give a message, you must exercise to live with the Lord by praying, O Lord, You give this message!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You should never again give a message that the Lord Jesus is not giving, and you should never again give a message with words that the Lord who is in you would not say.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You have to live with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the Lord does not speak, you should by no means speak.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>EXERCISING THE SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>AND FOLLOWING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord uses our spirit as the base.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our experience tells us that we can drive the Lord out of our mind, out of our emotions, and even out of the message that we are giving.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, we can never drive the Lord out of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is in our spirit, and we cannot chase Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No matter what, He always remains in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Perhaps then you would ask me, Since the Lord Jesus does not go away, why is my spirit still depressed sometimes?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Your spirit is depressed because the Lord Jesus in your spirit is depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You should remember that whenever your spirit is low, it is low because the Lord Jesus in your spirit is low.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He has no way out of our spirit because you have forced Him to be depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When you live by the Lord, do not believe in your feelings and do not exercise your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, you should exercise your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Within you there is a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A child does not initially understand that he has legs, but when you put him on the floor, eventually he will use his legs and begin to crawl.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is no need for you to teach a child to stand, for eventually he will stand up on his two legs.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He does not understand his legs, yet he knows how to use them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the same way, it does not matter how little you know about your spirit; you still know how to use your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do not think too much and do not go by your emotions, being happy when you are stirred up and downhearted when you are not.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do not pay attention to these things.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Simply mind your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is the same when you are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When you pray, do not pay attention to your thoughts and do not stay in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Pray quick and simple prayers from your spirit, using just two to three sentences to hit the point.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When many brothers and sisters pray, they go on and on, uttering long, wordy, and aimless prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Imagine if you were the Lord listening to this kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Would not your patience run out?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Instead of depending on your wordiness, pray by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Do not give histories or speak doctrines when you pray.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you feel that the Lord is lovely, just say, Lord, You are so lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>That is enough; there is no need to say more.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I have discovered that some of you have a new way of singing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You pick only one hymn, and then you pray-sing it verse by verse.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I am not criticizing or correcting you.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I wish only to say that there should not be any method to our singing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Everything and everyone should be according to spirit with no set method.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Perhaps today when we sing a hymn, we may pray-read the whole hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Then perhaps tomorrow after we finish singing the hymn, we may not pray-read at all.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The hymn singing should be something living.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It should not be according to any set way.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This does not mean that you should purposely learn different ways to sing, because the different ways that you learn would also become set ways.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Every one of us should learn to live in spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>There is no need to have a set method in picking hymns, singing hymns, or pray-reading, because we are all living with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In our daily living, it is easy to live alone.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>For example, it may be quite convenient for a young lady to live and walk by herself.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>However, once she gets married, her life as a married person may become more difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The husband has his ways, and the wife also has her ways.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>A married person has to live his life with another person.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Our Lord s living with us is even more involved than the living together of a husband and wife, for He is living right within us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>No matter how close your husband is to you, he cannot live inside of you, and he cannot be your life or your person.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>However, our Lord lives inside of us to be our person.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Thus, we absolutely must exercise to have the habit of going along with Him rather than having Him go along with us.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The Lord told Peter, You follow Me John 21:22b .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>When the Lord said this, He was already in resurrection, and shortly after He said this, He ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Once the Lord ascended to the heavens, how could Peter follow Him?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Peter could follow the Lord because the Lord not only ascended to the heavens, He also entered into Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>How do we follow the Lord today?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Someone once told me, The way to follow the Lord is to do whatever the Lord did.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>He left us a model.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Gradually, I discovered that this is the religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Today the Lord lives in our spirit, so whenever He makes a move in our spirit, we just follow.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This is the way to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>You and I are no longer single today.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We all have this wonderful One living in us to be our life and our person.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>He wants us to put ourselves aside completely and to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Our mind should be filled with His mind, and our emotions should be filled with His emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>He wants our entire being and our entire living to be filled with His element.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>He can sympathize with us, but He does not want to take our way.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Thus, we must learn from Him and follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>He is in our spirit, so we also have to learn to release our spirit, exercise our spirit, use our spirit, and turn back to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Each time we turn back to our spirit, we touch the Lord, because the Lord is there.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>I hope that the brothers and sisters do not take this only as a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Instead, I hope that you would promise to practice, to exercise, living with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>NOT CEASING TO CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>According to my experience, I suggest that if you want to live by the Lord, you should not cease calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>You must call on the name of the Lord continually.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Besides this there is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Do not think that calling on the name of the Lord is of no importance.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>The Lord s name is real, for His name denotes His person.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>If a certain brother is dead or not present, then for me to call his name is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>However, if he is real, living, and present, then when I call him, he will come to me right away.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Jesus is our Lord s name, and the Spirit is His person.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Once you call Lord Jesus, the Spirit is here.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Do you want to receive the life-giving Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Just call, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>When you call, He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Perhaps you would say that this is all superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>If you believe this, then let us call on the philosophers.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Let us say, O Plato!</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>O Socrates, where are you?</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>O Confucius, I love you!</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>You may love these ones and call upon their names, but they will not respond.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>But if you simply call O Lord Jesus! mysteriously you will be filled with feeling within.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>The more you call, the more feeling you will have.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Why is it that when you call on a philosopher or a sage, you have no feeling within, but when you call on the Lord Jesus, you do?</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>This is because all the philosophers are dead and are not here.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Only the Lord Jesus died but lives again.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>He is real, He is living, and He is experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>He is right here, and He is even inside of you.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>When you call on Him, your spirit will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>However, all calling is not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>If while remaining in your mind, you call with your mouth O Lord Jesus! nothing will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>When some electrical switches are turned on, the electrical current comes in right away.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>However, when other electrical switches are turned on, the electrical current still does not come.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>This illustrates that not all calling is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>Never think that calling on the Lord is a superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>It is a spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>Our Lord is the Spirit today within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>When we call on Him from our spirit O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>I love You! there is such a sweetness within.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>Even when you are reading the Bible, do not use your mind to think.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>Call O Lord Jesus as you read, and you will be refreshed within.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>This is the way to call on the name of the Lord and to pray-read the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>I hope that every brother and sister would practice this kind of living with the Lord every day.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>In all the churches all the brothers and sisters should be led to live in this practice of living with the Lord.</S>
