   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN EVERYONE DILIGENTLY LEARNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TRUTH THE FAILURE OF CHRISTIANITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will consider the failure of Christianity over the past two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This failure lies in the fact that only famous speakers speak in their meetings, and the audience does nothing but listen.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This can be compared to a person being required only to listen to famous teachers at school.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He listens in elementary school, high school, college, and even in graduate school, but he does not do any work on his own.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The end result is that he can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He may have listened to lectures on chemistry, mathematics, and other subjects, but he has gained nothing and consequently has no usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many among us have been saved for a long time and have been meeting regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, not many can clearly speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not many can give a clear word on the parts of man, the function of each part, or even the difference between justification and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our continual listening to famous speakers has caused us to become loose in our life practices and to lose our pursuit in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The result of our listening to famous speakers is that we do not endeavor to study the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have wasted our time and have gained nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is our failure.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this reason we are determined to change the system, but this is not easy to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have raised up numerous churches during the past fifty years, and we have learned much from our observation and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without a doubt all the saints love the Lord, the church, and the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By 1984, however, we saw that the churches in the Lord s recovery, whether in Taiwan or in America, had become lukewarm.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church in Taipei has decreased in number instead of increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In spite of all the faithful labor, there is no result.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is also the situation in all of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our practice has been wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not have allowed the brothers and sisters to always listen to famous speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to attend classes and study.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I hope that the saints in the Lord s recovery would not be Christians who only listen to famous speakers; rather, we would be Christians who attend classes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE NEED FOR EDUCATION</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The best example that proves the success of education is Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is difficult to find a society as stable, prosperous, abundant in knowledge, and excellent in manpower as Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The primary reason for this situation is the availability of education.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many people have received higher education and are able to develop products that can compete in the world market.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a result, many riches have been brought to this country.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This accomplishment has caused much admiration among Westerners.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we built the workers home in 1954, we imported flush toilets from abroad because plumbing equipment in Taiwan was outdated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The flush toilets presently used in Taiwan, however, are more advanced than those in America.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Success in education has enabled Taiwan to achieve what it was unable to achieve thirty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Over the past thirty years, the people in Taiwan have become educated, and their knowledge has developed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If this can happen in a nation, it can happen in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everything in Taiwan today is advanced, but everything in the church is still according to the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even though the Lord has blessed us abundantly, we delay Him because we maintain our old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is reasonable for us to maintain our strong points, but to maintain our old practices is a dreadful and serious mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, whether we are young or old, we need to change.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First, we need a change in concept, and second, we need a change in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must all start afresh to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The practice in Christianity has unconsciously bound all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This practice requires the saints only to attend a Sunday service and give a monetary offering.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such a practice annuls the function of the saints and edifies only the preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may say that we do not have this practice among us, but the principle of everyone listening to a famous speaker is equivalent to this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The brothers and sisters have developed the habit of sitting in the meetings and listening to gifted brothers give messages.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This habit annuls the gift we have received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have all been regenerated by the Lord and have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This life brings us a gift as our function.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This can be compared to a newborn baby who has a complete set of internal organs.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Having a complete set of organs does not mean that the baby is fully developed in function.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It simply means that the baby has complete organs.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As the baby grows, the function of each organ will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Function is the issue of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When a child grows to a certain stage, he will begin to speak, and when he reaches another stage, he can learn to read.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This also applies to the gift a person receives when he is regenerated; the function of the gift is manifested through his growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are living Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Since we have been regenerated and have God s life in us, we should grow in life in order for our function to be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If after two years a child cannot speak, his mother will worry even to the extent of losing her appetite, because she is concerned that the child might be dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our practice in the churches has made people dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many saints in the churches have listened to messages for decades and have become dumb because they do not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the contrary, many young people like to speak, but they do not have any content.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, the crucial point is not merely to speak but to speak with content.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This depends on education.</S>
