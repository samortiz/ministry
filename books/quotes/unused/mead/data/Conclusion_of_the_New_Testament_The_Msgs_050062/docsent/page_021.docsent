   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>34.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The One Being Formed within Them</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Galatians 4:19 Paul says, "My children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ was born into the Galatian believers, but not formed in them when they were regenerated through Paul's preaching the gospel to them the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The apostle then travailed again that Christ might be formed in them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ, a living person, was the focus of Paul's gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His preaching was to bring forth Christ, the Son of the living God, in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul's preaching was emphatically Christ-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the book of Galatians, Christ has been revealed in us 1:16 , He is now living in us 2:20 , and He will be formed in us 4:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ grown in us in full.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Christ was born into us at our conversion, now He lives in us in our Christian life, and He will be formed in us at our maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul's word about Christ being formed in us implies that we are being constituted of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To have Christ formed in us is a living, organic matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is now living in us so that we may be constituted of Him organically.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He intends to constitute our being our mind, emotion, and will of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He will constitute every part of our soul so that we may have His form, His image, in every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word "formed" in Galatians 4:19 corresponds to the word "image" in 2 Corinthians 3:18, where Paul tells us that we are being transformed into Christ's image.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This image is a form.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ must be formed in us so that we may express Him by being in His image.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The indwelling Christ is living in us, He is being formed in us, and He is becoming our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In our thinking, for example, we should take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do this, His element will become part of the very constitution of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, our entire being will be constituted of the element of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a result, our constitution will simply be Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second stanza of #499 in Hymns speaks of Christ being formed in us:</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Oh, what a joy!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Oh, what a rest!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ now is being formed in me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His very nature and life divine</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In my whole being inwrought shall be.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All that I am came to an end,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And all of Christ is all to me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This stanza of the hymn was written with Galatians 4:19 as the basis.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For Christ to be formed within us means that His element is being constituted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In other words, His being becomes our being, and His constitution becomes our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not merely a matter of the element of Christ being within us but of having the element of Christ constituted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be constituted of Christ in this way involves a process of organic transformation and formation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this process something living is being constituted into, wrought into, our being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The New Testament reveals that Christ is deeply related to our being.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is not merely a concept, theory, or theology.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a divine fact that we need to experience in full.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is a fact that Christ with His element dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As the living One, He with His element is working within us organically, constituting Himself into our being so that we may have His form and express His image.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul travailed that Christ might be formed in the believers in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, "We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Being transformed into Christ's image from glory to glory is not a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Doctrine cannot transform us into Christ's image.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This transforming work can be accomplished only as our being is constituted of Christ's living element.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then we can be transformed into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our Christ today is the One who lives in us and also the One who is being formed in our being by constituting us of His divine element.</S>
