<h1 class="title">THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST IN US</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:24-27; 2:2; Eph. 3:4; John 20:22; 1 Cor. 15:45</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE CONTAINING A MYSTERY</h2>
<p>The Bible, the greatest book on earth, is the most complete book, revealing many things concerning God, the universe, and man. A person today can learn more than the greatest philosophers of the past simply by reading the Bible. However, there is one thing in the Bible called a mystery, which is something that is hidden and difficult to comprehend. An example of a mystery is the physical human life. We know that we have something called life, but no one has ever seen it. We recognize that a machine does not have life, and we know that death is the absence of life. However, we still cannot exactly define life. A medical examination cannot locate life within a person. This indicates that life is a mystery. It is unquestionably real, yet it is hidden, invisible, and beyond understanding. Just as there is a mystery in our physical body called life, there is also a mystery in the Bible. Many great teachers have read and thought that they understood the Bible, yet they never saw the mystery in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAUL&rsquo;S STEWARDSHIP BEING<br />
TO COMPLETE THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:24-25 says, &ldquo;The church; of which I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God.&rdquo; <em>Minister</em> means &ldquo;one who serves.&rdquo; Attendants on an airplane meet the needs of the passengers, serving them with food and drink. Paul was a minister because he served the churches with Christ. Paul&rsquo;s stewardship was to complete the word of God. Before Paul&rsquo;s writing, much of the Bible already existed, but without Paul&rsquo;s writing, the word of God would not be complete. Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles are the completion of the word of God. Many Bible translations, including the King James Version, do not adequately translate <em>to complete the word of God</em> in verse 25. Paul&rsquo;s books are as crucial to the Bible as our heart is to our body. A person&rsquo;s heart is not easy to see. Many Bible readers do not know that the heart of the Bible is Paul&rsquo;s writings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF GOD BEING THE MYSTERY</h2>
<p>Verses 26 through 27 say, &ldquo;The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints; to whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles.&rdquo; According to the Greek grammar, <em>the word of God</em> at the end of verse 25 is <em>the mystery</em> at the beginning of verse 26. The completion of God&rsquo;s word in Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles reveals the mystery, that which is hidden and beyond understanding.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERY BEING CHRIST IN US</h2>
<p>Verse 27 goes on to reveal that the mystery is Christ in us. Christ in us is the mystery, the completion of the word of God. In today&rsquo;s age people reject superstition and demand scientific explanations. However, Christ being in us is a mystery. It is not something that we can substantiate by our physical senses or mental comprehension, yet we believe it. It is not superstitious or scientific, but it is real.</p>
<p>For nearly two thousand years countless Christians have read the Bible but have not seen the mystery revealed in Colossians 1:26-27. When most people read the Bible, they see only outward rules and regulations. These things are easy to see, like a person&rsquo;s nose, ears, and arms. However, like a person&rsquo;s heart, the mystery in the Bible, which is Christ in us, is real and living but difficult to perceive. This mystery was &ldquo;hidden from the ages and from the generations.&rdquo; Even the Old Testament patriarchs, kings, and prophets did not know the mystery of God. Eventually, God raised up Paul and sent him to complete the word of God.</p>
<p>Christ in us is the heart of the Bible, and it is also the heart of our being. Before we believed in Christ, we were lifeless corpses. When we repented, believed in the Lord, and called upon His name, a heart was transplanted into us. That heart is Christ in us.</p>
<p>When I first came to the United States, I found that the Christians were not aware of two crucial things. First, very few knew that they had a human spirit, and hardly anyone talked about the human spirit. Second, I discovered that most Christians in the United States did not believe that Christ is in the believers. When I began to teach that Christ is in us, some began to publish books to oppose this teaching. They said that I made Christ small by saying that He is in us. They believed that because Christ is unlimited and great, man is too small to contain Him. Romans 8:34 says that Christ is at the right hand of God, but verse 10 of the same chapter says that Christ is in us. This is a mystery. Moreover, Ephesians 4:6 says that the Father is in all, which means that the Father is in us. John 14:23 indicates that the Father and the Son make a mutual abode with us. Finally, in John 15:4 the Lord said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you.&rdquo; Christ abides in us, and we abide in Him. The meaning of <em>abide</em> implies that Christ is not only in us but also remains and makes His dwelling in us.</p>
<p>Christ being in us is the mystery and the completion of the word of God, the heart of the Bible. Christ is in every believer. Colossians 1:27 says that Christ in us is the hope of glory. We can express Christ because He is in us.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE MYSTERY OF GOD AND<br />
THE CHURCH BEING THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Colossians 2:2 says that Christ is the mystery of God. Because God is hidden, invisible, and beyond understanding, He is a mystery. As the embodiment of God, Christ is the mystery of God (v. 9). Because Christ is in us, God is in us.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 3:4 Paul mentions the mystery of Christ. Verse 6 reveals that the mystery of Christ is His Body, the church. The church today as the Body of Christ is a mystery. Unbelievers cannot understand why we believers love one another even though we are of different ages and nationalities. We are joyful and love one another because Christ is within us.</p>
<p>God is a mystery, Christ is a mystery, the church is a mystery, and even the believers are a mystery (John 3:8). Our acquaintances may not understand why we regularly attend church meetings. The mystery in the Bible is Christ in us, the mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE WORD,<br />
GOD, THE LAMB OF GOD, AND A MAN</h2>
<p>Christ is a wonderful person. There are many expressions and titles used to describe Christ in the Bible. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; The Word is Christ (v. 14). It is wonderful that, as the Word, Christ was with God and also was God. Furthermore, according to verse 14, &ldquo;the Word became flesh.&rdquo; This flesh was the man Jesus. Thus, Christ as the Word is both God and man; He is a wonderful God-man. Our limited mind thinks of God and man as distinct and separate. However, God and man became one in Christ.</p>
<p>John 1:29 says, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; Christ is the Lamb of God. According to Exodus 12, a lamb is for redemption. Again, it is wonderful that Christ, who is God, could become the Lamb of God. Christ&rsquo;s name is Wonderful, because we cannot explain Him (Isa. 9:6).</p>
<p>Christ died on the cross as a man and also as God. We cannot explain how God could die. Charles Wesley wrote in a hymn, &ldquo;Amazing love! how can it be / That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me? / &rsquo;Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies!&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #296). The One who died on the cross was God, the eternal Word who became a man and as the Lamb of God took away our sin.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST RESURRECTING AS THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT TO ENTER INTO THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>After dying on the cross and being buried for three days, Christ rose from the dead. On the night of His resurrection, He appeared to His disciples in a way that we cannot comprehend. The disciples were in a room, and all the doors were shut because the disciples were afraid of the Jews (John 20:19). Suddenly, Jesus was standing in their midst. Because He did not come through a door, the disciples thought that He was a spirit, or a ghost (Luke 24:37). But He said, &ldquo;Peace be to you,&rdquo; and He showed them His hands and His side (John 20:19-20). Was Christ physical or spiritual? If He was physical, how could He come in when the doors were shut? If He was spiritual, how could His disciples touch His hands and His side? We cannot explain this&mdash;it is wonderful.</p>
<p>John 20:22 says, &ldquo;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; When the Lord disappeared, He did not go away, for He had entered into His disciples. Just before His crucifixion He had told His disciples that He was going away (13:33). When Peter and the other disciples heard this, they were saddened. The Lord told them, &ldquo;Do not let your heart be troubled...I am coming again...I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality...He abides with you and shall be in you&rdquo; (14:1, 3, 16-17). The Lord was not satisfied merely to be with His disciples outwardly. He explained that He needed to go in order to be able to enter into them. To enter into His believers as life, He had to go through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). After rising from the dead, Christ was able to enter into His believers as the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15 deals with resurrection. Verse 45 says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; The last Adam, who was Christ in the flesh, became the life-giving Spirit through death and resurrection. Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>Spirit,</em> which is <em>pneuma,</em> may be translated also as &ldquo;breath.&rdquo; As the Spirit, the Lord is the holy breath; He is like the air. Because we are surrounded by air, when we breathe, the air gets into us. As a result, we are in the air, and the air is in us. Likewise, when we pray and call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, He enters into us. We abide in Him, and He abides in us.</p>
<p>Today Christ is not only the Word, God, a man, and the Lamb of God but also the life-giving Spirit. As the Lord of all (Acts 10:36), He is in the heavens, but as the life-giving Spirit, He is in us. Thus, He is at the right hand of God (Rom. 8:34), and He is also in us (v. 10). Christ is both in the heavens and in us, just as electricity is both in a distant power plant and simultaneously in many buildings. We worship Christ as the Lord of all, and we enjoy and experience Him as the Spirit. Because Christ is the Spirit, He is able to be in us as our life (Col. 3:4). Christ being in us is the mystery that is the heart of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AS RECEIVERS OF CHRIST AND<br />
MEMBERS OF THE BODY OF CHRIST,<br />
BELIEVERS SPONTANEOUSLY EXPRESSING CHRIST</h2>
<p>As Christians, we are not disciples of a philosopher but receivers of Christ. Light bulbs shine because they are receivers of electricity. When they receive electricity, they spontaneously shine. The Christian life is the shining of Christ from within. Christ is within us as our life, life-supply, power, strength, wisdom, patience, kindness, love, and everything. When we live Him, He expresses Himself through us. Then when we come together, we are the church, the Body of Christ, for Christ&rsquo;s expression. Christ is not a religion but a living person. We do not care for outward regulations. Instead, we have Christ in us, which is the mystery that has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to us and has become our experience. Because we daily experience this mystery, we are living members of the Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING FILLED WITH CHRIST<br />
TO LIVE AND EXPRESS CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 13:14; Col. 1:27; Gen. 1:26; Rom. 9:21; Gal. 1:14-16; 2:20; Phil. 3:7-14; 1:20-21</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL LINE AND GOAL OF THE BIBLE BEING THE DISPENSING OF GOD INTO MAN</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals to us that God had a good pleasure in eternity past (Eph. 1:5). According to His good pleasure, He made a purpose in eternity (v. 9). To fulfill His eternal purpose, He planned to dispense Himself into a group of human beings. The Bible calls this dispensing the economy of God (Eph. 1:10; 3:9; 1 Tim. 1:4).</p>
<p>A kitchen is a place of dispensing. First, the cook must consider how many people need to be fed and what to feed them. When these matters have been decided, a plan will be formed. To feed people is to dispense food into them. The dispensing of food implies not only that food enters into a person but also that the food is digested and assimilated by the person. In less than one day, the food that we eat becomes part of our tissues and cells. We may be familiar with the saying, &ldquo;You are what you eat.&rdquo; This means that we become what we eat. For instance, a man who eats fish every day will eventually be constituted with fish. He becomes fish by eating fish. We eat, digest, and assimilate food until we are constituted with the food. This is dispensing.</p>
<p>In eternity past God set up the universe as a great kitchen. Christ is the food in this kitchen. In John 6:35 Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life.&rdquo; Christ is our life supply. The church is a dining room; we come to the meetings to eat. God&rsquo;s economy is God&rsquo;s dispensing of Himself into us. The central line and goal of the entire Bible are the Triune God dispensing Himself into man. In order to know the Bible, we must see that God wants to dispense Himself into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING TRIUNE FOR HIS DISPENSING</h2>
<p>The word <em>triune,</em> which comes from Latin, means three-one. The Triune God is the three-one God. He is three, yet He is one. There is only one unique God, yet this God is three, for He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit are one God. God is triune in order to dispense Himself into man. The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow. As the source, the course, and the flow, the Triune God flows into us. This flow is His dispensing.</p>
<p>Once we are saved, the Triune God flows in us every day. In 2 Corinthians 13:14 Paul says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; The love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit are not three separate matters but three aspects of one thing. The fellowship of the Spirit is the flow. When this flow is in us, the grace of Christ and the love of God are also in us. Thus, the entire Triune God is flowing in us, and we are in the central line and goal of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST, THE MYSTERY OF GOD, BEING IN US</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that Christ, who is the mystery of God (Col. 2:2), is in us as a mystery (1:27). Christ is God (John 1:1, 14), the Father (Isa. 9:6), the Son (Matt. 3:17), and the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). Because Christ embodies the entire Triune God (Col. 2:9), when Christ is in us, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in us. This is why Christ in us is a mystery.</p>
<p>Before a brother was saved, he may have lost his temper whenever he became upset with his wife. He may have even enjoyed losing his temper. However, once he is saved, the Triune God is flowing in him even when he becomes upset with his wife. He may begin to speak something in anger but then suddenly will become silent, go to his bedroom, and begin to pray. Later he may repent to his wife. She may not understand this radical change in his conduct. This is a mystery&mdash;the mystery of God.</p>
<p>A sister may have liked to go shopping before she was saved. After being saved, however, she may sense a speaking within as she is browsing through a department store. As she considers what to buy, a speaking within may tell her not to purchase certain items; it may even prompt her to leave the store. This is the mystery of God. We need to realize that the mystery of God is a person, Christ, who lives within us.</p>
<p>Since Christ lives in us, we are persons of Christ. A Christian is a Christ-man, a God-man. God desires not good men or bad men but God-men. A God-man is a man who has God living in him and who lives God. God wants us to live Christ, who is the mystery of God.</p><h2 class="head1">MAN BEING MADE TO CONTAIN AND EXPRESS GOD</h2>
<p>When the Bible first mentions man, it says that God made man in His image and according to His likeness (Gen. 1:26). This is a great thing. Man is the most beautiful and lovely creature because he was made according to God. We should not despise or look down on ourselves. We are a picture of God, God&rsquo;s image and His likeness.</p>
<p>Man is a photo of God, but a photo has no life or reality of its own. Before we are saved, we do not have the life, nature, or reality of God. Romans 9:21 reveals that man was made as a vessel to contain God. A glove is made according to the form of a hand so that one day a hand may enter into the glove. The reality of the glove is the hand, for without the hand the glove is empty. Before we are saved, we are like an empty glove. When we are saved, Christ becomes our life, content, and reality, and we become His container and expression. Just as a glove moves only when the hand inside it moves, we move when Christ moves and stay when He stays. We are absolutely one with Him. We are no longer empty vessels but are vessels filled with Christ. A proper Christian is a God-man, a man filled with and expressing Christ. Many Christians who are truly saved do not live and express Christ because they are not filled with Christ. Some become worldly or even fall into sin, but most Christians live uprightly, according to religion, ethics, and morality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FULFILLING GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE BY LIVING CHRIST,<br />
NOT RELIGION, ETHICS, OR MORALITY</h2>
<p>As we have seen, man was made to contain God. However, after man fell away from God and lost God, men invented religion, ethics, and morality to preserve mankind. Without religion, ethics, and morality, human society could not be maintained. Religion is good because it teaches human beings that there is God and that they should fear and worship God, improve their behavior, and do good to glorify God. Ethics teaches that we should honor our parents, love our wife, submit to our husband, take care of our children, love our neighbors and our friends, and do good for society. Morality is also good and necessary for mankind. However, no matter how good these things are, they are not what God wants. God wants us to be filled with Him and to live Him. A glove may be washed, clean, and beautiful, but it will not fulfill its purpose unless it is filled with a hand. God does not want us merely to be a good person. Instead, God wants us to be a God-man, a person who is filled with God and who lives God.</p>
<p>As a young Christian, when I saw well-mannered persons, I thought that it would be good if they became Christians. I hoped that my denomination would gain such persons. When I saw naughty or rough ones, I thought that my denomination should not welcome this kind of person. I judged other Christians entirely according to religion, ethics, and morality. Newly saved ones often think this way. Not long after being saved, I became very religious. As soon as I stepped into the church building, I began to behave reverently&mdash;walking slowly, sitting in a proper seat, and not talking but closing my eyes and praying. However, most of the others came into the church building in a loose way. I inwardly criticized them, asking myself, &ldquo;Do these people think that they are coming into a movie theater? Don&rsquo;t they realize that they are in God&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; To be reverent is good, but it is not God. Rather, it is to be religious.</p>
<p>I am a quick person by nature. Before I was saved, I was bothered when I dealt with anyone who was slow. After being saved, I realized that I should be patient and sympathize with slower ones. I repented and prayed, &ldquo;Lord, help me to be slow. Help me to go along with others.&rdquo; I was mostly successful, and when I failed, I repented and tried to improve. This is ethics. From the time I was saved, whenever I made a mistake or did something wrong, I repented and asked the Lord for forgiveness. After being a Christian for many years, I disciplined and improved myself to the extent that I felt I did not have much need to repent. However, one day the Lord showed me that good behavior is not Christ any more than bad behavior is. Then I began to repent not only of my bad deeds but even more of my good deeds. God does not care for our good deeds; He only wants us to live Christ. I began to repent every day, praying, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me for not living You from morning until evening. I have lived according to religion, morality, and ethics. The whole day I did not do anything wrong, but I was living You for only a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because we were made in God&rsquo;s image, we spontaneously like to do good. Moreover, we are taught to behave well by our parents and teachers. Therefore, we may live properly by habit, but we rarely live Christ. When we come into the church life, we learn to enjoy the Lord in the meetings, but outside of the meetings we may still habitually not live Christ. At the end of each day we may repent if we have lost our temper or done something sinful, but we need to repent for not living Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FORSAKING RELIGION TO GAIN CHRIST</h2>
<p>We must forsake religion. Saul of Tarsus was a leading one in religion, but God did not want that. Instead, God wanted Christ to be revealed in Paul (Gal. 1:14-16). When Paul said in Galatians 2:20 that he had been crucified, he meant that his religious, ethical, habitual person had been terminated. Paul no longer lived religion, ethics, or habit; instead, he lived Christ. In Philippians 3:7 Paul said, &ldquo;What things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ.&rdquo; Paul counted religion, ethics, and morality as loss. He wrote, &ldquo;I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ&rdquo; (v. 8). Paul pursued Christ to gain Christ and be found in Him (vv. 14, 8-9). He said, &ldquo;According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death&rdquo; (1:20). He desired to magnify Christ in every kind of circumstance. Paul continued, &ldquo;For to me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (v. 21). Like Paul, we should not care for religion, ethics, or morality. We should care not for good things or bad things but only for Christ. Christ should be our life and our living; He should be our kindness, our gentleness, and everything that we express. For this, we must be filled with Christ and be in spirit. When we are in spirit, we are living Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 2:11-12; 6:17; 15:45b; John 7:39; Rev. 22:17; Rom. 8:4</h1>
<p>God has revealed in His Word that He wants to dispense Himself into man. We are God-containers. Without God as our content we are empty. Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption we can receive God into us, be filled with God, and even be saturated with God in our entire being. In this chapter we will see from the Holy Scriptures how God fills us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING LIKE THE AIR</h2>
<p>In order for God to come into our being, He must be something like the air. The word <em>Spirit</em> is used in both the Old Testament and the New Testament in reference to God. Genesis 1:2 mentions the Spirit of God. John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo; Matthew 28:19 names the Holy Spirit as the third of the Trinity. First Corinthians 15:45b says that in resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit. The Hebrew word for <em>Spirit</em> in the Old Testament is <em>ruach.</em> The Greek word for <em>Spirit</em> in the New Testament is <em>pneuma</em>. Both <em>ruach</em> and <em>pneuma</em> can mean &ldquo;wind,&rdquo; &ldquo;breath,&rdquo; or &ldquo;spirit.&rdquo; This indicates that the Spirit of God and the spirit of man are like the wind or the air. John 3:8 says, &ldquo;The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.&rdquo; The wind is a mystery. We are like the wind because we are born of the Spirit.</p>
<p>We cannot see or touch the air, but we recognize that the air is real and present. The word <em>pneumatic</em> means &ldquo;filled with air.&rdquo; A pneumatic tire is a tire that is full of air. As believers, we should be full of the Spirit. When we are short of the Spirit, we are like a car that cannot move because its tires are short of air.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN BEING A MYSTERY BECAUSE HE HAS A SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Both God and man are mysteries. The mystery concerning God and the mystery concerning man are altogether a matter of the spirit. Animals are not a mystery because they do not have a spirit. Our human spirit is the deepest part of our being. Externally, we have a body, which is visible and knowable. However, within our physical body are many mysteries. In addition to our physical heart, we have another heart. Jeremiah 17:9 says, &ldquo;The heart is deceitful above all things, / And it is incurable; / Who can know it?&rdquo; This verse speaks of our psychological heart. Our physical heart may be strong, but our psychological heart is rotten and incurable. The location of our psychological heart is a mystery. Furthermore, 1 Peter 3:4 says that there is a hidden man in our psychological heart. This hidden man is the spirit. When our heart wants something, the spirit within our heart does not always agree. Our heart is corrupted, but our spirit is the lamp of Jehovah (Prov. 20:27).</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONLY THE SPIRIT OF MAN<br />
KNOWING THE THINGS OF MAN</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 2:11-12 Paul says, &ldquo;Who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him? In the same way, the things of God also no one has known except the Spirit of God. But we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is from God, that we may know the things which have been graciously given to us by God.&rdquo; Our mind cannot know the things concerning man. Unregenerated professors and doctors of philosophy know many things, but they do not know where they came from, what their destiny is, or the real meaning of human life, the real purpose of human existence. We cannot know these things by exercising our mind, because the things of man can be known only by man&rsquo;s spirit. Atheists say that there is no God, but when they are alone, something deep within them causes them to wonder, &ldquo;What if God does exist?&rdquo; This question does not come from their mind. We cannot know God by exercising our mind, just as we cannot know the air by exercising our eyes or ears. We are able to sense the air by exercising the right organs&mdash;our mouth, nose, and lungs&mdash;to breathe in the air. Only the spirit of man can know the things of man. We need to forget about our mind and turn to the deepest part of our being, our spirit, to know that God is real and that He is our source and our destiny.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TWO SPIRITS AND THE PARTS OF MAN</h2>
<p>As believers, we have two spirits within&mdash;our human spirit and God the Spirit. It is not easy to understand the Bible, because the Bible contains spiritual mysteries, including the things of man, the things of God, and the two spirits. Most people do not know anything about the two spirits. Even Bible translators who are Hebrew and Greek scholars have mixed up the things concerning the spirit. Some Bible translations confuse the heart, the soul, the mind, and the spirit. These four terms refer to four distinct inner parts of the human being. Scholars may have strong minds, but they do not know God, the two spirits, or the things of man if they do not use their spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REGENERATED HUMAN SPIRIT<br />
BEING AN ENRICHED, UPLIFTED, MINGLED SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When we were saved, something of God was added into our spirit through regeneration. Our spirit has been enriched and uplifted by being born of God. Moreover, at the time of our regeneration God&rsquo;s Spirit came into our spirit. Our regenerated human spirit is indwelt by the divine Spirit. Before regeneration, the conscience is the only functioning part of the human spirit. Without being regenerated, the best that men can do is to develop their conscience. But when we are saved, Christ regenerates us by giving us God&rsquo;s divine life and nature. In addition, God the Spirit comes into our spirit. Thus, our spirit is mingled with God&rsquo;s Spirit into one spirit. A glass of water may be enriched by having tea, honey, and milk added into it. Similarly, when we were regenerated, we received God&rsquo;s life and nature, the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive death, His resurrection power, and the Spirit. All these riches have been added into our spirit. We need to realize that we have all the riches of God in our spirit.</p>
<p>When God created man, He wanted to enter into man. However, man became fallen and sinful. Because of sin, man even became dead, and his heart became incurably corrupt. This was our condition before we were saved. Before the holy, righteous God could enter into such fallen beings, He needed to do many things. First, He became a man in incarnation. God put on the flesh of man and lived as a man on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. Then He willingly went to the cross to die on our behalf. God judged our sins on the cross, and Christ shed His blood to cleanse our sins. Furthermore, Christ&rsquo;s death terminated our flesh, our self, the old creation, and Satan. Thus, Christ solved all the problems between God and man; the cross cleared up the entire universe. Then Christ was buried and rose after three days. Death could not hold Him, because He is the resurrection (John 11:25). As the resurrection, He overcame death and defeated the power of death. He took a tour of Hades and walked out. By resurrection He changed His form&mdash;He was transfigured, transformed from the flesh into the Spirit. Through His resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b).</p>
<p>The life-giving Spirit is an all-inclusive drink, which has had many ingredients added. The first ingredient was divinity. Then through incarnation the element of humanity was added. Furthermore, all the experiences of human life were added through Christ&rsquo;s thirty-three and a half years on the earth. Finally, all the accomplishments of Christ&rsquo;s death and the attainments of His resurrection were added. Thus, in resurrection Christ became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. Divinity, humanity, Christ&rsquo;s human living, His all-inclusive death, the effectiveness of His death, the power of His resurrection, and His resurrection life are all in the Spirit.</p>
<p>John 7:39 says, &ldquo;This He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; The Spirit who was not yet is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. The Spirit of God existed already, but the ingredients of Christ&rsquo;s processes and accomplishments had not yet been added. After Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, the Spirit was ready as an all-inclusive drink. Revelation 22:17 says, &ldquo;The Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him who hears say, Come! And let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely.&rdquo; When we drink the Spirit, we receive Christ&rsquo;s divinity, humanity, human living, all-inclusive death, and resurrection power.</p>
<p>When we first repent and pray to receive the Lord, we feel like an eagle soaring high in the air. Sufferings and all of human life are no longer problems to us. We feel that everything, including the devil, sin, and the world, is under our feet. We feel this way because we have received the life-giving Spirit. Because we have the Spirit within us, we are not &ldquo;flat tires&rdquo; but are full of <em>pneuma.</em> Our spirit is one with the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; We are one spirit with the Lord. We have a mingled spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT AND<br />
PRACTICING TO BE ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD<br />
BEING THE SECRET OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2>
<p>Romans 8:4 says, &ldquo;That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit.&rdquo; My burden is that we would realize that to be a proper Christian is to walk according to the mingled spirit. We need to walk, live, act, speak, and move according to the spirit. Instead of praying each morning to know the Lord&rsquo;s will concerning where we should go and what we should do each day, we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for another day for me to live You. Wherever I go and whatever I do and say, I want to practice to be one spirit with You so that everything I do and say would be according to You.&rdquo; When we realize that we are doing or speaking something that is not according to the Lord, we should stop and repent.</p>
<p>We must learn to practice living, moving, and speaking according to the spirit. The simple and effective secret of living a proper Christian life is practicing to be one spirit with the Lord and to walk according to the spirit. If we walk according to the spirit, we will be saved from many problems. If we speak to our spouse according to the spirit, we will not argue or lose our temper. If we shop according to the spirit, we may not buy certain things or even go to certain stores. The more we practice walking according to the mingled spirit, the more we will pray, sing, pray-read, and fellowship with the Lord. To walk according to the spirit is to live Christ. This is the way to live a victorious life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CHRISTIAN LIFE BEING<br />
A LIFE OF FEASTING AND ENJOYMENT</h1>
<p>The Christian life is a life of enjoyment. Religion has made the Christian life a life of work, but according to God&rsquo;s economy, which is revealed in the Bible, God wants us to live a life of enjoyment.</p>
<p>The Bible is a book of feasting. To partake of one dish is to eat, but when we eat many dishes, our eating becomes a feast. A traditional Chinese feast may have twenty-one courses. In the Old Testament times God invited His people to feast three times a year (Exo. 23:14-16). In the proper church life every meeting is a feast&mdash;&ldquo;dish&rdquo; after &ldquo;dish&rdquo; of Christ is brought forth and enjoyed by the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING IN GENESIS</h2>
<p>The Bible is not for doctrinal knowledge. Genesis through Revelation reveals God&rsquo;s desire for man to eat. Immediately after God created man, God put man into a garden. Genesis 2:9 says, &ldquo;Out of the ground Jehovah God caused to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food.&rdquo; God did not charge Adam to learn many things or to do much work. It is a false religious concept that God wants man only to gain knowledge or do work. God wanted Adam to eat. Adam needed only to learn to be careful about his eating. If he ate the right thing, he would receive life, but if he ate the wrong thing, he would die (vv. 9, 17). Regrettably, Adam eventually ate the wrong thing, but God came in to rescue him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SALVATION BEING A FEAST</h2>
<p>The passover in Exodus 12 was a feast. After the lamb was slain and its blood was applied, the people were to eat the lamb (vv. 7-9). In Luke 14:16 the Lord likened God&rsquo;s salvation to a great dinner. He said in verse 17, &ldquo;Come, for all things are now ready.&rdquo; In Luke 15 when the prodigal son, who was living like a beggar, returned to his father, he planned to say, &ldquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants&rdquo; (vv. 18-19). However, before the son finished speaking, the father stopped him and told his slaves, &ldquo;Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. And bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry&rdquo; (vv. 22-23). The son wanted to work for his father, but the father wanted his son only to eat. God&rsquo;s salvation is not work but a feast.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FEASTING IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>God commanded His people in the Old Testament to keep the feasts by coming together not to labor but to eat and rest (Lev. 23:7-8, 21, 28, 30-32, 35-36, 39). The people ate, and they made offerings to God for God&rsquo;s food. Thus, they ate before God, and they ate with God. They enjoyed God&rsquo;s eating, and God enjoyed their eating. God did not tell His people to come together three times a year to bow down and worship Him. Instead, God told His people to come to Him to eat, rejoice, and enjoy (v. 40). This is real worship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FEASTING IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The New Testament often records that the Lord Jesus reclined at table with His followers. A table is a place to eat. The Greek word for <em>table</em> can mean &ldquo;feast&rdquo; (Acts 16:34). The Lord&rsquo;s table is a feast. When the Lord established His table, He broke the bread, gave it to the disciples and said to them, &ldquo;This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me&rdquo; (1 Cor. 11:24). To remember the Lord is to eat Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DAILY ENJOYING THE LORD BY EATING HIM</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s table is a symbol of the entire Christian life. The Christian life is a life of daily enjoying the Lord by eating Him. We eat physical food only a few times a day, but our spiritual eating must be continual and unceasing. Beginning from our morning time with the Lord, we should eat the Lord throughout the day. When we are driving or walking, we can eat by calling, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; We can eat the Lord when we are at school, work, or home.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING PRIVATELY AND CORPORATELY</h2>
<p>We should come to the church meetings to eat the Lord. However, if we eat the Lord only in the meetings and not privately in our daily life as well, there will not be much to eat in the meetings. If we eat the Lord privately in our daily lives, we will have more to eat in the meetings. If we do not eat the Lord throughout the day, we will come to the meetings empty-handed. We may hope that others will bring something for us to eat, but if everyone thinks this way, no one will bring anything of Christ to the meeting for others to enjoy. However, if all the saints eat the Lord throughout the day, there will be much to share in the meetings.</p>
<p>The eating in the meetings depends on the eating in our private life. If we eat daily in our private lives, we will have a rich store and come to the meeting full of Christ. Then we can share our Christ, and all will eat and be richly fed. Therefore, every day we need to contact the Lord individually. We can eat privately by praying, reading the Word, pray-reading, calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name, and remaining in His presence. Even while we are working, we can call on the Lord or digest a verse of the Bible. In the evening we can have a time with the Lord to pray-read His Word and praise Him. We can sing to the Lord not only in the meetings but also by ourselves. We need to have both individual eating and corporate eating. We can eat corporately in the church meetings or with only one other person, such as our spouse or roommate. The Christian life is an eating life. The more we eat, the more we are filled and saturated with Christ. When we come to the meetings full of Christ, the meetings will be rich feasts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING AND DRINKING IN REVELATION</h2>
<p>At the end of the Bible, there is a promise and a call. The promise is in Revelation 22:14, which says, &ldquo;Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city.&rdquo; The call is in verse 17, which says, &ldquo;Let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely.&rdquo; Thus, the Bible invites us to come to eat and drink. If we learn to eat and drink, we will be kept in God&rsquo;s central line, fulfill His purpose, and reach His goal by being filled with Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:4, 8-10, 16-19</h1>
<p>We need to see a vision of the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ. The mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church (Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4). Thus, Christ and the church are the great mystery (5:32). God, who is a mystery, has been embodied in Christ and is therefore expressed through Christ. Whatever God is, is in Christ. To see, touch, and gain Christ is to see, touch, and gain God, for Christ is the embodiment of God. Christ, who is also a mystery, is embodied in the church, just as God is embodied in Christ. To touch or be in the church is to touch or be in Christ. The secret of the church is Christ.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the mystery of Christ making His home in our hearts. For Christ to make His home in our heart is more particular than for Him to be with us in a general way. Our heart is not merely something in our environment or even something very close to us but the center and content of our being. Therefore, Christ making His home in our heart is not an outward or superficial matter but is something deep in our being. This matter also concerns the real church life. The church is Christ making His home in our hearts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERY</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 3 there are several great matters. Verse 3 says, &ldquo;By revelation the mystery was made known to me.&rdquo; This mystery is deep and great, yet it is has been revealed to us and even revealed into us. Colossians 1:26-27 says, &ldquo;The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints; to whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; The mystery is Christ in us. Christ today is subjective to us. He is not only near us but also within us, in the depths of our being. This is indeed mysterious. Unbelievers do not understand why Christians are virtuous and joyful. People may wonder what the source of strength and power is that enables Christians to endure sufferings or to love when others cannot love. This is a mystery to them, but it has been revealed to us. We know that the source of our life and power is Christ within us. The indwelling Christ is the secret of the Christian life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Another great matter revealed in Ephesians 3 is the unsearchable riches of Christ. In verse 8 the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.&rdquo; Paul did not preach doctrine or a gospel of theology but the unsearchable riches of Christ.</p>
<p>We need to see some of the items of the unsearchable riches of Christ. First, the unsearchable riches of Christ include God. In order to receive God, we must receive Christ, for God is in Christ. The second item of Christ&rsquo;s riches is life. Life, which is precious and crucial, is in Christ. In order to receive life, we must receive Christ. The third item of Christ&rsquo;s riches is His humanity. As human beings, we have many defects and imperfections, but Christ, who is also a man, does not have any defects. His perfection is absolute; He is the perfect man. In order to have a proper humanity, we must have Christ. When we have Christ, we have God, life, humanity, and many other items. The apostle Paul preached these items. By God&rsquo;s mercy and grace we are doing the same thing today. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we do not preach doctrine or theology but Christ, a living person. We minister a rich Christ, a Christ full of unsearchable riches.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ECONOMY OF THE MYSTERY</h2>
<p>The third great matter in Ephesians 3 is the economy of the mystery in verse 9. An economy is a dispensing, a distribution of riches. The apostle Paul was doing a particular kind of work&mdash;he was distributing Christ in His riches into people. As genuine Christians, we can testify that since the day we first called on the name of the Lord, something mysterious has been added into our being; Christ has been dispensed into us. The mystery of Christ is Christ experienced in all His riches. To experience the riches of Christ means that something of Christ, some element of His riches, has been dispensed into us. In this way, we experience and enjoy Christ as our life, life supply, support, and strength. The more we experience Christ, the more He is dispensed into us. The dispensing of His riches into us is the economy of the mystery. Something eternal, mysterious, and incomprehensible yet sweet, rich, and high has been dispensed into our being and makes us joyful, living, powerful, loving, and lovable. This is the enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</p>
<p>Every believer has Christ within. Once we receive Christ, we can never send Him away. We may sometimes try to reject Him, but we cannot get rid of Him. We may even say, &ldquo;Lord, I do not love You,&rdquo; but He will say, &ldquo;I still love you.&rdquo; The more we talk to the Lord, even in this way, the more of Christ we will receive. Instead of resisting the Lord, we should simply love Him. Loving the Lord and being loved by Him is the reason that Christians may appear to be crazy to others. Saints often travel from a long distance to come to church conferences. At the conferences we only attend meetings. We do not come for entertainment, yet we are happy. Unbelievers cannot understand our joy and may think that we are superstitious or misled, but the real reason is that we have the dispensing of the mystery.</p>
<p>Saints from many different nations meet together in the church life. Naturally speaking, Japanese, Chinese, and Koreans cannot love one another, just as the Germans, French, and British cannot love one another. However, when we see the other saints, regardless of their nationality, we spontaneously love them. The reason and motive for our mutual love is not that we know each other well but that something within each of us corresponds to something within the other saints. Even if we cannot understand one another&rsquo;s language, we love one another because we experience the dispensing of the mystery. The first time that I went into a Japanese home was in 1933 when I was invited to visit a group of Japanese Christians. When I went into the home, they were all kneeling and praying on a traditional Japanese tatami mat. Right away I took off my shoes and crawled onto the mat to join them in prayer. I was happy to fellowship with them. I loved them, and they loved me. The reason for this love is the dispensing of the mystery.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The fourth matter in Ephesians 3 is the church, which is mentioned in verse 10. The church comes out of the dispensing of the mystery. When we enjoy Christ, and He is dispensed into each of us, the church will be produced. The church is not a building but a group of living Christians experiencing and enjoying the riches of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS</h2>
<p>The mystery of Christ, the unsearchable riches of Christ, the economy of the mystery, and the church are covered in the first half of Ephesians 3. The apostle Paul goes on in the second part of the chapter to pray for the saints that they would gain more of Christ by allowing Christ to make His home in their hearts. Ephesians 3:17 says, &ldquo;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we first believed in the Lord, He came into the center of our being. When we first called on the Lord, something that was formerly a mystery entered into our being. This is the dispensing of the mystery. The mystery has been dispensed into the center of our being. We have Christ, but we do not have enough of Christ. There is much room in our being, but the space within us that has Christ is small. He is mainly limited to our spirit. We need to have more Christ. The way to have more Christ is to allow Him to spread from the center of our being to fill our heart.</p>
<p>The key to having Christ make His home in our heart is in verse 16, where Paul prays, &ldquo;That He [the Father] would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.&rdquo; Christ is in our spirit, but we often miss Him because we remain in other areas of our being where Christ has not yet spread, such as our mind. When we experience troubles, such as losing our job, having problems with our spouse, or being bothered by others, we spontaneously exercise our mind to think about why we have these troubles. We may think about our troubles so much that we cannot sleep well. The more we think, the more we are bothered, and the more we remain in the mind. Then we may find that we have lost our enjoyment of the Lord. Our power and strength are gone, because we are in our mind, but Christ is not in our mind. We need be strengthened into the inner man, for the inner man is where Christ is.</p>
<p>To turn to our spirit is to be strengthened into the inner man. When we remain in our mind, we are weakened and find that we cannot enjoy the Lord. Then a brother may come to help us to pray. When we pray, we turn from our mind to our spirit&mdash;we are strengthened into the inner man. When we are strengthened into the inner man, Christ spreads in us and dispenses more of Himself into our being. By daily dispensing Himself into us, Christ eventually fills our heart. For Christ to make His home in our heart is for Him to settle down in us, filling our entire being and making every part of our being His home.</p>
<p>Christ becomes our content by filling every part of our being with Himself. He spreads to our mind, emotion, and will, filling our thinking, considerations, feelings, and decisions. Christ occupies our entire being, possesses us, and even becomes us, making us His expression. Then we can say, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21). When we think, it is Christ thinking. When we love, it is Christ loving. When we make a decision, it is Christ deciding. Christ becomes us, and He causes us to become Him. This is Christ making His home in our heart. When Christ makes His home in our heart, we will overcome all our troubles, enjoy Him, and experience Him in countless ways. The Christian life is a daily life of allowing Christ to make His home in our heart, a life of Christ adding Himself into our daily life. Christ continually dispenses Himself into our being to fill us, occupy us, and take us over. When this process is taking place, it is not we who are living but Christ, the mystery of God, living in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIMENSIONS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The sixth great matter in Ephesians 3 is in verse 18, which says that Christ makes His home in our hearts so that we &ldquo;may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are.&rdquo; When Christ begins to make His home in our heart, we will discover that He is unlimited. Christ&rsquo;s dimensions are the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe, which are immeasurable and unlimited. The more we experience and enjoy Christ, the more we know that He is unlimited and inexhaustible. We can never exhaust Christ; He is unlimited in every way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FULLNESS OF GOD</h2>
<p>The last great matter revealed in Ephesians 3 is the fullness of God in verse 19. When we experience Christ to the extent that we discover His unlimitedness, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God. The fullness of God is the expression of His riches. When water is dispensed into a cup until it overflows, the water running over is the fullness. In order to express Christ and dispense Him into others, we must be filled unto the fullness. When we are filled with the unlimited Christ, we become the fullness of God, which means that God is expressed through us and flowing out of us. The church is a group of people who are filled with Christ until they become the fullness of God, God&rsquo;s expression and His flowing out.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">MINGLING, GROWING, AND RENEWING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:4-6, 11-24</h1>
<h2 class="head1">EPHESIANS 3&mdash;EXPERIENCING CHRIST<br />
TO PRODUCE THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Ephesians is a particular book in that it gives us a full revelation of the church and also shows us the way to experience the church, which is to experience Christ. In the previous chapters we have seen that Christ is the mystery of God and that the church is the mystery of Christ. Ephesians 3:3 refers to something called the mystery. The church comes out of God, who is a mystery, and who is embodied in Christ. Christ also is a mystery. Even according to history, Christ is a mystery. In the six thousand years of human history, no one is as mysterious as Christ. He was God, yet He became a man. He is both God and man. He is one person of two natures and two lives&mdash;human and divine. Our mind cannot grasp how one person could have two lives and two natures, how Christ could be God and man at the same time. As a mystery, Christ has been embodied in the church. Thus, the church is the mystery of Christ, just as Christ is the mystery of God. Like God and Christ, the church is a mystery. Most people do not understand what the church is. Many think that it is a building with a cross on it, but this is not the church. As the church, we are a mystery. There is a mystery in us, and this mystery is Christ, who is the mystery, the embodiment, of God.</p>
<p>The mystery mentioned in Ephesians 3 includes the unsearchable riches of Christ, which are being dispensed into us (v. 8). Verse 9 calls this dispensing the economy of the mystery. Something mysterious is being dispensed into us. We experience the economy of the mystery daily and hourly as the riches of Christ are dispensed into us. In every situation and at every moment, while we are eating, washing, and talking to others, Christ is dispensed into us.</p>
<p>The economy of the mystery produces the church. The church, which comes out of this dispensing, is not material or physical but altogether spiritual and mysterious. It is the expression of God Himself. Verse 19 tells us that the church is the fullness of God, the outflowing and overflowing of the riches of God, which result from a constant filling. We Christians have the privilege of being filled with the Triune God until we overflow Him. To overflow God is to manifest God, to express God. The church as the fullness of God is the expression of God.</p>
<p>The church is not a physical building but the expression of God. Because we are constantly filled with God, He overflows from us. The overflowing of God from us is the church. If a group of Christians is not filled with God, they will not overflow or express God. We need to be Christians who are filled with God so that we are flowing out God in whatever we do. When we function in a meeting, God flows out. When all the saints function, the church becomes the fullness of God, God&rsquo;s flowing out.</p>
<p>Paul composed Ephesians 3 with seven main points: the mystery, the unsearchable riches of Christ, the economy of the mystery, the church, Christ making His home in our hearts, the dimensions of Christ, and the fullness of God. These seven points show us what the church is. The church comes out of the mystery, the unsearchable riches of Christ, the economy of the mystery, and Christ making His home in our hearts. When the church experiences the immeasurable dimensions of Christ, it becomes the fullness, the expression, of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EPHESIANS 4&mdash;<br />
MINGLING, GROWING, AND RENEWING</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3 can be described by the word <em>rich,</em> and Ephesians 4 can be described by the word <em>deep.</em> Chapter 4 reveals mingling, growing, and renewing. We need a thorough understanding of what is meant by these three words.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Mingling with the Triune God<br />
to Produce the Church</h2>
<p>Verses 4 through 6 mention the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father. These three are the Triune God, the three-one God. This does not mean that there are three Gods. There is one God, yet He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Verse 4 begins, &ldquo;One Body and one Spirit.&rdquo; The Body and the Spirit being mentioned together in this way indicates a mingling. The Lord and the Father are also grouped with matters related to the believers to show the Triune God mingled with our being. Ephesians 3 reveals the church as the fullness, the outflow, of God. Chapter 4 goes on to reveal something further&mdash;that the Triune God mingles Himself with us to cause us to become the Body. The Body, which is the fullness, the expression, and the overflow of God, comes out of God mingling with us.</p>
<p>In order for the Triune God to mingle with us, we first must believe in the Lord. When we call on the Lord, we spontaneously believe in Him. By calling on the name of the Lord, faith comes into us, we believe in the Lord, and the Lord enters into us. Immediately, we are joined to the Lord in an organic union. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:5 says, &ldquo;One Lord, one faith, one baptism.&rdquo; We are united with Christ, joined to the Lord, by believing. However, many worldly things or things of the old creation still hinder us. Therefore, we need to be baptized. By being baptized, we are freed from the world and cut off from the old things. We are one with the Lord and are members of His Body, which is filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:6 says, &ldquo;One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.&rdquo; <em>Over all</em> refers to the Father as the source, the origin; <em>through all</em> refers to the Son as the course; and <em>in all</em> refers to the Spirit, who abides in us. The Triune God is over us, through us, and abides in us. Thus, we are full of God. This is the mingling of the Triune God with the believers, causing the believers to become the fullness of God, the church. According to Ephesians 4, the church is produced by God being over all, through all, and in all. The Triune God mingled with us is the genuine church.</p><h2 class="head2">Growing in Life<br />
by the Increase of Christ in Us<br />
to Build the Church</h2>
<p>Verses 11 through 16 deal with our growth in life. The growth in life is the increase of Christ in us. Christ is already in us, but He needs to grow in us. Christ in Himself does not need to grow, for He is perfect and complete. In Himself Christ is fully mature, but in us Christ may still be very small. We need to gain more of Christ.</p>
<p>When Christ increases in us, we grow in Him. According to verse 15, we may grow up into Christ in all things. In our thinking, our loving and hating, our likes and dislikes, and all our decisions, we may grow up into Christ. Even when we get a haircut, buy a pair of shoes, study, or work, we may grow up into Christ. Most brothers and sisters are in Christ in some things but not in all things. In everything and at every moment, we need to grow up into Christ by having Christ increase within us.</p>
<p>The Body is built up by the growth in life of all the members. The church is not like a physical building, which is built by pieces being fixed together. The building up of the Body of Christ is like the grafting of branches to a tree. The grafting together of two living things involves growth. Two pieces of stone that are fixed together do not grow together. As living members of the Body of Christ, we are built together by growing together. The church as the Body of Christ is built up by the growth in life of all the members.</p>
<p>Once we are built into the Body, it is difficult to leave, because we are joined to the Body by life. If a member of our physical body is offended or unhappy with another member, it cannot leave the body. Wherever one member goes, the other members follow. It is difficult for anyone to leave the real church, because we are not stones placed upon one another but living members growing together. For a member of a body to become separated or divided from the other members results in death. Spiritually speaking, anyone who leaves the church brings death to himself.</p>
<p>The way to help people grow is to feed them. No one can grow without eating. All the gifts to the Body&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers&mdash;do one work, that is, to feed the believers. The co-workers who care for the churches and speak in conferences should be like waiters in a restaurant, ministering food to all the saints, feeding them with Christ. Real ministry is to feed the saints. Even proper teaching is a feeding. After hearing a message, the saints should be satisfied and nourished.</p>
<p>We grow by eating, drinking, and breathing. For this reason, we need to call on the name of the Lord, read the Bible, and pray with the words of the Bible. To read the Bible with prayer is to eat, to pray with the words of the Bible is to drink, and to call on the name of the Lord is to breathe. Eating, drinking, and breathing are crucial for our growing. When we grow, we are built up together.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Renewed<br />
by Taking Christ as Our Person<br />
to Be the New Man</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4 first reveals the Triune God mingling Himself with us. Next we see the Body growing with Christ and growing into Christ. Lastly, in verses 17 through 24, we see the matter of renewing. The church needs mingling, growing, and renewing.</p>
<p>Renewing comes from growing. Two trees of the same age may be completely different. If one tree is growing, it will be new and fresh every day. However, if the other tree is dying, it will become older all the time. Thus, when we are growing, we are being renewed.</p>
<p>To be renewed means to discharge the old things and to replace them with the new things. Our old man was crucified with Christ (Rom. 6:6) and buried in baptism (v. 4a), but we may still have many of the old things&mdash;old thinking, old emotions, old decisions, old ways of doing things, old ways of speaking, and old habits and customs. All these old things need to be discharged and replaced. For this, we need the supply of the new element.</p>
<p>The metabolism in our physical body comes mainly from eating. We eat new food, which is our supply of a new element. This new supply discharges all the old things and replaces them with a new element. In this way our bodies are renewed every day. If we do not eat for one week, we will quickly become old because there will be no discharge of the old things and no supply of the new material. The principle is the same with the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>We need to be renewed by putting off the old man and putting on the new man. The new man is Christ applied to and experienced and enjoyed by the believers. As the fullness of God, the church is the expression of God. As the Body of Christ, the church is the organism of Christ, growing with Christ. As the new man, the church is one with Christ, having Christ as its person. The Body of Christ is a matter of life, and the new man is a matter of a person. The Body of Christ needs Christ as its life, and the new man needs Christ as its person.</p>
<p>The church should be not only the fullness of God and the Body of Christ with Christ as its life but also the new man with Christ as its person. As the Body of Christ, the church lives Christ and expresses Christ, but as the new man, the church is Christ. The Body and the new man are produced by mingling, growing, and renewing. By daily growing and being renewed, we will become the Body and the new man. As we are being renewed, we put off the old person, our old man, and we take the new person, Christ. As our new person, Christ makes us the new man.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WASHING OF THE WATER IN THE WORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:26-27, 29</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE WASHING OF THE WATER IN THE WORD BEING NECESSARY FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:26-27 says, &ldquo;That He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish.&rdquo; The washing of the water in the word is a crucial matter for the church life. In order to have a proper church life, we need the washing of the water in the word.</p>
<p>The washing of the water in the word is different from the washing of the blood of Christ. The washing of the blood of Christ deals with our sins (1 John 1:7), but the washing of the water in the word deals with our spots and wrinkles. Spots are defects that come from wounds or from the natural life we received by birth; wrinkles come from oldness. When a church is young, it may not have any wounds or oldness. However, as the church goes on, it may become older, causing it to have wrinkles. The church also may be hurt by an event or certain persons. As a result, the church will have some spots. To wash away the spots and wrinkles, the church needs the washing of the water in the word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WASHING OF THE WATER IN THE WORD BEING<br />
AN INWARD, METABOLIC WASHING</h2>
<p>The washing of the water in the word is not an outward washing but an inward washing. If we become dirty outwardly, we can easily wash off the dirt. However, wrinkles cannot be washed away outwardly, even with the strongest soap. To wash away wrinkles, we need to be renewed inwardly. Inward renewing requires metabolism, which comes mainly from eating and drinking. When we eat nourishing food, we have a healthy metabolism, and our oldness is washed away. However, if we do not eat for several days, we will begin to look old. Eating and drinking produce an inward, metabolic washing. The washing of the water in the word is this kind of washing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>As growing Christians, we must daily eat the word of God. In Matthew 4:4 the Lord said, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&rdquo; The word that comes out of the mouth of God, which is the word in the Bible, is our spiritual food. We need to eat the word of the Bible every day and even several times a day. If we eat physically only once a day, we will be hungry and eventually become old. We need at least three meals a day. To read the Bible once a day is good, but it is best to practice to eat the Bible several times a day&mdash;morning, noon, afternoon, and evening. The more regular times we have to eat the word of the Bible each day, the better.</p>
<p>Some may think that they do not have the time to eat the word several times a day. However, if we truly desire to find the time, it is always possible. It does not take a long time to eat a snack&mdash;less than five minutes. If we do not eat several times each day, we quickly become tired. By taking a few minutes to enjoy a few verses during the day, we will be refreshed and strengthened. This makes a big difference. This kind of eating keeps us young.</p>
<p>If we have not memorized many of the verses in the Bible, it is best to carry a pocket version. When I was a new believer, I carried a book of the Bible in my pocket all the time. Even when I was at work, I would occasionally read a few verses. The washing of the water in the word sanctifies, nourishes, and cherishes us. We need to spend time in the word not only by reading but also by praying. Prayer is the way that we feed on the word. We need to eat the word several times a day.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WATER IN THE WORD BEING<br />
THE FLOWING LIFE OF GOD</h2>
<p>The water in the word is the life supply from God, the flowing life of God. In the Old Testament time the children of Israel drank of the water that flowed out of the cleft rock, signifying the flowing life of God that was released when the Lord Jesus was smitten on the cross (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4; John 19:34). When the Lord was on the earth, He told the Samaritan woman at the well, &ldquo;Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life&rdquo; (4:13-14). Then at the Feast of Tabernacles the Lord cried out, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&rdquo; (7:37-38). The living water is the Spirit of God. Finally, Revelation 22:1 says, &ldquo;He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.&rdquo; The river of water of life signifies the flowing life of God. Today this living water is in the Bible. The word of God in the Bible is our life supply.</p><h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT BY PRAY-READING<br />
TO DRINK THE WATER IN THE WORD</h2>
<p>We must come to the Bible in the proper way in order to receive the water in the word. The water in the word is mysterious and spiritual; it is not the letters in black and white. To touch the water of life, we must use our deepest part, our spirit. If we read the Bible only with our eyes and our mind, we are using only our body and our soul, and we will receive only knowledge. When we exercise our spirit in reading the Word, we touch the life supply, the water in the word.</p>
<p>The way to exercise our spirit is to pray. For this reason, we all need to learn how to pray-read. To pray-read is to repeat the words of the Bible as a simple prayer to the Lord. When we practice to pray-read in this way, we will sense the water of life flowing within our spirit to quench our thirst and to water, refresh, nourish, and strengthen us. The word conveys to us the spiritual life supply, which becomes a washing to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING PRODUCING A METABOLIC WASHING</h2>
<p>The food that we eat produces a kind of washing in our body, removing the waste from our blood and tissues. If we do not eat, we will not have this kind of washing. The more that we eat and the better the food is that we eat, the more we will experience this inward, metabolic washing of life. The same principle applies in the spiritual realm. If we eat the word by exercising our spirit to pray the Word, we receive life, which affords us a metabolic washing by removing all the negative things from our inner being. As a result, our wrinkles and our spots will be washed away. As the church, we will become beautiful&mdash;sanctified, without any blemish. Eventually, the Lord will present this glorious church to Himself as His bride (Eph. 5:27).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NOURISHING AND WASHING OF THE WORD</h2>
<p>The most crucial point in Ephesians 3 is Christ making His home in our hearts. In order to experience and enjoy Christ to the uttermost, we need to give Him the freedom to make His home in our heart, to be fully settled in our entire being. In chapter 4 there are three crucial points: mingling with the Triune God, growing by the increase of Christ, and being renewed by taking Christ as our person. We all should realize the mingling with the Triune God and experience the growth in life by the increase of Christ in us, growing up into Christ in all things. Then we will be renewed, transformed. We will put off our old man and put on the new man, which is Christ as the church. To take Christ as our person is to live not by ourselves but by Him. When we take Christ as our new person, we become the new man.</p>
<p>These four crucial matters in Ephesians 3 and 4 are subjective and deep, but we need to experience them in order to have the proper church life. If we all have Christ making His home in our hearts, realize the mingling with the Triune God, grow in life by the increase of Christ, and are renewed by taking Christ as our person, we will have the proper church life. The secret of experiencing these four matters is taking in the word. We must eat the word daily by exercising our spirit and pray-reading in order to experience these four crucial matters.</p>
<p>The word in the Bible embodies the entire Triune God. Therefore, to fully experience Christ, we must take in the word. Just as the vitamins and minerals that our body needs are in the food we eat, the word of God in the Bible conveys the spiritual nourishment that we need. Many Christians today are undernourished because they do not read or pray over the Bible. Owning a Bible but not reading or praying over it may be compared to buying much food but not cooking or eating it. If we do not eat properly, we will be weak, undernourished, and prone to sickness. Eating properly requires a certain amount of time. Every day we need to spend time to eat physically, and we likewise need to spend time to eat the word of God. When we eat the word of God adequately and properly, we will be nourished.</p>
<p>In the nourishing word there is washing water, which carries away all the negative things from our inner being. Physical food not only nourishes us but also cleanses us, washing all the negative things from our body. A proper and adequate diet defeats the germs and cleanses our blood and tissues. The same is true of our spiritual food, the word of God. If we eat and drink the word by exercising our spirit to pray-read the word, we will receive spiritual nourishment and washing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE LORD&rsquo;S NOURISHING AND CHERISHING BY PRAY-READING THE WORD</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:29 says, &ldquo;No one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church.&rdquo; <em>Nourishes</em> and <em>cherishes</em> in verse 29 relate to the washing of the water in the word in verse 26. When we pray-read the word, we receive the spiritual food. This food not only cleanses us but also nourishes and cherishes us. When a nursing mother feeds her child, the child receives the nourishment and at the same time enjoys tender care. When a baby is lying in his mother&rsquo;s bosom, he receives protection, rest, warmth, and comfort; all fear and cares are gone. For a small child, to be in the mother&rsquo;s bosom is the best thing, for there he enjoys nourishing and cherishing. When we pray-read the word, we have a precious, tender, and dear feeling that we are in the bosom of the Lord. We enjoy His protection, comfort, and tender care&mdash;His nourishing and cherishing. This is to enjoy Christ in a very direct and intimate way.</p>
<p>By enjoying Christ&rsquo;s nourishing and cherishing in the word, we will never become old but will be continually refreshed, and the church will become glorious, not having spot or wrinkle but sanctified and without blemish. This is the church that the Lord is after. Thus, we all need to practice pray-reading several times a day to receive Christ&rsquo;s nourishing and cherishing.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">RECEIVING THE WORD OF GOD<br />
BY MEANS OF PRAYER</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 6:10-19</h1>
<p>Ephesians 6:17-18 says, &ldquo;Receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit.&rdquo; Ephesians, a book on the church, ends with a particular kind of prayer by which we receive the word of God. This indicates that in order to have the proper church life, we must practice to receive the word of God by means of prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE WORD TO EXPERIENCE<br />
THE SECRETS REVEALED IN EPHESIANS<br />
FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3 through 5 reveals the secrets to enjoy Christ for the church life. We need to experience Christ making His home in our hearts (3:17). We also need to realize that the Triune God is mingled with the church (4:4-6), to grow in life by having Christ increase in us (vv. 11-16), and to be renewed by taking Christ as our person (vv. 17-24). Finally, we need to be cleansed by the washing of the water in the word (5:26-27). These are the secrets for us to experience Christ for the church life. To apply all these secrets to ourselves, we must receive the word of God.</p>
<p>In the word of God we find the riches of Christ and the reality of the Triune God. All that Christ is and all that He can do are in the word. Therefore, in order to experience Christ, we must get into the word. When the word enters into us, it nourishes us. This nourishing affords an inward metabolic washing, which discharges the old things and brings in the new element. The way to have Christ make His home in our hearts, experience the Triune God, grow, and be renewed and cleansed is to receive the word of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD</h2>
<p>The last section of Ephesians 6, beginning with verse 10, reveals the last secret for us to have the proper church life. Verse 11 says that we need to put on the whole armor of God to stand against the devil. Verses 14 through 17 describe the items of this armor. We are told to gird our loins with truth, put on the breastplate of righteousness, shoe our feet with the gospel of peace, take up the shield of faith to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one, and receive the helmet of salvation. The last item of God&rsquo;s armor is the sword of the Spirit, which is the only item used to attack the enemy. Verse 18 reveals that the secret to apply all these items of armor is to pray.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE WORD BY MEANS OF ALL PRAYER</h2>
<p>The prayer mentioned in verse 18 is not for blessing, peace, or healing but to receive the word of God, which, according to verse 17, is not a book of letters but the Spirit. Verse 18 says that we can receive the word of God by means of all prayer and petition. Prayer is general, and petition is specific. We need to pray in a general way and also in a particular way.</p>
<p>If someone gives us a glass of water, the unique means by which we can receive the water is to drink. The Lord has given us His word in the Bible. We receive the word, which is the Spirit, not by means of reading or understanding but by means of all prayer and petition. For this reason, we need to pray-read the Bible, turning the words of the Bible into the words of our prayer.</p>
<p>Many saints in the past centuries have practiced to mingle prayer with their reading of the Bible. George Whitefield, a contemporary of John Wesley, was a powerful evangelist. Whitefield wrote that it was his daily practice to kneel and pray as he read the New Testament. He found that the best means to receive the word of God was not merely by reading and understanding but by praying. Whitefield prayed through the entire New Testament in this way. If we practice to pray-read the word, we will be filled with Christ and with power. Then we will live Christ, minister Christ, and express Christ in a powerful way.</p>
<p>We all need to pray to receive the word of God. We should not pray in a pitiful way, complaining to the Lord about our weak condition or difficult situations, begging for mercy, or merely asking for blessing, health, and peace for ourselves or others. When we pray, we need to pray first to receive the word of God. We need to build up a habit to pray in this way. The first thing that we do each day should be to pray to receive the word of God. When we receive the word of God by prayer, the word nourishes, waters, refreshes, empowers, strengthens, saturates, washes, enlightens, corrects, and rebukes us. The result of our receiving the word of God by prayer is that we are inwardly cleared up and filled with the Lord. When we are in such a condition, nothing will be a problem to us.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYING CONCERNING ALL THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>Another result of pray-reading is that we will pray for all the saints. Verse 18 concludes, &ldquo;Praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.&rdquo; To pray at every time means to pray daily and throughout the day. We need to pray at every time, and we need to pray not from our mind but in our spirit. We should pray first to receive the word of God, and then we should pray concerning all the saints.</p>
<p>We may already pray concerning the saints, but we need to learn how to pray concerning the saints in the proper way. We may pray mainly concerning the saints&rsquo; health, marriages, children, or jobs. This kind of prayer is good, but it is not the highest prayer. In Matthew 6:31-32 the Lord said, &ldquo;Do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?...For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.&rdquo; Our heavenly Father knows everything that we need, and He will take care of all these things. Therefore, we do not need to anxiously pray for these things. In verse 33 the Lord went on to tell us, &ldquo;But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.&rdquo; If we seek first the kingdom and the righteousness of God, God will give us His kingdom and His righteousness and will add to us all that we need. This has been my experience throughout the many years of my Christian life.</p>
<p>We need to see what the kingdom and the righteousness of God are. Romans 14:17 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; According to this verse, God&rsquo;s kingdom in the present age is the church, and righteousness is the daily life of the church. We need to pray not for outward necessities, such as eating and drinking, but for righteousness&mdash;a proper daily life for the church life. We need to pray in this way all the time for all the saints. After reading the previous chapters concerning Ephesians, we might pray, &ldquo;Lord, bring all the saints into the proper church life so that they may experience Christ and have Christ make His home in their hearts. Lord, cause every saint to realize the mingling of the Triune God with the church, and allow each one to see that the Spirit is in the Body. Lord, help every saint to see that they have an organic union with You and that the Triune God is truly one with the church.&rdquo; We need to pray for these things. This is to pray in a high way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXAMPLES OF PRAYER IN EPHESIANS</h2>
<p>Paul gives two examples of prayer in Ephesians. In 1:17-23 he prays, &ldquo;That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him, the eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of His calling, and what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come; and He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; We need to pray for the saints in such a high way. Our prayer must be elevated from the earthly things to the heavenly things.</p>
<p>Then in 3:16-19 Paul prays, &ldquo;That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; We need to pray for the saints in this high way.</p>
<p>In 6:19 Paul also asks the saints to pray for him, that utterance would be given to him in the opening of his mouth, &ldquo;to make known in boldness the mystery of the gospel.&rdquo; We also need to pray for the apostles that they may have the utterance, the expression, to speak the mystery of the gospel. Most preachers today preach a low, shallow gospel, telling people only that they may be saved from hell, have their sins forgiven, and receive peace, joy, and God&rsquo;s blessing by believing in the Lord Jesus. This gospel is correct, but it is superficial. What Paul preached was deep, hidden, and mysterious. The mystery of the gospel is God&rsquo;s economy, the dispensing of Christ in His unsearchable riches into the believers to produce the church for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. To preach these mysterious and hidden things, there is the need of utterance. Human language is not adequate; we need divine utterance to speak concerning Christ as God&rsquo;s mystery, the church as Christ&rsquo;s mystery, and God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, economy, and dispensing.</p>
<p>If we all pray for these things in this kind of elevated prayer, the Lord will have a way to answer the prayer, and the proper church life will be brought in. The church has been on this earth for nearly two thousand years, but the situation among Christians today cannot satisfy God&rsquo;s heart. Few Christians see God&rsquo;s economy, the mystery of God, or the mystery of Christ. Before the Lord can come back, He needs a recovery of the proper church life to carry out His eternal purpose. He needs a group of people who see the great mystery of Christ and the church and who experience Christ to the uttermost so that corporately they become the expression of Christ, His organic Body as His fullness. This is our vision according to the divine revelation.</p></body></html>
