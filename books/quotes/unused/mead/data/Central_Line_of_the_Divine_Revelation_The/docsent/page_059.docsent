   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The old creation of man came out of the breathing in Genesis 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The new creation also came out of a breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Genesis we can see only the breathing of a breath, not of the person of the Divine Trinity, for the creation of man as a part of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The breathing in John 20:22 took place after Christ had passed through the processes of incarnation, human living for thirty-three and a half years, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before His ascension, on the day of His resurrection, Christ came back to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He did not teach them, but He breathed something into them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What He breathed into them was the Holy Spirit, who is the life-giving Spirit whom Christ became.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This Spirit who was breathed out by Christ was the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When God breathed His breath into Adam to animate the man of clay with a human spirit, He consummated the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the breathing in John 20:22 was after Christ had accomplished His New Testament work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Old Testament work of God's old creation was to create the physical things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the New Testament work of Christ was not like that.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ's New Testament work was of four steps.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, He became a man in incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before His incarnation He was the only begotten Son of God John 1:18 with divinity only; but through incarnation He put on blood and flesh Heb 2:14a as His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then He lived with the disciples for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This living was His working.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After this, He entered into an all-inclusive death, and then He entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His incarnation was to bring God into humanity; His crucifixion was to terminate that humanity; and His resurrection was to bring the crucified humanity into divinity, that is, to bring man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In His resurrection Christ's humanity was "sonized," and in His "sonized" humanity He was born to be the firstborn Son of God Acts 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ's coming from God to become a man to bring God into humanity and His going through death and entering into resurrection to bring humanity into divinity was a blending, a mingling, a compounding of God with man and man with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was in such a condition that Christ came to the disciples and breathed Himself into them, to compound, mingle, and blend Himself with them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Peter, John, James, and the other disciples were meeting in that small room, they represented the entire Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the Head breathed into the Body and told the Body to receive the Holy Spirit, we were there also.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After this breathing and receiving took place, the compounding, blending, and mingling of God with man was consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the time of the incarnation there was only one God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After John 20:22, however, there were at least one hundred twenty God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today this God-man has replenished the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everywhere we can see God-men, who are the blending, the mingling, the compounding of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The realization that we are the blending of God with man should uplift our estimation of our worth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are the blending, the compounding, of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No words can tell how great a blessing this is.</S>
