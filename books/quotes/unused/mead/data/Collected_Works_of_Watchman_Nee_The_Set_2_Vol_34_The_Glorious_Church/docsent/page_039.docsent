   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Do we sense the preciousness of this?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must remember this one thing all of our seeking and all of our growth is not for us as individuals, but for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What each member receives from God is for the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When your ears hear a word, you cannot say that you have not heard, because your ears are united to your body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When your mouth says something wrong, you cannot deny that you have spoken wrongly, because your mouth and body are united.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the same way, whatever the overcomers accomplish is the accomplishment of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since our Lord is the Head of the church, whatever He has accomplished on the cross belongs to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Likewise, as we receive benefit from the Head, we also receive benefit from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we partake of what the Lord has accomplished, we also partake of what the other members have accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When God sees the readiness of the overcomers, He reckons it as the readiness of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, it can be said that the wife has made herself ready.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The readiness of the wife especially refers to the garments of the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 19:8 says, "And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Scriptures reveal that there are two kinds of garments for Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus is our clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The other is the fine linen garment, bright and clean, spoken of in verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever we come before God, the Lord Jesus is our garment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is our righteousness, and we put Him on when we approach God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This garment is our common clothing; every saint is clothed before God and cannot be found naked.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the other hand, when we are presented to Christ, we must be arrayed with fine linen, bright and clean.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the righteousnesses of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Righteousnesses" means a succession of righteous deeds, one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All of these righteous deeds together are our fine linen garment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we were saved, we began to obtain a fine linen garment for our adornment the righteousnesses of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can also see these two sets of garments for the Christian in Psalm 45.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 13 says, "The King's daughter is all glorious within the royal abode;/Her garment is a woven work inwrought with gold."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The material of her clothing is gold, beaten gold.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then verse 14 says, "She will be led to the King in embroidered clothing."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The clothing mentioned in verse 13 differs from that in verse 14.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 13 the clothing is of gold, but in verse 14 the clothing is of embroidered work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fine linen garments in Revelation 19 are embroidered, they are not of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What then is gold?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus is gold.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is gold because He is entirely of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The righteousness which the Lord Jesus gave us, the clothing which He put upon us when we were saved was something of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Besides this clothing, we have been embroidering another garment from the day we received our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This relates to the righteous acts of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In other words, the clothing of gold is given to us by God through the Lord Jesus, while the clothing of embroidered work is given to us by the Lord Jesus through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we believed in the Lord, God gave us a gold garment through the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This garment is the Lord Jesus Himself, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was furnished by Him, ready-made.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The embroidered garment, however, is related to our deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is wrought one stitch at a time by the working of the Holy Spirit in us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is the meaning of embroidery?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Originally, there is a plain piece of material with nothing upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Later, something is sewed into it with thread, and by this sewing work, the original material and the thread become one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that when the Spirit of God works upon us, He constitutes Christ into us this is the embroidery work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we will not only have a garment of gold, but also a garment embroidered by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By this work Christ will be constituted in us and expressed from us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This embroidered garment is the righteous acts of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not done once for all, but repeatedly carried on day after day until God says that it is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Perhaps some may ask what the righteous acts are that are specifically spoken of here.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Gospels record many righteous acts, such as Mary's act of expressing her love to the Lord by anointing Him with ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This righteousness may be one of the crosswise or lengthwise threads in her fine linen garment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There were others, such as Joanna, the wife of Chuza, and many other women, who because of their love for the Lord ministered to His material needs and those of His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These also are righteous acts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our heart is often touched by the love of the Lord, and we make an outward expression of it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is our righteousness, our fine linen garment.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the embroidering work which is being done today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Any expression which results from our love for the Lord and which is done through the Holy Spirit is a stitch among the thousands of other stitches in the embroidery work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Bible tells us that whoever will give only a cup of cold water unto a little one will by no means lose his reward.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is a righteous act done out of love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we have some expression or act of love for the Lord, it is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Revelation 7:9 says that the garment is a white robe.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It has been washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must remember that we can only be made white by being cleansed from our sins through the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Not only must we be cleansed from our sins, but we must also be cleansed from our good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It too can only be made white by being washed in the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Not a single deed of any Christian is originally white.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even if we have some righteousness, it is mixed and not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We often have been kind to others, but inwardly we have been unwilling.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We often have been patient with others, but when we have gone home we have murmured.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, after having done some righteous deed, we still need the cleansing of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We need the blood of the Lord Jesus to cleanse us from the sins we commit, and we also need the blood of the Lord Jesus to cleanse our righteous acts.</S>
