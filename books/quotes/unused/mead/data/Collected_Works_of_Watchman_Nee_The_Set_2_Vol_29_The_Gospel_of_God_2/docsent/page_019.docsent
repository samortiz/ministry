   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ARGUMENT BASED ON GALATIANS 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Galatians 5:4 says, "You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When many read this verse, they think that, first, one can be separated from Christ, and second, one can fall from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such a one is surely not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This understanding is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to realize the background in which Paul wrote the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the clear gospel of God was preached to Galatia, the people there heard it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After this, false prophets came to Galatia to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They did not change the first half of the gospel; they changed the second half.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first half said that man was saved only by trusting in Christ and receiving Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, the second half said that before one believes in the Lord Jesus, he cannot have the righteousness from the law; but after one receives the Lord Jesus, he should have the righteousness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul wrote the book of Galatians just to refute them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He argued that as a man cannot have the righteousness of the law while he is yet a sinner, in the same way, he cannot have the righteousness of the law after he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have seen in the previous few messages that Romans and Galatians are different.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Romans says that while we are sinners, we cannot have the righteousness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Galatians says that after a sinner is saved, he still cannot have the righteousness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The subject of both books is not having the righteousness which is of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These ones taught that after a man has believed in Christ, is saved, and has eternal life, he has to have the righteousness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first thing and the minimum requirement of the righteousness of the law is circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After you are clear about the background of this book, you will know what Galatians is speaking of here.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In chapter one Paul said that he marveled that the Galatians were so quickly removing from Him who had called them in the grace of Christ to a different gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He marveled that they were so quickly deceived to follow another gospel v. 6 . He also said that if he, an angel, or any spirit came and preached to them a gospel different from what they had received, they should be anathematized.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word anathematize is the strongest word of curse in the Greek language.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It means that all the curse in heaven falls on the cursed one and that all the blessings are withheld.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul said that his gospel was revealed to him by God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He received it in the wilderness of Arabia.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the reason that his gospel could not contain any mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Galatians 2 tells us what this gospel is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this chapter Peter pretended.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When he saw the Jews coming in from James vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>11-12 , he maintained himself as a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul rebuked him to his face.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Circumcision means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ has already died.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is no longer we who live, but Christ who lives.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Chapter three tells us that God's goal is not the law but the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The reason that God gave man the law was to cause man first to know his sin and then to accept the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Chapter four brings out two other things to show us that it is useless for man to keep the law even if he is able to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hagar represents the law, and Sarah represents grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hagar must go before Sarah can remain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even if you can keep the law, you are just Hagar, and you still have to go.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first sentence in chapter five is, "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ has brought us into freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must now stand firm in this freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not lose this freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a man keeps circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the system of the law is retained, Christ will have to be denied.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One cannot keep the law a little and then ask Christ to make up the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ never does this kind of piecemeal work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, Paul said, "And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law" 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why would some not choose other things in the law?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Why would some only pick up the matter of circumcision?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Why would they only pick up what they liked and not keep the whole law?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If they wanted to keep one item of the law, they would also have to keep the entire law.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If one stays, all have to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They cannot choose one and reject all the others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 4 says, "You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To be brought to nought from Christ means the same thing as Christ profiting nothing at the end of verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It seems as if Christ is not expressed in you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You do not have forgiveness, joy, and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Furthermore, if you follow the law, Christ will be brought to nought in you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Here, it is not a matter of receiving salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is speaking of the condition to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Suppose a brother comes to me and says, "Mr. Nee, I should keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If I do not keep the Sabbath, my salvation will not be complete."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I know that this brother is indeed saved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is no question about it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now that he has received such a wrong teaching, I must tell him, "If you keep the Sabbath, the work of Christ will have no effect on you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is of faith that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now you have gone back to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You have fallen from grace."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Thus, it is not a question of salvation or perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is a matter of the condition for being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It shows us that a man is saved by Christ and not by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If a man keeps the law, there will be no grace.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We know that sin leads to perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But we must realize that the book of Galatians is not on the subject of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The book of Galatians speaks of good works.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It speaks of keeping the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Galatians is on the keeping of the law and circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Paul did not say that they had fallen into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He said that they had fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There is a big difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>To be fallen from grace and to fall into sin are two entirely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>To be fallen from grace is to be fallen from the principle of grace and to follow the principle of works once again.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Today, there are numerous saved believers who have fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But they have not lost their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Even we ourselves are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>A countless number of times we think that we are through.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But our salvation is because of the grace of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Paul said that those in Galatians 5 strove to overcome, but they had fallen from grace to trust in their works instead.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They wanted to have good works, but when they did this, they fell.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>What is to be in grace?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Grace means that we are lowly and helpless persons.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We have received grace before God.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We are in a lowly position.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We are looking to God to give us grace.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>As such, we are those that live in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It is not a matter of sin or evil conduct here.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If a man trusts in his own work, he is obstructing the grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Paul rebuked the Galatians here for following the law after they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>They had fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He reprimanded them for not having received enough grace and not having received enough mercy from God.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>To receive mercy and grace from God is to allow God to work.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This proves that the flesh is incapable and cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We can work by our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>But those in the flesh do not please God.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Suppose Brother Yau is an unprincipled man.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Every day he earns a dollar fifty cents but spends two dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Tonight I have pity on him.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>He is short of fifty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>I give him sixty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>He is like this every day, and I have pity on him also every day.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Suppose one day Brother Yau starts thinking, "Mr. Nee has had pity on me and has sent me money every day.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>But I have to think of a way to discipline myself a little."</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>When he does this, he is doing what the Galatians were doing with circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>They were doing it in the flesh, and as a result, they had fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>I have met such people.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>From the world's point of view, I like such people.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>They do not want others to feed them the rest of their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>They want to be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>This is good.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>But the Bible says that, as far as God is concerned, this is wrong because such people have fallen from His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Paul was not rebuking them for sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Paul was rebuking them for doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Paul rebuked them for doing good because their doing good meant that they did not need God's mercy anymore for the rest of their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>They would not live in God's mercy anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>My friends, man's thought is totally different from God's thought.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>We think that we can please God by doing a little.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>But God is happy when we remain in His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>He repeatedly says that He desires mercy and not sacrifice Matt 9:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Mercy is for God to give you something, and sacrifice is for you to give something to God.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>God desires mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>This means that He likes to give things to you.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>He does not desire sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>This means that He does not want you to give things to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>If God can give things away, He will feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>This is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Salvation is not to make us happy.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Salvation is to make God happy.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>God likes to keep giving.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>He wants to work continually on us.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>He wants to give us grace.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>You might think that it is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>But He thinks that it is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>You are a poor man and can get by with a few pennies a day.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>But now you are given a few dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>No wonder you would think that it is too much.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>If God is to do something, He wants to do it to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>If you allow Him to do only a little, He will not feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>If you want to be saved, you have to willingly allow God to work.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>You have to ask God to be merciful to you.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>God can only be happy if He is allowed to work this way.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>If you keep trying to give God something, He will not feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>When God sees you being shown mercy, He is happy.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>This is why I say that God desires mercy and not sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>Galatians 5:4 says that we should not fall outside of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>It does not say that we should not fall into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>What is contended here is not the question of salvation, but the question of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>Before God, we need not move, and we need not keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>We do not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>We should just allow God to work on us and to give us grace.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>Once we have works, we are fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>Hence, to say that one has fallen from grace does not refer to the question of salvation and perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>To be fallen from grace is a question of whether or not we enjoy Christ's benefits for us.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>To be fallen from grace is a matter of whether or not one allows the work of Christ to operate in him.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>We thank the Lord that salvation means to be continually under God's mercy and to be continually under His grace.</S>
