Strong and Young</h2><p>The burnt offering was to be strong and young. This means that it was to be full of strength and freshness, with no weakness and no oldness. In Leviticus 1 a male signifies strength, and a young one signifies freshness. Spiritually speaking, Christ was a male, full of strength, and He was young, full of freshness. He was strong, and He was fresh. Although Christ is ancient, He is never old. He is always fresh and strong. With Him there is no weakness or oldness.<h2 class=head2>E. Without Blemish</h2><p>The burnt offering had to be without blemish. This means that it had to be without defects and faults. As the burnt offering, Christ is without defects and faults (1 Pet. 1:19; Heb. 9:14).<h2 class=head1>III. OFFERED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING</h2><h2 class=head2>A. In the Outer Court of the Tabernacle</h2><p>The burnt offering was offered at the entrance of the tent of meeting (Lev. 1:3), that is, in the outer court of the tabernacle. The outer court signifies the earth.<h2 class=head2>B. Accepted before Jehovah</h2><p>The burnt offering, which was offered on the altar in the outer court, was accepted before Jehovah (v. 3). The altar signifies the cross. The cross on which Christ offered Himself was on earth, but His offering of Himself was before God. He offered Himself on earth, and He was accepted by God and before God.<h2 class=head1>IV. THE OFFERER</h2><p>Leviticus 1:4-6 speaks of the offerer.<h2 class=head2>A. Laying His Hand on the Offering</h2><p>Leviticus 1:4 says of the offerer, &#8220;He shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be accepted for him to make propitiation for him.&#8221; The offerer was not only to bring the offering but also to lay his hand on the offering.<h2 class=head3>1. Signifying Identification, Not Substitution</h2><p>In the Scripture, the laying on of hands always signifies identification, union; it does not signify substitution. To lay our hand on the offering means that we are one with the offering and take the offering as being one with us. Hence, the laying on of hands makes the two parties one.<p>By laying our hands on Christ as our burnt offering we are joined to Him. We and He, He and we, become one. Such a union, such an identification, indicates that all our weaknesses, defects, shortcomings, and faults become His and that all His virtues become ours. This is not exchange-it is union.<p>We may realize that we are altogether unqualified and hopeless. This is our actual situation. But when we lay our hands on Christ, our weak points become His, and His strong points, His virtues, become ours. Furthermore, spiritually speaking, by such a union He becomes one with us and lives in us. As He lives in us, He will repeat in us the life He lived on earth, the life of the burnt offering. In ourselves we cannot live this kind of life, but He can live it in us. By laying our hands on Him we make Him one with us, and we make ourselves one with Him. Then He will repeat His living in us. This is to offer the burnt offering.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Leviticus &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
