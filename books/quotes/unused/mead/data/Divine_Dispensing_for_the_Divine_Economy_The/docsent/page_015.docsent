   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Process of the Divine Dispensing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the Gospel of John, the eternal God who created the heavens and the earth became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The process whereby He became a man was by entering the womb of a virgin, Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was the great God who created the heavens and the earth, but He came into a virgin's womb and remained there for nine months until His birth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Word which was God became flesh in the way ordained by God for every man's birth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He came by way of conception and birth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was born as a little babe named Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The shepherds in the fields around Bethlehem came to see the baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger Luke 2:12, 15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a babe, He escaped to Egypt and returned to a village called Nazareth in the despised region of Galilee Matt 2:13-14, 19-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He lived in Nazareth for thirty years and worked as a carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the age of thirty, the age according to God's ordination that a man may enter into the service of the tabernacle Num 4:46-47 , the Lord Jesus came out to preach, but He actually came out to dispense.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not dispense doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He began to dispense Himself as the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As He began to dispense Himself, people were attracted.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I was young, I could not understand why the Lord Jesus was so attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Peter, Andrew, James, and John dropped everything to follow Him Matt 4:18-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was like an immense magnet, drawing His seekers to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He attracted all kinds of men and women, even a wife of a high official Luke 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many followed Him during the three and a half years of His ministry because He infused the embodied God into people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many in Christianity hold the concept that the Lord was merely teaching His disciples during this time, but this understanding is too shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was not a matter of the disciples receiving some doctrine or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They received a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This person was dispensed into them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's incarnation was the first step of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His human living was the second step, and His death was the third step.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the three and a half years of His ministry, the Lord Jesus went to the cross and died in order to accomplish an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The main purpose of His death was not to take away sins, but to release the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was a grain of wheat falling into the ground to die John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A grain of wheat remains the same until it is sown into soil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the soil it dies, and through death the inner life within the grain is released.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The main aspect of Christ's all-inclusive death was the release of His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The release of the divine life is the dispensing of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After passing through death, the Lord Jesus entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His death released the divine life, and His resurrection applied the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In resurrection He regenerated us 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We were regenerated two thousand years ago, before our natural birth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our regeneration preceded our natural birth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many count our regeneration as our second birth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is correct, but we must also realize that our second birth took place before our first birth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to our experience we were first born physically, and then spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But in God's sight, we were regenerated two thousand years ago at the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We know this because the Bible tells us so in 1 Peter 1:3.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection with regeneration, the processed Triune God is now within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His being in us is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is no longer in the manger, on the cross, in the tomb, or in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is not just in the heavens; He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If He were only in the heavens, He would be apart from and far away from us, but He is now with us and in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is nearer and dearer to us than anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our wife or husband can be with us, but they can never get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Jesus is within us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are so small, yet the processed and consummated Triune God dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In resurrection, the Lord became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the evening of the day of His resurrection, He came back to His disciples and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit" John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Holy Spirit here was the holy breath as the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In eternity He was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He then was conceived in the womb and born as a little babe in a manger.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He lived as a man in Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He began to travel and minister.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Eventually, He went to the cross, to the tomb, and to Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He then entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In resurrection He became the Spirit to regenerate us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After regenerating us, He stays within us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This wonderful One who was the Word in the beginning is now within us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He is within us as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, who is the consummated, processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In John 7:37-38 the Lord Jesus told us that He is the living water for us to drink, and in John 6:35 He said that He is the bread of life for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The intrinsic view of the Gospel of John concerning the Triune God is that He went through all of the processes to be consummated so that He could be available for His chosen people to eat, drink, and breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now He is within all of His eaters, drinkers, and breathers.</S>
