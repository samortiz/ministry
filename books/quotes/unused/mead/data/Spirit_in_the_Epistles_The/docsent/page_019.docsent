   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DYING TO THE LAW THAT CHRIST MAY BE FORMED IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The apostle wrote the book of Galatians with a strong intention to break down the Galatians' concept of keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The problem of the Galatians is the problem of every Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to our natural concept, we the saved ones all have a desire to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In other words, we like to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Immediately after we are saved, we have a concept within us, thinking that before we believed in the Lord, we had a bad temper and our conduct was poor; now that we are saved, we ought to improve our conduct and behave properly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The strange thing is that every Christian has this concept also whenever he is revived.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He has the feeling that formerly he was a careless and indifferent Christian, but now since he has been revived through the Lord's mercy, he should behave properly and not be so loose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brothers and sisters, is this concept right or wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Humanly speaking, it is a very good concept; from God's viewpoint, however, it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This kind of doing good is equivalent to the Jews' keeping of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is the flesh that keeps the law and works out the law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever man desires to do good, he uses his own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes you know that you are weak, so you pray to the Lord for help.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, the Lord will never answer this kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Truthfully speaking, the more you wish to do good, the more the Lord wishes that you would not do good.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You think that it would be good if you could succeed, but the Lord considers that it would be good if you fail.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, you may have a bad temper, so you pray to the Lord, asking Him to help you to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the more you pray in this way, the less patience you have.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Your temper worsens, even to such an extent that you are altogether disappointed with yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You say, "Lord, I have no way anymore!"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When such a day comes, the Lord would say, "This is wonderful!"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because His intention is not for us to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers and sisters, God has no intention for us to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, God wants us to live out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's goal is not the law but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Galatians chapter one says it pleased God to reveal His Son in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Chapter two says it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not we who are doing good, but it is Christ who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Man was created in the image of God, and the image of God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second Corinthians 4:4 says that Christ is the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Colossians 1:15 also says that the beloved Son is the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why did God create man according to Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He did this in order that one day He might put Christ in man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man is a vessel to contain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A glove is made according to the shape of the hand, and it is also made to contain the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If I want to put my hand into the glove, but the glove is uncooperative and does not give me the room, my hand cannot be comfortable inside the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the fingers of my hand must fit into the glove; only then can my hand feel comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that moment the glove is altogether the same as the shape of the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may say that the hand has been formed in the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After we have been saved, the Lord Jesus is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, He is very frustrated in us, and sometimes He is imprisoned in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may not give Him any ground in our soul, including our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Finally one day, as we are moved by His love, we gradually open ourselves to Him and give Him more ground.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then He is able to spread outward.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At a certain time we may have an argument with the Lord again, and we are not willing to give Him more ground; then He has to stop there and wait patiently.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes He may be gracious to us and may draw us with His love, yet it is still to no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then He may be forced to lift His hand to give us a little blow.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In any case, if you would not be subdued by Him this year, two years later He will subdue you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you would not be subdued by Him in this life, He will subdue you when He comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since He is in us, in spite of everything He must be formed in us.</S>
