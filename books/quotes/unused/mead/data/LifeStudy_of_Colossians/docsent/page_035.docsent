   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A JOINT PARTAKER OF TRIBULATION IN JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Revelation 1:9 John says that he was a joint partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To say that we are joint partakers in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus indicates that we are suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Jesus lived on earth as a man, He suffered continually.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the history of His life, His name Jesus denotes a suffering person, a man of sorrows Isa 53:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, to be a joint partaker of tribulation in Jesus is to suffer and to be persecuted as we follow Jesus the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The book of Revelation is for those who are suffering tribulation in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we wait for the coming of the Lord, we must be willing to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This suffering is for the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must participate in the sufferings of Jesus for the sake of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Jesus was on earth, He was persecuted by the Jewish religion, a religion formed according to God s oracles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 5:16 says that the Jews persecuted Jesus because He broke their Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Religious people cannot tolerate the breaking of their regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Any violation of their religious regulations will stir up persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Jesus broke the Sabbath, the Jewish religionists persecuted Him and even sought to kill Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, religion succeeded in sentencing Jesus to death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just as religion persecuted Jesus, it also persecutes the followers of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We know from the book of Acts that the Jews in the synagogues stood up in opposition to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul suffered this kind of persecution very much.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John, the writer of Revelation, also experienced it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John was exiled to the island of Patmos for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He became a joint partaker in the suffering, the affliction, in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The persecution against the Lord Jesus originated not with the secular world, but with the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the book of Acts we see that the situation was the same regarding the persecution of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The opposition did not come mainly from the Gentiles, but from the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In like manner, a great many martyrs have suffered persecution at the hand of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Religion always persecutes the genuine followers of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now it is our turn to undergo this persecution, this suffering for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During the years I was with Brother Nee in China, I saw how much he was persecuted by religion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The rumors, opposition, and condemnation came from the religious people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In his subtlety, Satan, the Devil, uses religion to oppose and to persecute those who follow the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, like John on the island of Patmos, we also must be joint partakers in the tribulation in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this way we make up what is lacking of the afflictions of Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>SUFFERING FOR THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 2 Timothy 2:10 Paul says, Therefore I endure all things for the elect s sake.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This verse is a further indication that Paul suffered for the sake of the elect, God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, 2 Corinthians 1:5 and 6 say, For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is another indication of how much Paul suffered for the saints.</S>
