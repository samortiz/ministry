<h2 class="head2">The Word of Scripture<br />
Being both God and the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed.&rdquo; The Scripture as the word of God is breathed out of God; it is what God breathed out. Hence, the word of the Scripture is God. We may also say that the word of the Scripture is the Spirit, because God is Spirit and what He breathes out is also Spirit. We should never regard the words in the Bible as merely words. The words in the Bible should not be regarded as merely black and white letters. They are God-breathed; they are God&rsquo;s breathing out. Therefore, when we touch the words in the Bible, we touch God.</p>
<p>In John 6:63 the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; Since the Bible is God-breathed, God&rsquo;s breathing out, the words in the Bible convey God. Since God is Spirit, the words that come out from within God are also Spirit. Let us use a glass of grape juice as an illustration. We know that the liquid that we pour out of this glass must be grape juice because it came from a glass that contains grape juice. The words of the Bible are God-breathed. Since the essence of God is Spirit, whatever God breathes out is God and is also Spirit. In other words, the words of God are breathed out from within God and are God. Therefore, in essence the words in the Bible convey God. Furthermore, since God is Spirit, the words breathed out from God, which are God, must be Spirit.</p>
<p>If we would understand the relationship between God, His word, and the Holy Spirit, we need a proper attitude toward the words in the Bible. The Lord&rsquo;s word and the Holy Spirit are one. Hence, in order to have a proper attitude toward the Lord&rsquo;s word, we must have a proper relationship with the Holy Spirit. If we are not filled with the Holy Spirit within, it will be difficult for us to have a proper attitude toward the word. If the Holy Spirit does not have the ground within us, it will not be easy for the word to have the ground within us. We must be filled with the Holy Spirit so that we may have a proper attitude toward the word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO PRAY IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In order to have a proper attitude toward the Lord&rsquo;s word, we must learn to pray in the Holy Spirit so that we may be filled with the Holy Spirit. A person who is filled with the Holy Spirit must be one who prays. A person of prayer will be filled with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit can be likened to air. If a person desires to be filled with air, he must breathe in air. When we take a deep breath, we are filled with air. Similarly, if we would be filled with the Holy Spirit, we need spiritual breathing. Our prayer can be likened to breathing. When we pray, we breathe the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Jude 20 says, &ldquo;Praying in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; When a person breathes, he is neither in water nor in fire; rather, he is in the air, and consequently he inhales air. Whatever sphere we are in when we breathe is what we inhale and receive. If we are in the air, we will inhale and receive air. In the same principle, when we pray in the Holy Spirit, we receive the Holy Spirit. What we receive in our prayer is the Holy Spirit. We breathe in the air, and as a result we are filled with air. We breathe in the Holy Spirit, and as a result we are filled with the Holy Spirit. When we pray in the Holy Spirit, spontaneously we are filled with the Holy Spirit. On the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit came down, and the one hundred twenty disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1-4). They received the Holy Spirit because they had prayed for ten days in one accord (1:14). They prayed and prayed until they received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit&mdash;the outward filling of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, in order to have a proper attitude toward the word, we must deal with the Holy Spirit properly. In order to deal with the Holy Spirit properly and be filled with the Holy Spirit, we must be a person of prayer. We must pray in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD ENTERING INTO MAN<br />
ALONG WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When we pray in the Holy Spirit, we must accept the Lord&rsquo;s word and let it have the ground in us. When we pray, we are in the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit fills us. Since the Holy Spirit and the word are one, when the Holy Spirit enters into us and fills us, He brings the word into us. The word is the Spirit. Consequently, when the Spirit enters into us, He brings the word into us. Whenever the Holy Spirit fills us, the word also enters into us. It is impossible to be moved by the Holy Spirit and not have the word within us. When the Holy Spirit comes, the word also comes. We cannot separate the Holy Spirit from the word.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to go to a movie. The Spirit will touch you and tell you not to go. This shows that the Holy Spirit is moving within you. While He is moving, there is also a speaking within you, telling you not to go. The moving of the Holy Spirit is the Lord&rsquo;s word. Every time the Holy Spirit touches you, you have the word. The Spirit is the word, and the word is the Spirit.</p>
<p>In John 14:21 the Lord said, &ldquo;He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me.&rdquo; Then in verse 23 He says, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word.&rdquo; How does the Lord&rsquo;s word come to us? The word comes to us with the Spirit, and the Spirit comes into us mainly through prayer. Most of the time we have the moving of the Holy Spirit through our prayer. Whenever we pray, the Spirit will operate and move within us, and the Spirit&rsquo;s moving and operating is the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. Whenever there is the moving of the Holy Spirit, there is the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. When the Holy Spirit moves within us, we should receive the word. This is to receive the moving of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We should also keep the Lord&rsquo;s word. This means that we should obey the Lord&rsquo;s speaking in us and His leading. Some might ask what they should do if they do not have the strength to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s leading. Since we have the Holy Spirit in us, we do not lack strength when the Lord speaks. The Spirit is inside of us. The word in us is the Holy Spirit in us; the two cannot be separated. The word is the Spirit. The Holy Spirit comes into us when we pray, and once the Holy Spirit comes into us, we have the word. Once we receive the Lord&rsquo;s word into us, we immediately have the Lord&rsquo;s presence, His manifestation, and the Lord will make His abode with us. This is the time that we should pray more. The more we pray, the more we will be filled with the Holy Spirit and have the word. The more we have the word, the more we will have His presence in us, and the more we have His presence, the easier it will be to pray. This is what John 15:7 says: &ldquo;If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crucial point is that the relationship between the word and the Holy Spirit is absolute. The word conveys the Holy Spirit. Therefore, if we want the word in the Scriptures to enter into us, we must be persons of prayer; we must pray in the Holy Spirit. Without the realization that the word and the Holy Spirit are one, our attitude toward the word will not be proper. Similarly, if we are not persons who regularly pray in the Holy Spirit, even if the word comes into us, there will be no ground in us for it. Hence, we must first know that the Word and the Holy Spirit are one. Next we must learn to pray regularly in the Holy Spirit. Whenever we pray in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit will fill our inner being. When the Spirit fills us, He brings the Lord&rsquo;s word into us. As we receive the word, we spontaneously touch His presence and obtain His manifestation. Then we are filled further with the Holy Spirit, and we have a desire to pray. The more we pray, the more we are filled with the Holy Spirit, and the more we are filled with the Holy Spirit, the more we have the word. Furthermore, the more we receive the word, the more we touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence and obtain His manifestation. Then there will be a further moving of the Holy Spirit within us, and we will have more prayer. We should experience this in our spiritual life all the time.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must pay attention to one thing: we must exercise to live in the Lord and to have His genuine manifestation, that is, His presence. To this end we must be persons of prayer who learn to pray diligently, and we must also be persons who read the Word and study it.</p>
