   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Satan gained Adam's will through his emotion, and caused him to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The way Satan beguiled Eve was to confuse her mind, gain her will, and then cause her to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When man's will, mind, and emotion were poisoned by the serpent to follow Satan and to rebel against God, the spirit with which man communicates with God received a fatal blow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here we see the principle of Satan's work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He beguiled man's soul to sin through the things of the flesh the eating of the fruit .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once the soul has sinned, the spirit falls into darkness and degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the order of all his works from the outside to the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Either he works from man's body or he works from his mind or his emotion for the purpose of gaining his will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once man's will surrenders, Satan gains the whole being, and the spirit is put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The way he worked the first time is the way he works in all subsequent times.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's work is always from the inside to the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He first works from man's spirit, then enlightens man's mind, touches man's emotion, finally causes man to exercise his will to activate his body to carry out God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the devil's works go from the outside to the inside, while all the works of God's Spirit go from the inside to the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this way we can differentiate what is of God and what is of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows us that once Satan gains man's will, he controls man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must be careful to realize that the soul is the organ of man's personality; it is the part that expresses man's free will and is man's master.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why the Bible often says that it is the soul that has committed sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Micah 6:7 mentions "the sin of my soul."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ezekiel 18:4 and 20 speak of "the soul that sinneth."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Leviticus and Numbers, we often see the expression "if a soul sin" KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Proposing to sin is the function of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The definition of sin is the will responding to temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, to sin is a matter of the will, which is of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason, propitiation is for the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"To make an atonement propitiation for your souls" Exo 30:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"To make propitiation for your souls" Lev 17:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"To make an atonement for our souls before the Lord" Num 31:50 KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the one who sins is the soul, the one who requires atonement is also the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For the same reason, only a soul can atone sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"But Jehovah was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>/ If You make His soul a trespass offering, / ...Because of the travail of His soul, He will see / And He will be satisfied; / ...Because He poured out His soul unto death...</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>/ Yet He alone bore the sin of many / And interceded for the transgressors" Isa 53:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we study the nature of Adam's sin, we will find that besides rebellion, there is also the matter of independence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should always bear in mind the matter of the free will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The tree of life signifies dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the beginning, man had not yet received God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If he had received this life, he would have obtained eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This shows that there was the possibility for man to attain to the highest form of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It also shows that man did not attain to it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Man will not attain to the highest until he has acquired God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the meaning of dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies independence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man wants to have knowledge that God has not given to him and tries to gain the things outside of God by exercising his own will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All these speak of independence.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When man rebelled against God, it was a sign of independence because rebellion against God means that there is no further need to depend on God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For man to try to know good and evil is also a sign of independence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is not satisfied with what God has given him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The difference between being spiritual and being soulish is very clear here.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be spiritual is to fully trust in God and to be satisfied with what God has given.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be soulish is to turn away from God and to freely seek after what God has not given, in particular, to seek after knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Independence is a characteristic of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No matter how good a matter is, even if it is the matter of worship, if there is not the total dependence on God and if there is any self-assurance or self-confidence, it is something soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Within a man, the tree of life cannot grow vigorously by the side of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This rebellion and independence is the principle of transgression for all sinners as well as for the believers.</S>
