   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Question:John 4:14b mentions the fountain and the springing up, but where is the river, signifying the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Answer:The springing up is the spring flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The river is implied in the flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Into here means issuing in, or to be, to become.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The New Jerusalem will be there through the Triune God's flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the beginning of the Bible, God was there.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the end of the Bible is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the beginning, in eternity past, was the Word, who was God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In eternity future the Word becomes the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that in the beginning was God, and at the end He becomes the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the New Jerusalem is the issue of God's flowing in three stages: in the Father's stage, in the Son's stage, and in the Spirit's stage.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All three stages are in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have the fountain, the spring, and the river within us at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fountain emerges, the spring gushes, and the gushing is the flowing as a river into the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Corinthians 12:13 says, "We were all baptized into one body."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This does not mean the Body is apart from us and that we have been put into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It means we have been baptized into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The baptism of the Spirit put us all together to be the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Into means "to be."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have been baptized to be the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, we will be the New Jerusalem, which is God mingled, blended, and incorporated with man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now we can see that one half of a verse, John 4:14b, covers the entire Bible.</S>
