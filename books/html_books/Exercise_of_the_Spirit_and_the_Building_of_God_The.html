<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book contains fifteen messages given by Brother Witness Lee in June 1961. Chapters 1 through 4 were spoken in a conference of the church in Taipei, chapters 5 through 7 were spoken in co-workers&rsquo; meetings, and chapters 8 through 12 were spoken in the service meetings of the church in Taipei. The time and place where chapters 13 through 15 were given are unknown. These messages were published in Chinese in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> from July through December 1961.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
AND PRAYER IN THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:6; 4:24; 1 Cor. 6:17; 12:3; 2 Cor. 3:17-18; Eph. 2:22; John 16:14-15</h1>
<p>The Lord has shown us the vision of the building up of the church. He has also shown us that the building of the church depends on the priests (see <em>The Vision of the Building of the Church, The Blueprint and the Ground for the Building Up of the Church,</em> and <em>The Priesthood and God&rsquo;s Building</em>). In order to be built up together, the saints must be priests. Only the priests live in the Holy of Holies; that is, they are in spirit and can be built up together in God. In this chapter we will cover the relationship between our spirit and building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
DEPENDING ON<br />
THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</h2>
<p>The building of the church is accomplished by building God into man. We should not think that the builded church is composed of only human beings. The church is built by building God into man and building man into God. When God is built into man and man is built into God, those who are many become one Body in one Spirit. The Body being one depends not only on man but also on God. When God is in all of us and we are in God, we are one Body. This is the way that we are built together.</p>
<p>In the New Testament age, the age of grace, God is doing a specific work in His Son and through the Holy Spirit. He is entering into people to become their constitution so that they may be filled with the element of God. God is also bringing these people, who are filled with His element, into Himself. This is the mingling of God with man; this is God entering into man and being mingled with man. The believers who have been mingled with God are built up together in God.</p>
<p>When we are in ourselves instead of in God, we are scattered and torn down. There is oneness and building only when we enter into God. The building up of the church is not a matter of being united because we have the same opinions, the same views, or even the same feelings toward one another. At the most, such a group would be a pleasant organization. The church is not built on having the same opinions or feelings; the church is built on Christ (Matt. 16:18). God is building Himself into man in order to be man&rsquo;s constituent. God is also bringing man into the Spirit so that man can be full of God&rsquo;s element. All those who are in God are spontaneously one Body. This one Body is the building. The building of the church is not a matter of human organization, nor is it based on having the same views or feelings. Rather, the building of the church is a matter of being mingled with God and being saturated with the Spirit. Those who are mingled with God and submerged in the Spirit are in the God of glory and are being built up together as one Body to be God&rsquo;s dwelling place, His glorious family.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD IN HIS SON<br />
BEING EVERYTHING TO MAN</h2>
<p>God had to take some definite steps in order to reach the goal of being mingled with man. First, God put all His elements, all the fullness of the Godhead, all His glory, in His Son, Christ (Col. 2:9). God wants His Son to have the first place in all things (1:18). Therefore, a person who does not know Christ does not have a way to know God, and if he does not contact Christ, he does not have a way to contact God. If he does not have a relationship with the Son, he will be alienated from God, because it is impossible to touch God outside of Christ, the Son of God (John 14:6). God is in His Son, and He wants to glorify His Son, our Lord Jesus (v. 11; 17:5). Any person who is willing to contact the Lord Jesus, no matter the time or the place, will immediately touch God. As long as he believes in the Lord Jesus, he will have a relationship with God. Human beings cannot obtain God apart from the Son of God. All God&rsquo;s glory, all the fullness of the Godhead, and all God&rsquo;s elements are in His Son bodily so that the Son can be everything to man for man&rsquo;s enjoyment and possession.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is everything to us. He is our life, our light, our way, and our wisdom. He is our bread of life and our living water, and He is our power, our joy, our peace, and our comfort. All that we need is in the glorious Son of God, because all the fullness of God dwells in the Son for us to enjoy, possess, and experience. For this reason, we need a deeper and more thorough knowledge of the Son. The Bible says that we need to know God (Col. 1:9-10; 1 John 4:7; Rom. 1:28), and it repeatedly says that we need to know Christ, the Son of God (Eph. 4:13; 2 Cor. 2:14; Eph. 3:19; Phil. 3:10; Col. 2:2; 2 Pet. 1:2).</p>
<p>The apostle Paul wrote the Epistle to the Philippians while he was in prison. In 3:10 he says, &ldquo;To know Him.&rdquo; This word does not refer to Paul&rsquo;s knowing Christ in the past but to his knowing Christ in an ongoing way. When Paul wrote this Epistle, he had been an apostle for many years with many considerably deep experiences of the Lord, yet he still said, &ldquo;To know Him.&rdquo; Christ is boundless and limitless. In Ephesians 3:18 the apostle says that Christ is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe. There is no way to describe how wide is the breadth, or how long is the length, or how high is the height, or how deep is the depth. The breadth, the length, the height, and the depth are immeasurable. The apostle could not find suitable words to describe the infiniteness of Christ; therefore, he simply spoke of &ldquo;the breadth and length and height and depth,&rdquo; which are immeasurable. Paul knew Christ to such an extent that he could describe Him as the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe. Christ is boundless; His breadth, length, height, and depth are all limitless. Christ the glorious Lord is so boundless because He is the embodiment of God. The infinite God, the God who exists from eternity to eternity and whose years will never fail, is embodied in this glorious Christ. Hence, we can never fully know Christ or exhaust our experiences of Him. Such an infinite Christ has become everything to us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SON OF GOD BEING TRANSFIGURED<br />
TO BECOME THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Son of God was transfigured to become the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). It is not easy to find the phrase <em>the Son of God</em> in the Old Testament. Although this phrase is in the Old Testament, it is not given as much emphasis as in the New Testament. For example, the Gospels speak of the Word of God, who was incarnated as a man, as the Son (John 1:1, 14). Even the Lord referred to Himself as the Son, saying, &ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life&rdquo; (3:36). Concerning being sent by the Father, the Son said, &ldquo;The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing, for whatever that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner&rdquo; (5:19), and &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father&rdquo; (14:9). However, at the end of His ministry on earth, the Son said, &ldquo;If I go..., I am coming again and will receive you to Myself&rdquo; (v. 3). In this verse the word <em>coming</em> does not refer to the Lord&rsquo;s second coming at the end of this age; it refers to His coming after His resurrection from the dead. His going was to die on the cross so that He could come after His resurrection as the Spirit (vv. 16-18). He was transfigured to become the Spirit, and He came back as the Spirit. Hence, the Acts and the Epistles are altogether a story of the Spirit.</p>
<p>All that the Father is, is in the Son; and all that the Son is, is in the Spirit. The Son is the expression of the Father, and the Spirit is the realization of the Son. Where the Spirit is, there the Son is also, and all that the Son has obtained has been added to the Spirit. A person cannot receive the Lord Jesus without being moved by the Holy Spirit and allowing the Holy Spirit to work in him. We believe in the Lord Jesus, but it is the Spirit who moves within us. We have received the Lord Jesus, but we received Him when the Holy Spirit entered into us.</p>
<p>When a person repents and believes in the Lord, he does not pray to the Holy Spirit, but he feels the moving of the Holy Spirit. He is moved by the Holy Spirit, but he prays, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I receive You as my Savior.&rdquo; When a person is saved, he receives the Lord Jesus, not the Holy Spirit, as his Savior. It is amazing that when a person prays to the Lord Jesus and receives the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit enters into him. It is the Holy Spirit who touches us when we pray to the Lord Jesus. This is a mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THREE OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
BEING INSEPARABLE</h2>
<p>There are many mysterious things in the universe, but the most mysterious is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. It is not possible for our limited minds to comprehend the mystery of the Divine Trinity. How is it possible for the Son to be the Father and for the Son to become the Spirit (Isa. 9:6; 1 Cor. 15:45)? I have no way to explain these matters. But I know that when I am moved by the Spirit, I call, &ldquo;Lord Jesus!&rdquo; and when I call on the Lord, the Spirit moves in me. There is no way for us to separate the Lord Jesus from the Spirit in our experience. The Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17); hence, when we touch the Spirit, we touch the Lord Jesus, and when we draw near to the Lord Jesus, we are filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>We should not say that we do not know how to pray. At least we can call, &ldquo;O Lord, O Lord.&rdquo; There is no need to compose many sentences. We can close our eyes and say, &ldquo;Lord, Lord, O Lord.&rdquo; If we would call in this way for five minutes, we would be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:3 says, &ldquo;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This means that a person only needs to say, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; and he will be in the Holy Spirit. How marvelous it is that once a person prays to the Lord Jesus, something happens within him! Someone might pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I do not believe that You exist,&rdquo; but eventually, he will be saved, because his turning to the Lord allows the Spirit to move. Hence, it is risky to pray to the Lord Jesus. Once we call on Him as the Lord, we have the Holy Spirit. I cannot explain this. Just as there are many things in the universe that scientists cannot explain, there are many spiritual matters that we cannot explain. We should not try to understand them. We simply need to know that God has put all that He is in the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and that the Lord Jesus is realized as the Holy Spirit, who is everywhere just like breath and wind. The Spirit is available for us to touch and enjoy in any place and at any time. We need only to open our mouth and call on the name of the Lord Jesus. We should try to experience Him in this way.</p>
<p>Suppose a newly saved brother, who has not been taught how to pray and who is under some pressure, calls, &ldquo;Lord, Lord.&rdquo; After a while, he will be comforted and strengthened within. Not only so, when he continues to call on the Lord, he will be enlightened. Before he called, he was confused and did not know what to do, but after calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name, he will be clear and have a way to go on because he has experienced the Lord Jesus as the Spirit being everything to him.</p>
<p>If we call on the Lord when we are depressed, in difficulty, or have a heavy burden, we will be strengthened inwardly. We will feel that someone is bearing the burden for us. The Lord not only bears our burdens; He even carries us. When we come to a dead end and are unclear concerning our future, we should call on His name to be enlightened. This is not a psychological exercise. If anyone has doubts about calling on the Lord, he should call on the name of any idol. The more he calls on an idol, the more miserable, darkened, and confused he will be. However, if he calls on the Lord a few times, he will experience the Lord being his everything.</p>
<p>Such experiences prove that God is embodied in the Lord Jesus and that the Lord Jesus is realized as the Spirit. When we call on the Lord, the Spirit touches our spirit, and we touch reality. Something that we cannot explain happens within us, and we are comforted, strengthened, and enlightened. In the past we did not understand this experience; we only knew that by calling on the Lord Jesus, we were saved from discouragement and confusion. We did not realize that we were exercising our spirit to touch the reality of comfort, strength, light, and the way.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT ENTERING INTO MAN</h2>
<p>All that God is, is in His Son; and all that His Son is, is in the Spirit. Just as air is everywhere, so the Spirit is present in every place and at all times. He can reach any person in any place and at any time. When the Spirit enters a person, he will experience the Spirit&rsquo;s glorification of the Lord Jesus and the Spirit&rsquo;s conviction.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Glorifying the Lord Jesus</h2>
<p>The Spirit causes a believer to love the Lord Jesus, find his delight in Him, and desire to love, exalt, and please Him. This is the Spirit&rsquo;s glorification of the Lord Jesus within the believer (John 16:14). We should not rely on our feelings to determine whether or not the Spirit is in us. After hearing that the Spirit is in them, some believers try to feel the Spirit. We do not need to ask whether the Spirit is in us. We only need to ask how we treat the Lord Jesus. Loving Him and turning to Him prove that the Spirit is in us.</p>
<p>It is amazing that we do not feel the Spirit when He works in us; we only sense that the Lord Jesus is lovable, glorious, and sweet. The sense that the Lord Jesus is lovely and worthy to receive our love and adoration is a result of the operation of the Spirit in us.</p>
<p>There is no way to separate the Lord Jesus from the Spirit in our experience. We do not need to look for the Spirit. We only need to ask how we treat the Lord Jesus, that is, whether He has ground in us and whether we desire to love Him, exalt Him, and please Him. If our answer is yes, we should have the full assurance that the Spirit is within us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Convicting People</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the Spirit causes a believer to see his corruptness. This is the Spirit&rsquo;s convicting (v. 8). We need to admit that we still have many improper things within us, such as sin, the world, temper, lusts, and the flesh. On the positive side, when the Spirit operates in us, He causes us to sense that the Lord is lovable, glorious, and sweet, but on the negative side, He causes us to see that we are corrupt. We will sense that we have disappointed our parents, that we are not humble toward our colleagues, and that we are not loyal to our boss. We will see that we are worldly, bad tempered, and fleshly. Then we will confess these sins. This experience demonstrates the Spirit&rsquo;s work in us. When the Spirit operates in us, we sense that the Lord Jesus is lovable and that we are corrupt. When we sense that we are corrupt, the Spirit is working to cleanse and purify us by dealing with all the improper things in us.</p>
<p>When the Spirit works in us, He causes us to sense the loveliness, glory, and sweetness of the Lord Jesus, and the Spirit causes us to hate our corruptness, sins, lusts, and the flesh. On one hand, we will love, glorify, and honor the Lord Jesus; on the other hand, we will confess our corruptness and sins. Such experiences prove that the Spirit has a special place in us. The more we revere the Lord Jesus and condemn ourselves, the more we will be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>The building of the church is the building of God with man, and it is altogether a matter in the Spirit. God is in His Son, His Son is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit reaches us, enters into us, and dwells in our spirit. When He enters into us, He shows us the Lord&rsquo;s loveliness, and He causes us to judge and condemn ourselves in order to be cleansed from the improper things in our being. This is the work of the Triune God in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR RESPONSIBILITY&mdash;<br />
PRAYING WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Our responsibility is to pray with our spirit. When we sense that the Lord Jesus is lovely, we should pray. Some saints do not practice this. They often feel that the Lord Jesus is lovely and gracious, but they do not pray. When asked why they do not pray, they usually give two reasons: first, they feel that they are dull of speech and unable to pray; and second, they think that the Lord Jesus knows their hearts, so there is no need for them to pray.</p>
<p>Many years ago I gave a message in Shanghai concerning how to draw near to God and touch His presence. Afterward, a brother whom I knew came to me and said, &ldquo;Brother, the way you teach Christians to pray is too complicated. You say that we need to be calm, turn to our spirit, and pray. This is too troublesome. According to your way, it is difficult to be a Christian. I am a Christian, and I love the Lord very much, but I pray in my heart. The Lord knows me, so why should I have to tell Him how I feel?&rdquo; What he said seemed reasonable. When I considered this matter before the Lord, He showed me that even though we do not need to pray because He knows our heart, we will not be filled with Him if we do not pray. If we do not pray, we will be limited in our enjoyment, even to the point of being unable to sing Hallelujah. The more we pray, the more we will be filled with the Lord, be joyful, and be able to sing Hallelujah. The Lord does know our intentions, but if we do not pray, the Spirit will have little ground in us.</p>
<p>After seeing our need to pray, I asked the brother whether he was joyful and whether he sang. He replied that he was a businessman who dealt with money every day, so he could not be joyful. He also said that since the day he was saved, he had never said Hallelujah. I told him that prayer was the only way to be joyful and to sing; otherwise, he would be just like the unbelievers. He needed to turn his thoughts into prayer. When he sensed that the Lord Jesus is lovely, he should say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are lovely.&rdquo; When he felt that the Lord had preserved him, he should say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, thank You for keeping me in peace.&rdquo; If he would turn his feelings into prayer, he would be joyful.</p>
<p>Many Christians do not pray. Such Christians often quench the Spirit, and this offends the Lord. First Thessalonians 5:16-18 says, &ldquo;Always rejoice, unceasingly pray, in everything give thanks,&rdquo; and verse 19 says, &ldquo;Do not quench the Spirit.&rdquo; This shows that when we do not pray, we quench the Spirit; when we do not give thanks to the Lord, we quench the Spirit; and when we do not rejoice, we quench the Spirit.</p>
<p>Another brother said that he did not pray because he did not have the leading to pray. This word is not accurate. He does not pray because he quenches the moving of the Spirit, not because he does not have the leading of the Spirit. Seeing the Lord&rsquo;s loveliness and touching His grace are issues of the moving of the Holy Spirit. We should immediately turn these experiences into prayer. We can say, &ldquo;Lord, You are lovable,&rdquo; while we are hurrying on our way to work. Of course, it is better if we have time to be calm and worship the Lord. However, if we do not have such time, it is still good to pray in the midst of our business.</p>
<p>If we would pray more often, we would enjoy praying, and we would become skillful in praying. Initially, a brother might be able to pray only a few sentences, but gradually the length of his prayers will increase, he will become sensitive to his spirit, his thoughts will match the sense in his spirit, and he will have the utterance to express the sense in his spirit.</p>
<p>The moving of the Spirit within us causes us not only to see the Lord&rsquo;s loveliness but also to see our mistakes. A normal Christian is conscious of his mistakes. A Christian who is not conscious of his mistakes has a problem with the Lord. A normal Christian senses his mistakes and shortcomings. Whenever we see our mistakes and shortcomings, we need to confess. We should not say that we lack time. As soon as we sense a mistake, we need to confess it in prayer.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to pray; we only need to practice. Every believer always feels that the Lord is lovely, glorious, and sweet. A believer also senses his mistakes. He needs to turn these feelings into prayers of praise or confession. The more he prays, the better. If we would receive this fellowship and practice it, we will be blessed persons. We will experience our glorious Lord and taste His riches in our spirit. The more we pray, the more our spirit will be living, fresh, and strong. Moreover, the more we confess our sins, the more the Spirit will enlighten and search our inward parts; and the more thorough our confessions will be, and the more we will be filled with the Spirit. Through such a continuous cycle, we will become people who live in spirit and are full of the Spirit. The more we experience this cycle, the less we will despise and rebuke others; we will have fewer opinions, and we will be less contentious. We will be delivered not only from the world and sins but also from our narrowness and the self. Such deliverance does not come from listening to messages or from exhortations; it is the issue of prayer. Furthermore, we will be built together with the saints.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRAYING TO THE LORD<br />
AND BEING FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 16:13-15; 7:37-39; Eph. 5:18-20</h1>
<p>Let us look at some verses in the Scriptures related to the Divine Trinity. John 16:13-15 says, &ldquo;When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you.&rdquo; According to these verses, all that the Father has is the Lord&rsquo;s, and all that the Lord has is received by the Spirit and declared to us.</p>
<p>Verses 37 through 39 of chapter 7 say, &ldquo;Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; These verses say that those who believe into the Lord Jesus will receive the Spirit. This was our experience. When we believed into the Lord Jesus, we received the Spirit.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:18-20 says, &ldquo;Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord, giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father.&rdquo; When we are filled in spirit, we will praise the Lord with singing and psalming in our hearts. Such praises will be rendered by the saints not only individually but also corporately; all the saints will speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. This portion also says that we need to give thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father. These verses reveal the three persons in the Divine Trinity. <em>Spiritual songs</em> in verse 19 implies the Spirit, and verse 20 speaks of the Lord Jesus and of God the Father. If we are filled in spirit, we will praise the Lord with spiritual songs and give thanks to God the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL INTENTION BEING<br />
LIFE AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>Many portions of the Bible are like pictures; they depict the profound and mysterious things of God. The picture at the beginning of the Bible is of man being placed in front of the tree of life. The last picture is of a glorious city built with gold, pearl, and precious stones. At the beginning we see a tree, but at the end we see a city. The tree depicts life, and the city depicts building. If we understand the meaning of these pictures, we will realize that God&rsquo;s intention is altogether related to life and building. He intends to be life to His people so that they can be built up together in His life to become a glorious eternal dwelling place.</p>
<p>If we read the Bible in the light of the picture at the beginning of the Bible and the picture at the end of the Bible, we will see that the entire Bible speaks of God being life and everything to His people so that they can be transformed into precious materials and built together in His life to become a corporate entity, which is His glorious dwelling place. The Bible is focused on life and building. Building depends on the divine life, which is a matter of God entering into man to be mingled with man and to be man&rsquo;s supply in every matter.</p>
<p>From the beginning to the end, the Bible shows God&rsquo;s desire to enter into His people to be enjoyed by them as their everything. He is their life, strength, wisdom, way, bread of life, and living water. All these items reveal that God wants to enter into us to be our supply so that we may enjoy Him. The issue of such an enjoyment is not only that we will live because of Him but also that He will be mingled with us and become our constitution, delivering us from everything outside of Him, including our natural self. This is the way that we are built up as a corporate entity to be His eternal dwelling place. This is the central thought of the Bible, and this is God&rsquo;s eternal intention.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING IN CHRIST FOR MAN&rsquo;S ENJOYMENT</h2>
<p>How is it possible for us to experience God? God has given Himself to us so that we would experience Him. This is not doctrinal; it is practical. God wants us to touch Him, gain Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him. He wants us to experience Him in every item of our daily life. This is real. However, how is it possible that we can experience our glorious Lord?</p>
<p>The first step God took in His plan was to put everything of Himself in His Son, our glorious Lord Jesus Christ. God is pleased for the Lord Jesus to have the first place in all things (Col. 1:18). God is pleased to give all honor, authority, position, and glory wholly to the Lord Jesus. When believers glorify the Lord Jesus, they glorify God, and when they worship the Lord Jesus, they worship God. Conversely, when people reject the Lord Jesus, they reject God, and when they insult the Lord Jesus, they insult God. The way that a person deals with the Lord Jesus is an indication of his attitude toward God. The Lord Jesus is not only God&rsquo;s grace to man; He is also God&rsquo;s test to man. A person who is willing to receive the Lord Jesus will obtain God&rsquo;s grace, but if he rejects the Lord Jesus, he receives God&rsquo;s test. God is in the Lord Jesus for man to receive and enjoy Him. The way that a person treats the Lord Jesus determines the kind of relationship he has with God.</p>
<p>Hence, we must know the Lord, believe in Him, love Him, pray to Him, give Him praise, revere Him, and regard Him as the Lord of lords and the King of kings. Whenever we exalt Him, bless Him, and worship Him, we touch God&rsquo;s heart. God rejoices when His Son receives our worship, respect, exaltation, and blessing because God&rsquo;s heart is set on His Son. God has given all that He has to His Son, and He wants His Son to have the first place in all things.</p>
<p>We must see this vision: God desires to glorify His Son, and He has put all His fullness and all that He has into His Son. We cannot receive anything of God apart from His Son. In order to obtain God&rsquo;s love, grace, and riches, we must receive the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>All saints experience joy and feel pleasant when they consider the Lord Jesus. The adherents of other religions do not have this kind of sweetness or joy when they consider the founders of their religions. Only Christians have a sense of sweetness, gratitude, and adoration when they remember the Lord Jesus or mention His name. Christians have such feelings because the Spirit is within them glorifying the Lord Jesus. When we remember the Lord Jesus, we worship, thank, and adore Him. This is not doctrine; it is the work of the Spirit within us. This work of the Spirit leads us to the second step in our experience of God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING REALIZED AS THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The second step of God&rsquo;s plan for us to experience Him involves all that the Son has being realized in the Spirit. After I was saved and heard about being filled with the Holy Spirit and about the different works of the Holy Spirit within man, I longed to be filled with the Holy Spirit. In spite of my yearning, praying, and waiting, I did not feel the presence of the Holy Spirit. I asked myself what are the characteristics of the Holy Spirit, what kind of work does He do, and what would my condition be if He were in me?</p>
<p>Gradually, I found a key and touched a spiritual mystery. I realized that when the Holy Spirit was in me, I appreciated and loved the Lord Jesus. To be filled with the Holy Spirit is to be filled with feelings for the Lord Jesus. When I consider the Lord Jesus, I know that the Holy Spirit is in me.</p>
<p>John 7:39 says, &ldquo;This He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus said that those who believed into Him would receive the Spirit. We have believed into the Lord; hence, we have received the Spirit. The Bible does not tell us to believe in the Spirit, to worship the Spirit, or to pray to the Spirit. The Bible says that we should believe in the Lord Jesus, receive Him, worship Him, and pray to Him. Although we are not told to believe in the Spirit or pray to the Spirit, when we believe in the Lord, the Spirit enters into us, and when we bless or praise the Lord, the Spirit fills us. This is an amazing fact.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING THE SUBJECT<br />
AND CENTER OF PRAYER</h2>
<p>Some saints said that they know the importance of prayer and the importance of serving with the human spirit. However, they do not know the subject of prayer. They know that they need to enter the Holy of Holies, touch the throne of grace, function as priests, serve with their spirit, release their spirit, exercise their spirit, be blended with other saints in spirit, and fellowship in spirit. These items are common knowledge among the saints. However, they do not know what words to use when they pray, and they do not have a subject.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the unique subject of our prayer. Ephesians 5:18-19 says that when the believers are filled with the Spirit in their spirit, they can use psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to sing and psalm with their hearts to the Lord. When believers are filled with the Spirit, Christ becomes the subject and the focus of their praise and prayer. First Corinthians 12:3 says, &ldquo;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In other words, calling &ldquo;Lord Jesus&rdquo; is an indication that the Holy Spirit is working in a believer. Real prayer is centered on the Lord. When we exercise to pray, we do not need to ask for things; rather, we should praise the Lord, appreciate Him, behold Him, worship Him, and laud His virtues. This kind of prayer is real prayer.</p>
<p>A sister once said she had prayed and asked the Lord to improve her temper because her bad temper displeased her husband and made her children unhappy. She made up her mind to overcome her temper by the Lord&rsquo;s strength, but the more she prayed, the worse her temper became. She did not know what to do. When I asked her whether the Lord Jesus is lovely, she said, &ldquo;Of course, the Lord Jesus is lovely, but I have a bad temper, so I am not lovely.&rdquo; When I asked her whether she praised the Lord for His loveliness, she asked how someone with a temper as bad as hers could praise the Lord. This sister was focused on her temper, and the subject of her prayer was how to improve her temper. Regardless of how much I said concerning the Lord Jesus being so wonderful, she continued to ask how she could improve her temper. This sister could not forget her temper. I waited for a long time until she finished saying everything she had to say, and then I said, &ldquo;Sister, please do this one thing: From now on, do not pray concerning your temper. Instead, consider our lovely and glorious Lord, and praise Him. You can say, &lsquo;Lord, You are lovely; You are so glorious.&rsquo;&rdquo; I said that whenever she loses her temper, she should behold, praise, worship, and bless the Lord. The subject of her prayer should not be losing her temper; the Lord Jesus should be the subject of her prayer.</p>
<p>She came back a few days later and said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, your way works. When I worshipped, thanked, and praised the Lord, I forgot about my temper and was filled with the Lord Jesus. I began to rejoice. I stopped losing my temper when I encountered a troublesome situation; I felt at ease and was able to praise the Lord in a sweet way. I was full of joy.&rdquo; This sister touched a great spiritual secret. We should not allow anything to occupy our Christian life, that is, to become the subject of our living and prayer. The Christian life is a life with the Lord Jesus as its focus; the Lord Jesus should be the subject of a Christian&rsquo;s prayer.</p>
<p>A sister once said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, my only shortcoming is a lack of patience. I have asked the Lord to give me patience. Why has He not given it to me?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;The Lord Jesus does not give people patience. He only gives us Himself.&rdquo; Hence, we should not ask the Lord to give us patience. We should forget our impatience and instead consider the Lord, behold Him, praise Him, worship Him, and bless Him. We should tell Him how sweet it is to receive Him once more. If we pray in this way, we will be filled with Him, and we will be patient without trying, because the Lord will be our patience.</p>
<p>A brother once came to me for help. He had been trying to overcome a certain weakness but continually failed. He heard a servant of the Lord say that all our problems originate from our old man; we sin, lose our temper, and display other weaknesses because of our old man. However, our old man has been crucified with the Lord; He has delivered us from these problems. The brother was told that we only need to reckon ourselves as dead. This word made him happy, and he decided to practice reckoning himself as being dead. However, no matter how much he tried, his weakness remained and became even worse. He discovered that the more he reckoned himself as being dead, the more his old man was aroused and became even more active. Hence, he did not know what to do. I told him that a message on our co-crucifixion with Christ cannot deliver us, nor can our reckoning deliver us. Only the living Lord can save us. When He gains ground in us, He will spontaneously lead us to experience our co-crucifixion with Him in a practical way. We do not need to speak about co-crucifixion, nor do we need to reckon that we have died with Christ. We just need to let the living Lord be our subject and our center. It is sufficient for us to fellowship with Him daily and look to Him moment by moment by drawing near to Him and worshipping Him.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING<br />
THE REALITY OF THE LORD JESUS</h2>
<p>All that God is, is now in the Lord Jesus, and the Lord Jesus is made real as the Spirit; He is realized as the Spirit. The Spirit glorifies the Lord Jesus in us and through us. When we bless and worship the Lord, the Spirit is able to occupy and fill us. The secret and the key to the work of the Spirit in us are that the more we bless and praise the Lord Jesus, the more ground the Spirit has in us and the more He can fill us. We might forget about the Spirit, but as long as we behold the Lord, worship Him, and speak of His beauty, we will be filled with the Spirit. We believe in the Lord Jesus, but we receive the Spirit. We bless the Lord Jesus, but we are filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>Let me repeat, all that the Lord Jesus is, is made real in the Spirit. Only the Spirit can make the Lord Jesus real to us. When we say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are life,&rdquo; the Spirit will make the Lord real to us as our life. Sometimes we do not know what we need. We might say, &ldquo;Lord, I need You. My situation is too difficult. I do not know whether I need You as life, as light, as the way, or as wisdom. I do not know what I need, but I know that I need You.&rdquo; If we would pray in this way, the Spirit will make a particular aspect of the Lord real to us, according to our need. If we need consolation, the Spirit will make the Lord Jesus real in us as our consolation. If we need light, the Spirit will make the Lord Jesus real in us as our light.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus is all that we need, but our experience of this depends on the Spirit of reality. Only when the Spirit is real to us can we enjoy the Lord Jesus as spiritual food, living water, light, the way, truth, and life. No matter what our need may be, when we call on the Lord Jesus and fellowship with Him, the Spirit will make the Lord real to us in order to meet that need.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TURNING FROM OTHER THINGS TO THE LORD JESUS</h2>
<p>When we touch the key, prayer becomes an easy matter. We must not make numerous items the subject of our prayer. We should confess, but this is not the subject of our prayer. A normal Christian should confess his sins at least once a day, but he should not be excessive in confessing his sins. Being excessive can be compared to a disease. I met a brother who had made sins the subject of his prayers. Whenever he prayed, he would say, &ldquo;Lord, I am the most sinful person, and everything related to me, whether at home or in the church, is sinful.&rdquo; He was always confessing his sins. He never thanked the Lord. He never said, &ldquo;Lord, I am sinful, but I thank You because You are Jesus my Savior, and You have saved me from my sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subject of our prayer must turn from confessing our sins to praising. The Lord Jesus Christ, not sins or weaknesses, should be the subject of our prayers. Our sins are a black background that cause the Lord of glory to shine forth.</p>
<p>There was a humble and meek brother who always mentioned being weak when he prayed. Initially, his prayers sounded good, but after hearing him pray in this way in a series of meetings, I had a negative feeling within. Paul said that he would most gladly boast in his weaknesses so that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him, for when he was weak, then he was powerful (2 Cor. 12:9-10). This shows that weaknesses should not be the subject of our prayer; only Christ should be the subject. The fact that we are weak should not be our prayer. The strength of Christ can be expressed in our weaknesses. We should be strong when we are weak. We are glad to boast in our weaknesses, but we should not live in our weaknesses. I should be able to say that it is good that we have weaknesses, for through them the Lord&rsquo;s strength can be perfected in us.</p>
<p>We should not continually talk about our weaknesses. The Spirit is not pleased to hear us speak about our weaknesses. The Spirit is pleased to hear us speak concerning Christ. Saying that we are sinful and weak makes the Spirit sorrowful. This is not the purpose of the Spirit. The Spirit convicts us in order to bring us into the reality of Christ. Our need is to behold the Lord Jesus and bless Him. The more we behold and honor Him, the more the Spirit will fill us, and the more ground He will gain in us.</p>
<p>I cannot forget a word that was spoken in January 1934 during an overcoming meeting in Shanghai. A servant of the Lord quoted Griffith Thomas, who said, &ldquo;There is now a common saying that if you look at yourself once, you must then look at Christ ten times. But I think this must be changed to look at Christ eleven times and do not look at yourself even once.&rdquo; This word really helped me to turn my gaze from the things outside of Christ to Christ Himself. That day I saw that only Christ should be my subject.</p>
<p>We should not focus on our weaknesses or our failures. Instead, we should focus on our glorious Lord. We should practice gazing on Him, blessing Him, worshipping Him, and asking Him to be with us. The more we practice this, the more we will be filled with the Spirit, and Christ will be realized in us. We will be delivered not only from sins and the world but also from our natural and individualistic self. We will be saved, and we will enter into God.</p>
<p>We should pray over the verses that we read at the beginning of this chapter. We must forget our problems, weaknesses, and sins and pray over the words in the Bible so that the Lord can gain ground in us. The Bible says that the Lord Jesus is meek, considerate, and full of faith; we should turn these words into prayer. If we would exercise to pray in this way every day, the Spirit will increase in us and fill us. Furthermore, our spirit will become living.</p>
<p>The way to be holy, victorious, and spiritual depends on our prayer. No one can be holy, victorious, or spiritual without prayer, nor can anyone enter into God without prayer. Messages cannot make us holy, victorious, or spiritual. Only prayers that have the Lord Jesus as their subject can make us holy, victorious, and spiritual. There is no need to mention our sins, the world, our bad temper, or our problems. Our only need is to contemplate Him, love Him, praise Him, and speak of Him. If we would do this every day, our sins, the world, and all the demons would depart from us. We do not need to take anything other than the Lord Jesus as our subject. Then we will be holy, victorious, and spiritual, and we will even enter into God as our portion. Furthermore, our spirit will be living because we will be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>I hope that we will all learn to be such praying people. Instead of merely listening to messages or attending meetings, we need to be those who take the Lord as the center of our prayer.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">TWO PROVISIONS FROM GOD&mdash;<br />
THE HOLY WORD AND THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1; 4:24; 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6, 17; Col. 3:16-17; Eph. 5:18-19</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S GLORIOUS PLAN</h2>
<p>The Scriptures reveal that God has a glorious plan, which is for man to receive Him as his life and element so that man may be mingled with God as one. Then God and man will become a mutual dwelling place, in which God dwells in man and man dwells in God. This is the eternal desire of God&rsquo;s heart and His eternal plan. In order to accomplish this plan, God has put all that He is in His Son. He now wants man to receive His Son so that man will receive all the fullness of God.</p>
<p>The entire Bible, from the beginning to the end, repeatedly reveals the riches and sweetness of the Son of God, our glorious Lord Jesus Christ. He is God coming to be everything to us. By enjoying all that God is in the Son, we will be constituted with all that God is and blended with God. Consequently, God is mingled with us to become a mutual dwelling place.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO PROVISIONS FROM GOD&mdash;<br />
THE HOLY WORD AND THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In order to touch and experience the Lord, we should know His provisions. Throughout the ages, the saints who love the Lord have treasured two things: the holy Word and the indwelling Holy Spirit. The wealth of a Christian consists of the holy Word and the Holy Spirit. God in His wisdom has provided us with these two items. Anything we treasure apart from the holy Word and the Holy Spirit will one day become a thorn to us. The sweetest blessings that God has given to us are the Bible in our hand and the Spirit within us. These two blessings are available for our enjoyment at any time and in any place.</p>
<p>There is no way for us to know the Lord, touch Him, or draw near to Him apart from the Word and the indwelling Spirit. God is bountifully rich; He is so many items, such as life, power, light, wisdom, and the way. Among the numerous items of what God is, His being the Word and the Spirit (John 1:1; 4:24) are general in that they include all the other items. In the Word God is life, light, wisdom, power, and the way. Likewise, God is life, light, wisdom, power, and the way in the Spirit. All that God is, is included in the Spirit. Therefore, the Word and the Spirit are the totality of all that God is.</p>
<p>All that God is can be summed up in His being the Word and the Spirit. Our knowing, obtaining, and experiencing the Lord depend on His being the holy Word and the Holy Spirit. Our experience of Him as our life, light, power, bread of life, and living water depends, first, on His being the Word and, second, on His being the Spirit.</p>
<p>The holy Word and the Holy Spirit are two great provisions. The Gospel of John says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (1:1). In this verse the Word is with God, and the Word is God. Hence, God is the Word. John also says, &ldquo;God is Spirit&rdquo; (4:24). Chapter 1 says that God is the Word, and chapter 4 says that God is Spirit. In chapter 6 the Word and the Spirit are joined as one: &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (v. 63). The Lord&rsquo;s words are life because they are spirit. In His wisdom, God has provided Himself to us as the Word and the Spirit.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16-17 says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God. And whatever you do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.&rdquo; According to these verses, a person sings to God with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs when he is filled with the word of the Lord. When a believer is filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word, he will praise the Lord.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:18-19 says, &ldquo;Be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&rdquo; These verses say that a person praises the Lord when his spirit is filled with the Holy Spirit. Colossians and Ephesians are sister books and have many similar portions. Both Epistles refer to praising the Lord with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. However, Colossians says that a believer praises when he is filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word, and Ephesians says that a believer praises when his spirit is filled with the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit. This indicates that the Lord&rsquo;s word and His Spirit are inseparable.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HOLY WORD ENABLING US TO KNOW CHRIST</h2>
<p>In order for something to occupy us, it must pass through our mind. If we want to gain a person, we must first gain his mind. Hence, newspapers and magazines are filled with words of advertisement to engage a person&rsquo;s mind. We may not pay much attention to words, but they are important. A person who speaks effectively will prosper, and a person who speaks convincingly will prevail.</p>
<p>If God had never spoken, we would be confused concerning everything in the universe. However, our God speaks, and He is the Word. He has even put His words into writing in the Bible. There are sixty-six books in the Bible, and every chapter of every book is God&rsquo;s word. God speaks so that we would know and understand that He is a speaking God and that the Lord Jesus is the Word. Since we have God&rsquo;s Word, we know that He is the Word, that He is triune, that He is life, and that the Spirit dwells in us. We would not have a way to know all these matters without God&rsquo;s speaking. We can know and understand the things of God because He has spoken.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son.&rdquo; God spoke to the fathers through the prophets, but now He speaks to us in His Son. God is a speaking God, He is the Word, and He gave us the Bible, His Word. When we read the Bible, we are enlightened to understand many things that scientists and philosophers are not able to understand. The Bible tells us who God is, and it tells us the source and destination of the universe. It also tells us where we came from, where we are, and where we are going. The more we read the Bible, the more enlightened we will be. God&rsquo;s word is precious.</p>
<p>We must remember that Christ is the Word of God; He is what God speaks, and He is what God reveals. If we want to know the Bible, we must know Christ. Christ is the key that opens up the Bible. Furthermore, if we did not have the Bible, we would not know the Lord Jesus: we would not know that He is the Son of God, that He bore our sins on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24), that our old man was crucified with Him (Rom. 6:6), that He destroyed Satan on the cross (Heb. 2:14), that He accomplished the work of redemption on the cross, that He resurrected from the dead and is sitting at the right hand of God (Eph. 1:20), or that God has given Him the name which is above every name (Phil. 2:9) and has given all authority in heaven and on earth to Him (Matt. 28:18). The more we read the Bible, the more we will see and know our glorious, great, and immeasurably rich Lord. We are thankful that God has given us the Bible, which fully reveals His Son, our glorious Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT ENABLING US TO GAIN CHRIST</h2>
<p>Not only do we have a mind, which is a part of our soul; we also have a spirit, which is deeper than our soul. If the Lord were only the Word and not the Spirit, He would be able to reach only our mind for us to understand Him, but He would be unable to enter our spirit for us to gain Him. The Lord, however, is not only the Word but also the Spirit. The Word is the explanation of the Lord, but the Spirit is His essence. The Word explains the Lord to us so that we may apprehend, understand, and know Him. However, He is not only the Word; He is also the Spirit so that we can contact Him with our spirit.</p>
<p>We must see that God has not only prepared the Word for us but also given the Spirit to us. These two items are related. When the Word enters into us, it is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is released from within us through the Word.</p>
<p>A brother might read Genesis 1:1 in the morning. This verse says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; This is a very simple word. However, while reading it, he might pray, &ldquo;Lord, You are the beginning of everything.&rdquo; Then he will be full of praise and spontaneously say, &ldquo;Lord, I praise You because You are the beginning of all things. I want You to also be the beginning of everything that I do today. I do not want to begin anything.&rdquo; By praising and praying in such a way, the Word enters into him. Hence, the Word that he contacted and received becomes the moving of the Spirit within him. This example shows that the Bible is outside of us, but once we contact and receive it, it becomes the Spirit within us. God is the Word, and He is the Spirit; hence, the Word is the Spirit. As soon as the Word enters into us, it becomes the Spirit.</p>
<p>Every person who is filled with God&rsquo;s speaking is also filled with the Spirit. A person who has no understanding of the Bible and no knowledge of the Lord Jesus has no way to be filled with the Spirit. There is a brother who was filled with the Spirit the first time that he prayed. He knelt down and confessed, &ldquo;Lord, I am a sinner. You are the Son of God, and You are my Savior. You died on the cross for me.&rdquo; At that time he wept and was filled with the Spirit. His prayer was according to the Bible. We can receive the Spirit only through the Word. The Word that we receive enters into our spirit and becomes the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE TWO PROVISIONS<br />
BY READING THE WORD AND PRAYING</h2>
<p>Since God has given us the holy Word and the Holy Spirit, we should enjoy them. Some Christians are short of experience because they only read the Bible without praying; they contact the Bible with their mind without contacting the Spirit with their spirit. They appreciate the Bible but not the Spirit. When they read the Bible, they are reading dead letters; hence, they are not able to receive a supply of life. Other Christians pray but do not read the Bible. These Christians may be burning in spirit, but since they are not clear concerning the truth, they pray in ignorance. Furthermore, their fervency cannot last, because it is not based on enlightenment from the Word. Both types of Christians are not normal.</p>
<p>Since we have the Spirit within us and the Bible in our hand, we should enjoy both. When we read the Bible, we should pray. We should be like the brother who read Genesis 1:1. After reading this verse, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, You created the heavens and the earth in the beginning.&rdquo; When we pray in this way, we will be inspired with praise and say, &ldquo;Lord, You are the beginning of all things.&rdquo; Then the Spirit will have the way to ask us whether it is God or we who initiate the things that we do. Being enlightened in such a way is an indication that the words in the Bible have entered into us and have become spirit and life.</p>
<p>Some believers say that it is easy to read the New Testament, but a brother once told me that it is a closed book to him. He did not understand the first sentence of Matthew 1: &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.&rdquo; When he read verse 2, &ldquo;Abraham begot Isaac, and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers,&rdquo; he was confused by all the begettings. This brother&rsquo;s problem is also the problem of many other saints. In order to deal with this problem, in 1936 we published the pamphlet <em>Gleanings from the Genealogy of Christ.</em> This pamphlet deals specifically with the genealogy in Matthew 1. However, it is possible to receive the supply from this portion of the Word without understanding its interpretation. When we read Matthew 1:1, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are the son of David and the son of Abraham. I do not know who David was, nor do I know who Abraham was, but I know that they were men. Lord, I praise You that You are the Son of Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we are willing to pray according to what we read in the Bible, we will sense that the Lord Jesus is lovely. Then we might praise Him by saying, &ldquo;Lord, You created the heavens and the earth. You are the Lord of all, yet You became the son of David and the son of Abraham. You became the Son of Man.&rdquo; This is the way to be filled with Christ.</p>
<p>When we are filled with Christ, we will not lose our temper. Suppose a brother spends time with the Lord in the morning, but instead of mentioning his temper, sins, and the world, he reads Matthew 1:1 and spends ten minutes to pray over it by beholding, worshipping, and praising the Lord. He will be filled with the Lord, and his temper will not overcome him, nor will any problem suppress him, because he has touched the Lord&rsquo;s word, and the Spirit has turned this word into life within him. We can be filled with the element of Christ even by praying over a seemingly dry verse.</p>
<p>Some saints think that the four Gospels are not very meaningful, and they do not like to read them. Matthew 8:1-3 says, &ldquo;When He came down from the mountain...a leper, coming near, worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me. And stretching out His hand, He touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed!&rdquo; Some saints say that these words are ordinary and should not be considered as the Scriptures. But if a saint is willing to use his spirit and pray over even this portion of the Bible, he will be supplied. He might say, &ldquo;Lord, if You had not come down from the mountain, that leper would not have been cleansed. But You came down from the mountain to the place where we, the lepers, are. When You cleansed us, You were so considerate that You stretched out Your hand to touch us.&rdquo; By praying in such a way, he will touch the sweetness of this portion of the Word. This portion does not speak of sin and the world, nor does it exhort us to be patient, meek, and loving. But if we would use our spirit to pray over this portion of the Word, these words will become spirit and life within us, and the element of Christ will increase in us. As a result, we will stay away from sin and the world, and we will be patient, meek, and loving.</p>
<p>It does not matter whether we have a bad temper or other weaknesses that we cannot overcome. We do not need to bear these matters in prayer to the Lord. We should put aside our sins and our weaknesses and instead read a portion of the Word and turn it into prayer and praise. Then we will be filled with the Lord&rsquo;s sweetness, joy, and glory. This is the way to be victorious over sin and filled with Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord is the Word, and He is the Spirit. Moreover, the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit and life. We can read the Bible, and we can be filled with the Spirit through prayer. If the Lord&rsquo;s words remain in our mind, without touching our spirit, they will be merely words, not spirit and life. Therefore, we should not only use our mind when we read the Bible; we must also exercise our spirit and pray. Then the words will pass through our mind into our spirit. Once the words of God&rsquo;s holy Word enter our spirit, they will become spirit and life to us.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly stressed the need to pray after we hear a message. It is not enough to nod our heads in agreement; we must also stir our spirit and let our spirit be enlivened. If we only nod our heads, we may not grow in life, because the words that we hear will remain in our mind, not in our spirit. We should pray when we read the Word, and we should pray after we listen to a message. May we learn to use not only our mind to receive the Word but also our spirit to receive the Holy Spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT<br />
IN READING THE WORD AND PRAYING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:14; 2:41-42; 6:4; Rom. 12:12; 1 Thes. 5:16-17</h1>
<p>According to Acts 2:41-42, the first group of believers continued steadfastly in four things: the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, breaking of bread, and prayers. Other verses in Acts that speak of continuing steadfastly in prayer include 1:14 and 6:4. Furthermore, Romans 12:12 says, &ldquo;Persevere in prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First Thessalonians 5:16-20 says, &ldquo;Always rejoice, unceasingly pray, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. Do not quench the Spirit; do not despise prophecies.&rdquo; This portion unveils the meaning of quenching the Spirit. When we pray unceasingly and give thanks in everything, we do not quench the Spirit. When we do not pray or give thanks, we quench the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE LORD THROUGH THE WORD<br />
AND TOUCHING THE LORD THROUGH THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>God is in the Son, the Lord Jesus, so that His children may enjoy Him. We can know, touch, and enjoy the Lord Jesus through the Word and the Spirit. The Word is for us to understand and know Him, and the Spirit is for us to contact and touch Him. God has given us the holy Word and the Holy Spirit. We have the Bible, the Word of God, in our hand, and the Holy Spirit within us. We can read the Bible anytime and anywhere. This is the way for us to understand and know more about the Lord Jesus. This is the function of the Word. The Word conveys, manifests, and reveals the Lord Jesus to us.</p>
<p>If we did not have the Bible and if we did not have the ministry of the word, there would be no way for us to know our glorious and rich Lord. However, we have not only the Bible, the Word of God, but also the ministry of the word. We can read the Bible at any time and in any place, and we can also listen to the Lord&rsquo;s word. Hence, we are able to know and understand more concerning the Lord.</p>
<p>It is one thing to know and understand something, but it is another matter to experience something. Suppose you are invited to a feast with many delicious dishes, and someone explains how each dish was prepared, what ingredients were used, and their nutritional value. This will give you an understanding of the meal. But it is not sufficient to understand. You still need to eat. It does not matter whether you use a fork or a pair of chopsticks, you must eat the food on the table. Understanding is one thing, but eating, enjoying, is another.</p>
<p>In the Bible the Lord&rsquo;s supply is likened to food. He is the bread of life and the living water. We should not think that it is enough for us to know, understand, and apprehend the Lord as the bread of life and the living water. We must also eat and drink Him. A newborn babe does not know anything, but he drinks milk. Although he does not understand its nutritional value, he drinks milk. Hence, although understanding is helpful, our ultimate goal is to receive the supply.</p>
<p>Our seeking of the Lord is by the Word. The more we know and understand the Word, the more we can gain the Lord. When we were newborn babes, we knew nothing except to drink milk. The more we grew, the more we learned. Now that we are adults, we know what we should eat and what we should avoid. This kind of knowledge helps us to enjoy our food. This same principle applies to our enjoyment of Christ. Therefore, we need both to understand and to enjoy Christ. Understanding and enjoying complement each other, and both are indispensable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE LORD<br />
BY READING THE WORD AND BY PRAYER</h2>
<p>Let us consider how to eat and drink the Lord, that is, how to receive and gain Him. Eating the Lord is simpler than eating food; there is no need of chopsticks or of forks and knives. When we read the Bible, we can pray over any verse. When we pray, we exercise our spirit. We use our mind to understand and apprehend, and we use our spirit to pray. We cannot say that our spirit is always the source of our prayer, but as long as we would pray, our spirit will be stirred up. For example, a child does not know how to use his feet when he begins to walk. He simply tries to walk and then learns how to use his feet, because walking requires that he use his feet. Likewise, praying requires the exercise of our spirit. We do not need to analyze whether we are using our mind or our spirit to pray. As long as we are willing to pray, our spirit will come forth. Perhaps the first sentence comes from our mind, but if we continue to pray, spiritual utterances from our spirit will come forth. We may not know whether we are exercising our spirit, but eventually, our spirit is stirred up.</p>
<p>Here is an illustration. In Matthew 8:24 through 27 the Lord Jesus and His disciples crossed the sea. While they were crossing the sea, there arose a great tempest, but the Lord was sleeping in the boat. The disciples were frightened and cried out, &ldquo;Lord, save us; we are perishing!&rdquo; The Lord rebuked them, saying, &ldquo;Why are you cowardly, you of little faith?&rdquo; Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. This is a simple portion of the Bible, but if we are seeking the Lord, the Spirit will touch us. We will see that when He was on earth, the Lord Jesus was a man whose outward appearance and actions were not different from those of other people, yet He was very different. He did not fear a dangerous situation but was able to sleep peacefully during a tempest. The disciples were all worried, but the Lord was sleeping. When we read this portion, we might say, &ldquo;Lord, You are wonderful. Everyone was scared, but You were sleeping peacefully.&rdquo; Then we should turn this thought into prayer. The more we pray, the more we will be inspired, and the more we are inspired, the more we will pray. As a result, we will be filled with the Lord.</p>
<p>If we read a portion of the Word and pray in the morning, we will have a good morning watch. In our morning watch we should read the Lord&rsquo;s Word in a simple way with a seeking heart in order to receive inspiration. We should then pray in a simple manner according to our inspiration. After praying, we should read the Word again in order to receive further inspiration, which we should again turn into prayer. We might spend only eight to ten minutes to read the Word and pray in this way, but we will surely be filled with the Spirit; we will be full of Christ. Not only so, we will have Christ&rsquo;s presence and power the rest of the day. When we encounter problems, Christ will encourage us; when we encounter temptations, He will resist them for us. When we touch the Word, we also touch the Spirit. This is the way to eat, drink, and enjoy the Lord in the Word and as the Spirit.</p>
<p>Many educated people do not like to read the Gospels. Once a college professor said that the four Gospels are not up to the standard of religious classics, because they are a record of unrelated matters, such as a hemorrhaging woman touching the fringe of the Lord&rsquo;s garment (Matt. 9:20-22; Mark 5:25-34; Luke 8:43-48), the blind asking for healing (Matt. 20:29-34; Mark 10:46-52; Luke 18:35-43), and little children being brought to the Lord Jesus for blessing (Matt. 19:13-15; Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17). These seem to be children&rsquo;s stories. How can they be considered as the Word of God? On the contrary, the four Gospels are certainly not simple. Rather, the simple words and understandable examples portray our glorious and rich Christ as the embodiment of God. We should practice to pray over the inspiration that we receive when we read the Bible. The more we pray, the deeper He will touch us, and we will gain more of His element. Eventually, we will be filled with Christ.</p>
<p>A well-trained physician told me that he had read many famous writings but that he still felt empty within. I recommended that he read the Gospel of John, because it is a book on life and is above other writings. After a period of time, he came to me and said, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, I have finished reading the Gospel of John, which you had recommended. It is altogether meaningless. The entire book consists of stories about people, which mean nothing.&rdquo; Therefore, I read a few verses from the Gospel of John with him. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (1:1); &ldquo;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life&rdquo; (8:12); &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life&rdquo; (3:16); and &ldquo;in that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (14:20). After reading these verses, I said, &ldquo;Do you think these words are meaningful or not?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;They sound quite mysterious,&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;Exactly so. The Gospel of John is not a simple book. The words seem easy, simple, and common, but they contain the speaking of a tremendously great God and a tremendously glorious Christ. If you would seek Him with a humble heart and read His Word, you will discover that it is very mysterious. Not only so, if you are willing to pray according to what you sense while you read, you will touch Christ and be filled with Him. You will also be full of joy and peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many saints not only understand what I am saying but have also experienced this. When we turn what we read in the Word into prayer, we will be joyful, peaceful, satisfied, and strengthened. We will mount up with wings like eagles. This is how to touch the Word and the Spirit. This is also what we refer to as reading and praying.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO EXERCISE OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>God is embodied in His Son for our enjoyment. This is a fact, which is definite and practical; it is not vague. God created us with a spirit, and His Spirit of glory dwells in our spirit. We have the holy Word in our hand and the Holy Spirit in our spirit. Whenever we read the Word, the Spirit moves in us. We cannot receive the inspiration from the Spirit by reading a newspaper. At the most, the report of an event may touch our emotions. When we read the Word, however, we are inspired by the Spirit. When we read the Word, the indwelling Spirit responds. When the Word without enters into us, it becomes the Spirit, and when the Spirit comes out of us, He becomes the word. The two always respond to one another. Whenever we read the Bible, the Spirit moves, and when we pray the words that we have read, they enter into us. The Bible and the Spirit coordinate with each other. When we touch one, the other responds. We know the Lord by the Bible, and we touch Him by the Spirit.</p>
<p>All God&rsquo;s children need to see that God wants us to enjoy Him. In order to enjoy Him, we must read the Bible with a calm heart. This is the first step. Next, we need to exercise our spirit and turn what we read into prayer. It is best to pray according to the light that we receive from reading the Bible. If we do not receive any light while reading the Bible, we can repeat the words in the Bible with a praying spirit.</p>
<p>In Matthew 8:1-3 the Lord Jesus healed a leper when He came down from the mountain. A brother who receives light while reading this portion might say, &ldquo;Lord, if You had remained on the mountain, that leper could not have been healed. You are a Lord who comes down from the mountain.&rdquo; Such a prayer is full of light. If the brother did not receive this kind of light, after reading verse 1, he might say, &ldquo;Dear Lord Jesus, thank You for coming down from the mountain.&rdquo; This is very easy. Or he can read the Bible with a praying spirit. This will also exercise his spirit. Therefore, it is not difficult to exercise our spirit when we read the Word.</p>
<p>As long as we are willing to practice, we will learn. This kind of pray-reading is not difficult. The Word explains who the Lord is so that we may know Him; hence, we need to read the Bible. Furthermore, the Lord is the Spirit so that we can touch Him with our spirit. The Spirit and the Word echo one another. When we read the Word, the Spirit moves in us; and when the Spirit moves, we should turn the Word into prayer. We use our eyes and our mind when we read. When we pray, it seems as though we are using our mouth, but the Spirit comes. Although our prayer might not begin with our spirit, if we continue to pray, we will exercise our spirit. When the Spirit moves, we should pray according to the inspiration of the Spirit. Or we can turn the words in the Bible into prayer. May we practice this.</p>
<p>If a seeker of the Lord is willing to spend some time to exercise his spirit according to this fellowship, he will definitely be transformed daily. This is more effective than listening to messages. This is not to say that listening to messages is not helpful. God has arranged for us to meet as the church and for some to minister the word so that we can hear His speaking. However, we should not use only our mind when we listen; we should also exercise our spirit. We need to touch the Word, and we also need to touch the Spirit. The words that we read must be turned into prayer; that is, we need to contact and digest the words with prayer.</p>
<p>It is normal to pray while listening to a message. If we cannot pray in a detailed way, we should continually look to the Lord. Immediately after the message, we should have a time of prayer. Then we would not only listen to the Lord&rsquo;s word with our mind, but we would also touch the Lord with our spirit. As a result, the words we heard will become spirit and life in us, and we will enjoy the Lord in a practical way.</p>
<p>Every message and fellowship should be brought into the spirit of prayer so that we can touch God and be genuine persons, because our spirit is genuine. When we touch God in our spirit, we become genuine persons. When we fellowship with God in our spirit, we become sincere persons. When we fellowship with God in our spirit, we become sanctified persons. When we touch Him in our spirit, we become upright persons who are filled with Him. We will also be filled with the Spirit, and we become persons who can overcome sin, the world, temptations, seductions, greediness, sicknesses, the self, the flesh, naturalness, and individualism. Furthermore, we become persons who can be built up together with other saints and can be coordinated as one Body to be His glorious dwelling place. The building up of the church can be accomplished by those who pray with their spirit. The building up of the church depends on our spirit of prayer.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRAYER AND THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 21:13; Luke 1:8-9; 2:36-37; Eph. 5:18b-20; 6:18-19</h1>
<p>The Lord has shown us that there is a great need to build up the priesthood so that the church can be built. Such a vision comes from the Lord&rsquo;s enlightenment. In this chapter we will consider several important points concerning the priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD SAVING US TO BE PRIESTS</h2>
<p>According to Revelation 1 and 5, the Lord purchased us for God by His blood out of every tribe, tongue, people, and nation and thereby released us from our sins and made us a kingdom and priests to God (1:5-6; 5:9-10). The kingdom is a matter of authority. After we are saved, we are subject to God&rsquo;s authority, and we have His authority. With such a standing we can be His priests. According to the New Testament, as believers, we are priests to God. On the one hand, we are members of His household. On the other hand, we are in His kingdom; hence, we are under His authority and represent His authority. We are also priests in His temple, His dwelling place. First Peter 2:5 says that we are living stones and are being built up as God&rsquo;s spiritual house, His dwelling place, and as a holy priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING A PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>The church is a corporate body of priests. Many saints understand that the church is composed of all the saints. Now we must go further and see that the saints in the church are a coordinated body of priests, a priesthood. The priesthood is the built-up church. In the Old Testament the tabernacle consisted of furniture, and the priests who served in the tabernacle were a group of people. The priests and the tabernacle were intimately related, but they were separate. This is no longer true in the New Testament. In the New Testament age, the tabernacle and the priests are one. God&rsquo;s priests are His tabernacle, His dwelling place. This dwelling place, the built-up church, is the priesthood composed of every believer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOCUS OF THE PRIESTLY SERVICE BEING<br />
THE BURNING OF INCENSE</h2>
<p>The focus of the priestly service was to burn incense, which signifies our praying to God. The priests needed to regularly take care of many things, such as presenting the offerings, spreading the bread of the Presence, lighting the lamps, and burning incense. All their services focused on burning the incense. The priests needed to present offerings for their burning of the incense at the incense altar. The fire used at the incense altar had to be taken from the bronze altar. This signifies that the prayers we offer in the resurrected Christ must be based on the effectiveness of His redemption on the cross. Only such prayers are accepted by God. The offerings were for the burning of the incense. The priests had to light the lamps before they could burn the incense; otherwise, they would have been in darkness. Therefore, the lighting of the lamps was also for the burning of the incense. The priests also had to eat the bread of the Presence so that they were supplied to burn the incense at the incense altar. The bread of the Presence signifies that the Son of God became our food so that we would live before Him. This shows that the bread of the Presence is also related to burning the incense. Thus, the focus, the center, of the priestly service was burning the incense.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SAINTS NEEDING TO PRAY<br />
FOR THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In the New Testament the temple of God is composed of priests who pray, that is, burn the incense. Therefore, the temple must be a temple of prayer (Luke 19:46). The built-up church is a house of prayer. This is not doctrine, nor is it an opinion. This is the requirement for the building up of the church. Some saints must rise up in a practical way to carry out the priestly service of entering the Holy Place and burning incense; that is, there must be some who will rise up to pray. Otherwise, it will not be possible to build the church.</p>
<p>In the churches we lack saints who are willing to carry out the priestly service of burning incense before God. The Lord has enlightened us so that we would meet this need.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving Life through Prayer</h2>
<p>God desires to enter into a group of people and be their life so that they can be mingled and built up in His life. This process requires much prayer. No one can be saved without prayer. Prayer moves those who hear the gospel to receive the Lord. The Bible says, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved&rdquo; (Mark 16:16), and &ldquo;whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&rdquo; (Rom. 10:13). A person is genuinely saved when he calls on the Lord&rsquo;s name, because he contacts the Lord. A person who has not prayed may believe only in his mind, not in his spirit. When a person prays, something transpires in his spirit.</p>
<p>In the same principle, until we meet the Lord face to face, our contacting the Lord cannot be separated from prayer. Regardless of how good a message is, without prayer we do not have a way to receive it into our spirit. Hence, immediately after we listen to a message, we must pray concerning any enlightenment that we have received. Then what we have heard will remain in our spirit. When we read the Word, we must also match our reading with prayer. No matter how much we read, we must pray in order to receive the Word into our spirit. Without prayer we cannot receive the spiritual supply, because what we hear or read will remain in our mind. It is only through prayer that what we hear or read can pass through our mind to become the spiritual supply in our spirit.</p>
<p>Prayer is the key for us to contact and enjoy God. Only by means of prayer can we be joined to God. In order for an electric lamp to shine, it needs to be connected to the power station. We need to read the Word, listen to messages, read spiritual books, and fellowship with the saints. However, the most important matter is that we touch God, that we are joined to Him, in our spirit through prayer. This was our lack in the past. We often had much spiritual activity, but we did not touch God. This is not to say that we do not need to listen to messages, read spiritual books, and fellowship with the saints. We need these activities, but the most necessary item is that we are joined to God through prayer.</p>
<p>In the past we did not pray enough. The saints and even the full-time serving ones did not pray enough. Hence, the greatest need in the churches is prayer. We must have a change in our concept and see that we need to endeavor to spend time in prayer. God wants us to pay attention to this matter. In order to contact and receive the Lord, we must pray more. Prayer will issue in the practical growth in life.</p><h2 class="head2">Supplying Life through Prayer</h2>
<p>We must also pray if we want God to flow out of us in order to supply others. It is through prayer that the living water of life can flow into us, and it is also through prayer that this living water of life can flow out of us. Our spirit is weak, and we are short of the supply for others because we do not pray enough. The primary purpose of prayer is for us to exercise our spirit and absorb God. Asking for things is secondary. For example, when we play basketball, our primary concern is to exercise our body; whether or not we win is secondary. Likewise, prayer is primarily for us to exercise our spirit. Sometimes our prayers will be answered, but that is not always the case. God often does not answer our prayers according to our desire. However, whether or not our prayers are answered is secondary. The fact is that we have prayed and thus exercised our spirit. When our spirit is strengthened, we can supply others whenever we open our mouths.</p>
<p>In order for the brothers to have a strong spirit while they give a message, they cannot be short of prayer in their daily life. A brother who lacks prayer and does not exercise his spirit to contact God in his daily life will not have a living, strong, and released spirit when he ministers the word. This is a law. Athletes who run daily are swift when there is a need to run. Those who train in boxing can hit someone with force when there is a need. Likewise, if the brothers would pray daily, their spirit would be strong and released when they stand up to give a message, and they would be able to touch the saints. The brothers who minister the word must not rely on eloquence or knowledge. They must pray daily so that their spirit is strong and enriched.</p>
<p>The early apostles prayed. They said, &ldquo;We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word&rdquo; (Acts 6:4). The apostles continued steadfastly in prayer. They placed prayer before the ministry of the word. This shows that in their feeling, prayer was more fundamental and more important than the ministry of the word. They prayed not only to ask God to manifest His power, to save souls, and to bless His work but also to exercise their spirit. In Acts the apostles prayed steadfastly day by day. Hence, it is not a wonder that their spirit was uplifted and prevailing. When they stood up to speak, their spirit was released.</p>
<p>Just as we need to exercise our spirit in order to give a message, we need to exercise our spirit in order to supply the saints through visiting them and fellowshipping with them. We need prayer to receive the Spirit, and we also need prayer for the Spirit to be released. This is the only way for the church to be built. If we are not delivered to spend more time to pray, God will not be able to do anything among us. As a result, the messages we give concerning building will touch only the minds of the saints, and God will not have the real building of the church. Therefore, we must exercise our spirit in prayer. We must function as priests by being strengthened in our spirit through constant exercise so that we can release our spirit in any situation. This is the way for the church to be built up. The building up of the church depends on the prayer of the priesthood. A praying church is a built-up church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE MOVING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>If we want the Spirit to move in us, we must not wait passively. Ten years ago I exhorted the saints to pray according to the move of the Spirit. However, we cannot find a verse in the Bible that tells us to wait until we are moved by the Spirit before we pray. On the contrary, 1 Thessalonians 5:19 says, &ldquo;Do not quench the Spirit.&rdquo; It is not a matter of waiting for the Spirit to move us. The Spirit is constantly moving in us. It is a matter of not quenching the move of the Spirit. There are other verses in the Bible, such as Romans 12:11, &ldquo;Be burning in spirit,&rdquo; and Ephesians 5:18, &ldquo;Be filled in spirit,&rdquo; which are concerning the move of the Spirit. The word <em>be</em> in these verses indicates that we must be active in order to be burning or filled in spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIGGING THE WELL IN ORDER<br />
FOR THE LIVING WATER TO FLOW OUT</h2>
<p>Being filled in spirit refers to the flowing of living water from within us. In the Old Testament, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness, they often encountered the problem of a shortage of water. Shortly after they crossed the Red Sea, they came to Marah and to the twelve springs of water at Elim (Exo. 15:22-27). At Meribah Moses struck the rock, and water flowed out (17:1-7). In Numbers 20:2-13 the children of Israel encountered a shortage of water again, and God instructed Moses to speak to the rock so that it would yield its water for the people to drink. In verses 16 through 18 of chapter 21 the children of Israel came to Beer. On this occasion they did not strike the rock, nor were there visible springs. Rather, they dug a well for water to spring up. On one hand, they used the scepter and their staffs to dig the well; on the other hand, they sang, &ldquo;Spring up, O well!&rdquo; Many Bible students pay attention to the twelve springs at Elim and to the water that flowed out of the smitten rock, but they neglect the digging of the well in Beer. We are focusing on the type of digging a well in order to get water. We are not concerned with the springs at Elim or with striking the rock. The rock has been cleft, and the springs are flowing into us. Our present need is to dig the well. We must dig until the living water springs up.</p>
<p>Digging the well does not refer to seeking the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. The Bible speaks of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit only in Acts, not in the Epistles. The spirit that is spoken of numerous times in the Epistles does not refer to the Holy Spirit but to the mingled spirit, that is, God&rsquo;s Spirit mingled with our spirit. For example, Romans 8:4 speaks of walking according to the spirit. The word <em>spirit</em> here refers to the Spirit of God mingled with the spirit of man, that is, the divine Spirit mingled with the human spirit. We can say confidently that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is not referred to in the Epistles. Romans 5:5 says, &ldquo;The love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.&rdquo; There is a distinction between the love of God being poured out through the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit being poured out upon the believers. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit recorded in Acts was outward, upon the believers, just like water covering people outwardly so that they are submerged in water. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit was an extraordinary experience, not a daily matter. It was something done by God to meet a particular need. Now God is in our spirit as the spring of living water. We do not need to search for outward springs or to strike the rock, nor do we need to wait for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. We need only to dig the well, to open a hole in our being, so that the spring of water hidden in our spirit will flow out.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Digging the Well through Prayer</h2>
<p>We dig the well through prayer. The more thoroughly we pray, the deeper we dig. Ephesians speaks of being filled in spirit (5:18) and of &ldquo;praying at every time in spirit&rdquo; (6:18). In order to be filled in spirit, we need to pray in spirit. If we want our spirit to be strong and released so that God can flow out of us, we must exercise our spirit through prayer daily. Then our spirit will be strong, and we will be able to express the sense within our spirit. If we would be faithful to exercise our spirit, in a short time our spirit will be released, and living waters will flow out. Moreover, we will be able to supply the saints and lead them to release their spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SINGING HYMNS TO MATCH OUR PRAYER</h2>
<p>Besides exercising our spirit to pray, we must exercise to sing hymns. There is often the need to sing hymns that match our prayer in order for our spirit to be released. We have not practiced singing regularly, so we do not know how to sing in the meetings. Singing greatly affects the release of the spirit. Hence, we need to diligently practice singing in order to make up for our lack. Although it is difficult for those who are over forty years old to learn to sing, it is still better for them to learn and to practice. We do not require the saints to become vocalists, but we hope that everyone will be willing to learn in humility. After a period of time, we will see some improvement. We particularly need to learn to sing with our spirit the new hymns that are frequently called in the meetings. Giving a message and listening to a message both involve the mind, but genuine prayer and singing involve the exercise of the spirit. It is through praying and singing that our spirit can be released. At least one-third of our meetings depends on singing hymns. This is particularly true concerning the bread-breaking meeting. If we cannot sing a hymn well, the spirit of the meeting will be dampened. Conversely, if we can sing a hymn well, the entire meeting will be uplifted. I believe that we have experienced this.</p>
<p>If we want to have a strong spirit, we must exercise to pray and sing more. Formerly, we used mainly our mind to listen to messages and to study them. Now we must have a change&mdash;we must use our spirit more than our mind in order to pray and to sing the hymns. It is not enough to merely utter words clearly or to sing with a loud voice. Our spirit must come out with the words we utter and with our voice when we sing. This is the way to have a strong spirit and to release the spirit of the saints. This is also the way for living waters to flow among us and for the church to be built.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE URGENT NEED OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT LACK OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The Lord has shown us that there is the need to build the church. The present need of the church is not merely for the believers to love the Lord fervently, to pursue spirituality, or to preach the gospel zealously in order to lead people to salvation. Rather, the present need is for the believers to be built together in spirit to become a living, spiritual temple as the Body of Christ for Him to obtain rest, to be expressed, and to be glorified.</p>
<p>In 1958 we released a series of messages concerning the building (see the following three books: <em>The Building Work of God, The Basis for the Building Work of God,</em> and <em>The Perfecting of the Saints and the Building Up of the House of God</em>). The response of the saints to these messages was inadequate. However, there has been a strong response from the saints to the recent messages concerning the building of the church. This response has resulted in some amount of practical building in the church.</p>
<p>While pursuing the practical building, we discovered that there is a serious lack in spiritual riches among us. We still are lacking in matters related to the spirit, because we are short of genuine fellowship and prayer. In the spring of 1958 the leading brothers sensed this shortage. The brothers saw that many saints have a heart for the Lord and enjoy coming to the meetings and listening to messages but lack personal fellowship with the Lord. Therefore, we had three conferences to cover how to eat, drink, and enjoy God and how to absorb His riches through reading the Word and prayer (see <em>How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God</em>). The Lord spoke a fresh and timely word to us in those meetings, and a number of saints experienced a turn in their fellowship with the Lord.</p>
<p>However, there is still a great lack in the practical living of the saints in relation to the present need of God&rsquo;s building. We still do not have adequate fellowship with the Lord. The more we fellowship concerning the relationship between the saints who serve as priests and their being built up together, the more we sense this need.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH AND<br />
OUR SERVING AS PRIESTS</h2>
<p>First Peter 2:5 says, &ldquo;You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood.&rdquo; The spiritual house is produced through the living stones being built up together. This house is a priesthood, a group of built-up priests. Therefore, for the saints to be built up together, they must be priests. The priests who serve God, draw near to Him, and fellowship with Him are the spiritual house, the dwelling place of God.</p>
<p>In both Exodus and Leviticus the priests&rsquo; service was related always to the tabernacle; the tabernacle was entrusted to their care. In the picture of the Old Testament typology, the priests were the serving ones, and the tabernacle was God&rsquo;s dwelling place. The priests and the tabernacle were distinct but not separate from each other. When the tabernacle was pitched, the priests served God in the tabernacle. When the children of Israel moved, the tabernacle was entrusted to the priests. Among the children of Israel, there was always a corporate body of priests caring for the tabernacle. The tabernacle and the priests could not be separated.</p>
<p>In the New Testament 1 Peter 2 speaks concerning the priests and the tabernacle being mingled as one. Verse 5 says that the priesthood is the spiritual house. The New Testament priests are the New Testament tabernacle. Every priest is a constituent of the tabernacle. Every saint must be a living priest in order for us to be built up together as the church. A saint who lacks fellowship with the Lord and the flow of living water cannot be considered a living stone, nor is there the possibility for him to be built with others. Therefore, we must bring the saints into the priestly service for them to live a life in the Holy of Holies, that is, to live continuously before God and in fellowship with Him. This is the only way that we can be built up together.</p>
<p>Apart from being brought into the priesthood, there is no other way for the children of God to be built together. It is not sufficient for us to nurture and edify the saints. The saints must be brought into the priestly living so that they may serve in the tabernacle, that is, live before God and let God live in them. Then their spirit will be fresh, and they will grow daily and be able to be blended and built up together. To be blended in spirit is to be built up. We cannot be built up in ourselves; we can be built up only in the Spirit.</p>
<p>With respect to the Body of Christ, on the one hand, we have been baptized in the Spirit, and on the other hand, we have been given to drink the Spirit. First Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; This means that we are baptized in the Spirit outwardly and that we drink the Spirit inwardly. These are the two aspects of our experience of the Spirit. We experience His outpouring and His infilling. With respect to the outpouring, we are baptized in Him; with respect to the infilling, we drink Him. If we are in the Spirit and let the Spirit blend us together, we will experience the one Body. This is real coordination, blending, and building. We must see that unless the saints are brought into the priestly service, there is no way for the church to be built.</p><h2 class="head1">THE COORDINATION OF FELLOWSHIP AND AUTHORITY</h2>
<p>Concerning the Lord Jesus, Zechariah 6:13 says, &ldquo;It is he who will build the temple of Jehovah; and he will bear majesty and will sit and rule on his throne; and he will be a priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace will be between the two of them.&rdquo; As the Builder of the holy temple, the Lord holds the two offices of the kingship and the priesthood. In Him there is the counsel of peace between the two offices. The two offices are joined together in Him for the building of the temple. This corresponds with 1 Peter 2:5, which says that the living stones are being built into a spiritual house, which is the holy priesthood. In addition, verse 9 says that the priests are a royal priesthood. The priests serve not only as priests but also as kings.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the two lines of the priesthood and the kingship were involved with the building of the tabernacle and of the temple. In the building of the tabernacle, Moses represented the aspect of authority, the kingship, while Aaron represented the aspect of fellowship, the priesthood. After Moses and Aaron, Joshua and Eleazar continued to represent the aspects of authority and fellowship (Num. 34:17). Eleazar continued the line of fellowship, and Joshua continued the line of authority. Authority and fellowship are inseparable. Joshua was the authority, but he could not rule independently. All his actions had to be balanced and regulated by Eleazar&rsquo;s fellowship with God. Eleazar bore the Urim and the Thummim when he fellowshipped with God. In this way he brought all God&rsquo;s people before God and brought God&rsquo;s intention to His people. This was the function of fellowship in the priesthood. In such a fellowship God and His people were mingled as one. Joshua&rsquo;s actions in the aspect of authority were based on this fellowship. Joshua could not exercise authority without Eleazar&rsquo;s fellowship. Moreover, Eleazar&rsquo;s fellowship could not be executed without Joshua&rsquo;s authority. If either were lacking, the rank and order among God&rsquo;s people would not have been maintained. Therefore, among God&rsquo;s people there must be the execution of authority, and there must also be fellowship to touch God&rsquo;s heart. These two aspects need to be in coordination in order for the people of God to be in oneness and thereby be built together.</p>
<p>After the children of Israel entered into Canaan, during the age of the judges, the people fell into confusion. There were problems among the priests, and some even left the tabernacle to become family priests, serving idols (Judg. 17:7-13; 18:14-20). The aspect of fellowship among the children of Israel was completely destroyed. Once the fellowship was destroyed, authority was lost, and order was replaced with chaos. Hence, the book of Judges says, &ldquo;There was no king in Israel; everyone did that which was right in his own eyes&rdquo; (17:6; 21:25). That was a time of desolation among the people of God.</p>
<p>Later, Samuel was raised up in the position of a priest. He was not a priest of the house of Aaron; he was a Nazarite. In the Pentateuch God arranged that His people could serve Him either by ordination or by voluntary consecration. To serve by ordination meant that one was a male of the house of Aaron and hence a priest by birth. To serve by voluntary consecration meant that a person was not a priest by birth but that he volunteered to become a Nazarite (Num. 6:1-5). This was a door of grace opened by God for His people to serve Him. At the time of Samuel this door of grace was used. When the ordained priests were in desolation, a voluntary Nazarite was able to come in and replace them. Samuel wore the ephod and stood in the position of a priest, even while he was still a boy (1 Sam. 2:18). By serving as a priest, he brought in the kingship. Hence, fellowship always brings in authority; that is, the priesthood brings in the kingship.</p>
<p>When David was a proper king, having a normal relationship with God, he also wore the ephod. The two offices of the priesthood and the kingship were not borne by one person. However, when David brought the Ark into Jerusalem, he danced before God and was girded with a linen ephod (2 Sam. 6:14). This is a type of the Lord Jesus possessing the two offices of the priesthood and the kingship. David&rsquo;s wearing the ephod on that occasion was related to God&rsquo;s tabernacle, His dwelling place. When David brought the Ark into Jerusalem, the Ark was no longer in the tabernacle, its resting place. Hence, in Psalm 132 David said that he would not go up onto the couch of his bed or give slumber to his eyelids until he found a place for Jehovah, a tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob (vv. 3-5). The fact that David as a king put on the priestly ephod is a strong indication that in order for God to have a dwelling place, the priesthood and the kingship must be blended. In other words, there must be the fellowship that coordinates with, balances, and brings in authority.</p>
<p>David not only desired to build the temple for God; he also set the priests in divisions. God&rsquo;s dwelling place cannot be separated from the priesthood. The Old Testament is consistent in this matter. While David was gathering material to build the temple, he paid attention to the strengthening of the priestly service. He divided the priests and the Levites into two groups. One group was responsible for the service in the house of Jehovah and had twenty-four divisions (1 Chron. 24:1-19). The other group was responsible for singing praise and also had twenty-four divisions (ch. 25). The singing was performed by the Levites, but they were attached to the priests. In the New Testament there is no distinction between the priests and the Levites. Whatever the priests and Levites did in the Old Testament should be done by the New Testament priests.</p>
<p>The glorious situation with the priesthood did not last long. The priesthood fell into desolation, and the doors of the temple were even closed. When the fellowship was lost, the kingship fell into degradation. During the reign of Ahab, the priesthood was desolate, and the kingship failed completely. At this time, the prophets emerged. The prophets functioned during an abnormal situation. They emerged during the degradation of the priests and kings.</p>
<p>During the recovery of the building, when the people of God returned from the land of captivity to rebuild the temple, Zerubbabel was the governor, and Joshua was the high priest. The coordination between the kingship and the priesthood, between authority and fellowship, was necessary for the temple of God to be recovered (Zech. 6:13). Later, Ezra, a priest and scribe, taught God&rsquo;s people the books of the law, and Nehemiah was the governor and led the people to rebuild the holy city (Neh. 8). In these two men we can see the coordination of the priesthood and the kingship. As the person who builds the temple of God, the Lord Jesus possesses the two offices of the kingship and the priesthood. In order to build the church, there must be fellowship and authority.</p>
<p>How wonderful it is that at the end of Revelation, the last book in the Bible, there is the throne of God and a river of water of life flowing through the New Jerusalem: &ldquo;He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street&rdquo; (22:1). This is a picture of authority in coordination with fellowship. According to John 7, the river of water of life denotes the Spirit of life flowing out of God into all those who belong to Him (vv. 38-39). The fellowship among God&rsquo;s people is the flowing out of God in the Son as the Spirit.</p>
<p>This river flows out of the throne, which is the throne of grace (Heb. 4:16). However, since it is a throne, it is for exercising authority. The fact that there is one throne indicates that God cannot be separated from the Lamb. In the New Jerusalem God is the light, and the Lamb is the lamp (Rev. 21:23). The light is in the lamp, so the two are one. God is in the Lamb, who died to shed His blood and terminate the old creation. His blood has purified the things that were defiled by Satan&rsquo;s rebellion (Heb. 9:23-24). Therefore, God can flow out of the throne. Here is fellowship and also authority. May we all see this eternal principle of God.</p>
<p>Revelation continues the Gospel of John. John&rsquo;s Gospel says that God is from the beginning, that in Him is life, and that He came for man to have life (1:1, 4; 10:10). He is the Lamb of God who was slain and shed His blood to take away the sin of the world and terminate everything of the old creation, and He is the Bridegroom who will have His bride (1:29; 3:29). These items are found in the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>The consummation of the Bible is at the end of Revelation, where we see the bride, the Lamb, the river of water of life, and the tree of life (chs. 21&mdash;22). This conclusion portrays God, who is eternal, accomplishing redemption in His Son, the Lamb, and flowing into His people as the Spirit, the river of water of life. This flow brings us into one fellowship and joins us together. This fellowship is accompanied by the throne of authority. The throne is related to the kingship, and the flow of the water of life is related to the priesthood. The two offices of the kingship and the priesthood are joined together. In the universe there are the throne and the river of water of life&mdash;there are God&rsquo;s authority and His fellowship. As children of God, we are royal priests. We serve as priests in the fellowship of God, and we are under His authority. In such a balanced situation of fellowship and authority, we can be built up together to be His dwelling place. The building up of God&rsquo;s children is the only way for God to gain a dwelling place.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD DESIRING TO GAIN PRIESTS</h2>
<p>The entire Bible shows that God desires to gain priests. After creating Adam, God placed him in a position in which he could draw near to God. Abel, Noah, and Abraham were priests because they offered sacrifices to God. In the New Testament every believer can enter into the Holy of Holies (Heb. 10:19). In the Old Testament only the priests could enter the Holy of Holies. Therefore, God desires everyone who is saved to be a priest.</p>
<p>A priest is one who fellowships with God and contacts God. God intended for the children of Israel to become a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:6). But when the children of Israel worshipped the golden calf, eleven tribes lost the priesthood, and only one tribe, the Levites, came forth to stand on God&rsquo;s side (32:19-29). Hence, the priesthood was given to the tribe of Levi (Num. 18:22-23; Deut. 33:8-10). A priest is a person who draws near to God, fellowships with God, and affords God an open opportunity to work in him. This is the standing that every believer has. Therefore, there should not be any barriers between us and God. We should fellowship with Him and afford Him sufficient opportunities to work Himself into us and to bring us into fellowship with Him so that the water of life can flow freely in us.</p>
<p>Our former understanding concerning the priests was superficial. The Lord has given us a complete view. A priest is a person who lives before God, has fellowship with God, and is mingled with God. He has the divine life and nature within him and possesses God&rsquo;s image and authority. Such a person expresses and represents God in the divine fellowship; he also allows all that God is to pass through him and be accomplished in him. This is the meaning of a priest. Only the priests can accomplish the building of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOCUSING ON THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE SPIRIT<br />
AND A PRIESTLY LIVING</h2>
<p>Our urgent need is to live in the Holy of Holies and help the saints enter into such a fellowship. God has prepared many things for us; our need is to dig the well and let the water of life flow among us so that the practical building can be accomplished. In the churches there is the need for everyone to have a practical living in the Holy of Holies. We should also focus on the matter of perfecting the saints in the various meetings.</p>
<p>There is only one group of people who can fulfill God&rsquo;s intention. The persons in this group exercise their spirit to fellowship with God, and they let God flow through their spirit. Such persons have a spirit that is strong, living, and released, and they exercise their spirit in order to be mingled and built up with others. Our urgent need is to be such persons.</p>
<p>May we be diligent and burning in our spirit to rise up and receive this burden. We need to grasp every opportunity to pray in groups of two or three. Then when we come to the meeting, we will serve in our spirit, have the supply of the spirit, and exercise our spirit. May the Lord grant us grace so that the saints will enter into the fellowship of the spirit and the genuine building. Whoever allows the Spirit to flow in him will be built with others. The flow of the Spirit brings the divine elements into us and also cleanses us of filthiness, impurities, complications, mixtures, and the old creation. Then we will have the real building in the fellowship of the spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRAYING TO BE STRENGTHENED IN SPIRIT</h1>
<p>I have a strong sense within that we have reached a new stage, and we need to have a turn.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING MORE INDIVIDUAL PRAYER</h2>
<p>During the past twelve years, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we have laid a foundation in the truth and received some training concerning coordination in the service. We have also advanced in the matters of the administration of the church and the shepherding of the saints. These are all necessary matters. However, we must admit that we do not exercise our spirit enough. Our situation can be compared to a person who is physically strong yet anemic. This does not mean that we were wrong or improper in the past and therefore need to be adjusted. We are saying that we must focus on strengthening our spirit.</p>
<p>We have spent a great deal of time to study the truth, we have developed the work, and the churches are spreading. These situations are proper. Nevertheless, we must admit that we lack the exercise of our spirit. As a result, our spirit is not strong, living, rich, or fresh. We seem to be proper and right, but we are very poor. If our spirit were strong and matched our knowledge of the truth, our coordination in service, our administration of the church, and our shepherding of the saints would have been greatly blessed. Hence, we must focus our attention on being strengthened in our spirit. We must spend more time to pray, not only individually but also corporately. We must exercise our spirit so that it will be strong, living, rich, and fresh.</p>
<p>Our only way is to pray more. This is the way to exercise our spirit. The more we pray, the more we enter into the divine light and are enlightened by the Lord to see our need to be purified and broken in a deeper way. Although we have consecrated ourselves to the Lord, when we enter into deeper fellowship with Him, we will sense that His requirements are deeper and stricter. Then we need a deeper consecration. Thus, our spirit will be strengthened and refreshed.</p>
<p>In the present stage of the work, the co-workers must focus on and aggressively pursue the exercise of the spirit. This is not merely to seek the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, although there will be the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. When we pray more in the Lord&rsquo;s presence and have more fellowship with Him, we will spontaneously experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and be empowered. However, the pursuit we are speaking of is much deeper than seeking the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Those who are working for the Lord must focus on the spirit; otherwise, the work will not have much spiritual worth, and the building will be merely a theory. At the most, we will have outward practices that will not cause the church to be built up. If we want the church to be built up practically, the co-workers must take the lead to exercise their spirit. May we spend more time in prayer to exercise our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE SAINTS TO PRAY MORE<br />
AND SUPPLYING THEM</h2>
<p>Besides focusing on exercising the spirit, we should also change the way that we work. In the past we stressed giving messages. We taught and helped the saints through the messages, but we rarely brought the saints back to their spirit through prayer. We cannot say that our practice was wrong, but it lacked the element of the spirit; hence, it was not easy for the saints to be strengthened. This can be compared to instructing a person to grow but not caring for the circulation of his blood. We need to focus on increasing the circulation of blood.</p>
<p>There must be a change in the way that we work. We need to lead the saints to their spirit through prayer rather than focusing on giving messages. In the meetings and in our personal contact with the saints, we must lead them to pray with us so that they can touch the Lord in their spirit and thereby receive the supply that will solve their problems. This will be more effective than trying to render help solely through messages.</p>
<p>If we want to lead the saints to pray, we must exercise to pray regularly. When our spirit is strong, living, and released, we will be able to enliven others&rsquo; spirit, fanning it into flame. Suppose our gospel preaching has little effect, and very few people are saved. This probably means that we only preach to people; we do not lead them to pray with their spirit in order to contact God. Regardless of how much we speak, if we do not lead a person to pray, he will not be saved. If we can lead him to pray so that he opens his heart and spirit to the Lord and calls on the name of the Lord from deep within, he will touch God, his spirit will be released, and he will be saved.</p>
<p>We should apply this principle to shepherding the saints. Besides ministering the word to them, we must pray with them. To spend twenty minutes to pray with a brother is more effective than merely speaking with him. However, if our spirit is dry, it will be useless to compel others to pray with us. Our spirit must be uplifted and released so that it comes forth once we open our mouth to pray. Then we can touch and enliven the saints through praying with them. At the same time, the Holy Spirit will flow through us as living channels into the saints, and they will receive the riches of the Spirit.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that we do not pray enough and that we rarely lead others to pray. As a result, although our work has been blessed by the Lord, few of the saints who have been gained spend sufficient time in prayer. The Lord has saved many, but few of them spend time in prayer. Many saints love the Lord, but they lack prayer. Many saints have been brought into the service, but they lack prayer. These examples are the result of the co-workers being short of prayer in the work. We do not spend sufficient time to pray, and the way that we work lacks prayer.</p>
<p>The co-workers must have a turn. They must learn to pray by exercising their spirit until their spirit is strong, uplifted, fresh, and released. Then we will be able to supply the saints so that their spirit can be released, and they can pray with an exercised spirit. When we lead the saints in this way, their problems will spontaneously be solved, they will be supplied, and they will also touch the source of grace. If we will always lead the saints to exercise their spirit in fellowship with God, their spirit will be living and fresh. Furthermore, they will release their spirit in the meetings.</p>
<p>We should not focus merely on giving messages. During the course of our speaking, we should pause and let the saints pray, and then we can continue the message. We must give the saints the opportunity to express what they have received in their spirit. After the message, we should give them an opportunity to express their inner feeling. In this way the message will penetrate their spirit, and they will receive spiritual help.</p><h2 class="head1">MEETING WITHOUT FORMALITY AND<br />
PRAYING MORE TO RELEASE THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We also need to change the way that we meet. When we speak of the way we meet, we are referring not only to certain practices but also to the substance of our meetings. Since we do not release our spirit in prayer and we focus more on messages than the flowing of the spirit, our meetings have gradually become a formality. Every meeting has regulations or is conducted in a set way. The message meeting has a set way, the prayer meeting has another way, and the bread-breaking meeting has yet another way. Everyone is familiar with the ways to conduct the meetings. The meetings are orderly and have become a routine; hence, we seldom exercise our spirit. The saints listen to messages and rarely exercise their spirit. Even in the bread-breaking meeting and the prayer meeting, they rarely exercise their spirit. They merely keep the regulations for that particular meeting. This is a serious situation.</p>
<p>The co-workers must rise up to turn this situation. We must detest formality and the lack of the exercise of the spirit. We must be released in our spirit so that we release our spirit in the meetings. Then we can lead the saints to not be bound by traditional rules but to release their spirit. For example, the procedure in the prayer meeting is as follows: At 7:30 P.M. a brother calls a hymn for us to sing. Then another brother announces the items for prayer, after which we begin to pray. We should tell the saints to reject this procedure. For convenience, it is right to decide the day and the time of a meeting. We may decide that the prayer meeting should be on Tuesday from 7:30 to 9:00 in the evening. However, some saints may arrive before 7:30, others at 7:30, and still others at a later time; this does not matter. Those who arrive first should exercise their spirit and begin to pray. They do not have to wait until 7:30 before beginning to pray. Perhaps everyone will pray individually, but at a certain time, they should pray corporately. The saints who need to leave early can do so, while those who are burdened may continue praying. This kind of meeting has been delivered from regulations and allows the Holy Spirit to move in a living way.</p>
<p>We have fallen short of being living and have offended God in this matter. Since it is difficult for us to release our spirit, the gifted members have not been manifested in the meetings. The meetings are for the release of the spirit, but they have become a formality that causes the spirit to be bound. When three to five brothers pray together before the meeting, they exercise their spirit, but when the meeting begins, their spirit is bound, and they fall into regulations. We must overturn this situation of having formal meetings so that the meetings can cause the saints to be released. Regardless of what the saints do, we must be released. Our spirit must not be bound in the meetings. We should not sit quietly, looking around at the saints. We should come to the meetings in order to exercise and release our spirit. Then the meetings will be a real help to us. We must not allow the meetings to be bound by formality.</p>
<p>The bread-breaking meeting is another example. First we sing a hymn, and then we pray. We should not have this formal regulation. It may be that the meeting does not begin with a hymn; rather, the saints simply praise and pray until everyone&rsquo;s spirit is released. Then when the meeting has reached its climax, the bread and the cup are passed. This does not mean that we should intentionally try to do something different. My desire is that we would see that our situation is abnormal. The meetings, which should lead the saints to release their spirit, have deteriorated to the extent that the saints are bound. All the activities in the meetings have fallen on the shoulders of a few responsible saints who reluctantly try to meet the need. This situation must change.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:25 says, &ldquo;Not abandoning our own assembling together,&rdquo; but it does not give a procedure for Christian meetings. Should we sing hymns first or pray first? When should we read the Scriptures, and when should we give testimonies? We cannot find any procedures in the Acts or in the Epistles. The New Testament does not give such regulations. The Lord wants us to break bread in remembrance of Him, and He wants us to first break the bread and then drink the cup. But He did not give us a procedure for breaking the bread. He did not say how many prayers we should offer or how many hymns we should sing. He did not give any procedures. We cannot find a portion of the Bible that says how the apostles gave messages. The basic reason for such an omission is that in the New Testament age everything is of the Spirit, not of the letter or of forms.</p>
<p>We dare not say that the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting is altogether according to the Bible. Of course, neither can we say that it is not according to the Bible. However, if we continue to follow our present practice, this meeting will develop into a form, which kills the spirit. Every meeting in the New Testament age must be in spirit, not in rituals. Therefore, we must educate the saints so that every time they come to a meeting, they would serve in their spirit. It does not matter what kind of meeting they attend, they must release their spirit.</p>
<p>In order to lead the saints to exercise their spirit, the co-workers must exercise their spirit. We must spend more time to pray with an exercised spirit. We have spent a great amount of time to study the truth and to develop the work, but we have not spent an adequate amount of time to pray. The amount of time spent in individual prayer has been inadequate, and the amount of time spent praying with other co-workers has also been inadequate. Hence, our spirit is poor, weak, and dry, and we are short of the spirit in the work and in the meetings. As a result, the meetings are formal, and the work lacks vitality. May the Lord wake us up to make this turn so that we would be released and have the supply of the spirit in the work and in the meetings.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">BLENDING DEPENDING ON PRAYER</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:1-11; Rom. 12:11</h1>
<p>Blending in spirit is crucial for the building of the church. Hence, we need to encourage the saints to blend in the spirit in all the meetings. In order to practice something, we first need to understand its basis; otherwise, we will have difficulty practicing it. We avoid confusion by understanding what we are doing and why we are doing it. In order to encourage the saints to practice blending in spirit, we need to understand the concept of blending. For this reason, we will fellowship concerning six crucial points related to blending in spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOD<br />
AND THE BELIEVERS BEING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The relationship between God and His people is altogether in the spirit. God is Spirit, and we have a spirit. Therefore, all our dealings with God, whether prayer, fellowship, or service, are in the spirit. This is the first thing that we need to know.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING SLOTHFUL TO EXERCISE THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We must confess that we are lazy and loose in the matter of exercising our spirit. In this matter the children of God tend to be slothful, just like some children are too lazy to use their mind to study. Most children can play all day without feeling tired. But they are unwilling to do their homework, because they are slothful in using their mind. They are accustomed to exercising their body, but they are unaccustomed to studying with their mind. This also applies to us as God&rsquo;s children in relation to exercising our spirit. We are willing to spend a good amount of time reading newspapers, conversing, and doing many other things, but we are not willing to pray. Prayer requires that we exercise our spirit, but our spirit is slothful, unwilling to move.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;Do not be slothful in zeal, but be burning in spirit, serving the Lord&rdquo; (Rom. 12:11). The word <em>slothful</em> here is in relation to the spirit because Paul goes on to say that we need to be burning in spirit, serving the Lord. Some saints are diligent outwardly, but their spirit is slothful. They are diligent and energetic in doing things, but they are slothful and seldom moved in spirit to pray. This is the result of being slothful to exercise the spirit and being unwilling to pray more with the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT EXERCISING THE SPIRIT<br />
BEING AN OFFENSE TO THE LORD</h2>
<p>Being slothful in spirit and not exercising the spirit greatly offend the Lord. In John 4:24 the Lord said, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit.&rdquo; Verse 23 says that God seeks such to worship Him. God is longing for persons who will fellowship with Him in spirit. We offend God by not exercising our spirit to worship Him or by rarely exercising our spirit.</p>
<p>God is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit so that we can receive and enjoy Him. God created us with a spirit and redeemed us so that the Spirit could enliven our spirit. Now the Spirit dwells in our spirit so that we may absorb and enjoy God with our spirit. However, we put Him aside, ignore Him, and turn our back to Him when we do not contact Him with our spirit. Many of us do not enjoy the Lord much, and some have never enjoyed Him. Some co-workers serve fervently in the church and visit other saints. They are fervent in many things other than exercising their spirit. They do not enjoy the Lord. As a result, the Lord is unable to reach the goal of His salvation among us.</p>
<p>Since we seldom exercise our spirit, we do not have a rich supply for the saints; we are not channels for them to receive the Lord. We may frequently visit the saints, but we can neither enliven their spirit nor supply them, because we do not exercise our spirit to pray with them. We are unable to render the saints real spiritual help.</p>
<p>Even in the meetings we do not exercise our spirit to contact one another. Most of our activities have the flavor of rituals and formalities, not the flavor of the Spirit or the moving of the Spirit. We cannot expect to worship and gain God, who is Spirit, in such meetings. How can we speak of exercising our spirit to open the spirit of the saints and bring them into the Lord? These shortages are the result of our not exercising our spirit, not praying enough, and being unwilling to open ourselves to pray with others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ACTIVE TO RECEIVE THE MOVING<br />
OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the past we blamed our lack of worship, enjoyment of the Lord, and supplying others on the Holy Spirit not moving in us. This sounds spiritual, but it is incorrect.</p>
<p>We have a wrong concept concerning the move of the Spirit. We think that when the Spirit moves in us, He takes the initiative, and we are passive. Some saints rarely pray or fellowship in the meetings, because they are not moved by the Spirit, and they dare not behave recklessly in the meetings. Such an explanation indicates that they have misunderstood what it means for the Spirit to move in them.</p>
<p>In order to understand how the Spirit moves, we must know a few matters that have been accomplished by God in the universe.</p>
<p>First, the Spirit is flowing. When the Lord Jesus was put to death on the cross, His side was pierced, and out flowed blood and water, just as living water flowed out of the cleft rock (John 19:34; 1 Cor. 10:4). This means that the Spirit has been released. This is as great an event as the accomplishment of redemption on the cross. In order to be forgiven of his sins, a sinner needs only to receive in his heart what the Lord has accomplished; there is no need for him to ask the Lord to die again on his behalf. Likewise, in order to obtain the Spirit, a believer needs merely to claim the accomplished fact; there is no need to beg, because the Rock has been cleft, and the Spirit is flowing out as living water.</p>
<p>Second, the Spirit has been sent. The Spirit has not only flowed out of the Lord, but He has also been sent. There were two steps in the sending of the Spirit. In the first step the Lord breathed into the disciples on the evening of His resurrection. In this step the Spirit entered into man as the Spirit of life (John 20:19, 22). In the second step the Spirit descended like a violent wind and like a flame of fire. In this step the Spirit descended upon man as the Spirit of power (Acts 2:1-4). These two steps are accomplished facts. Now the Spirit of God is not only before the throne but has also been sent forth into all the earth (Rev. 5:6). For example, radio waves are transmitted from a radio station to the whole earth. A person simply needs to turn on a radio, and he will receive the radio waves. Likewise, when a person opens his heart and his spirit, he will receive the Spirit.</p>
<p>Not only so, the Spirit has contacted our spirit. The moment we received the Lord, the Spirit contacted and enlivened our spirit. The Spirit is subjective to us, for we have contacted Him.</p>
<p>Finally, the Spirit is in our spirit. After we were regenerated, the Spirit remained in us; He now dwells in us. Hence, we should know with assurance that the Spirit is flowing because the Lord Jesus died on the cross, the Spirit descended from heaven, He contacted our spirit at the time of our regeneration, and He is dwelling in our spirit.</p>
<p>In view of these four great accomplishments, we can say that the Lord has done everything. We do not need to wait for the Lord to do anything else. We do not need to wait for the Spirit to move. When the wind is blowing, we just need to open the windows in order for the wind to blow into the house. If we want a draft, we should open windows that face each other. If we wait passively for the windows to open, the wind will never blow fresh air into the house.</p>
<p>The Spirit is like the wind. When the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The wind blows where it wills&rdquo; (John 3:8), He was referring to the Spirit. On the day of Pentecost, the move of the Holy Spirit was like a rushing violent wind (Acts 2:2). If we desire to have the blowing of the Holy Spirit, we should not wait passively; rather, we should take the initiative to open ourselves. Once we are open, the Spirit will blow and move in us. We may wait to be moved by the Spirit, but the Spirit is waiting for us to open ourselves. It is not a matter of whether or not the Spirit is moving but of whether or not we are willing to be open. The Spirit always wants to flow, but He has no way because we are not willing to open ourselves. Sometimes we are somewhat open, but we are open only on one side instead of two sides; we are open to God but not to the saints. Consequently, the Spirit can flow only in but not out. Eventually, He will no longer be able to flow in.</p>
<p>God is abounding in grace. He was incarnated, died, resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit in order to dwell in us. Now our spirits are subject to us (1 Cor. 14:32). As long as we are willing to move, the Spirit will move. If we do not move, the Spirit has no way to move. Therefore, the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;Be burning in spirit&rdquo; (Rom. 12:11). The word <em>be</em> here means that we need to take the initiative. Whether or not we are burning in spirit is our responsibility, not the Spirit&rsquo;s responsibility. If we are willing, we will be burning, but if we are not willing, we will not be burning. Once we turn on the switch, the electric current will flow.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12 speaks of spiritual gifts. Does the Spirit need to take the initiative in order for us to exercise these gifts, or do we? The Spirit spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12 has already been breathed into the believers and poured out upon them. This Spirit is dwelling in us. As long as we take the initiative to apply Him, not according to our feeling but according to faith, He will be manifested. It is not a question of whether or not He will give us a gift but to what extent we would let Him be manifested. If we open our mouth wide, He will fill it (Psa. 81:10). If we are closed and passive, His work will be limited. Therefore, the problem lies with us, not with the Spirit.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:1-2 says, &ldquo;Concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant. You know that when you were Gentiles, you were always being led away to dumb idols, whenever and however you were led.&rdquo; In his New Translation of the Bible, J. N. Darby translates the beginning of the first sentence as &ldquo;Now concerning spiritual manifestations.&rdquo; This translation makes it clear that the gifts are manifestations of the Spirit. In these verses the apostle seems to be saying, &ldquo;The false gods that you worshipped in the past could not speak; they were dumb idols. As a result, while you were serving them, you were also dumb. But now the God whom we worship is the Spirit. He is living, and He speaks; when He moves, we receive different kinds of gifts.&rdquo; Then the apostle goes on to present the manifestations of the Spirit. These do not depend on the Spirit&rsquo;s taking the initiative but on our taking the initiative. If we do not take the initiative, He has no way to be manifested, even though He is in us.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must change this wrong concept concerning the moving of the Spirit. We must not be passive and slothful in exercising our spirit. We should be diligent to rise up and exercise our spirit. The indwelling Spirit will follow us and manifest His unlimited riches and inexhaustible power.</p><h2 class="head1">BLENDING IN SPIRIT DEPENDING ON<br />
EXERCISING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Blending in spirit does not refer merely to our coming together to have exciting prayers. Rather, it refers to the need to pray with our spirit. All our dealings with God are a matter of the spirit. In order to touch God and anything of God, we must be in spirit. We must exercise our spirit so that our spirit can be enriched and strengthened. The best way to exercise our spirit is to pray. The fundamental way to blend in spirit is to pray with our spirit.</p>
<p>In the past we did not spend enough time to pray. Now we are promoting blending in spirit in order to encourage the saints&mdash;including the co-workers, the elders, and the responsible ones&mdash;to be praying persons. We need to exercise our spirit so that we can pray at any time and in any place. Even while we are walking or driving, we can still pray. This kind of praying in any place will cause us to exercise our spirit more, and our spirit will become stronger. Herein lies our real growth.</p>
<p>The secret to blending in spirit is to exercise our spirit. We should exercise our spirit individually in our daily life; also, every time we meet with the saints, we need to release our spirit to pray together. It does not matter what kind of meeting we are in or who is in the meeting, our spirit should be released. If we would all practice in this way, our meetings would be rich, and every saint would be released. Thus, our spirits would be blended and become one flow, and the river of water of life would flow among us. This is the way for death and sins to be washed away and for the riches of the Spirit to flow in. Therefore, we must be diligent to exercise our spirit until it is strong, uplifted, fresh, and living. We should use every occasion to exercise our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THOUGHTS AND WORDS<br />
BEING CRUCIAL IN OUR EXERCISE</h2>
<p>In order for our spirit to come forth effectively, our thoughts need to be properly exercised, and our speaking needs to match our thoughts. Such an exercise depends on our praying more. Prayer causes us to exercise not only our spirit but also our mind when we speak. Suppose a brother who does not often pray decides to pray. His thoughts and words may not express his burden. He will probably be able to utter a few sentences, but he will not be able to express the burden in his spirit. However, if he prayed regularly, once his spirit is exercised, his words will express the burden in his spirit. Our thoughts and words must match the burden in our spirit.</p>
<p>We must spend more time to pray regularly. On the one hand, we must exercise our spirit, and on the other hand, we must not overlook the importance of our thoughts and words. Then when we pray in the meetings, our spirit will be strong and fresh, our thoughts will be clear, and our words will be adequate. This is the way for our prayers to be rich and for the Spirit to be expressed through us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>The purpose of this fellowship concerning blending in spirit is to encourage us to pray more. Whenever we come and meet, every saint needs to open his spirit and pray. We should pray not only once but often so that our spirits are released, the Spirit is expressed, we are blended in spirit, and the whole church is full of life.</p>
<p>In order to be blended in spirit, our spirits must be released in a strong, rich, and living way. As long as the Spirit of life can flow, death and sins will be washed away because the flow of life has the function of watering and also the function of washing and cleansing. It not only supplies us with life but also washes away defects and impurities and brings in the spiritual riches. The spiritual riches in the church will increase when we allow the Spirit of life to flow freely within us.</p>
<p>In the past we did not allow the Spirit of life to flow freely in us; therefore, we suffered a great loss. It was as if we were sitting in a foul-smelling house, but we were unwilling to open the windows. Now we must open the windows and let in fresh air.</p>
<p>I hope that we will stress the flow of the Spirit of life through prayer. We should not stress the messages or other aspects of the work. May the Lord cause the churches to become praying churches, where the Spirit of life flows freely. We are not seeking the outpouring of the Spirit, nor are we seeking excitement. However, when we are blended in spirit, the outpouring of the Spirit will be brought in. In the blending we touch the unsearchable riches of Christ, and this is much more precious than momentary excitement. When we touch the fountain that flows endlessly, our spirit will be living, fresh, uplifted, and rich, even if we are not excited. May the Lord lead us to be blended in spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRAYING AND BLENDING IN SPIRIT<br />
TO FLOW OUT THE LIVING WATER</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 84:6; Joel 2:23, 28-29; Rev. 1:5-6; 5:9-10; 1 Pet. 2:5</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT COMING TO MAN IN TWO WAYS</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, the Spirit comes to man in two ways. On one hand, the Spirit enters into man to become a living spring within him; on the other hand, the Spirit comes as rain and is poured upon man outwardly. These two ways are spoken of in the New Testament. In the Old Testament God spoke of bestowing His grace on man according to these two ways. Psalm 84:6 says, &ldquo;Passing through the valley of Baca, / They make it a spring; / Indeed the early rain covers it with blessings.&rdquo; In this verse God promised those on the highway to Zion that even though they would pass through the valley of Baca, He would turn the dry land into a spring. God also promised the early rain. God&rsquo;s full blessing is a flowing spring and also rain.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the Lord Jesus spoke of the Spirit entering into the believers. He spoke of the Spirit entering into the believers to become a fountain within them (John 4:14) and also of the Spirit flowing out of the believers to become rivers of living water (7:38). When the Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost, the apostle Peter quoted the prophet Joel, who said that God would pour out His Spirit upon all flesh. This pouring out of the Spirit is likened to rain (Acts 2:16-18; Joel 2:28-29, 23). The Spirit comes to us in these two ways. Sometimes the Spirit is like a fountain within us flowing out to become rivers of living water, and sometimes the Spirit is poured out upon us as rain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD ENTERING INTO MAN TO BECOME A FOUNTAIN BEING THE NORMAL EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>The outpouring of the Spirit upon the believers is seen in the Old Testament and also in the New Testament. However, the Spirit entering into the believers to become a fountain flowing out as rivers of living water is spoken of only prophetically in the Old Testament. The actual experience of the Spirit entering into the believers can be found only in the New Testament. The last book of the Bible, Revelation, says that in the New Jerusalem there will be a river of water of life flowing out from the throne of God (22:1), but there is no mention of rain. This shows that God enters into man in order to be a fountain and to flow out as rivers of living water. He descends upon man outwardly as rain for instantaneous watering, but this is not God&rsquo;s normal relationship with man in the New Testament. God&rsquo;s normal way is to enter into man in order to become a fountain flowing out as rivers of living water.</p>
<p>In Tsinan, China, there is a spring called Baotu Spring. Water gushes forth from this spring all year round. Hence, there is no shortage of water in Tsinan.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the fountain in Jericho had bad water, but Elisha healed the water (2 Kings 2:19-22). Today the ancient city of Jericho is buried under the earth, but the fountain is still there, and the people who live nearby drink of its water. The water that flows from this fountain is stored in a cistern. Regardless of how many people draw water, the amount of water in the cistern is never reduced. This fountain also supplies drinking water to the people in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The plain of Jericho is approximately three hundred meters below sea level, and its climate is dry and hot. It is a barren land, but wherever the water from the fountain flows, there are palm trees, banana trees, and other fruit trees. These plants do not depend on the rain but on the water from the fountain. The supply from the fountain is more dependable than the supply from rain.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s way of entering into man in order to be a regular supply is more important than His coming upon man outwardly as power. Since we have God in us as the living water of life, we do not have a great need for Him to come to us as rain. The fountain that is flowing within us is sufficient to meet our every need.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago the Pentecostal movement was prevailing in northern China. At that time, I was still young. I attended their meetings and saw their situation. The work of the Holy Spirit was as strong as a thunderstorm. A thunderstorm can be violent with extreme force, but it may not provide us with drinking water. In contrast, when it rains lightly all day long, a large amount of water is absorbed into the soil. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit that we saw in the Pentecostal movement thirty years ago in northern China was like a thunderstorm. After a short period of time, the rainwater dried up, and there was very little result.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE</h2>
<p>We have learned lessons related to the Spirit, and we have studied what the Word of God says concerning the Spirit. The normal way that God comes to man is not as a thunderstorm. Rather, He enters into man in order to be a fountain of living water, and He flows out of man as rivers of living water. John 1 says that the Word was in the beginning, that the Word was God, and that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (vv. 1, 14). Chapter 4 says that the Lord is living water and that whoever drinks of the water that He gives will not thirst forever, for this water will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life (vv. 10, 14). In chapter 7 the Lord said that rivers of living water will flow out of those who believe into Him (v. 38). In verse 39 John goes on to explain, &ldquo;This He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive.&rdquo; This means that the living water in chapter 4 is the Spirit in chapter 7.</p>
<p>There is a clear type of the living water in the Old Testament. When the children of Israel thirsted in the wilderness, God told Moses to strike the rock so that living water would flow out of the cleft rock to quench the thirst of the children of Israel (Exo. 17:6). The living water was not poured on them; rather, they drank the water and took it into them. First Corinthians 10:4 says, &ldquo;The rock was Christ.&rdquo; The water that flowed out of the rock typifies the Spirit.</p>
<p>In Revelation the water of life is spoken of at least three times. Verse 17 of chapter 7 says that the Lamb will shepherd and guide the believers to springs of waters of life, verse 6 of chapter 21 says that he who thirsts will be given to drink from the spring of the water of life freely, and verse 1 of chapter 22 says that a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. The book of Revelation was written by John, and its concept and thought are a continuation of his Gospel. John&rsquo;s Gospel says that in order to be man&rsquo;s life, God was manifested not only as food for man to eat (6:35) but also as living water that flows into man to become a spring and flows out of man as rivers (4:14; 7:38). In Revelation John speaks of a river of water of life flowing out from God and of the tree of life growing on both sides of the river. The tree of life signifies the Lord Jesus as our bread of life, and the river of water of life signifies the Spirit flowing into us as the living water of life. According to this picture, the flowing of the Spirit brings Christ to us as bread, our life supply. This is Christ with the Spirit growing in us, and this is also the Spirit bringing Christ into us to be our life supply.</p>
<p>The entire Bible concludes with the holy city, New Jerusalem, with the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne and the tree of life growing on both sides of the river. The essence of the Bible is that there is a throne out of which flows the river of life with the tree of life growing along the river. This is God flowing out. The Spirit uses this picture in a symbolic way of writing in order to conclude the entire Bible. The Bible is concerned with God&rsquo;s flowing out in order to enter into man in the way of life. He is man&rsquo;s food and He is living water for man to eat, drink, and enjoy so that man can be mingled with Him as one.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John says that the Word was in the beginning, and the Word was God (1:1). God who is the Word became flesh (v. 14) in order to be the bread of life to man (6:35) and to flow out of man as the living water of life, which signifies the Spirit (7:38-39). God came as the Son to be the bread of life and then as the Spirit to be the living water of life. This is the river of life and the tree of life in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Whatever the Gospel of John says concerning the Lord Jesus&mdash;such as His being the light, the way, the reality, and the life&mdash;can all be seen in the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem He is light, life, reality, and everything.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John also says that the Lord Jesus, the Word who became flesh, is the Lamb of God and the Bridegroom who will take the bride (1:29; 3:29). Revelation says that the New Jerusalem is the bride and that the Bridegroom is the Lamb, Christ (19:7; 21:2, 9). All the crucial items in the Gospel of John are also in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>If we consider the Gospel of John, we will see that not one item in it is excluded from the New Jerusalem. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I and the Father are one&rdquo; (10:30). This means that He and the Father are inseparable. In the New Jerusalem God and the Lamb are also one and inseparable (Rev. 21:23; 22:1). The crucial points of the entire Bible, including the Gospel of John, are found in the New Jerusalem. The focus of the holy city, New Jerusalem, is the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne and the tree of life growing on both sides of the river (Rev. 22:1-2). This is a picture of God flowing out of the throne of grace in two steps: first, in the Son to be the bread of life to man and, second, in the Spirit to be the living water of life to man. The believers who allow God to flow through them will eventually become the building materials of gold, pearls, and precious stones and will be built up together to be the New Jerusalem, the dwelling place of God mingled with man (21:18-21). Conversely, the people who would not allow God to enter into them will end up in the lake of fire and will perish forever (20:15).</p>
<p>We need a clear view of this picture. May the Lord open our eyes to see that God has flowed out as the Son and has flowed into us as the Spirit to become the spring of living water to us. If our condition is normal, we will not need the outpouring of the Spirit, because the spring in us is more vigorous than the spring in Tsinan or the spring in Jericho. As long as we let Him flow freely within us, He will flow out of us as rivers of water of life.</p>
<p>We are not against the outpouring of the Spirit. Many children of God need the outpouring. They have fallen into a particular situation that requires that they be delivered by God in an extraordinary way. However, the normal situation of a believer is to live in God and to have God as the spring of living water flowing out as rivers of living water. If this is our situation, we will not depend on the outpouring of the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYING AND BLENDING IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>God is a fountain within us, but we have not dug deeply enough for the living water to spring forth. We have not been taught sufficiently to exercise our spirit. Just as our mind needs to be trained in order for us to function, our spirit also needs to be trained.</p>
<p>Although the immeasurable Spirit is in our spirit, we do not apply Him. We are saved, and our spirit has been enlivened, but we are not accustomed to exercising our spirit. We like to engage in physical and mental activities, but we do not enjoy exercising our spirit. We are like children who enjoy playing but do not like to study. Many saints do not like to exercise their spirit. They like to clean the meeting hall and even to attend conferences or Bible studies, but they do not like to be calm in order to touch, exercise, and release their spirit. Since we began fellowshipping concerning blending in spirit, some saints have stopped coming to the meetings. In the past they attended meetings in order to hear a message, but now those who come to the meetings must pray and blend in spirit. Hence, the saints who are not accustomed to exercising their spirit feel uncomfortable in the meetings.</p>
<p>The saints feel uncomfortable because they do not like to exercise their spirit. We like to do things and listen to messages, but we do not like to exercise our spirit. May the Lord be merciful to us and revolutionize our concept so that we would pay attention to blending in spirit by prayer. This kind of prayer is to dig the well. When we dig deeply enough, the Spirit as the living water will spontaneously flow out.</p>
<p>To blend in spirit is to exercise and release one&rsquo;s spirit in prayer with others. Every believer has been enlivened in his spirit, and the Spirit of God dwells in his spirit. Hence, we need to exercise our spirit. We should not be persons who only like activities that involve our body and our soul. We should exercise our spirit in all that we do. Moreover, our spirit should blend with the spirit of the other saints in our activities and in prayer. Blending in spirit is not momentary or seasonal; it is continual.</p>
<p>While the children of Israel journeyed through the wilderness, they came to a place called Beer, where there was no water for drinking. So they used the scepter and staffs to dig the well while they sang, &ldquo;Spring up, O well!&rdquo; (Num. 21:16-18). Our blending in spirit by praying is our digging the well so that our spirit can flow forth with living water. In order to build the church, our spirit must be living and strong. Whether or not the church can be built up depends on how much we are blended in spirit.</p>
<p>Although we received this light several years ago and saw the need for the spirit of the saints to be strong, we did not see its importance as clearly as we do today. In order for the church to be built, the church must be a priesthood. The priests are a group of people who burn the incense by praying in spirit. The focus of their function is not the bronze altar with the offerings but their entering into the Holy Place to light the lamps and to burn incense at the incense altar. Lighting the lamps signifies reading the Word, and burning the incense signifies praying. Every time we fellowship with God, we need to light the lamps and burn the incense. In other words, we need to read the Word and pray.</p>
<p>When we pray, we let the Spirit pass through us. The Spirit cannot flow through a person who never prays. The Spirit can flow in us and out of us only through our prayer. It does not matter how many messages we have heard; if we do not turn the messages into prayer, they will not have any effect on us. The same applies to our reading the Bible. If we read the Bible without praying, the words in the Bible will merely be letters related to knowledge, which will remain in our mind and will not become the bread of life, the light of life, and the Spirit of life to be the supply in our spirit. Hence, in addition to listening to messages and reading the Bible, we must pray.</p>
<p>The desolation of the church is due to a lack of prayer. Before the children of Israel became desolate, the prophethood was not manifest. Moses was a prophet, but his primary function was to represent God as His deputy among the people of Israel. Aaron&rsquo;s function was to serve as a priest to God. At the time of David and when Solomon built the temple, there were kings and priests ministering before God.</p>
<p>Later, the condition of the Israelites deteriorated to the point that during the reign of King Ahab, there were idols in their midst. In 1 Kings 18 and 19, the kings were improper, and the priests were nowhere to be found. However, the prophets, such as Elijah and Elisha, were prominent. In degraded Christianity the believers are not exercising God&rsquo;s authority as kings, nor are they ministering to God as priests. Instead, there are pastors giving sermons; in other words, only a few serve as prophets. Even our situation has degraded to the point of the churches depending on the ministers of the word. The meetings consist mainly of ones giving messages and of others listening to messages; very few saints pray as priests.</p>
<p>I am burdened that the Lord would balance us so that we would pay as much attention to prayer as we do to listening to messages. Otherwise, the messages that we hear will remain in our mind. We must see that God&rsquo;s intention is for every believer to be a priest. The church has fallen to the extent that only a few minister as priests. We must recover the prayer of the priests so that the church can be built up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING BY EXERCISING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The saints must pay attention to the service of the priests and rise up to minister to God. To minister in this way is to exercise our spirit to pray so that our spirit and the Spirit are mingled as one. Then God can flow through us and be transmitted through us to supply others. There has been a great deal of blending in spirit among the co-workers and the leading ones. I hope that this blending will be strengthened. It must not be seasonal. This requires us to exercise and practice daily. The more our spirit is exercised, the stronger, richer, and fresher it will be, and the more we will be able to enliven the saints.</p>
<p>I hope that the leading ones will endeavor to lead the group meetings to practice blending in spirit. Then the leading ones can stir up the rest of the saints to blend in spirit. If we exercise and practice according to what the Lord has shown us, the saints will be uplifted and living, the priesthood will be manifested among us, and we will be blended in spirit and built together to be the dwelling place of God in spirit. This is the miniature expression of the New Jerusalem on the earth today. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRAYING IN SPIRIT AND<br />
DROPPING FORMALITIES AND REGULATIONS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 2:41-42; 4:23-31; 12:5, 12</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH BEING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The above verses from Acts show that the early church was a praying church. The believers did not have a fixed place or time for their meetings, nor did they adhere to any form. When they came together, they simply prayed and served the Lord in spirit.</p>
<p>In order for the church to be built up, it is necessary for every saint, especially those who bear the burden in various services, to enter into the Holy of Holies and carry out their priestly service, that is, to pray in their spirit. Only by praying in our spirit can we become living stones that are being built together. The living stones spoken of in 1 Peter 2:5 refer to regenerated believers; hence, this is a matter in the spirit.</p>
<p>The only way to be enlivened is to turn to our spirit, where the Holy of Holies is, and pray according to the sense in our spirit. Whichever part of our being that we exercise the most will become our strongest part, and its function will be manifested. In order for our spirit to be strong, it needs to be exercised.</p>
<p>We have been saved, our spirit has been enlivened, and the Spirit of God is dwelling in our spirit. These are facts. However, it is still possible for our spirit to be weak. If a brother does not live according to his spirit but instead conducts himself according to the needs of his body and his soul, his spirit will become weak. Then those who contact him will discover that he does not exercise his spirit in his dealings and conversations with others, nor does he exercise his spirit when he reads the Bible, fellowships, or prays.</p>
<p>No matter how meek or amiable such a brother might be, he cannot be built into the church. The only way to be built into the church is to learn to live in the spirit. In order to build a concrete house, we must mix cement with water and then add stones into the cement. No matter how beautiful or how smooth the stones may be, without a mixture of cement and water, there would not be a way for the stones to be joined together. Likewise, in order for the saints to be fitly joined and knit together, they must live in the spirit.</p>
<p>Concerning our being built up as a spiritual house, 1 Peter says that we are both living stones and a royal priesthood (2:5, 9). If we would be built together, we must be living stones as well as ministering priests. To be ministering priests means that we constantly exercise our spirit and live under the control and ruling of the spirit. When every saint lives in the spirit, we will be built together in spirit.</p>
<p>Every believer possesses not merely a human spirit but a mingled spirit, which is the mingling of the divine Spirit and the human spirit. Therefore, to live in spirit is to live not only in our human spirit but also in the divine Spirit. When we release our spirit in prayer, we do not merely release our human spirit; we also release the Spirit of God, who is mingled with our spirit. If all the saints were in such a spirit, we would spontaneously be coordinated, being fitly joined and knit together, and the church would be built up.</p>
<p>After we released the messages on building the church, we spent a long period of time seeking the Lord and touching His feeling concerning the practical way to build the church. The genuine way to build the church is for the saints to live in spirit and to release the spirit. The serving ones must learn to serve God in spirit. When our spirit is released, we will be blended together to become one spirit. We will also be joined and knit together in one spirit. This knitting together is not an organization in a community; it is the saints being blended as one in the mingled spirit. This blending is genuine building.</p>
<p>We hope that all the saints will be living stones that are built together and also priests who serve together by contacting God in the Holy of Holies, the mingled spirit. Only when we are in our mingled spirit, the divine Spirit mingled with our human spirit, can we be built together with other saints. There is no other way to be built together.</p>
<p>We have seen the vision, but we do not release our spirit enough; we do not spend enough time living in the Holy of Holies, within the veil. In other words, we do not spend enough time to pray in our spirit. This word is especially needed by the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones who take the lead. When we come together, we do not spend enough time to pray in spirit, our spirit is not released, and we are short of blending in spirit. Hence, we need to stress this matter. We cannot take care of the saints in a general way. As those who take the lead in the churches, we must go before the Lord and consider how much time we spend in the spirit. I am not encouraging self-analysis, which is useless. But I am asking whether our spirit is uplifted and released when we meet with the saints. We need to consider this matter seriously. If we are willing to be enlightened by the Lord, we will confess that our spirit is not strong enough.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYING INDIVIDUALLY</h2>
<p>We must spend more time to exercise our spirit in individual prayer. We must learn and practice this even when we are very busy. The brothers should exercise their spirit both when they are on their way to work and while they are at work. The sisters should exercise their spirit while they are doing their chores at home and while they are buying groceries. This is our urgent need. If we cannot learn to exercise our spirit, the Lord will not gain a way to build His church among us.</p>
<p>The Lord has achieved much among us. In Taipei alone, there are over two hundred elders, co-workers, and responsible ones. We must admit that we have a considerable amount of building material. However, this material has not been sufficiently blended in spirit. We are not able to meet the Lord&rsquo;s requirement or afford Him a way to spread, because our spirit is still not strong or living. We need to focus on exercising our spirit when we pray individually.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING FORMALITIES AND REGULATIONS</h2>
<p>We must also consider the condition of our meetings. Christian meetings in both Catholicism and Protestantism have fallen into rituals and regulations. According to Acts, the early saints did not have forms, rituals, or regulations when they met together. They met and served in spirit. They did not meet on a fixed date or at a fixed time. It seems as if they were always meeting. When the apostles Peter and John were released from prison in chapter 4, they went immediately to their own people (v. 23) and had a meeting. On another occasion, after the apostle Peter was released from prison, &ldquo;he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, who was surnamed Mark, where there was a considerable number assembled together and praying&rdquo; (12:12). We should not think that this was the only group of saints who assembled together and prayed. We should believe that many other groups of saints were assembled together in other places. Their meetings were not bound by time, date, or place, nor did they have rituals or regulations.</p>
<p>The situation in Christianity, however, has degraded. Catholicism and Protestantism have fallen into rituals and rules. We have to admit that we too have been affected by Christianity. Unconsciously, our meetings have fallen into rituals and regulations.</p>
<p>We must consider the condition of our meetings. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day there is a message in the morning, and we break bread in the evening; the prayer meeting is Tuesday evening, and there is another message meeting on Thursday evening. We know that these meetings are on fixed days and are conducted in a particular way. The new believers might feel that the meetings are fresh and rich in supply, but the saints who have been meeting for five to ten years feel that the meetings are wearisome and even burdensome. If a meeting is scheduled to begin at seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, these saints will arrive at half past seven. On the way to the meeting they talk freely with their companions, but once they step into the meeting hall, their spirit is closed, and their whole being is locked. It seems as though they have made up their mind not to open their mouth in the meeting. Everyone knows the procedure for the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting. First, the brother who accompanies the speaker to the podium selects a hymn for the saints to sing. After the congregation sings, he offers a prayer. After the prayer, the speaker reads the Scriptures and then gives a message. After the message, there are announcements, and then the meeting is dismissed. At this point everyone can relax.</p>
<p>Can we expect the saints who attend such meetings to take the initiative to exercise their spirit? We admit that some saints are able to meditate and fellowship with the Lord in spirit, but only a few saints practice this. However, even if all the saints practiced this, their spirit would still not be sufficiently released. We simply cannot believe that this was the situation of the early church.</p>
<p>A situation that does not involve the release of the spirit is abnormal and improper. In a normal situation, every child of God should use his spirit, exercise his spirit, and fellowship with the Lord in spirit. Furthermore, when there is the opportunity, he should gather other saints together, not to gossip but to pray in spirit, read the Scriptures, fellowship, and exhort one another or to preach the gospel to their relatives and friends. If it is inconvenient to meet in their homes, they can go to a nearby meeting hall. They should not be bound by time, location, or formalities. The ministry of the word should also be done in a flexible way. When there is a burden, the brothers can give a message, just as the saints did in Acts 20. On the first day of the week, while the saints were gathered together to break bread, the apostle Paul rose up and gave an extended message (v. 7). This shows that their meeting did not have a set time to begin or to end.</p>
<p>In order for the Spirit to have a free course among us, we must learn to exercise our spirit in private prayer, and our meetings must break away from formalities and regulations, not being bound by time, place, or form. The church in Taipei has thirty-five districts. When it is convenient, the saints should gather in the nearest district for prayer and fellowship. The saints should be able to meet at any time, from morning to evening, in the meeting hall seven days a week in order to pray, read the Word, sing hymns, fellowship, and preach the gospel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we need to be flexible. It is not necessary for everyone who comes to the meeting hall to do the same thing. Perhaps three or five saints would pray and sing in one corner, while seven or eight saints would read the Bible and fellowship in another corner. Perhaps in still another corner some saints would fellowship concerning preaching the gospel to their schoolmates, relatives, or friends. This means that the saints are exercising their spirit to serve God in whatever they do.</p>
<p>Our meetings must have a radical change. In the past, the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning message meeting began at ten o&rsquo;clock. A brother would release a message, then everyone would pray silently, and the meeting would be dismissed. This meeting does not have to begin at ten o&rsquo;clock. Early in the morning some saints can come to the meeting hall to pray in groups, and other saints might come to clean the hall. Some saints might remain in the hall until it is time for the message, but others might leave to take care of personal matters and then return later for the message. Then at around ten o&rsquo;clock all the groups of saints can stop what they are doing and listen to the message. After the message there is no need to dismiss the meeting, because some saints might remain in the meeting hall to pray and have thorough fellowship.</p>
<p>Likewise, the bread-breaking meeting does not have to begin at seven-thirty in the evening, because we spend only about forty-five minutes to remember the Lord and worship the Father. Some of the brothers who are in the military service might come to the meeting hall by five-thirty and pray, read the Word, and praise. A group of sisters might come after six o&rsquo;clock. Most of the saints should arrive by seven o&rsquo;clock and form groups to pray, sing hymns, read the Word, or fellowship with one another. As a result, everyone will be released and living, and they will be able to focus on remembering the Lord and worshipping the Father. The praise in such a meeting will be fresh and uplifted.</p>
<p>The prayer meeting on Tuesday should not be bound by time or form. If necessary, the leading brothers should fellowship concerning some of the items for prayer so that the saints can pray concerning these items in their group meetings. The meeting on Thursday should be conducted in the same way as the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting. A brother should spend about forty minutes to release the Lord&rsquo;s word, but the saints do not need to arrive or leave at a specific time.</p>
<p>The saints should not be bound by time or formalities; they need only to serve the Lord in spirit. The way we serve may vary every week; it all depends on the move of the Spirit. Some saints may feel to &ldquo;burn the incense&rdquo; through prayer, others may feel to &ldquo;light the lamps&rdquo; by reading the Scriptures, and still others may feel to sing and praise. Some saints might bring unbelieving relatives, friends, or schoolmates, and other saints might preach the gospel to them. This is the way for us to break away from formalities and regulations in our meetings. The building of the church is without formalities; it depends on our using and exercising our spirit in our daily living so that we can serve and coordinate with others with a living spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>May the Lord grant us to not merely have a change in method. If the saints are enlivened, they will not be limited by time or methods when they pray, sing hymns, read the Bible, or minister the word.</p>
<p>May we all bring this matter to the Lord in prayer. May the Lord have mercy on us and deliver us from the rituals and regulations of worship in Christianity. Then His church can be built up in spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">TURNING FROM EMPHASIZING THE WORD<br />
TO EMPHASIZING THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:63; Eph. 5:18-20; Col. 3:16-17; 2 Cor. 3:17-18; Acts 6:4</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the supply of the Spirit. We have fellowshipped concerning blending in spirit, releasing the spirit, serving with the spirit, and praying in spirit, but we still do not have much knowledge concerning the supply of the Spirit. Therefore, in this chapter we will fellowship concerning the supply of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO MEANS OF SUPPLY&mdash;THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The church receives the supply from the Spirit and from the Word. In times of degradation the church loses the Spirit and the Word of God. In Christianity there are organizations and activities, but there is no Spirit. Sermons are preached, but the supply of God&rsquo;s Word is lacking. Christian meetings have many activities, including singing, praying, preaching, and giving reports, but they lack the Spirit and the Word of God. Since these two means of supply are lacking, the church has become poor and weak and therefore has many problems. This is a clear indication of degradation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE WORD</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s work of recovery in the church begins with the recovery of the Word. This is the principle not only in the New Testament age but also in the Old Testament age. For instance, at the expiration of the seventy years of the captivity of the people of Israel in Babylon, God brought them back to their fathers&rsquo; land and raised up the priest Ezra to read the book of the law (Neh. 8). This was to restore the words of God and present them to His people. Once the people of Israel received and understood the words of God, they were recovered. Likewise, during the Reformation, Martin Luther was raised up by the Lord for the work of recovery. He recovered primarily the truth of justification by faith, and he unlocked the Bible. Previously, only members of the clergy could read the Bible; common people were not allowed to do so. After Martin Luther began the recovery of God&rsquo;s Word, the church began to receive the supply.</p>
<p>God has continued the work of recovery in the church. Whenever there is a recovery, it almost always begins with the Word. Over thirty years ago He began the work of recovery among us in the Far East through our brother, Watchman Nee. This work also began with the recovery of the Word. The Lord gave our brother an immeasurable amount of light from the Word. Those who witnessed this matter and were in the flow of that recovery all felt that the Lord&rsquo;s words released through Brother Nee were immeasurably rich and powerful. He was used by God to carry out a great part of the recovery of the Word in China. This was God&rsquo;s great grace to the church.</p>
<p>The most obvious example in the history of recovery is what began in 1828 among the so-called Brethren in England. The most evident and most powerful aspect of the recovery among the Brethren was also the Word of God. It is not too much to say that Martin Luther gave the church an unlocked Bible, and the Brethren gave the church an opened and interpreted Bible. After Martin Luther the Bible was no longer locked, but as far as light was concerned, it was a closed book, and few believers were able to interpret it. It was not until the Brethren were raised up, in particular J. N. Darby, that the Bible became an opened and interpreted book. Theologians acknowledge that the orthodox doctrines taught in Christianity are based on the light released by the Brethren. Orthodox theology has also been influenced by Dr. C. I. Scofield. However, he did not discover the truths himself. He taught the truth, but nearly everything he taught was discovered by the Brethren. The Brethren recovered the Word of God and enabled the church to receive an enormous supply. To this day we are influenced by the light that the Brethren received.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE WORD BEING<br />
FOR CORRECTION AND ENLIGHTENMENT</h2>
<p>The supply of the church lies not only in the Word but also in the Spirit. Strictly speaking, the supply of the church should come from the Spirit and then the Word; this is the proper sequence. However, in His work of recovery God always recovers the Word, and then the Spirit confirms the Word because God must first open man&rsquo;s understanding. When there is degradation and deviation, the Word is needed for explanation, instruction, enlightenment, and the correction of man&rsquo;s views and concepts (2 Tim. 3:16).</p>
<p>Our spirit is the deepest part of our being. If our thoughts and concepts are not changed, our spirit will be frustrated. There must first be a change in the parts that surround our spirit, particularly our mind with our thoughts and concepts. In His work of recovery, God first releases light, revelation, and visions through His Word to His children so that their concepts may be changed, their understanding may be opened, and their spirit can turn to God. Only at such a time will the Spirit of God be able to work freely in their spirit. God first recovers the Word, and then the Spirit works to confirm the Word.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s work of recovery, the Word functions to instruct, correct, and supply. The supply also depends on the Spirit. In the New Testament the Word, the Spirit, and the Lord are one. In John 6:63 the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; This verse shows that there is a relationship between the words of the Lord and the Spirit. From our fellowship it might seem as though the Lord&rsquo;s words and the Spirit are not related. However, the Lord&rsquo;s words are related to the Spirit because He is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; This shows us that the Lord is the Spirit. Furthermore, John 1:1 says, &ldquo;The Word was God.&rdquo; Thus, the Lord is also the Word. The Lord is the Word, the Lord is the Spirit, and His words are the embodiment of the Spirit. If the Lord&rsquo;s words pass through us in a proper way, they are of the Lord, and they are also of the Spirit. Therefore, if the words that we release in the church are of God, they convey not only His utterance but also God Himself as the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Epistles to the Ephesians and to the Colossians provide a further basis for saying that the Word and the Spirit are one. Ephesians and Colossians have many parallel portions. For example, both Epistles speak of praising the Lord with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs (Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16). However, there is a slight difference. Ephesians speaks of praising the Lord with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs because we are filled in spirit. We must be filled with the Spirit of the Lord in our spirit in order to praise the Lord with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Colossians speaks of praising the Lord with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs because we are filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word. Both Epistles speak of praising the Lord, but one says that our praising is the result of being filled with the Spirit, and the other says that it is the result of being filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word. This shows that the Lord&rsquo;s words are the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BRETHREN</h2>
<p>The ministry of the word should convey the Spirit. However, sometimes the ministry of the word falls into a situation in which mere words are uttered, without the Spirit. Then the ministry of the word is no longer the utterance of the Lord, because it does not contain His element. This condition speaks of the church&rsquo;s degradation. Around 1827 the Brethren were raised up, and they recovered many items related to the Word. For about fifty years after 1828 numerous ministers of the Word were raised up among the Brethren. Those who were raised up include J. N. Darby; C. H. Mackintosh, author of <em>Notes on the Pentateuch;</em> F. W. Grant, author of <em>The Numerical Bible;</em> James Taylor Jr.; and B. W. Newton. They were great ministers of the Word. Through them the Word of God was released like sea billows rolling upon the shore.</p>
<p>The release of the Word through the Brethren was like waves of the truth surging into the church. The words they spoke were living and full of the Spirit. Regrettably, in the second half of the nineteenth century the Brethren fell into division and lost the Spirit. Now most of their groups have fallen into doctrines and letters; they are short of the Spirit. They lack the fresh and living condition that they possessed in the beginning.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PENTECOSTAL MOVEMENT</h2>
<p>For a period of eighty to ninety years, beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century, God raised up the Pentecostal movement as a reaction to the deadened situation among the Brethren. The believers in the Pentecostal movement did not focus on the Word or on its interpretation. They focused on being filled with the Holy Spirit, that is, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. They sang spiritual songs and spoke in tongues. The believers in the Pentecostal movement reacted to the deadened situation among the Brethren to the extent that they abandoned all regulations. In some places they even broke the norms of human behavior.</p>
<p>At the peak of the Pentecostal movement, there were three major groups: the jumpers, the laughers, and the rollers. These terms sound funny, but they were actually the three major groups of the Pentecostal movement. I had the occasion to attend their meetings and observe their situation. The jumpers did not jump in an ordinary manner; they jumped high above the ground. Their behavior seemed funny, but they were quite serious. The laughers laughed loudly, and the rollers rolled on the floor. In those days an elderly sister among us was affected by the Pentecostal movement. She would always roll when she received the outpouring of the Spirit. Consequently, when she knelt down to pray at home, her servant would immediately move the furniture in order to give her enough space in which to roll.</p>
<p>Such stories sound peculiar, but it is undeniable that the Pentecostal movement was raised up by God, because crowds of people were brought to salvation through them. Those who had been indifferent to the Lord gave up everything for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. We must not condemn the Pentecostal movement too harshly. We can only say that it was truly a reaction from God.</p>
<p>The Brethren and the Pentecostal movement are illustrations of God&rsquo;s work. He must supply His church with the Word as well as with the Spirit. The normal condition of the church should be that the ministry of the word is full of the Spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s words are the Spirit, and the Lord is the Spirit; moreover, the Word is the Lord. The Lord, the Spirit, and the Word are inseparable. When the church is in an abnormal condition, the ministry of the word is no longer with the Spirit. Rather, the ministry of the word becomes dead letters. At such a time God has to raise up a group of people to focus on the Spirit as a reaction to the deadened condition of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S RECOVERY IN THE FAR EAST</h2>
<p>Let us now consider the history of the recovery in the Far East. We are also a part of God&rsquo;s work of recovery. During the past thirty to forty years, the focus of this work has been the Word. I believe that the Lord would allow us to say that since the time Christianity was brought to the Far East two hundred years ago, the Word of God has not been released as it has been released among us. Not only so, in certain aspects we have excelled beyond Western Christianity. In relation to the work, the churches that have been raised up in the localities are the fruit of the Word. The co-workers, elders, deacons, and those bearing responsibility in the churches are also the product of the Word. In brief, we have been built up by the Word. Many saints were saved and raised up in the last ten years. The work and the churches in Taiwan were built up by the Word. By our preaching and releasing God&rsquo;s Word and by our reading and studying His Word, not only have the work and the churches been raised up, but co-workers and various responsible ones have been produced. Everything has been brought forth through the Word of God. Hence, we say that we are built up by the Word.</p>
<p>Not only so, the words that God has given us are full of the Spirit and contain the riches of the Spirit. Brother Nee is a good example. He was raised up by the Lord, and those who listened to his messages sensed the presence of the Spirit. When he gave a message, he would speak for one and a half hours, but those listening sensed the flowing out of living water. No one could deny that his words were of the Spirit. That was the situation among us in the beginning.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DANGER OF HAVING ONLY THE WORD</h2>
<p>However, we must be careful. If we emphasize only the Word, after an extended period of time we will not have much of the Spirit. Initially, the ministry of the word can be full of the Spirit, but gradually the Spirit will be lost, until the words we speak no longer convey the Spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery begins with the Word, but we cannot stop with the ministry of the word. The Spirit must match the Word. The supply in the church depends on the Word as well as on the Spirit. In a normal condition the supply from the Word is the supply of the Spirit. If we have the Word but neglect the Spirit, the words we utter will not convey the Spirit, and we will be left with dead letters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EMPHASIZING THE SPIRIT MORE</h2>
<p>We need to know the distinction between the supply of the Word and the supply of the Spirit. It is a mistake to depend merely on the ministry of the word or to lean heavily on the supply of the Word. We must rely on the Word as well as the Spirit. If we must emphasis something, it is better to emphasize the Spirit.</p>
<p>In Acts 6:4 the apostles said, &ldquo;We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.&rdquo; Prayer is mentioned before the ministry of the word. Prayer is related to the supply of the Spirit, and the ministry of the word is related to the supply of the Word. This verse shows the sequence of these two matters. In Acts the apostles emphasized prayer; they prayed first. In their move, the Spirit was first and then the ministry of the word followed. Prior to Pentecost the apostles did not preach the word; rather, they prayed for ten days (1:13-15). Undoubtedly, their prayers were of a priestly nature with the release of the spirit; that is, they prayed by blending in spirit. They did not pray in the mind or according to regulations. The apostles prayed in spirit, in the Holy of Holies. We should believe that their times of prayer were not unplanned; rather, they would have prayed at scheduled times, ministering in the presence of God, just as the priests in the Old Testament ministered to God day and night, according to their course. Moreover, their prayers should not have been individual prayers but corporate prayers; about a hundred and twenty disciples prayed as one entity. The prayers of the disciples in the ten days prior to the day of Pentecost were the fulfillment of the burning of incense by the Old Testament priests when they ministered to God. The issue of such prayers was the pouring out of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit came first, and then Peter stood up to release the word. Acts was a new beginning; it was not a recovery. Thus, this example shows that the Spirit is first and is followed by the Word. During the time of recovery, the desolate situation requires that people&rsquo;s concepts be corrected and that their understanding be opened. Hence, God recovers first with the Word and then with the Spirit.</p>
<p>Even though I am busy working, I often go before the Lord to consider and observe these matters. The more I observe, the clearer I become. The recovery of the Word is not lacking among us, but we lack the supply of the Spirit. It does not match the supply of the ministry of the word; hence, the supply of the Word has diminished. We have more of the Word and less of the Spirit. There is an insufficient flow of the water of life and an inadequate blending in spirit. This is our condition. We must see that God works first through the Spirit and then through the Word. Although the Word is first in the work of recovery, the Word must be followed by the Spirit. The Word is for initiating and opening, but it must be followed immediately by the Spirit. This is the proper way.</p>
<p>We must humbly admit that we still do not have sufficient knowledge of the Word of God. Not to mention the intrinsic significance, many portions of the Bible are still beyond our grasp. Furthermore, there is a great amount of light that has yet to be released from the portions that God has given us understanding. However, we still have more of the Word and less of the Spirit. We are like bakers who have plenty of flour but who are short of water and oil. We do not despise the flour, because without flour we cannot make bread or pasta. However, without water and oil, we still cannot make bread and pasta.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SERVING ONES<br />
NEEDING TO INTENSIFY THE EXERCISE<br />
OF THE SPIRIT BY PRAYER</h2>
<p>We need to have a change of concept. We cannot merely read the Word, listen to messages, attend meetings, and read spiritual publications; we must also pray. We have paid much more attention to the aspect of the Word. It is true that our spiritual knowledge has increased, but we must consider the condition of our spirit. We have to confess that our spirit is not strong. Our spiritual knowledge surpasses the condition of our spirit. We understand spiritual principles, and we are able to express them, but we do not exercise our spirit; hence, it is not strong. Our concept has not yet turned from the Word to the Spirit. When we meet, we still depend on the ministry of the word, but we do not pay adequate attention to the supply of the Spirit.</p>
<p>We must have the Word and the Spirit. Without the Spirit, the Word is empty. If we have merely the Word without the element of the Spirit, the Word will become dead letter (2 Cor. 3:6). It is possible for us to have an increase in spiritual principles, spiritual doctrines, and spiritual knowledge and at the same time become weaker in our spirit. We must rise up and make up for our lack in the Spirit. This is not a matter of listening to messages, understanding messages, or reading the Bible. It is a matter of our spirit being strong. We must exercise our spirit more.</p>
<p>In order to experience the Lord, it is necessary to have spiritual knowledge, but it is even more necessary to exercise the spirit. Our touching and experiencing the Lord and our enjoying His riches depend on our exercising and using our spirit. There is a strong burden within me that we would have a change in concept so that we would depend more on the Spirit than on the Word; in the meetings we should supply the saints with the Spirit more than with the Word. This requires all the serving ones, including elders, co-workers, and responsible ones, to regularly exercise their spirit. We should not excuse ourselves. We must rise up to exercise our spirit. We must learn to exercise our spirit by prayer. We should pray not only in the meetings but also in private.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING TO PRAY IN THE MIDST<br />
OF A BUSY SCHEDULE</h2>
<p>Some responsible ones may say that they are too busy to pray. We will always be entangled with numerous trivial things because we live in the world. However, the Lord has arranged our environment for us so that we may learn to pray even when we are very busy. Such prayers are weighty and valuable.</p>
<p>Many Christians are idealistic; they think that they should be able to drop everything and find a very quiet place in order to draw near to the Lord in prayer and fellowship. Even if there were such an environment for us to pray, that kind of prayer may not be very valuable. We offer genuine prayers when we are in the battlefield; genuine prayers are spiritual battles. In the battlefield there is no extravagance. Soldiers are always in a rush. Even when they eat, they eat with one hand and hold their weapon with the other (cf. Neh. 4:17). This is the situation in the battlefield. Those with spiritual knowledge realize that this is also the environment for genuine prayers. When we are entangled with our children and domestic affairs, when our businesses are not doing well, or when we need to hurry to work every day, we do not have time to pray. Yet our prayers under such circumstances are genuine.</p>
<p>We should not think that we can pray only when we are in an undisturbed environment in which we can kneel down and pray for an hour without any interruptions. We do not despise such prayers, but according to our experience, many good prayers are in fragments: &ldquo;Here a little, there a little&rdquo; (Isa. 28:10). While we are praying, the doorbell might ring, the phone might ring, or our children might need urgent care. While we are praying, many things happen. It seems as though we do not even have the time to say, &ldquo;I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus, Amen!&rdquo; We need to be trained to pray in fragments; we need to be able to exercise our spirit in prayer in the midst of a busy schedule.</p>
<p>In this age many things compete for our time. We need to strive at school and strive at work; otherwise, we will be eliminated. Likewise, we need to be aggressive to seize the time for spiritual things. We should not imagine that we will be able to accomplish anything if we are loose or lax. This is especially true in the matter of prayer. On the one hand, such busy circumstances are Satan&rsquo;s subtle strategy to steal our time, but on the other hand, we must worship God because He has sovereignly arranged these circumstances for us to be trained.</p>
<p>We must see through Satan&rsquo;s subtlety. He is a subtle schemer who causes us to be busy and at the same time tells us that we do not have time to pray. As a result, we never have time to pray. We should not excuse ourselves and say that we are too busy to pray. Nor should we expect the Lord to deliver us from our busy affairs so that we can pray in a leisurely way. Such a concept is wrong, and it is Satan&rsquo;s subtle scheme. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we must exercise to watch and pray in the midst of our busy schedules.</p>
<p>In the mornings the sisters are busy preparing breakfast and sending their children to school. Even with such a busy schedule, the sisters still need to exercise to pray in spirit. If they cannot pray long prayers, they can still pray in fragments. This also applies to the brothers. While they are on their way to work, they should stir up their spirit in prayer. If we do not try to fight and seize the time, Satan will eat up our time every day. We must be awakened and must exercise to seize the opportunity to pray with our spirit in every kind of busy situation.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT A CHANGE IN WAYS BUT A CHANGE IN CONCEPT</h2>
<p>We are fellowshipping concerning a change in our concept, not concerning a change in the way we meet. It is not a matter of changing our scheduled time for the meetings or of singing first and then praying or of praying first and then singing. It is a matter of changing our concept. The ministry of the word is strong, but our spirit is not strong enough; it is not living or released. We must exercise our spirit by praying when we come to a meeting. Our intention should not be merely to attend a meeting but rather to serve with our spirit. Our intention should not be merely to listen to a message but to serve with our spirit. When I was in Manila and in Hong Kong, I told the churches not to focus only on the matter of coming together to meet. We meet in order to serve. We meet so that we can use our spirit to worship and serve God. We should have the concept that we come not to meet but to serve. Although our meetings should be a feast, we often come and only look at the food. Some brothers and sisters attend meetings, but their spirit does not move.</p>
<p>Instead of saying that we are going to a meeting, we should say that we are going to serve, to minister. When we say that we are going to a meeting, we often mean that we are going to the meeting hall to sit. After a day&rsquo;s labor we take our Bibles and go to the meeting hall in the evening and allow our spirit, soul, and body to rest while the leading brothers bear the responsibility of the meeting. This is a great mistake! We should go to the meetings in order to serve others with God. Hence, we should be diligent in our spirit to fellowship, to pray, to praise, to give thanks, to worship, and to serve. If we would have such a spirit, the words that are released will be spirit and life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GENUINE SUPPLY OF THE CHURCH<br />
DEPENDING ON THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The sequence in the Gospel of John concerning the Spirit is excellent. Chapter 3 says that the Spirit regenerates our spirit; the Spirit begets the spirit (v. 6). Chapter 4 says that God is Spirit and that we need to worship Him in spirit (v. 24). This means the spirit worships the Spirit. Chapter 6 says, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life;...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (v. 63). First, the Spirit regenerates a person, and then this person needs to worship God in spirit. As a result, this one who has been regenerated by the Spirit and who worships God in spirit will be like the Lord; when he speaks, his words will be spirit and life. Because he is filled with the Spirit, what he utters will be spirit. &ldquo;Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks&rdquo; (Matt. 12:34). John 7 goes one step further and says that when the Spirit comes forth, He becomes rivers of living water (v. 38).</p>
<p>If we are willing to exercise our spirit, that is, to worship and serve in spirit, we will be filled with the Spirit, and the words that we speak will be the flowing of the Spirit as rivers of living water. If we read and speak the Bible, listen to messages, and read spiritual publications without exercising our spirit, we will eventually have more knowledge but less of the Spirit. As a result, the church will receive dead letters, not the genuine spiritual supply.</p>
<p>We must see that the supply to the church depends on the Spirit and not merely on the ministry of the word. In His work of recovery the Lord first uses the Word, but He must ultimately match the Word with the Spirit. Otherwise, the Word will become dead letters; it will be without the Spirit, and it will not be the Spirit; and the church will become deadened. If we can match the ministry of the word with the exercise of our spirit so that we serve in spirit, then the ministry of the word will be Spirit-filled, strengthening, enlightening, uplifting, and releasing. Furthermore, those who listen to our speaking will be enlivened, and their spiritual capacity will increase. This will draw out more words from those who minister the word. In this way, the church will receive a fresh and living supply, and all the saints will be able to know Christ, experience Christ, and touch the riches of Christ in their spirit. For this reason, we must exercise our spirit to pray regularly until we can pray in any place and at any time. This is the way for our spirit to be enriched and strengthened, for our service to be uplifted, and for the church to be built up.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BALANCING THE WORD WITH THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:63</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BALANCED SUPPLY<br />
OF THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The church receives the supply from the Word and from the Spirit. The church is always revived and supplied by the Word and by the Spirit. According to church history, in some situations the supply to the church was focused on the Word. However, this does not mean that the Spirit was not involved, because once the Spirit is lost, the Word becomes dead letters and is unable to supply the church. In other situations the supply to the church was focused on the Spirit, but the Spirit cannot supply without the Word. Without the rich Word as the means and content, the Spirit is powerful but not rich in our experience. Thus, without the Word, the Spirit cannot render the supply in a full way.</p>
<p>With regard to the Spirit, the Pentecostal movement that emerged in China thirty years ago was living and powerful, but it was poor with regard to the release of the Word to the children of God. The meetings of the Pentecostal movement were living and strong, but they were poor because they were short of the rich Word as the means and content.</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s wise arrangement, the church is to be supplied by the Word and the Spirit in a balanced way. The church needs the supply from both the Word and the Spirit. The Word that the church needs is supplied by the Spirit; the Spirit that the church needs is revealed and unveiled through the Word. Without the Word, the church is poor; without the Spirit, the church is dead and weak. In other words, if there is the Word but not the Spirit, the church will be dead and weak. If there is the Spirit but not the Word, the church will be poor. We must see that in His wisdom, God&rsquo;s provision is a balanced combination of the Word and the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that God, in His desire to have a relationship with man, is the Word and the Spirit. God is the Lord, but if He is not also the Word and the Spirit, we cannot understand, know, touch, and contact Him. We can know Him and contact Him because He is both the Word and the Spirit. The Word explains and reveals God. His Word opens our mind and enlightens us so that we may understand and know Him. The Spirit enables us to contact, touch, gain, experience, and enjoy Him; otherwise, we have no way to know such a mysterious God. God&rsquo;s being both the Word and the Spirit is His great grace to mankind. This is also a crucial point in the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;The Word was God.&rdquo; In other words, God is the Word. Verse 24 of chapter 4 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo; Verse 63 of chapter 6 says that the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit and life. This verse links the Word and the Spirit. God is the Word and the Spirit, and God as the Word is the Spirit. These verses are not found in Matthew, Mark, and Luke; they are only in John, because John speaks of the wonderful, mysterious, unfathomable, invisible God who can now be known, contacted, touched, gained, and enjoyed by men. The way to know and touch such a wonderful and mysterious Lord depends on His being the Word and the Spirit. If He were not the Word, we could not know Him, and if He were not the Spirit, we could not touch Him. Therefore, we worship Him as the Word and the Spirit. As such, we can know and touch Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO GREAT GIFTS</h2>
<p>God gives two great gifts to those who are saved: the Holy Bible, that is, the Word, and the Holy Spirit. The Bible and the Spirit, who is God Himself, have been given to mankind. We have not only the Holy Bible in our hand but also the Holy Spirit in our spirit. The Bible explains God, and we can read it any time. It opens our mind and guides our thoughts so that we may know, understand, and comprehend God. Furthermore, the Spirit, who is God Himself, has entered our spirit so that after knowing God, we can receive, experience, eat, drink, and enjoy Him in our spirit, based on the words in the Bible that we have read. This is God&rsquo;s twofold provision of grace, neither aspect of which should be neglected.</p>
<p>God is the Word, and God is the Spirit. How do we experience Him as such? The Word of God that is not only presented to us but also heard, understood, and received into us becomes the Spirit. We read and comprehend the Bible, but after we take it in and are touched by it, we receive inspiration. This is how the Word becomes the Spirit in us. We read the Word, but after we take it in, it becomes the Spirit. The Bible in our hands is the Word, but when the word is in us, it is the Spirit. This also applies to the messages that we hear. The words that we understand and are touched by should be received into us, and then we will receive inspiration. We hear the words, but they become the Spirit who enters into us. When we read a spiritual book or listen to the testimonies of the saints, we first read, hear, and understand the words, and then we are enlightened by the words. As soon as we receive these words into us, they immediately become the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Word is God explained and revealed to open our mind and enlighten our thoughts so that we may understand Him. After we understand, we receive inspiration. When we receive inspiration from the Word, it becomes the Spirit in us. This Spirit is the life supply. Hence, if the Word does not come into us and become the Spirit, it cannot become our supply. The Word of God that is in our hand inspires, unveils, and enlightens us so that we may know God and know His deeds, His nature, and His riches. The words that we receive become the Spirit in us for our life supply.</p><h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE WORD OF GOD<br />
WITH OUR HEART</h2>
<p>God in His wisdom has provided us with the Word and the Spirit. In order for us to receive this provision, on the one hand, we need to contact the Word, but on the other hand, we need to contact the Spirit in fellowship. This means that we must contact the Word and the Spirit.</p>
<p>We contact the Word of God by using our eyes to read, our ears to hear, our mind to understand and comprehend, and our heart to receive. Whether we love God and His Word is related to our heart. If we love God and desire His Word, our heart will receive what our eyes see, our ears hear, and our mind understands. Some saints are able to understand and comprehend what is written in the Bible and spoken in a message because their eyes are bright, their ears are sharp, and their minds are clear. However, they do not love God, nor do they want His Word. Although they can understand, they are not interested. Although they can comprehend, they are not willing to receive. Such a situation requires God&rsquo;s mercy. Every time we come to the meeting, we must have a heart that loves, desires, and seeks God and thus is willing to contact His Word. Then our eyes will see, our ears will hear, and our mind will understand. Furthermore, our heart will receive. This is the way to contact the Word of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONTACTING THE SPIRIT OF GOD<br />
BY PRAYING WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>It is not adequate for us to contact only the Word. We must also use our spirit to contact the Spirit. In contacting the Word, we use our eyes, our ears, our mind, and our heart. The only way to contact the Spirit is by praying with our spirit. Some may say that they do not understand what it means to pray with their spirit. However, they should at least understand what it means to pray. When we begin to pray, we might not use our spirit, but as long as we continue to pray, we will eventually pray in our spirit.</p>
<p>A child who is learning to walk is a good example. Initially, he does not know how to walk, but eventually, he learns how to use his legs to walk. Some believers do not know how to use their spirit in prayer. Even some of the saints who have been serving the Lord for a long time do not touch the Spirit in prayer. Such saints should pray more. If they do not touch the Spirit during the first five minutes, they should pray for eight minutes. If they do not touch the Spirit in eight minutes, they should pray for ten minutes. If they do not touch the Spirit in ten minutes, they should pray for fifteen minutes. There is no need to be impatient or discouraged; they should continue praying, because eventually, they will certainly touch the Spirit. A child practices to walk, and eventually, he is able to walk with his feet in a proper way. Likewise, we need to pray until we are able to pray with our spirit. As long as we continue to pray, we will learn to pray with our spirit to touch the Spirit.</p>
<p>We have a body, a soul, and a spirit; hence, when God fellowships with us, He must take care of each part. He cannot be only the Spirit and not the Word, nor can He be only the Word and not the Spirit. If He were only the Spirit, our spirit might be able to contact Him, but our mind would not understand, and we would be confused, not knowing what is going on. However, if He were only the Word and not the Spirit, we would have the capacity to comprehend and understand Him but not be able to touch Him in our spirit.</p>
<p>Human beings are multifaceted and complex. We have a spirit, and we also have a soul, which includes our mind. Whatever enters our spirit must pass through our mind. If we do not understand a message, it will not pass through our mind, and as a result, we will not receive it into our spirit. If our mind is open, we will understand what is spoken, and the spiritual supply will enter into our spirit through our opened mind. How much we receive in our spirit is determined by how much we understand.</p>
<p>God reaches us first through the Word, through which He unveils us, so that we may understand and know Him. However, He is also the Spirit. God causes us to understand Him, and then He causes us to receive and contact Him in our spirit. As soon as we contact Him, the words that we read will enter into us as spirit and life. The Spirit is the essence of God, His being, and the Word is the means to convey God. In order to receive God, we must first receive the Word of God and then receive the Spirit in the Word. We cannot use only our mind or our heart to receive God. We need to use our spirit. Looking, listening, comprehending, understanding, and receiving with our heart are not sufficient; we must use our spirit in order to contact and receive Him. Prayer is the only way to contact and receive God with our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">BALANCING THE WORD WITH THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Because of our shortage in the past, we have been speaking concerning exercising the spirit, blending in the spirit, serving as priests, and entering into the Holy of Holies. God always uses the Word and the Spirit to revive and supply the church. Sometimes the Word is emphasized, and at other times the Spirit is emphasized. More than forty years ago the Lord began a work of revival to supply the churches in the Far East. Since then, the emphasis has been on the Word. As such, our testimony and work, the establishment of local churches, and the raising up and producing of co-workers and other serving ones have all come about through the Word. Through our ministering the Word, we have brought forth the work, churches, and co-workers and serving ones. In the past forty years we have focused on the Word. If we continue to focus on the Word but neglect the Spirit, we will become unbalanced and dry. Eventually, we might fall into a state in which, instead of conveying the Spirit, the Word turns into empty doctrine and dead letters. We would lose the operation of the Spirit. This is the problem that the Brethren experienced. We are afraid of repeating their mistake.</p>
<p>I have a heavy burden that we would be balanced in the Word and the Spirit. There have been many ministers of the Word whose messages were more spiritual and inspiring than the messages we give. However, these ministers were short of the Spirit, and as a result, they ministered doctrine. These cases serve as a warning to us. We must not repeat the mistakes of those who have gone before us by allowing an unbalanced and dry situation to exist. Therefore, we are focusing on the strengthening of the Spirit. When we spoke of the building of God, especially the blueprint of His building, He reminded us not to approach the building in the way of doctrine but to be balanced by leading the saints to be blended in spirit.</p>
<p>It is more troublesome to lead the saints to exercise their spirit, to function as priests, and to minister in the spirit than it is to give a message. As long as the brothers have good utterance and use proper illustrations and superior content, the saints are willing to receive what is spoken. But when we ask them to pray, they hesitate. They seem to say that it is too difficult to pray. In order to learn a new skill, we must be willing to endure some pain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LISTENING TO THE MESSAGES WITH PRAYER</h2>
<p>Our situation is unbalanced because it is leaning toward doctrine. Everyone attends the conferences because there is someone giving the messages. The saints come to hear messages. A few years ago we conducted Life-study meetings in Taipei. For six months the number of those in attendance did not decrease. We also held a ten-day conference concerning building, and every day there were around two thousand three hundred saints in attendance. However, when the responsible brothers announced that we want to pray, the number of saints immediately dropped by one thousand. We should ask ourselves whether this is normal. Two thousand three hundred saints came to hear messages for ten days, but as soon as we announced our desire to pray, the number dropped by one thousand. If two thousand three hundred saints come every day to listen to messages, it seems reasonable that the same two thousand three hundred saints would pray every day. If we use our eyes, ears, mind, and heart to contact the Word of God, we should use our spirit to contact the Spirit.</p>
<p>Some might ask whether prayer is as important as the messages. Yes, it is. When we preach the gospel, people might be deeply touched and even moved to tears, but if they do not open their mouths to pray, no one will be saved. There is a certain gospel friend who is moved to tears every time he hears the gospel, but he has never prayed. Consequently, he still is not saved.</p>
<p>One day a person came to see me and said that more than twenty years ago he was moved when he heard a gospel message, so he attended a few gospel meetings. The more he listened, the more he was touched, and he was even moved to tears. However, he felt that he was not saved. When I asked whether he had prayed, he said that he did not pray when he was touched, even though he felt that he was sinful. Because no one helped him to pray and repent, he stopped going to the gospel meetings, and his inward feeling gradually disappeared. This example shows that no matter how much a person is moved by a message, if he does not open his mouth to pray with his spirit, he cannot touch the Spirit. This is an undisputed fact.</p>
<p>A person may be greatly touched many times, but he cannot be saved without prayer. This same principle applies to reading the Bible and listening to messages. We have been giving messages for more than a decade. If we consider the messages that have been given, our situation should be many times better than what it is today. However, in spite of the many messages that we have heard, our spiritual condition has not changed very much. Although we cannot say that there has been no growth, we must admit that we are not where we should be.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters have heard many messages, but the result is far less than what we expected; we have not prayed enough. I respectfully present this problem before all of you. Please consider, what would be our situation if, after every message, the saints would bring what they understood to the Lord in prayer?</p>
<p>By God&rsquo;s mercy we have the truth, revelation, and the ministry of the word. The messages are truly high and weighty. Those who hear the messages appreciate them and are touched by them. However, the impact produced by these messages is far less than what we anticipated. It seems as though we have heard too much. We hear with our ears and our mind, and we appreciate what we hear. Our heart is touched, but we must admit that we pray too little; hence, the effect is far less than it should be.</p>
<p>We must learn from history and not repeat the mistakes of the past. If we continue giving messages without adequate prayer, the result will be poor. I deeply regret the work we have done in the past. We cannot take the way of just the Word. Although we cannot disregard the Word, we should not neglect the Spirit. We must not lead the saints to listen to messages without prayer. When the number of saints in a conference drops by one thousand in a prayer meeting, there is an unbalanced situation that must be corrected.</p>
<p>In Acts the number of those who heard the message given by Peter was also the number who prayed. Chapter 2 says that three thousand people were saved. After they were saved, they all &ldquo;continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers&rdquo; (vv. 41-42). Not only did they listen to the message, fellowship, and break bread, but they also prayed. If the same number of saints attended the prayer meeting and listened to the message, our situation would be normal, and we would be balanced. I am not despising the messages that we give; they are effective. In the past thirty to forty years, we have supplied the churches through ministering the Word, without which we would not have our present growth. However, the Lord has shown us that this way is not adequate. We must also focus on the Spirit in order to balance our present situation. Just as we have focused on the Word, we should likewise focus on the Spirit. Just as we have supplied the churches with the Word, we should likewise supply them with the Spirit.</p>
<p>The brothers who minister the Word should know the living of the priests. Christ is everything in the living of the priests. Christ is what they wear, eat, and drink, and He is also where they dwell. All the churches should focus on the living of the priests in the ministry of the Word. However, before we focus on the living of the priests, we must lead the saints into exercising their spirit by prayer; otherwise, the spirit of the saints will not match the word that is spoken, and it will not be as effective. Not only the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones must have strong spirits; the saints who attend the meetings regularly must also have strong spirits. Then we can continue and minister concerning the living of the priests.</p>
<p>Blending in spirit is not a seasonal matter. Blending in spirit is a lifelong matter. We need to pray immediately after we hear a message, we need to pray immediately after we read a portion of the Bible, and we need to pray immediately after we gain spiritual knowledge. If we do not pray, at most the words will enter into our heart; they will not enter into our spirit. We will have heard words and understood them, and our heart will desire and receive them, but they will enter only into our heart; our spirit will not be moved. As a result, the words will be only words to us; they will not convey the Spirit. It is not until we pray in our spirit, digesting the words we have heard with our spirit, that the words can enter into our spirit and become spirit and life to us. I hope that this word will strengthen our feeling concerning the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">GIVING MESSAGES WITH MUCH PRAYER</h2>
<p>In Acts 6:4 the apostles said that they would &ldquo;continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.&rdquo; The apostles continually prayed and ministered the word. We should believe that Peter spent more time praying than ministering the word and that he spent more time praying than preparing to minister the word. I believe that the preparation for his messages was prayer. He prepared the spirit of speaking through prayer, and he released his message in the spirit of prayer. How about our speaking? Perhaps we spend one hour searching for material and compiling an outline, but we do not pray for half an hour. We speak, but we do not pray, or we speak much, but we pray little. As a result, our messages touch the mind of the saints instead of their spirit.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, the apostle Peter gave a message that pricked people in their heart (2:37). The words touched the depth of their being. Those words were spoken from the spirit and were spirit and life. What we speak from the podium is mainly words; there is not much spirit and life. We speak from our mind; therefore, our spirit does not move.</p>
<p>We know that the messages should convey the Spirit. Therefore, the speaking brothers spend a little time to prepare their spirit in prayer. Without this prayer, our messages would be letters and complete vanity. However, we need to spend more time in prayer and less time preparing for the messages. We should spend all of our time in prayer. We need to touch the feeling of God and His thoughts in prayer, and we need to speak these thoughts and feelings in prayer. Then even if the logic of the message is not that strong, the spirit of the saints will still be touched. Frankly speaking, what matters in a message is not the logic but the importance of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING IN ORDER TO LEAD OTHERS</h2>
<p>We must prostrate ourselves before the Lord and acknowledge that He is the wise God. He is the Word and the Spirit. He gave us the Holy Bible and the Holy Spirit. If we want to serve Him in a proper way, we must use our eyes, ears, mind, and heart to deal with His Word, and we must use our spirit to deal with His Spirit. Not only do we contact His Word, but we must also pray in our spirit. We need to use our whole being&mdash;eyes, ears, mind, heart, and spirit&mdash;to serve God. We must learn this before we can lead the saints into this practice. We can no longer listen and read without praying. It is best to read the Bible for a certain amount of time and then pray for the same amount of time. The amount of time that we spend to listen to a message or to read the Word is the amount of time that we should spend in prayer. If this would be our practice, the outcome will be very rich.</p>
<p>We have said that we speak much but pray very little, so our spirit seems poor and weak. Some saints have come to every Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting for one year and have heard every message, but their spirit is as dead as that of an unsaved person. The responsible brothers in every locality should consider the condition of the spirit of prayer of the saints who are in the meetings regularly. Is their spirit living or dead, strong or weak, fresh or old? The saints need to pray after every message, and they need to pray after reading the Bible.</p>
<p>We cannot lead others into something that we do not practice. If we want the saints to pray, we must pray first. If we want the saints to pray much, we must pray much. There is not enough prayer among the serving ones. We discuss, fellowship, and study much, but we pray too little. We cannot say that we know enough, but our prayer cannot compare with what we know. We are short of genuine prayer; we do not spend enough time in prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TOPICS AND WORDS OF PRAYER</h2>
<p>Perhaps some saints would ask, what are the topics for prayer, or what words should they use? The answer is in the Psalms. Some psalms are long and others are short. Most of them are prayers, and they do not use routine words. They are words of praise to appreciate the virtues of God, extol His glory, thank Him for His lovingkindness, and praise His doings. When we pray, we do not praise, thank, or extol the Lord; instead, we ask for peace, benefits, and spiritual things. The Psalms are prayers that are filled with praise, worship, and thanks, and they declare the glory of the Lord. Our prayers do not match these prayers because we lack practice. If we would pray frequently every day, we will have more words of praise, thanks, and extolment.</p>
<p>One of the brothers gave a message concerning the knowledge of the Lord, but the material seemed dry and tasteless, so the saints could not digest or apply it. It is good to have rich material, but we also need to have much prayer in order to digest it. If the saints would be willing to consider the verses concerning the knowledge of the Lord and turn them into prayer, they will</p>
<p>have many topics to pray over. Such prayers would be fragrant and acceptable to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING IN BALANCE</h2>
<p>In the past we over-emphasized the Word but neglected the Spirit. We gave many messages, but we did not exercise our spirit enough. This does not mean that we should neglect the Word but that we should pay equal attention to the Spirit. We do not want to be unbalanced. We want to balance the Word with the Spirit. Just as we have focused on the Word, we will now focus on the Spirit. Every saint must receive the Word and contact the Spirit in a good way. Then we will not only understand with our mind, but our spirit will also be strong. We need a balanced development in both the Word and the Spirit so that there will be a way for God&rsquo;s building.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">TWO GREAT GIFTS FROM GOD TO MAN&mdash;<br />
THE HOLY BIBLE AND THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 3:16; John 5:39; 6:63; Luke 11:13; John 16:13-14</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the relationship between the Holy Bible and the Holy Spirit. The Holy Bible and the Holy Spirit are two great gifts from God to man, and they are the means by which God gives Himself to man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOLY BIBLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Word of God</h2>
<p>Let us first consider the Holy Bible. Not only do Christians acknowledge that the Bible is a peculiar book, but even many intelligent unbelievers agree that the Bible is the most unique book in the world. No one can deny that the Bible occupies a special place in human history and that the influence of the Bible on mankind is immeasurably profound and far-reaching. The Bible occupies such a special place because it is the Word of God. In principle, all the words of God to man are contained in the Bible. Apart from the Bible, we would not know what God has spoken to man. God&rsquo;s speaking to man in the past is recorded in the Bible, and God&rsquo;s speaking to man in the future is also contained in the Bible. The Bible is the Word of God because it is God&rsquo;s speaking to man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being a Means for God to Give Himself to Man</h2>
<p>The Word of God is the crucial means through which God gives Himself to man. The Bible is the means by which God gives Himself for man to possess and enjoy. A cup is the means to give someone a drink of water. Without a cup, it is difficult to give a person some water to drink. Therefore, the cup is the means for drinking water. Likewise, God gives Himself as living water to us for our enjoyment through His Word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Revelation and Explanation of Christ</h2>
<p>God becomes our enjoyment in His Son, Christ. God is in Christ so that He can be enjoyed by us. In other words, Christ is God coming to be enjoyed by us. Since the Bible is the means for God to be enjoyed by man and God is enjoyed by man in Christ, this glorious and rich Christ must be the center and content of the Bible. If we want to enjoy God, we must enjoy Christ, and if we want to gain God, we must gain Christ. Apart from Christ, we cannot find, meet, contact, or gain God. Apart from Christ, we cannot enjoy God. We must be in Christ in order to have a subjective relationship with God.</p>
<p>How does Christ transmit Himself into us? How are we able to contact Him? It is through His Word, the Bible. He is embodied in the Word, through which He transmits Himself into us by revelation and explanation. The Word is the revelation and explanation of Christ. We gain Christ in the Word; He reveals and explains Himself to us through the Word. When we read the Bible, we must realize that the Bible is the revelation and explanation of Christ.</p>
<p>God needs to reveal and explain Christ to us through the Bible because we human beings are rational creatures. Man was created in God&rsquo;s image. God is rational, so He created man to be rational. Hence, in order for something to enter into us, it must pass through our reasoning and be accepted by our reasoning. God is Spirit, but if He wants us to enjoy Him, He must reveal and explain Himself to us through the Word so that He can pass through our reasoning. When He passes through our reasoning, He can enter into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Conveying the Spirit</h2>
<p>The Bible is not only the revelation and explanation of Christ; it also conveys Christ as the Spirit. Apparently, the Bible is no different from any other book in the world in terms of being a book printed on paper. However, there is a fundamental difference between the Bible and other books. After people read other books, they do not feel that something has entered their spirit. But when a person reads the Bible, he can touch the living Spirit. Even though it seems as if he is reading only the printed words, he can be contacting the living God. The Bible is unique because it conveys the Spirit. The Spirit is &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; in the words of the Bible.</p>
<p>When we read a secular book, our mind receives knowledge, and our feelings can be touched, because knowledge and emotions are &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; in words. In the same way, the words of the Bible convey not only the knowledge of God but also the Spirit of God. When we read the Word of God, we gain not only knowledge in our mind but also the Spirit in our spirit. When we read the Bible, we should pray in our spirit because the Spirit conveyed in the words of the Bible has touched our spirit. At best, secular books open a reader&rsquo;s mind, causing him to understand a concept, or they stir up the reader&rsquo;s emotion, because what they convey affects our thoughts and affections but not our spirit. What the Bible conveys, however, affects not only our thoughts and emotions but also our spirit. When we read the Bible, the Spirit touches our spirit and generates prayers from the depth of our being. This proves that the living Christ is embodied in the words of the Bible. When we read the Bible, we touch the Spirit of Christ. As a result, we receive not only teachings, which affect our mind, but also the life supply in our spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Being a Book of Supply</h2>
<p>The Bible is not merely a book of teachings. It is more than a book of teachings. The Bible is a book of supply. There are at least two verses that confirm this. One verse is Matthew 4:4, which says, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&rdquo; The emphasis in this verse is &ldquo;every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&rdquo; That which comes out of the mouth of God is what He is filled with, just as a person&rsquo;s words are the expression of what he is filled with. The words that come out of the mouth of God are His riches and His element. Hence, these words are our supply; they enable us to live in His presence. The second verse is Jeremiah 15:16, which says, &ldquo;Your words were found and I ate them.&rdquo; The Word of God is edible; hence, it is full of supply.</p>
<p>There are other portions in the Bible that speak of the Word of God as our nourishment. For example, Paul said that in his ministry he supplied the believers either with milk or with solid food (1 Cor. 3:2). Some portions are simpler and are easier to digest and therefore are likened to milk. Other portions of the Bible are more difficult and are harder to digest and therefore are likened to solid food. However, both milk and solid food supply nourishment. This shows that the Bible is not merely a book of teachings but rather a book of supply. It is food for us to eat. We need to esteem the Bible highly because it is God&rsquo;s great gift to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>God has given us another great gift&mdash;the Holy Spirit. This giving is referred to many times in the Bible. For example, in Matthew 7:11 the Lord Jesus said that our Father in the heavens will give good things to those who ask of Him. According to Luke 11:13, <em>good things</em> refers to the Holy Spirit. In God&rsquo;s eyes, the &ldquo;good things&rdquo; in the universe is the Holy Spirit. God gives good things&mdash;the Holy Spirit&mdash;as a great gift to those who ask of Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Center of God&rsquo;s Promises</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament God promised to give His gift to man (Ezek. 36:26-27; Joel 2:28-29). In the New Testament the Lord said that He would pour out the Holy Spirit upon His believers (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4-5, 8). Therefore, the Holy Spirit is the center of God&rsquo;s promises to His people both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament (Gal. 3:14). On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit was poured out (Acts 2:1-4), thus fulfilling God&rsquo;s sweet promise. From that time onward, all the riches of God were available to man through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>It is correct to say that the entire Bible is concerning Christ. But it is also correct to say that the entire Bible is concerning the Holy Spirit, because starting in the Old Testament God repeatedly promised that the Holy Spirit would come. Hence, the Old Testament is the promise of the Holy Spirit. In the New Testament the Lord Jesus repeatedly said that He would give us the Holy Spirit. In John 14 and 16, before the Lord&rsquo;s death, He spoke extensively regarding the coming of the Holy Spirit. After the Lord resurrected, He breathed the Holy Spirit into His disciples, and He commanded them to wait in Jerusalem until the Holy Spirit, the promise of the Father, would come upon them (20:22; Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4-5, 8). After receiving the Holy Spirit, they became a group of people who lived in the Holy Spirit. From Acts to the end of Revelation the focus of the divine revelation is on the living of the believers in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Realization of Christ</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit causes everything of Christ to be realized in men, just as Christ caused all that the Father is to be manifested among men. Just as Christ was God manifested among men, so the Spirit is Christ realized in men. One is a matter of manifestation; the other is a matter of realization. God in Christ can be experienced and enjoyed by us in a real and practical way because the Spirit is the realization of Christ. Our experiencing and enjoying God is altogether a matter in the Holy Spirit. The work of the Holy Spirit includes revealing and explaining Christ to us so that He can become our reality. For this reason, the Holy Spirit is called &ldquo;the Spirit of realty&rdquo; (John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Realized according to the Bible</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit enters into us in order for Christ to be realized in us according to the revelation of the Holy Scriptures. The Bible explains and reveals Christ, and the Spirit causes all that has been explained and revealed in the Bible concerning Christ to be realized in us and become our reality. The Spirit and the Word are one.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the Word realized in us, and the Word expresses the Spirit. Every aspect of God&rsquo;s relationship with man is a matter of the Word and the Spirit. That which God speaks is the Word, and that which enters into man is the Spirit. The Word is in our hand, and the Spirit is in us. It is hard to distinguish between the two. The riches of God are revealed in the Word, and the Word that enters into us becomes spirit and life. Not only so, when we express the indwelling Spirit through our speaking, He becomes the word of God to those who hear, and what they receive becomes spirit and life in them.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING TWO GREAT GIFTS</h2>
<p>By means of the Word and the Spirit we receive the divine element; we gain and enjoy Christ. God gives all His riches to us in Christ. This is the only treasure in the universe. God gives this treasure to us through the Word and the Spirit. To say that God gives Himself to us in Christ is rather abstract and general. It is more concrete and specific to say that God gives Himself to us in the Word and in the Spirit. God has given us the Holy Bible and the Holy Spirit, through which we can enjoy everything that He is. Therefore, the Holy Bible and the Holy Spirit are two great gifts from God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONTACTING THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>God is embodied in Christ so that we may receive Him through the Word and the Spirit. Hence, in order to gain God, we must contact the Word and the Spirit. We contact the Word by reading the Bible, and we contact the Spirit through prayer.</p>
<p>Even though Christians are familiar with reading the Bible and praying, these two matters are not simple. There are many ways to read the Bible and to pray, each of which has its own benefits. We have spent much time studying different ways; hence, we can conclude that the most simple and effective way to read the Bible and to pray is to read the Bible through prayer.</p>
<p>Every portion of the Bible that we read should be turned into prayer. This is the basic principle. We must not read the Bible without praying, nor should we separate reading the Bible from praying, as if reading the Bible and praying are unrelated. A brother may read Matthew 17, regarding the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus on the mountain, and then pray for his wife and children. Another brother may read John 10, regarding God giving eternal life to man, and then pray for the prosperity of his business and for healing. In these two instances, reading the Bible and praying do not match. Some saints are better; they read the Gospel of John and pray for the revival of the church. Other saints may read the Gospel of Matthew and pray for the building of the church, or they may read the Gospel of Luke and pray for the saints to exercise the spirit. These are not wrong or improper prayers, but this is not what we are referring to in relation to reading the Bible.</p>
<p>We are not emphasizing praying for matters. This fellowship is concerning turning the portions of the Word that we read into prayer. After reading a sentence in the Bible, a brother should turn that sentence into prayer. If he is inspired by a point in the Word, he should turn that point into prayer. This way of praying is not related to specific matters; it has nothing to do with such things. This way of praying concentrates on turning what we read in the Bible into prayer. Every local church should take this way. This is not only for those who take the lead; every saint must be brought into this way of praying.</p>
<p>While a brother reads the Bible during morning watch, he should also pray. This prayer is to digest what he reads in the Bible. He does not need to pray for many matters, all of which the Lord knows: &ldquo;For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things&rdquo; (Matt. 6:32). There is no need for the brother to ask about many things. His prayer should be his enjoying Christ and assimilating Christ according to what he reads in the Bible.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to the messages that we hear. We should not merely listen to a message and understand it without turning what we have heard and understood into prayer. Our mind can become sharp, and we can become more knowledgeable, but as a result of a lack of prayer our spirit will wither. Every time we hear a message, we should turn what we have heard into prayer, thus digesting the Lord&rsquo;s word in prayer. If we are willing to practice turning what we read in the Bible into prayer and what we hear of the Word into prayer, our spirit will become living. Only by such a practice can the Christ revealed in the ministry of the word and in the Bible become the real and living Christ in our spirit. Eventually, our flesh will be swallowed up, our natural life will be killed, and we will live out the Christ whom we have assimilated. This is not a matter of imitating Christ. By turning what we read in the Bible into prayer, we assimilate Christ, and He becomes our supply and life element for our transformation. As a result, we express Christ.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother reads Mark 6:30-44, which is concerning the Lord feeding five thousand with five loaves and two fish. He should not focus on the Lord&rsquo;s power that performed the miracle but on the details of how the Lord handled the situation. This is what he should turn into prayer. Then he will touch the Lord&rsquo;s fineness and sweetness. He might say, &ldquo;Lord, there were five thousand men, not including the women and children. These people were hungry. As soon as they heard that they would be fed, they must have rushed over to You. But You did not panic; instead, You charged them to recline on the grass so that they would not tread upon one another. Lord, You are so composed and wise.&rdquo; This is the way to turn what we read in the Bible into prayer. He may also say, &ldquo;Lord, You are not only wise, but You are also organized. You not only told them to sit down, but You also told them to sit down in groups by hundreds and by fifties.&rdquo; This is to receive the knowledge in the Word into our spirit. This is the way for the divine element to increase within us and to change our nature, transforming us into the image of the Lord. Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we will be &ldquo;transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; This is not self-improvement but enjoyment and transformation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Let us now consider our knowledge of Christ and our seeing the vision of Christ. There are two ways to receive a vision of Christ. One way is to see a complete vision once and for all. The other way is to see small progressive visions. All those who see a complete vision will later see the details of the vision. They first see an overall picture, and then they later see different parts of the picture. Contrarily, those who see smaller visions will eventually see the complete vision. They see small visions, which expand into a complete vision.</p>
<p>For example, when we look at a map of the city of Taipei, we quickly see a panoramic view of Taipei. This is the large vision. But we still need to walk through the streets of Taipei using this map. Then the streets of Taipei will become real, and we will gain knowledge of the streets of Taipei. Knowing the streets of Taipei is the small vision. However, some people, such as pedicab drivers, are illiterate and cannot read a map. They drive to this street today and that street tomorrow. After three years the whole city of Taipei will become clear in their being. This is to have small visions that turn into a large vision, that is, for small visions to accumulate and become a complete vision. A person who first sees a complete vision still needs to see small visions, and a person who first sees small visions will eventually see the complete vision.</p>
<p>Whether a person sees a complete vision or a small vision, he needs to enjoy and experience what he has seen. We must experience the Christ whom we have seen. Paul saw a complete vision, and then little by little, day by day, he experienced that vision in his daily living. Unlike Paul, who had a full knowledge of Christ, we tend to see small visions. But if we faithfully follow what we have fellowshipped in this chapter, that is, turn what we read and hear into prayer, we will come to the full knowledge of Christ.</p>
<p>Hence, the end result of seeing the complete vision first is the same as the end result of seeing small visions first. Either way, we enjoy Christ every day. The practical way to enjoy Christ is to read and pray the Bible, daily reading the Word and digesting it by prayer. Those who practice this will surely come to the full knowledge of Christ. Their knowledge will not merely be in their mind but also in their spirit. May the Lord have mercy on us and grant us adequate practice in reading and praying over the Bible to touch and enjoy Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
GOD BEING THE WORD AND<br />
GOD BEING THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6</h1>
<p>Everything of the Father is embodied in the Son, and everything of the Son is received by the Spirit (John 14:9; 16:13-14). Now the Spirit reveals and declares all that He has received to us. Hence, we can say that through the Son and in the Spirit we can know, touch, contact, and enjoy everything of God. In this chapter we will continue to consider the relationship between God being the Word and the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT&mdash;<br />
THE KEY TO MAN ENJOYING GOD</h2>
<p>The Bible clearly refers to God as the Word. The most obvious portion is John 1:1: &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,...and the Word was God.&rdquo; The last part of this verse means that God is the Word. John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo; The Gospel of John contains the clearest verses concerning God being the Word and God being the Spirit. This shows that the Gospel of John does not focus on doctrine. Rather, it reveals in simple and plain words that God came to the earth to be man&rsquo;s life so that man can enjoy Him as everything.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John says that the Lord is many items. For example, the Lord is the light, the resurrection, the way, the reality, the life, the bread of life, and the living water (8:12; 11:25; 14:6; 6:35; 7:38). All these items are for our enjoyment, and they are our supply. He is the bread of life for us to eat, and He is the living water for us to drink. Likewise, He is the resurrection, the life, the light, and the way for us to partake of Him and enjoy Him. The Gospel of John portrays the many ways in which God wants us to enjoy Him as everything. God&rsquo;s being the Word and the Spirit is the key to His being enjoyed by us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BEING THE EXPLANATION AND<br />
THE SPIRIT BEING THE REALITY</h2>
<p>It is easy to understand that God is bread and that He is water. It is not difficult to understand that God is life, light, the way, and truth. However, it is not easy for us to think of God as the Word and the Spirit. We often say that God is Spirit, but we do not really understand what this means. Furthermore, our understanding of God being the Word is inadequate. Why do we need to speak of God as the Word and the Spirit, in addition to His being life, light, bread, and living water? All that God is, is made known to us through the Word and is gained by us through the Spirit. If He were not the Word, we would not know that He is everything. If He were not the Spirit, we would not be able to gain Him as our everything. The Word is the explanation of God. The Spirit is the reality and causes us to gain God as our everything in a practical way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD GIVING US UNDERSTANDING</h2>
<p>All that God is, is made known to us in the Bible. Hence, the Bible is a great book, without which the whole universe would be a mystery. Without the Bible we would have no way to know God or the things in the universe. But we praise the Lord that He is the Word. He is a speaking God.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1 unveils that God is a speaking God. Verses 1 and 2 say, &ldquo;God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son.&rdquo; He is a speaking God. Moreover, God asked some men to write down His words in a book so that people could read His words, listen to His words, and speak His words. The Bible is the story of God&rsquo;s speaking. It is the utterance of God, the revelation of God, and the explanation of God. It is the means through which we can know God and understand who He is and what He is to us. Hence, the explanation of God first enters our thoughts through the Word.</p>
<p>In order for something abstract to enter into us, it must first pass through our mind. If it cannot enter our mind, it cannot enter our being. If God were not the Word, we would not be able to understand Him, and we would be unable to know Him. We can know that He is our bread, our living water, our life, our light, and our way because He is the Word. All that He is to us is made known to us through the Word. This is the way that He passes through the first gate of our being, our mind, so that we can know all that He is to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT ENTERING INTO OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>If God were only the Word, we would not be able to touch Him; we would not be able to contact Him in genuineness. If God were merely the Word, we would be able to understand certain things about Him, but He would be unable to enter into our being. The most genuine part of our being would still be unable to contact Him. The most genuine part of a person is his human spirit. The human spirit is the genuineness of a person. God has to be Spirit so that the human spirit, the deepest part of a person, may contact, touch, and obtain Him. The Word by itself can only give man understanding, but the Spirit can enter into man&rsquo;s spirit. Hence, the Word enables us to know about God, and the Spirit enables us to touch and gain God.</p>
<p>I hope that in the young people&rsquo;s meetings this matter of God being the Word would be made clear and that the matter of God being the Spirit would be emphasized. The young brothers and sisters need to see that if God were only the Word but not the Spirit, the most He could do would be to reveal Himself in our mind. However, we would be unable to touch or enjoy Him, that is, to contact Him in the depth of our being. Hence, God must be the Spirit so that we can contact and touch Him in our spirit.</p>
<p>God is the Word mainly for us to know Him, and He is the Spirit mainly for us to touch Him. Touching God can be likened to touching electricity. We need a deep realization of this word <em>touch.</em> It is possible for a person to study electricity and to be familiar with the theory of electricity without touching electricity. It is one thing to understand electricity, but it is another to touch electricity. This is the situation of many people in relation to God. They know about God and understand things concerning Him from reading the Bible, hearing gospel messages, and reading spiritual books, but they do not contact God in their spirit. Therefore, they have very little experience of God being everything to them. Such people have the Word of God, the Bible, but they lack the experience of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Here is an example. It is possible for a person to be an expert in nutrition and a skilled cook but to suffer from hunger because he does not eat or drink. Such a person only knows about food, but he does not partake of it. We must receive the Spirit into our spirit, just as we eat food and drink water. Only then can we have a genuine relationship with God in which He is received into our being to be joined to us in spirit and to be our supply. This is the way that we gain God.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE HOLY BIBLE AND<br />
THE HOLY SPIRIT IN A THOROUGH WAY</h2>
<p>God gave us the Holy Bible in our hand because He is the Word, and He imparted the Spirit into our spirit because He is the Spirit. There is one Bible, the Word of God, and there is one Spirit. As Christians, we must deal with the Holy Bible in our hands and the Holy Spirit in our spirit. If we do not deal with the Bible in a proper way, we will be foolish and confused concerning God. Similarly, if we do not deal with the Spirit in a proper way, we will be empty and void of God as reality. Without the Word and the Spirit, man would have no relationship with God. If a Christian is to have a rich knowledge concerning God and a thorough understanding of God, he must deal with the Holy Bible in a proper way. He must study it carefully and know it thoroughly. Likewise, if a Christian is to obtain God and enjoy Him richly, he must deal with the Spirit in a proper way. He must contact the Spirit and receive the Spirit. These two matters are complementary, and both are indispensable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BEING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>John 6:63 says, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; This verse connects the Lord&rsquo;s words with the Spirit. The Lord said that it is the Spirit who gives life. Then He went on to say that the words that He speaks to us are spirit. This proves that the Word and the Spirit are two sides of one thing. One side is the Word, and the other side is the Spirit, but they are one and the same. Under normal circumstances every time we touch the Bible, we should touch the Holy Spirit. Every time we read the Bible outwardly, we should touch the Holy Spirit inwardly. Hence, our relationship with the Word is a matter of the Spirit. Colossians 3:16 says that when the Lord&rsquo;s word dwells in us, we will praise God with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Ephesians 5:18-19 says that when the Spirit fills us, we will praise God with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. These verses indicate that the Word that operates in us is a matter of the Spirit in us.</p>
<p>The Spirit and the Word contain all that God is. Whatever is in the Spirit is also in the Word. For example, God being life is related to the Spirit as well as to the Word. Romans refers to the Spirit of God as &ldquo;the Spirit of life&rdquo; (8:2), and the Gospel of John says, &ldquo;In Him [the Word] was life&rdquo; (1:4), and &ldquo;the words which I have spoken...are life&rdquo; (6:63). The Spirit is life, and the Word is life. God is also light. This light is surely in the Spirit, because this light is spiritual. This light is also in the Word. Psalm 119 says, &ldquo;The opening of Your words gives light&rdquo; (v. 130), and &ldquo;Your word is a lamp to my feet / And a light to my path&rdquo; (v. 105). The Holy Spirit is light, and the Holy Bible is also light.</p>
<p>God is power. The power of God is in the Holy Spirit and in the word of God. Luke 1:37 says, &ldquo;No word will be impossible with God.&rdquo; The word <em>impossible</em> can also be rendered as <em>powerless.</em> This indicates that God&rsquo;s words are powerful. The power of God is in the Spirit as well as in His Word.</p>
<p>God is our comfort, which is in the Spirit as well as in the Word. When we touch the Holy Spirit, we are comforted, and when we read the Bible, we are also comforted. The Holy Spirit comforts us, and the Holy Bible also comforts us. These examples show that the Word and the Spirit are one; God is the Spirit, and He is the Word. The Spirit is the essence of God, and the Word is the revelation and explanation of God. If there were only the Bible, we could have an understanding of God, but we would be unable to touch God, His essence. We thank the Lord that we not only have the Bible in our hand, but we also have the Holy Spirit in our spirit. As a result, when we read the Bible, the Holy Spirit can move within us. We need to touch the Word, and we also need to touch the Spirit. When we touch both the Word and the Spirit, we also touch God. This point is very crucial.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING THE WORD ENABLING GOD<br />
TO PASS THROUGH OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>It is of little value for us to merely understand the Word of God with our mind. In order for the Word to enter into our spirit so that we can contact God in our spirit, we must pray by turning the Word into prayer. This enables God to pass through our being. The more we pray, the more He will pass through our being; the more thoroughly we pray, the more thoroughly He will pass through our being. When our prayer is detailed and earnest, God can pass through us in a more detailed and earnest way. When we pray a little, God will pass through our being a little. If we pray for a short time, God will pass through our being for a short time. If our prayers are shallow, God will pass through our being in a shallow way. If we pray carelessly, God will not pass through our being in a detailed way&mdash;God cannot be careless, but we do not allow Him to be detailed. The degree and extent of His passing through our being depend on the condition of our prayer. When we contact the Lord&rsquo;s words, in reading the Bible or listening to messages, we must pray thorough prayers in order for God to pass through our spirit in a practical and solid way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;THE LETTER KILLS, BUT THE SPIRIT GIVES LIFE&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In conclusion, 2 Corinthians 3:6 says, &ldquo;The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.&rdquo; This means that if we do not open our spirit and turn the Word into prayer, what we read and hear will only be letters to us and will not profit us. This is the reason that many saints read the Bible and listen to messages but do not have much growth in life.</p>
<p>Some saints know the principles of the Christian life and understand the truth, but this knowledge only becomes the basis for criticizing others. The more they read the Bible and listen to messages, the more critical they are of others, and the more critical they are of others, the deader they become. This proves that the letter kills. If a message is not received with an open spirit and turned into prayer, it will be dead letters in our mind. It is dead knowledge, which kills (1 Cor. 8:1). However, if we learn to open our spirit and pray after reading the Bible or hearing a message, digesting the Word of the Lord in a spirit of prayer, His words will become spirit and life to us. They will swallow up our death, supply our needs, and cause us to live in a fresh and living way before the Lord. The Spirit gives life. May the Lord be gracious to us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WORD BECOMING THE SPIRIT</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will cover how to receive the Word as the Spirit. This is a basic lesson for Christians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD NEEDING TO BE ENJOYED BY MAN<br />
BEFORE HE CAN BE MINGLED WITH MAN</h2>
<p>In order to be mingled with man, God must first give Himself, with all His elements, to man, for man to eat, drink, and enjoy. In order for something to be mingled with man, it must be something that man can receive. In order for food or drink to become part of man&rsquo;s constitution, it must first enter into man. Likewise, we must first enjoy God by eating Him before He can be mingled with us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING ENJOYED BY MAN IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>God is enjoyed by man in His Son, Christ. There are many religious people who seek God, but very few have touched God when they worship. There are many people in Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, but few people have touched God when they worship. Actually, the teachings of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism are not about the worship of God. Confucianism is a philosophy of improving human ethics, but it is not related to worshipping God. Buddhism was founded by Siddhartha Gautama. Buddhism teaches a person how to become a buddha. It has nothing to do with the worship of God. Taoism teaches how a person can reach a state of perfect peace and become immortal, but it is not related to worshipping God. Only Christianity, Judaism, and Islam speak about the worship of God. These three religions are monotheistic; that is, they worship one God. Furthermore, they worship the true God. However, there is a great difference between Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. Judaism and Islam do not worship God in Christ: they worship God apart from the Son of God. As a result, those in Judaism and Islam do not touch God when they worship, even though the object of their worship is right. They worship the true God, but they cannot touch Him, because they do not worship Him in Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p>According to 1 John, those who do not receive Christ cannot contact God: &ldquo;Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also&rdquo; (2:23), and &ldquo;he who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life&rdquo; (5:12). This life is the Son of God. These portions of the Word clearly show that apart from Christ, the Son of God, man cannot touch God, because He is embodied in the Son. No one has ever seen God, but the Son of God has declared Him (John 1:18). Hence, those who have seen the Son have seen the Father (14:9), and those who have not seen the Son have not met the Father. This means that those who do not receive Christ cannot contact God. No matter how pious and sincere a person might be, if he is not in Christ and does not have Christ, he cannot contact God. God can be contacted by man only in Christ. Christ is the only means for man to contact God. There is no means through which man can contact God, much less obtain and enjoy God, except through Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING BOTH THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Christ is the means for the believers to contact God because Christ is the Word and the Spirit. In order for God to be mingled with the believers, they must enjoy Him. The believers can enjoy God because He is embodied in Christ, and they can touch Christ in the Word and in the Spirit. If the Word and the Spirit did not exist, no one on earth would be able to touch Christ. In a normal condition the church should have both the Word and the Spirit. When the balance between the Word and the Spirit is lost, the believers cannot touch Christ in a proper and full way. If we want to gain Christ in a proper and full way, we must touch the Word and the Spirit.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.&rdquo; This verse speaks of the word of Christ being within man. Romans 8:9 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of God dwells in you. Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.&rdquo; This verse speaks of the Spirit of Christ being within man. First Peter 1:10-11 says that the Spirit of Christ spoke within the Old Testament prophets.</p>
<p>The Word and the Spirit are for us to realize Christ. Christ is conveyed to us in the Word, and we can experience Him as the Spirit. Without the Word and the Spirit, everything is empty. We would not have a way to know Christ or experience Him without the Word and the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Word is primarily for explaining Christ to us so that we may understand and know Him. The Spirit is primarily for us to realize everything that Christ is, to make Him our reality, so that we may touch Him. For example, it is possible to learn about electricity and understand it. But if a person does not contact electricity, it will not be real to him, because he has not experienced electricity. Christ is the living Word of God, and the Bible is the written Word of God. The written Word of God is for us to know the living Word of God. We can know the living Word of God because the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ. If we want to know, contact, touch, and enjoy Christ, we must contact the Holy Bible and touch the Holy Spirit. In other words, we must read the Bible and pray with our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORD BECOMING THE SPIRIT<br />
IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2>
<p>According to the Gospel of John, God is embodied in the Son in order to be enjoyed by man. The characteristic of John&rsquo;s Gospel is that it speaks of how God becomes everything to us in His Son. It begins by saying that the Lord Jesus is the Word: &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (1:1). Verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh.&rdquo; The Word that became flesh is the Lord Jesus. At the end of this book, the Lord Jesus is the Spirit. In chapter 20 Jesus stood in the midst of His disciples, and &ldquo;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 22). Chapter 14 is the turning point of this book. Chapter 1 says that God is the Word and that the Word became flesh. In chapter 14 the Lord said, &ldquo;If I go...I am coming again&rdquo; (v. 3). His going was His death, and His coming was His resurrection. Through His going and His coming, that is, through His death and resurrection, the Lord Jesus was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit. Hence, in verse 20 He said, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (v. 20). This verse speaks of His becoming the Spirit.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John we can see that Christ is first the Word, and we can also see that through death and resurrection He became the Spirit. The only way to contact Christ is to touch the Word and to contact the Spirit. The more we know the word of Christ, the Bible, and the more we contact the Spirit, the more we will gain Christ. There is no other way to gain Him.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&rdquo; In John 6:63 the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; These two verses show that Christ is contacted through the Word and the Spirit because He is both the Word and the Spirit. Furthermore, His words are spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BECOMING THE SPIRIT<br />
THROUGH PRAYER IN ACTS</h2>
<p>The early apostles gained the Lord Jesus first by contacting Him and His words and later by receiving the Spirit. They did not have the four Gospels, which present the Lord Jesus in a clear way, nor did they have the Epistles or Revelation. However, for three and a half years they followed the Lord Jesus every day; they witnessed with their eyes how He lived and walked. They saw Him eat when He was hungry, drink when He was thirsty, sleep when He was fatigued, and weep when He was grieved. In their presence He manifested power, authority, and wisdom. He also manifested the glory of God. Therefore, people often asked, &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; (Matt. 21:10; Luke 7:49; 9:9). The disciples read the living Word. During His three and a half years on earth, the Lord was the living Word before their eyes.</p>
<p>For three and a half years the Lord spoke to the disciples. The Lord spoke to them also through His actions and His life. In Matthew 5 through 7 and John 14 through 16, the Lord spoke to them with words. In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus said that He is the bread of life and the light of the world (6:35; 8:12). The disciples heard these precious words with their ears, and later they wrote them down for the future generations to read. For three and a half years they &ldquo;read&rdquo; the word of Christ every day. Not only so, the events related to the Lord Jesus&rsquo; betrayal, trial, crucifixion, burial, resurrection from the dead, appearing to them, and ascension on the Mount of Olives were also &ldquo;read&rdquo; by the disciples.</p>
<p>During the three and a half years, the disciples surely &ldquo;read&rdquo; the word of Christ, but did they contact the Spirit? Did they experientially receive the Lord? Was the Lord Jesus mingled with them? Was He everything to them? It was only on the evening of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, when He breathed into the disciples, that the Lord entered into them as the Spirit of resurrection. For three and a half years the disciples saw the Lord, &ldquo;read&rdquo; the Lord, knew Him, and understood Him. Then He died, was raised from the dead, and ascended to the heavens. We cannot deny that they had seen a vision. They saw the Lord on the cross, they witnessed His resurrection, and they saw His ascension. These visions attracted them and kept them from going back to Galilee. In Jerusalem there was a threatening situation, and there was persecution. Their lives were at risk, but they were not afraid. However, their visions were not what kept them in Jerusalem. More than twenty years ago I told people that as long as they saw the glorious Christ, their problems would be solved. Today, I say that seeing a vision is not enough, because we need the Spirit in addition to a vision. For this, we must add prayer, just like the apostles prayed for ten days.</p>
<p>From the Gospels through Acts 1:12, the apostles contacted the living Word. It was not until the second half of chapter 1 that the Word became the Spirit to them. For ten days they contacted the Word with their spirit. As they contacted the Spirit in their spirit, the Word became the Spirit within them; that is, the objective Christ became subjective to them. This is what transpired in the upper room in Jerusalem during those ten days (vv. 13-14). The Word whom they had heard, seen, and spoken with became real in them as the Spirit. As a result, on the day of Pentecost the ascended Christ was poured out upon them as the Spirit.</p>
<p>We must see the progression from the Gospels through Acts 1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God. He created all things. Then in time the Word became flesh and lived as a man on the earth. After three and a half years He was crucified, resurrected from the dead, and ascended to the heavens. This was the Word. For three and a half years plus forty days, the apostles contacted the Word objectively. After ten days, however, they stopped using their eyes and their mind to contact the Word; rather, through prayer they used their spirit to receive what they had seen and understood. As a result, they began to know not only the Word but also the Spirit. Then, from Pentecost onward, Christ to them was not merely the Word but also the Spirit. The key to their experience was prayer.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORD BECOMING THE SPIRIT<br />
IN OUR EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>The five major points that we have fellowshipped above are somewhat theoretical. Let us now consider how to receive the Word with our spirit.</p>
<p>First, we must read the Word, know it, and understand it. This requires that we not only read the Bible but also listen to messages, read spiritual books, and fellowship with the saints. These activities are matters related to the Word. The more we do these things, the better. Second, we must turn whatever we read and hear into prayer.</p>
<p>Have you ever considered what the one hundred and twenty disciples prayed about in the upper room for ten days? We often feel that we are short of words for prayer. We cannot pray for ten hours, not to mention pray for ten days. Some saints cannot pray longer than ten minutes. The disciples prayed for ten days! What were they praying about? We believe that they must have prayed concerning the promise of the Holy Spirit, on the one hand, and concerning what they had seen and heard while they were following the Lord for three and a half years, on the other hand.</p>
<p>At the end of the Gospels as well as at the beginning of Acts, before His ascension, the Lord charged the disciples to remain in Jerusalem to receive the promise of the Father, saying, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; (1:4, 8; cf. Luke 24:49). During those ten days, the disciples must have prayed, based on this charge, for the Holy Spirit to come upon them so that they would become the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses. In order to become the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses, they had to recall how they followed Him for three and a half years. This must have been the content of their prayer. Furthermore, when they stood up to testify on the day of Pentecost, Peter spoke concerning what they had seen and heard for three and a half years (Acts 2:14-41). The content of his first message indicates that the disciples must have prayed concerning what they saw and heard while they followed the Lord.</p>
<p>One more thing happened in those ten days: the disciples cast lots in order to choose Matthias as an apostle to take the place of Judas, who had sold the Lord (1:15-26). This can be likened to a basketball team that is ready to play basketball but discovers that one member is missing, so they must find someone to complete the team. The disciples were preparing to testify for the Lord, but they needed to make up the lack in the apostleship. They must have prayed concerning this matter. After their prayer, they took care of it. This is another item that they prayed about in those ten days. They certainly did not pray for prosperity, safety, or their health. Their prayer in those ten days must have revolved around Christ, whom they had seen for three and a half years, and the Holy Spirit, who was about to come upon them.</p>
<p>In other words, the disciples turned the Christ whom they had seen and known for three and a half years into the content of their prayer. This Christ and the Holy Spirit were the subjects of their prayer. They had previously contacted Christ by seeing and hearing Him. Now, they contacted Him with their spirit; they used their spirit to absorb what they had seen and heard. As they were praying, the ascended Christ descended upon them as the Holy Spirit and was fully joined with them. Hence, they not only contacted the Lord as the living Word but also contacted Him as the Spirit. Likewise, if we are to touch Christ, gain Him, and be fully mingled with Him in a practical way, we must learn to turn whatever we read, hear, and see into prayer with our spirit. This is the lesson of receiving the Word as the Spirit. May the Lord bless us.</p></body></html>
