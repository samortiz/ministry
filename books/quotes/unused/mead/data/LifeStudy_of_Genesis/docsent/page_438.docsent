   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SEVENTY-SIX AFTER BREAKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Timothy 3:16 says that all Scripture is God-breathed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do you believe that Genesis 34, the chapter which we shall consider in this message, is God-breathed?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to look to the Lord that He would show us how this portion of the Word is the breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was young, after I had read chapters like Genesis 34 once or twice and the story had been fixed in my memory, I skipped over them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever I came to this chapter in my reading of the Old Testament, I would remember that Jacob's daughter was defiled and that his sons mercilessly killed people and plundered the city, and I passed over it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the Lord has shown us that even this chapter is the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although there is life in this portion of the Word, it takes experience to appreciate it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After Breaking</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to apprehend the life in chapter thirty-four, we must look both backward and forward.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Prior to this chapter, Jacob had been delivered out of all his troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For twenty years, Jacob was retained under Laban's squeezing hand, and he was very troubled by this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, it was impossible for Jacob to stay with Laban any longer and he left his uncle's home.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God had told Jacob that He wanted him to return to the land of his fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jacob, however, could not forget what had happened there, for it was there that he had deceived his father Isaac and had supplanted his brother Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although he was willing to return to the land of his fathers, he had to confront the great problem of facing his brother Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, taking the word of the Lord and utilizing his skill and cleverness, he stole away from Laban, not informing him that he was leaving.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By stealing away from Laban, he overcame his first difficulty, that of being under Laban's squeezing hand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But then there was a second trouble: Laban pursued Jacob and finally caught up with him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But God intervened, telling Laban not to say anything either good or bad to Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, Jacob was wholly delivered from the hand of Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the greatest trouble facing Esau still lay in front of him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because of this, he had a long night of wrestling with an unidentified opponent who actually was the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But Jacob passed through this crisis, and the Lord delivered him from the problem with Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After this, Jacob had no more difficulties for a while.</S>
