[1]  In our study over the past five years, the Lord has shown us His ordained way for meeting and serving in the church.
[2]  The God-ordained way comprises four steps: gospel preaching; the home meetings for feeding the young ones; the group meetings for shepherding, teaching, and perfecting the saints that they may be able to carry out the work of the New Testament ministry, that is, the building up of the Body of Christ; and prophesying in the church meetings.
[3]  We know what the God-ordained way to meet and to serve is, but we do not know how to carry out that way.
[4]  In the old way of meeting, we came together in the meeting hall to listen to a brother who was knowledgeable in the Bible.
[5]  Since then we may have divided the large meeting into several group meetings.
[6]  However, in these group meetings some of the new ones may ask questions that we are not able to answer.
[7]  If we are not able to answer the new ones questions in a practical way, this indicates that we do not know how to meet in the group meetings.
[8]  We know that we should not return to the old way of meeting, so we may eventually compromise by inviting a knowledgeable brother to come to our group meeting to take care of its needs.
[9]  On the one hand, we do have the group meetings, but on the other hand, we may still be in the old way.
[10]  Although we may no longer meet under one roof but in several homes, we may still not be in the new way.
[11]  To carry out the group meetings we need to learn how to have a practical fellowship, a mutual prayer, the care for one another, and the shepherding of the young ones.
[12]  The Lord is omnipotent, but if we do not do something practically to help the brother or sister for whom we pray, our prayer may not be answered.
[13]  We may pray that the Lord meet the need of a brother who is in need of money, but the Lord may tell us that we must first meet his need from our own resources.
[14]  The group meetings should be eighty percent of the church life.
[15]  If we do not build up the group meetings, the church will be very weak.
[16]  Among us there are some older saints who love the Lord and the church but do not have the habit of attending the group meetings.
[17]  We must let the new ones know that we do not care as much for the big meetings as we care for the group meetings.
[18]  Hebrews 10:24-25 says, And let us consider one another for inciting to love and good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.
[19]  The more we study these two verses, the more we can realize that they refer to the group meetings.
[20]  If in a local church the attendance in the Lord s Day morning meeting is higher than that in the group meetings, the saints in that church are still religious and in their traditional way.
[21]  Group meetings in which the saints bubble are the proper church meetings and the proper church life.
[22]  The way for the church to practice the God-ordained way to meet and to serve is first through the exercise of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel by preaching the gospel through visiting people.
[23]  Then we need to raise up group meetings to build up the new ones, to perfect them, and to raise them up.
[24]  It has been good that we have had group meetings in the past.
[25]  However, we can always find a better way in anything we do.
[26]  If we have never been coached, we will not have the proper way.
[27]  Our group meetings of the past were better than nothing, but we must realize that they might not have been carried out in the coached way.
[28]  Paul did not have nineteen centuries of church history to study, but we have studied church history very much, not just to learn the facts of history, but mainly to discover what the best way for the church is.
[29]  Now we have learned that the top way, God s ordained, biblical way, is the way we are passing on in these messages.
[30]  If we mean business with the Lord, we must make a decision to have a radical change in our understanding concerning the Lord s way.
[31]  Then we should form a new group meeting with these new persons, and we must strictly practice the new group meeting according to the way in which we were coached.
[32]  For the sake of the group meetings, we must always be released, living, and fresh.
[33]  To go on in the Lord s new way, the God-ordained way to meet and to serve, requires much study.
[34]  We have had much speaking and teaching concerning the new way, and we have discovered many crucial points related to it.
[35]  If we have two or three spiritual children under our care, they will be our comfort, strengthening, encouragement, and daily joy year-round, and we will feel that we know the meaning of our Christian life better.
[36]  If we rise up to bear fruit and care for the young ones, we will realize our shortage.
[37]  To be a Christian we need to grow, but we may have been in the Lord and in the church for many years without the proper growth in life.
[38]  The reason we may lack the growth in life but still be content is that we do not care for fruit bearing and taking care of the young ones.
[39]  If we are not bothered today, one day we may be troubled by the Lord Jesus.
[40]  We must render care to others, but if we do not have the growth in life and are not knowledgeable concerning spiritual things, the things of God in His economy, we will not be able to care for the younger ones.
[41]  In order for the church to be fully built up, we must have proper group meetings, and for the group meetings in the practical church life, there is the need of fellowship, intercession, care, and shepherding.
[42]  The fellowship, intercession, care, and shepherding in the first section of the group meeting are the beginning and the base of the group meetings.
[43]  Meeting in the old, traditional way did not give the saints the way to release what was within them, but by our meeting in the new way, everything that is in the saints can be released.
[44]  CHAPTER SEVEN TEACHING IN THE GROUP MEETINGS THE FELLOWSHIP IN THE GROUP MEETINGS
[45]  The purpose and goal of the group meetings is the perfecting of the saints through teaching in mutuality, and the best way to carry out the teaching is by asking and answering the proper questions.
[46]  However, it is better to begin the group meetings with fellowship, intercession, care, and shepherding; these constitute the foundation of the group meetings.
[47]  In the group meetings we should not neglect the fellowship regarding the personal situation of the saints; however, neither should we overemphasize this fellowship.
[48]  If a peculiar question is asked in a group meeting for example, someone may ask when mankind began to have different colors of skin we should not answer it, but should pray and seek for a proper way to redirect the speaking to a more profitable line.
[49]  When a group meeting becomes prevailing, everyone in it will be free, but this may open the door for certain peculiar things to come in. Thus, in the group meetings we should not be bound, but neither should we be free without limitation.
[50]  If during our quick reading we do not understand certain portions of the Word, we do not need to be concerned; we may understand these portions when we read them the second time, or we may understand them after additional readings.
[51]  Reading through the Word of God in this way does not mean that we should read without help from reference books.
[52]  IN THE DILIGENT PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY Scripture Reading: Luke 14:21-23; 19:13; Rom 1:14-15; 1 Cor 9:17, 21-25; Phil 1:27; Col 1:27-29 THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL
[53]  Today our urgent need is to practice the new way diligently.
[54]  It is not sufficient merely to have a large number meeting in a local church, because they may be meeting in the way of Christianity, coming together on the Lord s Day merely to constitute a good attendance.
