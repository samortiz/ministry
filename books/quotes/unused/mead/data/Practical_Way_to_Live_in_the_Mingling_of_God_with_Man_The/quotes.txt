[1]  The Practical Way to Live in the Mingling of God with Man CONTENTS
[2]  The Eight Stages of the Christian Life in Romans
[3]  How to Experience Christ in a Practical Way Feeding on Christ and Drinking of Christ
[4]  OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE IN ROMANS Scripture Reading: Rom 3:9, 20, 24; 5:11-12, 19; 6:3-6; 7:18; 8:2, 4-6, 28-29; 12:2-5
[5]  In chapter 6 we declare, Hallelujah! but in chapter 7 we must cry out, Wretched man that I am! v. 24 . In this fifth stage we see a man who strives and struggles to do good, to keep the law of God, and to please God by himself vv.
[6]  When we rejoice that we are in Christ, the enemy often comes and subtly asks us whether or not we are in Christ.
[7]  This picture shows us one who is saved, walks according to the Spirit, is being conformed to the image of Christ, and is a member of the Body of Christ living in the Body of Christ and practicing the Body life.
[8]  Furthermore, we learned that when we realize the glorious fact that we are in Christ and Christ is in us, we will automatically be normal Christians.
[9]  Although we know that Christ is life and everything to us, we have to know more particularly who Christ is and how we can experience Him practically.
[10]  Hence, because everything of God is in Christ, Christ is the embodiment of God.
[11]  Not only so, from Colossians 1:18-19 we also know that God s desire, intention, and eternal plan is to give the first place to Christ in everything because God s pleasure is to have all His fullness dwell in Christ.
[12]  When we eat Christ, He as the Spirit comes into us and operates in a number of ways.
[13]  The more we are filled with the Holy Spirit, the more we will sense the presence of Christ.
[14]  Christ dwells within us, but it is because the Holy Spirit is within us that we know this.
[15]  When the Spirit indwells us, Christ lives in us, for Christ is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .
[16]  Since Christ is life to us and lives within us, we must daily live by Christ and not by the natural life.
[17]  To deny the natural life of the mind, emotion, and will and let Christ occupy all the parts of our being is to live by Christ, take Christ as our life, let Christ live in us, and take Christ as everything in a very practical way.
[18]  It is easy to say that we are in Christ, that Christ is in us, and that Christ is everything to us, but we need to experience these things in a practical way.
[19]  When Christ is formed in us, whenever we think, love, or decide, we will have the image of Christ and bear the expression of Christ.
[20]  This means that spontaneously Christ will be magnified through us, and our life, being, and doing will be an expression, a manifestation, of Christ Phil 1:20-21 .
[21]  As we have seen, enjoying Christ as food and drink is vital to the practical experience of Christ in a daily way.
[22]  If we eat and drink Him by reading and praying, we will think by Christ, love by Christ, decide by Christ, and have a life that is fully in Christ.
[23]  CHAPTER THREE THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN Scripture Reading: Lev 2:4; 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 8:4-6, 16
[24]  There is a mystery revealed in the Scriptures that we can never comprehend fully.
[25]  This mystery, which is revealed to us throughout the entire Bible, is the mingling of God with man.
[26]  In the Scriptures oil signifies the Holy Spirit of God, and fine flour signifies the human nature particularly that of Christ.
[27]  If we read the Scriptures carefully without any human concepts or ideas about the nature of our fellowship with God, we will realize that God s intention has much more to do with our being mingled with Him than it does with our outwardly worshipping Him.
[28]  When He was on this earth, He was both man and God He was the God-man.
[29]  Stephen s word in Acts 7 proves that even after His ascension into heaven, the Lord Jesus is not only God but also a man: Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God v. 56 . There is a man in the heavens who is the embodiment of God.
[30]  After forty years of studying the Bible, I can say with assurance that if we do not realize the mingling of God with man, we can never understand the Scriptures thoroughly.
[31]  The Scriptures tell us that originally God had the only begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ John 1:18 .
[32]  The Bible also tells us that after the death and resurrection of Christ, God had many sons, with Christ as the Firstborn among them 20:17; Heb 2:10; cf.
[33]  Because the Spirit is the reality of Christ, when the Spirit came into us, Christ Himself came into us.
[34]  If we practice this the daily giving up of our mind, emotion, and will and going along with Christ the Spirit, who is the reality of Christ, will occupy our mind, emotion, and will.
[35]  CHAPTER FIVE OUR NEED TO BE FILLED WITH CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 2:9-10; Eph 3:19
[36]  Colossians 2:9-10 says, For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and you have been made full in Him, who is the Head of all rule and authority.
[37]  These two verses say first that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ.
[38]  Then they say that we are made full in this Christ.
[39]  For us to be filled unto all the fullness of God means that we are filled to overflowing with all the riches of Christ cf.
[40]  The perfect mind is a mind that is full of Christ, the perfect emotion is an emotion that is full of Christ, and the perfect will is a will that is full of Christ.
[41]  Although the Bible does speak of morality, we must realize that the Bible s central point is Christ, who fills us and in whom we are made full.
[42]  The way for us to be filled with Christ is to simply go to Him with a sincere heart, open our spirit to Him, and tell Him how much we are occupied in our mind, emotion, will, and heart with things other than Him.
[43]  Question: Many Christians speak of living by the Holy Spirit with power.
[44]  Answer: The current teaching in much of Christianity concerning the Holy Spirit frustrates our ability to see clearly the matter of being filled with Christ.
