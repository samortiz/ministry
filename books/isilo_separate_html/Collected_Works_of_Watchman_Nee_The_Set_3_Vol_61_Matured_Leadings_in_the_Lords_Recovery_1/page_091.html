We all know that sin is evil and the world is attractive. It is impossible for us to drop the world by ourselves, but the Lord's glory enables us to drop it.</p><h2 class="head1">THINGS TO PAY ATTENTION TO<br />IN THE VISITATION WORK</h2><p>Concerning visitation we have a few more things to say.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Gossiping</h2><p>In visiting others it is best to restrict the conversation to spiritual things. We should not be loose in our talk. Those who are talkative should pay special attention to this point. It is bad enough to speak loosely at home. The consequence of loose speaking is much greater when visiting others on behalf of the church! In visiting others, we have to maintain the church's purity. We have to deal with nit-picking, criticism, and slandering as soon as they surface. The purpose of making visitations is to build up others, not to tear them down. Therefore, we must not be loose in our conversation. We should not get into right and wrong, and we should not argue.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Assuming the Place of a Teacher</h2><p>In making gospel visitations, it is inevitable that there will be some who have a problem with believing, even though they have put down their name and shown an interest in the gospel. In visiting them, we have to adopt the attitude of a learner. We should not visit them by assuming the air of a teacher. If we go as a teacher, the result will not be good. It does not take many doctrines to get a person saved. One grain of wheat can bear many grains. In the same way, one seed of the Word is enough to save a person; one does not need many doctrines for salvation. As long as there is life, there will be sprouting and growth. Some brothers continue to bring many people to the Lord through just one sentence of God or even half a sentence of God. The preaching of the gospel depends not on the preponderance of doctrines but on the impartation of life to others.</p><h2 class="head2">First Giving Our Own Testimony</h2><p>My suggestion is that the first time we visit someone, we should tell them our spiritual age and condition. We can testify, saying, "I was more or less the same as you. Although I have believed in the Lord for many years, I was unclear about many things when I first believed. Only now am I learning to serve. I may not be clear about many things, but there are one or two things that I am very clear about: My sins are forgiven, and I have joy and peace through my faith in the Lord." Once we testify to them in this way, they will be stirred up to seek the joy that we have. When they are in darkness, they rejoice in their sin, but once they come under the light, they will grieve over their sin.</p><h2 class="head2">Touching the Heart Rather Than the Head</h2><p>Next, we can say, "The church realizes that you have put down your name and expressed a desire to receive the Lord. It is sending me to come and visit." This will touch their heart. We have to seize the opportunity to contact them and touch their heart. We should not try to touch their head. After the heart is turned to the Lord, the head will pose no problem at all. Our visitation will give the new ones an impression that the church cares for them, that it takes an interest in the affairs of their soul. If they ask any question, we can defer it in a gracious way. We should not pay too much attention to their mind, but we should pay much attention to the reaction in their heart and spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Deferring to the Right Ones<br />When We Cannot Help Them</h2><p>After we have made a few visits, we should evaluate whether or not we are able to help them to get through. If we cannot, we should ask the responsible brothers to send one or two others. If they cannot help the new ones to get through, then perhaps the responsible brothers should visit them.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_090.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_092.html">Next</a> </body></html>
