   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN SALVATION BEING ETERNAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen on the positive side that all the work that God has done and all the grace that He has given us at the time we were saved cannot be annulled by the passage of time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can boldly say that once we are saved, we are eternally saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once God has shown mercy to us, we are eternally under His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once we have the eternal life of the Son of God, we will never lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although I am very bold in saying this, we human beings are still human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even today many Christian workers do not see this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because man's heart is filled with the flesh and the law, he cannot understand how God's grace can be so great.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is too incredible to him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is natural for man to think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man is of the flesh, and the flesh is of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The flesh knows only the law; it does not know grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Anything that originates from the human flesh is of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But anything that originates from God, from the Holy Spirit, and from grace, is of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the world we know nothing about grace and gift.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All we know is to barter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All day long, our minds are filled with how much we should work and how much we should get for our work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We think that in order to gain anything, we have to work for it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For years, we have bartered away our lives, our time, and our energy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We think that if one is to pay a certain price, he first has to be paid an equal amount.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If he has accepted a certain amount, then he has to offer certain things in return.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our life is a life of bartering.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because this is the way we live, we also think that God's grace and eternal life toward us are in the same principle of bartering.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we hear the clear gospel, we may see the light for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At that time, we may realize that grace is free and that it is not a matter of bartering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But this realization seems to happen only at the time we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many people still have not been delivered from the thought of God's grace as a loan to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They think that if they do not do well, God will claim back the grace He has given.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if a man knows the Bible and is clear about the ten items of truth mentioned in the previous messages, he has to admit at the very least that there can never be such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone who knows the Word of God should never doubt what he knows because of what he does not know.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since one has seen clearly the sealing and the pledging of the Holy Spirit, eternal life, the hand of the Lord, the Body of Christ, the temple of God, and the promises of the Lord, he cannot overturn what he knows with problems concerning things that he does not know or understand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot overturn the facts we know.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, there are still things we are ignorant of.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What we will do now is to take a look at some of the things that we do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will take a few of the supposedly contradictory arguments especially the more convincing ones and consider them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE KNOWLEDGE OF ETERNAL SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>NOT LEADING ONE TO SIN AT WILL</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before we consider some of the problems in the Scriptures, we have to consider one strong objection and doubt that some men raise.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some think that if a person is "once saved, always saved," such a person will surely sin more freely.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This can be considered as the most common and strongest point of objection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a man knows that he is eternally saved and will never be condemned, will he not become loose, start to commit all sorts of sins, and be bold to do anything?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since this could be the case, is not this kind of teaching very dangerous?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I remember that a man once wrote a letter to Mr. Mackintosh the one who wrote a commentary on the Pentateuch.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In that letter he told Mr. Mackintosh that he had heard a preacher a week earlier preaching on the matter of being a child of God eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A young man in the audience said that since such was the case, he could do anything he wanted to now.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Within a few days, the young man committed all sorts of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The writer of the letter complained that because of the teaching of "once a child, eternally a child," the young people had been damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In response to his letter, Mr. Mackintosh wrote, "It is true that once a person is a child of God, he is eternally a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But I doubt whether the young man you mentioned is a child of God in the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have a son.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose I were to say to my son that since he is my son, he will be my son eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Upon hearing this, would my son be so overjoyed that he would right away smash the window with a stone, break his dishes on the floor, pull off the tablecloth and roll the bowls on the floor, and do all sorts of impolite things before me?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Can there be such a person?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is true that when a person becomes a son, he is a son eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But he will not act lawlessly just because he is a son.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If he acts lawlessly, I doubt if such a one is really a son."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to the Bible, there is nothing wrong with the preacher's word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But the young man's action is totally wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To determine if a teaching is right, we can only judge it by the truth in the Bible; we cannot determine it by man's conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As teachers of the Bible, we can only be responsible for telling others what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We cannot be responsible for telling others what the Bible should say.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not have this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We know that the Word of God says that once we are a son, we are a son eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We do not know to what result this knowledge will lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The problem today is that man would not judge God's Word with God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Man likes to drag out someone from the corner and say that since man is the way he is, how can one say that a man is "once saved, eternally saved"?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is true that some believers have failed and are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is also true that some people are false ones.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is true that there are millions of believers who have different experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We can only judge them by the truth of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We cannot judge the truth of the Bible by what others have done.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We can only prove them wrong by the truth of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We cannot condemn the truth of the Bible as wrong because of what they have done.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The starting point of a Christian is the Word of God, not man's conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Today you may ask me whether you are still saved, because you lied yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I cannot ascertain whether or not you are saved based upon whether your lie was a good lie, a bad lie, a bright lie, or a dark lie.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I can only tell you what the truth of the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If this is not the case, there will be no need of the judgment seat and the great white throne.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We can only look at what the Word of God says.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We can only judge man's act by God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We can never judge God's Word by man's act.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is God's Word that says once a man is saved he is saved eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There is nothing wrong with it.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Though it is wrong for man to act irresponsibly because of this word, we still must judge everything by God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>God's Word is our complete constitution and our highest court.</S>
