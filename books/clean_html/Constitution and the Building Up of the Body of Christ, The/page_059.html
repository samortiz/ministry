<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Supporting the Believers<br>with the Power of Christ's Resurrection</H2><P>The believers are supported with the power of Christ's resurrection in long-suffering, in the uniting bond of peace, and in all the positive needs for joining together and knitting together and for the rich supply of every joint and the operation in measure of each one part. This means that in the church life, we have to be one. You have to be joined to me and I have to be joined to you. In the Lord's recovery, all of the races with all the different colors&#151;white, black, yellow, brown, and red&#151;are blended together. The peoples of this earth are all so different. How could all these peoples be one Body? There is one Body in the universe, and we express it here on earth for all to see (see chorus of Hymns, #1107). We do not want people to see divisions or opinions. This is why we need to be joined together and knit together.</P><P>The only way we can be really one is by the application of the cross and the power of Christ's resurrection. His power of resurrection is sufficient for us. He gives us the cross to bear, but He also supports us with the power of His resurrection. It is in this way that we are transformed. Paul said that he desired to know Christ and the power of His resurrection that he might be conformed to Christ's death (Phil. 3:10). We should live and serve not by our natural power, but by the power of Christ's resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Issuing in the Practical Building of God</H2><P>The constituting of the believers into precious materials through transformation issues in the practical building of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Locally in Every Local Church</H2><P>The practical building of God is locally in every local church in the harmony of the one accord stimulated by the one Spirit in the one Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Universally in the Oneness of the Divine Trinity</H2><P>This practical building is also universally in the oneness of the Divine Trinity, prayed for by the Lord (John 17) and accomplished by His lovers (John 17:26b) for the carrying out of God's eternal economy according to His good pleasure (Eph. 3:9-10; 1:9). There is the possibility of having the one accord in the local church and of enjoying the oneness universally in the Body of Christ. This all depends upon how much we love the Lord, how much we receive the Lord, how much we love His cross, and how much we live not by our energy, power, strength, and might, but by the power of His resurrection. The death of His cross and the power of His resurrection both are compounded in the compound Spirit (cf. Exo. 30:23-25). When we live by the Spirit and follow the Spirit, we have the cross and the power of Christ's resurrection.</P>
