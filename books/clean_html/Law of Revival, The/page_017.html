<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING CONSTRICTED<br />
IF WE KNOW RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Although we have tasted the sweetness of the Lord&rsquo;s love and experienced His riches, these experiences are rather shallow and are in the initial stage, in the first two chapters of Song of Songs. If we remain in this stage, one day the Lord will cause us to realize that we are constricted by a wall and cannot move and that He is the mountain-leaping and hill-skipping Christ. We are motionless and lifeless, but He is in resurrection. He will not deceive us. He shows us that there are mountains and hills on His pathway for us, but they are not a problem to those who are in resurrection, because it is easy to leap and skip over the mountains and hills. If we remain in our feelings, we will become a weak maiden who is constricted in a spiritless and lifeless room. Hence, He comes to call us out of our self, to come away and walk with Him. This is to enter into His resurrection. According to our feeling, everything is death, but according to His feeling, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone, the flowers are blooming, and the birds are singing. It is not the time to lie down inside the house but to go out and move.</p>
<p>This was Paul&rsquo;s experience while he was in prison. Even though his body was constricted in the prison, he was leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills. The prison did not constrict Paul. The books of Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and 2 Timothy reveal that he was leaping and skipping. He was not oppressed or downcast, saying, &ldquo;Formerly, I could go to Corinth and Asia, but now I cannot move freely. In the past I was received and welcomed everywhere I went, but now all have turned away from me.&rdquo; If Paul had such an attitude, he would have indeed been in prison and would have been buried there. However, Paul was not imprisoned; he was in resurrection. His spirit was not bound to a prison. Hence, in Philippians he could say, &ldquo;In like manner you also rejoice, and you rejoice together with me&rdquo; (2:18). He was able to write Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and 2 Timothy because he was not in a &ldquo;prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the prison Paul had a deeper pursuing of the Lord. Paul said that he desired &ldquo;to know [Christ] and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death&rdquo; (Phil. 3:10). This means that Paul allowed his human element to be put to death so that God&rsquo;s element could be brought forth through death. The Epistles that he wrote while in prison indicate that the element of Paul was put to death and that Christ was expressed through him. Hence, in Philippians 1:20-21 Paul said, &ldquo;Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death. For to me, to live is Christ.&rdquo; Paul could say this because he had a vision, a revelation, of resurrection, not because he enjoyed Christ&rsquo;s sweetness like a bundle of myrrh, a cluster of henna flowers, or an apple tree. These verses are not a matter of enjoyment but of seeing a vision. Paul saw and knew Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, and in this resurrection he was able to endure the sufferings that others could not endure. Prison did not constrict him; it only put to death his natural element and brought forth the element of Christ within him. Hence, the longer Paul was imprisoned, the more he was conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death, bearing Christ&rsquo;s death in his body.</p>
<p>This principle applies to our personal experience and also to the church. The churches in all the localities cannot circumvent this principle. After a period of time there will be a revival, and then after another period of time there will be a trial. The Lord uses this cycle to bring us deeper and higher so that we may know and experience Him more. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace, one day we will arrive at a stage when others will say that we are going down, but we will say, &ldquo;No, we are rising up,&rdquo; or others will say that it is winter, but we will say, &ldquo;No, the winter is past, the flowers are blooming, and the birds are singing.&rdquo; This indicates that we know resurrection. This is not merely to enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s sweetness but even more to know His resurrection. When we know His resurrection, we will be fresh, living, strong, and powerful, and we will experience the power of resurrection practically.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BROKEN IN ORDER TO<br />
EXPERIENCE THE LORD&rsquo;S DEATH<br />
AND KNOW HIS RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>We must experience the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection one day at a time and one experience at a time. Our spiritual experiences have not been arranged in order for us to remain whole. They are for us to be broken and for our human element to be put to death so that we would have a deeper knowing of Christ&rsquo;s death and His resurrection. This is to be delivered from our human element and to let God&rsquo;s element grow within us. Hence, there is no room for wishful thinking in our spiritual journey. Many things are contrary to our desire, cause us grief, and make us disheartened. This is our path, this is where we grow, and this is also where the New Jerusalem is produced. The New Jerusalem is constructed with precious stones. Precious stones are produced through intense heat and high pressure. We need heat and pressure so that we can be transformed. If we realize this, we will be at peace and will rejoice in the midst of a painful experience instead of losing heart. Just as the apostle Paul, we will be able to say, &ldquo;That I may know Christ and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.&rdquo;</p>
