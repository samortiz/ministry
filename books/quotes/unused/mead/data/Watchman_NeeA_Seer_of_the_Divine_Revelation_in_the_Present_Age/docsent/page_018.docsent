   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To Be Filled with the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Though some had been saved, I was still not satisfied, because many in the school and in the town were still not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I felt the need to be filled with the Holy Spirit and to receive power from above that I might be able to bring more people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then I called on Miss Margaret Barber.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Being immature in spiritual matters, I asked her if it was necessary to be filled with the Holy Spirit in order to obtain power to bring many to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>She answered, "Yes."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I asked her concerning the means to be filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She said, "You must present yourself to God that He may fill you with Himself."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I replied that I had already presented myself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But when I considered, I knew that I was still my old self.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I knew that God had saved me, chosen me, and called me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Though I had not yet attained absolute victory, I had been freed from sins and evil habits, and many matters hitherto entangling me had been abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, I still felt the lack of spiritual power to cope with spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then she told me the following story:</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother Prigin was an American who had been to China.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He had obtained a master's degree and was studying for a Ph.D. Feeling the condition of his spiritual life unsatisfactory, he sought the Lord and prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He said to God, "I have very strong unbelief; some sins I cannot overcome, and I have no power to work."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For two weeks he asked God specifically to fill him with the Holy Spirit that he might lead a victorious life with power.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God said, "Do you really want this?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If so, do not take the Ph.D. examination two months from now, for I have no need of a doctor of philosophy."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He felt he was in a dilemma.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Ph.D. degree seemed a sure thing; it would be a pity not to sit for the examination.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He knelt down to pray and ask why God would not allow him to get the degree and be a minister as well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But here is a strange thing: Once God has made a demand, He sticks to it and never compromises with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The following two months were most painful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the last Saturday of that period he experienced real conflict within.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Did he want the degree or did he want to be filled with the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Which was better: a doctor's degree or a victorious life?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Others could be doctors and yet be used by God as well why couldn't he?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was struggling and reasoning with God and was at his wits' end. The Ph.D. was dear to him and so was the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But God would not give way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To choose a doctor's degree would make it impossible to live the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To live the spiritual life would require forfeiting a doctor's degree.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At length, with tears in his eyes, he said, "I submit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Despite my two years' study toward a Ph.D. degree, a goal which I have cherished for thirty years, ever since childhood, I have no alternative but to relinquish sitting for the examination for the sake of submission to God."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Following this decision he wrote to notify the university authorities that he would not sit for the examination on Monday, thus abandoning hope for a Ph.D. degree once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was so exhausted that night that he could find no message to deliver the following day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So he simply told the congregation the story of his surrender to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On that day the congregation was revived.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Three-quarters of them were in tears.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He himself also gained strength.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He said, "If I had known before that the result would be like this, I would have submitted earlier."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His subsequent work was greatly blessed by the Lord, and he was one who had the deepest knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When I visited England, I intended to go on to the United States to meet him, but the Lord took him before I had the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But when I heard this testimony, I said to the Lord, "I am willing to remove anything standing between God and me in order to be filled with the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Between 1920 and 1922 I went to at least two or three hundred people to confess offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After a further strict scrutiny of past events, I felt there was still something between God and me; otherwise, I would have had spiritual vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But despite further dealings in many ways, I still could not gain strength.</S>
