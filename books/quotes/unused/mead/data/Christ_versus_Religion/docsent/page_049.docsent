   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ORGAN TO USE THE KEYS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the organ for us to use these two keys?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our hand, we know, is the proper organ to turn the key to open the door of our house.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To somehow manipulate our mouth or our toes to turn the key would be extremely absurd.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Likewise, the proper organ for us to use the keys of the Spirit and the Word is not our mentality or our will, but our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must exercise our human spirit; we must stay in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever we pray, we must pray in our spirit; whenever we pray-read the Word, we must pray-read with our spirit; whenever we say, "O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah," we must say it by exercising our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible may either be a book of letters or a book full of words as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The kind of Bible we have depends upon which organ we use to contact it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we contact the Bible by our mentality, it is merely a book of letters to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we contact the Bible, however, by exercising our spirit, it immediately becomes a book of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Apostle Paul said in 2 Corinthians 3:6, "The letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul, in referring to the letter which kills, was referring to the written Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we contact the Scriptures with our mind, it becomes the killing letters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The same book may be either killing letters or the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all must realize firstly that we have such a Christ a Christ for our happiness, a Christ for our rest, a Christ as our Lawgiver and Predictor, and a Christ as the Life-giver.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But we must also realize that this Christ today is the Spirit and is in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now, if we would contact this Christ, we need to exercise our spirit to pray-read the Word or simply to call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we would do this, we would continually contact Christ and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Have you ever changed your way in dealing with the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am much concerned that you are still cleaving to your old way of reading and studying the Bible by exercising your mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Are you still in the old way?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes, no doubt, in your study of the Bible you have received some life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But I believe that most of the time you have been deadened and killed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is simply because you have used the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The new way and best way is that whenever you come to the Bible, at the same time you come to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Always combine coming to the Bible with coming to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you come to the Bible, you must open your spirit and mouth to call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whatever verse, whatever sentence you read, read it by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Always mingle your reading of the Scriptures with calling on the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Try it!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You will see the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You may say then, "Should we not understand the Bible?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Leave this matter to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Just pray-read; the Lord will take care of your understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I guarantee that if you faithfully pray-read the Word of God, you will understand the Bible much better than all the others who do not pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let us use for an illustration a match.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The match stick, it is true, is made of wood, but in essence the match is really phosphorus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The meaning of the word phosphorus is "light-bearer."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>II Peter 1:19 refers to the Lord as the day-star: that term "day-star" in Greek is the word phosphorus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is the phosphorus, the light-bearer, shining in the darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now suppose I want to use the match: what shall I do?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Of course, I must strike it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But how shall I strike it?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If I strike it, using the end without the phosphorus, though I strike till eternity I will get no light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am using the wrong end. The Bible is the match, and the Lord Jesus, the Spirit, is the phosphorus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The wooden stick may be likened to the black and white letters, the words in the Bible, which hold Christ as the phosphorus, the heavenly day-star.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How can we make the phosphorus take fire and shine?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must use the right end of the match, and we must strike it on the right spot.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The right end is the Holy Spirit, and the right spot is our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must not care so much for the black and white letters that is tantamount to concentrating on the wooden stick of the match.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All our focus should be on the end with the phosphorus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We do have the letters of the written Word, but we must not pay too much attention to them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must concentrate on the heavenly phosphorus in the Word, Christ the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>And we must strike this end in the right place, our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How many Christians there are who are "striking" the Bible in the area of their mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Little wonder that they never catch fire.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need the stick to hold the phosphorus, no doubt; we need the written Word, the black and white letters, to contain Christ, the heavenly phosphorus.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But it is the phosphorus, it is the Spirit, that burns and gives the light.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must strike the right end, and we must strike the right end at the right spot.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must take the written Word and strike the Lord who is the Spirit upon our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Immediately we will get the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It really works.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you stay with the Bible for half an hour or even an hour and get no fire, you are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I can tell you, just after two minutes of, "O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the beginning was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>O Lord Jesus, You are the Word!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Amen, Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hallelujah!" you will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the right way to contact the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You have to strike the Lord Jesus, the heavenly phosphorus in the Word, upon your human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Try the new way, and you will give up the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Every time you come to the Word in this new way it will burn and shine upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Praise the Lord, we have the keys, we have the organ, and we have the way to contact and enjoy such a wonderful Christ.</S>
