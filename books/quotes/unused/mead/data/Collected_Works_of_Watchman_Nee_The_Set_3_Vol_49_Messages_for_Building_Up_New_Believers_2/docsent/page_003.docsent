   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>EXAMPLES OF WITNESSING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us consider four portions of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are good examples of witnessing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. Going into the City to Tell Others</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John 4 the Lord told the Samaritan woman about the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By this she realized that no one on earth can find satisfaction without the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everyone who drinks of the water from the well will thirst again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No matter how many times man drinks of that water, he will thirst again; he is never satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only by drinking the Lord's water will we not thirst again, because there is a spring that will flow out of us and satisfy us continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only this inner satisfaction can give us true satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Samaritan woman had been married five times.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>She married one man after another; she had changed her husband five times, yet she was still not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She was a person who drank again and again but was never satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even the man who was with her at that time was not her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She, undoubtedly, was not a satisfied person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the Lord had the living water that could satisfy her.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord showed her who He was, and when she had Him, she left her waterpot and went away into the city, saying, "Come, see a man who told me all that I have done.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Is this not the Christ?" v. 29 . Her first reaction was to testify to others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What did she testify?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She testified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps the people in the city knew something about her, but there were probably many things which they did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet the Lord told her everything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She testified to others, saying, "Is this not the Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The moment she saw the Lord, she opened her mouth to invite others to find out whether He was the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a result of the woman's word, many believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every Christian has an obligation to be a witness and to introduce the Lord to others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord has saved a great sinner such as me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If He is not the Christ, who else can He be?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If He is not the Son of God, who else can He be?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have no choice but to open my mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have to open my mouth to testify.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although I may not know how to give a message, at least I know that He is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I know He is the Son of God, the God-appointed Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have seen that I am a sinner, and I know that the Lord has saved me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I cannot explain what has happened to me, but I can ask others to come and see what a great change has occurred in me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I do not know how it came about.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Formerly, I considered myself a good man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now I see myself as a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord has shown me my sins, things which I did not realize were sins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now I know the kind of person I am.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I committed many sins in the past which others did not know about and which even I myself may not have known about.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I committed many sins, yet I did not realize that they were sins.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here is a man who told me everything I have done.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He told me what I already knew, and He also told me what I did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I can only confess that I have touched Christ and have met the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here is a man who told me that the "husband" I had was not my husband.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He told me that if I drank of this water, I would thirst again and come back for more.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How true were those words!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Come and see.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Is He not the Savior?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Is He not the Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Is He not the only One who can save us?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All those who have seen that they are sinners surely have a testimony to give.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those who have seen the Savior also have a testimony to give.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This woman gave her testimony within a few hours after she had met the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It was something that happened on the same day, not something that happened a few years later when she returned from a revival meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>She witnessed to others immediately after she returned to the city.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once a person is saved, he should tell others what he has seen and understood immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not speak what you do not know, and do not give a long discourse.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Just tell them what you know.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is all you need to testify; you only have to tell others how you feel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some can say, "I was so depressed before I believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But now that I have believed in the Lord, I have become so happy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the past I pursued many things but was never satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now there is an unspeakable sweetness within.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Before I believed in the Lord I could not sleep at night.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But now I can sleep well.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I used to be full of anxiety and bitterness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But now I feel peace and joy wherever I go."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You can tell others what you have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You do not need to tell them what you cannot say.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You do not need to tell them what you do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Do not speak anything beyond what you know or beyond your present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>That may stir up arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Present yourself to others as a living witness.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They will have nothing to say.</S>
