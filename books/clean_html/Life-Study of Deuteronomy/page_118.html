<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Concerning Levi</H2><P>The blessing concerning Levi is very rich (vv. 8-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Jehovah's Thummim and Urim<br>Being with His Godly Men</H2><P>First, Moses said that Jehovah's Thummim and Urim would be with His godly men, whom He tested at the waters of Meribah. Levi had said of his father and mother, "I do not regard him," and his brothers he did not acknowledge, and his children he did not recognize. Levi had thus kept Jehovah's speaking and had guarded His covenant (vv. 8-9). This indicates that Levi cared not for his relatives but for God's interests.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Levi Showing Jacob<br>Jehovah's Judgments and Israel His Law</H2><P>Second, Moses said that those of Levi would show Jacob Jehovah's judgments and Israel His law. Also, they would put incense before His nostrils and whole burnt offerings upon His altar (v. 10). The altar for incense was inside the tabernacle, and the altar for offerings was outside. Levi would serve God at both altars.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Jehovah Blessing His Might<br>and Accepting the Work of His Hands</H2><P>Third, Moses asked Jehovah to bless Levi's might (or, substance) and accept the work of his hands (v. 11a) and to wound thoroughly the loins of those who would rise up against him. Of those who hate Levi, Moses prayed that they would not rise up again (v. 11b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Concerning Benjamin</H2><P>Concerning Benjamin (v. 12), Moses said, "The beloved of Jehovah shall dwell securely beside Him." This is a matter of geography, indicating that Benjamin would be close to Jerusalem, the location of God's dwelling place, and thus would be God's neighbor. He would dwell securely by God, who would "cover over him all the day." Furthermore, He would dwell between Benjamin's shoulders. According to geography, Benjamin is shaped like two shoulders, and Jerusalem is located between them. Hence, the Lord would dwell between the shoulders of Benjamin.</P>
