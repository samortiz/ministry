   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Delivered from Self-love</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>During these years you have accumulated enough knowledge and heard enough messages, but you have not denied yourself enough.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You are still very self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who are discouraged are all self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The same is true with those who love themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In fact, a self-loving person is very easily discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Your thoughts are more active and stubborn than others'.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Your thoughts probably have gone beyond the spiritual reality you have attained within.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are not real, but false.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When a brother rebukes you, your mind suffers a blow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then your thoughts, which should fall only to the level of the reality you have attained, fall below this point, and you become discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A self-loving person is very easily discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A mark of those who do not love themselves is that they refuse to spend too much time thinking about themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A self-loving person devotes much energy thinking about himself and loving himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are two reasons a person cries.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, he is smitten by God, and he cries on account of God's dealing and breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, he feels sorry for himself because he loves and pities himself too much after God's smiting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the first kind of crying, there can be praises in the midst of weeping; one acknowledges that what the Lord is doing is right.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With the second kind, there is only self-love in the crying.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One kind of crying is the result of God's breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The other kind of crying is the result of self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our brother is very strong in his mind on the one hand, and very indulgent in self-love on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For years you have not been able to give up your self.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You must reach the point where you no longer think about your self.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have to make a resolution to ignore your self and let your self go from now on.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you do this, your problem will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Accepting the Dealing of the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In your speaking, your spirit was coarse.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The feelings of your spirit also were very coarse.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a man has not been smitten and ground by God, his spirit is surely coarse.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The degree of fineness of a man's spirit is determined by the amount of breaking and grinding he has received from God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not right for our brother to be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The cross never discourages a man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The cross always leads to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since the time of creation, there has been nothing more positive than resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The cross is very positive because it removes all the undesirable elements in man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's dealings only cause us to be discouraged about ourselves; they do not cause us to be discouraged about God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is right for us to be discouraged about ourselves, but we have to be positive towards God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are two results to God's dealings through the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First, we become defeated, useless, and knocked out on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Second, we experience resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's smiting is not merely to ruin and destroy a man, but it is also to cause him to rise up once the smiting work is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The smiting of the cross ushers us into the realm of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some cannot rise up again after they pass through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that they are sick and sunken in self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The cross is not the last thing that happens to a man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is a necessary pathway to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The smiting of the cross may be severe, but it enables a person to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The work of the cross destroys a man completely, even to the point of death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the same time, however, on the other side of the grave, there arises the hope with God; one feels he can rise and have faith again through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Discouragement is not breaking; it is self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is wrong for you to be discouraged for so long.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You should say to God, "I am hopeless in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I am a hopeless man, but with You there is hope.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You are the God of all hope."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Ignoring Confusing Thoughts</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You have to learn to continually turn your thoughts away from introspection.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not look inward or analyze yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Introspection and self-analysis will never help us obtain deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sometimes we wonder how we can understand the things of God without using our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But many thoughts will not solve our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They are all lies.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The best course for you to take is to not turn your mind inward at all.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you are wrong, you have to ask the Lord for His shining and judgment to tell you what is right and what is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do not try to replace God's light with your own thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If God does not enlighten you, forget about whether or not your inward condition is good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Just take care of God's light, and ignore your own thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You should pray, "Lord, give me light and let me see.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I will not replace Your shining with my own thoughts."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>No one can know whether or not he is right in himself by exercising his own thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only light will show us where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is no need to set our mind upon ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Simply drop the thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What happens after they are dropped is none of our business.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we try to make it our business, we will come under the enemy's attack.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Every self-loving person is under the enemy's attack.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The best course of action is to ignore confusing thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should simply hand ourselves over to the Lord and fling everything into His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we do this, the enemy will not be able to attack us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Forget about your own confusing thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Do not pay any attention to them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As long as you do not consider yourself so lovable, you will not be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You should not cherish any love for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Revelation 12:11 says that the brothers overcome Satan by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Only those who do not love their own soul-life will overcome Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>You have to look to the Lord absolutely and be freed from your own thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You have to believe that you are crucified with the Lord and are resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If you can ignore the confusing thoughts, you will run a straight course, and your spirit will become tender and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Forget about all your problems and resolutely cast your self aside.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you do this, you will find a straight pathway in front of you.</S>
