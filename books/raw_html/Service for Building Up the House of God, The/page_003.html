        <h2 class="head1">CONSECRATING OURSELVES FOR<br />
THE BUILDING OF GOD</h2>
<p>In the Epistles the apostles wrote that God desires a house. The Epistle to the Romans is concerning the Christian life, but chapter 12 is concerning the Body in coordination. All the saved ones need to become one Body in Christ and be coordinated as members one of another (vv. 4-5). According to man&rsquo;s view, a believer who is spiritual is one who experiences chapters 1 through 8; that is, after believing, he advances to living in the spirit and walking according to the spirit (8:4). However, after chapter 8 the apostle revealed the Body of Christ in chapter 12. In this chapter he exhorted the saints in Rome to consecrate themselves, that is, to present their bodies a living sacrifice, for the realization of the Body of Christ (v. 1). Chapter 12 speaks of the human body and the Body of Christ. It seems as though a believer who is spiritual because he lives in the spirit and walks according to the spirit has reached the peak of the Christian life. However, this is still not adequate. He needs to experience consecration. He needs to present himself as a spiritual person, that is, as a person living in the spirit and walking according to the spirit. He needs to present his body so that he can be a member for the building up of the Body of Christ. God is focused on the Body of Christ. His desire is that we present our bodies to accomplish the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Some saints live in chapter 8. They are spiritual. They walk according to the spirit, and they live in the Lord. Regrettably, however, they are individualistic; they are spiritual individuals. They do not know the church, and they have not seen the Body of Christ. It is true that they are spiritual, but they do not coordinate with other members. They are spiritual by themselves. Their spirituality is isolated and individualistic. They do not know what it means to coordinate with others, that is, to be members one of another. They feel that it is all right to do everything by themselves. They live before God by themselves, read the Bible by themselves, pray by themselves, fellowship with the Lord by themselves, preach the gospel by themselves, and visit other saints by themselves. It is true that they express the condition in chapter 8. They not only walk according to the spirit, but they also know that all things work together to conform them to the image of God&rsquo;s Son (vv. 28-29). Hence, they are able to learn precious lessons of life by accepting the outward dealings in their environment. However, they remain in chapter 8 and do not advance to chapter 12.</p>
<p>Such believers have not entered the experience of consecration according to chapter 12. This experience of consecration does not refer to the experience of consecration that they had at the beginning of their Christian life. Rather, it is the consecration of a rather mature and spiritual Christian. We need the experience of consecrating our spirituality and presenting our bodies to God as a living sacrifice so that we may be members living in the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING MEMBERS ONE OF ANOTHER<br />
TO BECOME ONE BODY</h2>
<p>What does it mean to be members of the Body? Suppose a brother and I are both capable. He can run, and I can run. He can speak, and I can speak. He can do everything, and I can do everything. In this situation neither of us is a member. He is an individual, and I am also an individual. Since we each have a body, we can do everything by ourselves without relying on each other. However, a hand can do only what a hand is meant to do. It must depend on other members to do other things. The hand needs the mouth as well as the feet. Likewise, the mouth needs the hands as well as the feet. Every member needs all the other members.</p>
<p>Being a member is not a matter of doctrine. Being a member is a matter of our seeing and of our consciousness. It is not useful to merely understand the doctrine of being a member. Have we seen that we are a member, and are we conscious of being a member, or do we still consider ourselves to be a body? A body can do everything and knows how to do everything. It can run, it can gesture, it can speak, it can hear, and it can see. A body is all-capable. In contrast, a member can function only according to what it is. The hand is the hand, the eye is the eye, the ear is the ear, and the foot is the foot. First Corinthians 12:21 says, &ldquo;The eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.&rdquo; This is what it means to be members one of another.</p>
<p>We should ask ourselves whether we sense a need for the other brothers and sisters. Do we feel that we can read the Bible, pray, give testimonies, shepherd others, and even engage in spiritual warfare by ourselves and that we do not need the other saints? Or do we sense that we are merely members who need the other saints, for without them we cannot do anything? There is a great difference in these two situations. If we are truly living as a member of the Body of Christ, we will sense a need for the other saints in everything.</p>
<p>Take reading the Bible as an example. Although a brother can read the Bible by himself, he still may feel a need to read the Bible with the saints. He needs them to be his eyes and his understanding so that he may have a deeper comprehension of the Bible. The same applies to prayer. Although he can pray by himself, and he also knows how to pray, the other saints often utter what he is unable to utter when he prays alone. He may have a sense within that he is unable to express in prayer, but when another brother prays, that sense is expressed. Thus, even in the matter of prayer we cannot be individuals.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother has been visiting a weak saint, and no matter what the brother does, the saint&rsquo;s condition remains the same. The brother may know and understand the saint&rsquo;s problem and be willing to help solve the problem, but nothing changes. If this brother would be willing to take another brother with him, however, the weak saint would be released. We need other members when we visit the saints.</p>
<p>To know the Body of Christ is to realize that we are only members and that we cannot do anything without others. When I was a young Christian, I felt quite capable, but now I cannot do anything apart from the brothers and sisters. I often have the feeling to ask a brother to pray with me. Even when I give a message, I desire to have four brothers standing next to me&mdash;not sitting in chairs but standing with me. For instance, suppose we have a gospel meeting, and eight thousand people come to listen to the gospel. We can have fifty brothers standing on the podium. When one brother is speaking, the other forty-nine brothers are supporting him. One brother says, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord,&rdquo; and forty-nine brothers say, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; One brother says, &ldquo;Repent and believe in Jesus,&rdquo; and forty-nine brothers say, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; Such a gospel meeting would be full of impact. This was the situation when the apostles preached the gospel at Pentecost.</p>
<p>When the church gathers together to pray, a sister&rsquo;s prayer can touch others. However, if the same sister prays by herself, her prayer will not have so much inspiration. She might run out of words after three or five sentences. It is amazing that when she prays with other saints, words pour forth. This is the supply of the Body. This is the mutual supply among the members.</p>
<p>When I give messages from the podium, it seems as if I am the one speaking. However, I can speak because the saints are here. The words that I speak come from the Body and are through the Body. If no one were in this room, I surely would not be able to continue after speaking five sentences. It is because of you that I am able to speak continually and unceasingly. Hence, even in giving messages we need the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Every believer is but a member. You may be as small as a little finger, or you may be as big as an arm. No matter what you are, you are simply a member, and as such, you need to be coordinated with other members. Every believer must mature to the extent that he cannot be separated from other believers.</p>
<p>Some brothers pray for the subject of a message. A subject obtained in this way is not the issue of prayer; it is actually &ldquo;dug out&rdquo; from the mind. This is not God&rsquo;s way. Paul did not pray for a subject before he wrote the Epistles to the Corinthians, nor did Peter or John pray for a subject before writing an Epistle. The Epistles were not written in this way. Paul wrote the first Epistle to the Corinthians because he was in contact with the church in Corinth and knew their problems. These problems became the source of his subject. For example, there were divisions and strifes among the Corinthians (1:10-11), so he wrote to them concerning Christ, saying, &ldquo;Is Christ divided?&rdquo; (v. 13). He also said, &ldquo;If there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and do you not walk according to the manner of man? For when someone says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are you not men of flesh?&rdquo; (3:3-4). This example shows that the believers were the source of Paul&rsquo;s Epistles.</p>
<p>Whenever I do not have a subject for a message, I fellowship with some brothers and ask, &ldquo;Brothers, how are you? What is the situation of the saints? How are the meetings in your district?&rdquo; From what they say, I receive a subject for a message. As a result, the saints feel that the messages are relevant and practical. Little do they realize that they have supplied my subject and my words.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is for us to be members one of another and thereby become one Body. God does not want people merely to be saved or to be spiritual. He wants much more. He wants people to become members of the Body of Christ and of His household. He wants people to be saved and believers to be spiritual so that they may become the Body, which is also His house. The church is the Body and the house of God. To Christ, the church is His Body; to God, the church is His house. This is what God desires. We must see this in order to have the consciousness that we are merely members who need other saints. We need to be coordinated together. We cannot be independent Christians, nor can we be individualistic. God wants a house, and we need this house. Christ wants a Body, and we need this Body. We must have such a clear vision of this need and a strong consciousness of this need.</p>
<p>Many saints are not satisfied with their local church. Some have said, &ldquo;Since the condition of the church is so poor, I do not need to go to the meetings anymore. I will read the Bible and pray by myself.&rdquo; This sounds reasonable, but those who stop attending the meetings eventually fall away. It seems as though the church meetings are of little profit and that it is better to read the Bible and pray alone. However, a short while after they stop attending the meetings, they stop reading the Bible and praying as well. Eventually, they end up watching movies instead. Even the weakest meeting is a help to us. At the very least, it can keep us from falling. We need to see that a Christian cannot be alone. We must remain in the church. We must know this fact and have this consciousness.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
