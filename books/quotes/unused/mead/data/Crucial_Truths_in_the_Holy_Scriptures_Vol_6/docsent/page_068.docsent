   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These verses speak of three signs related to the Lord s second coming: wars, famines, and earthquakes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nation people fighting against nation denotes civil war, and kingdom fighting against kingdom denotes international war.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These two types of fighting will occur frequently in the last days.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>History also shows that famine follows war.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the last days there will be many wars and severe famines.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Over nineteen hundred years ago, when the Lord spoke this word concerning earthquakes, there were very few earthquakes, but now earthquakes occur almost daily.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Difficult times will come.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, savage, not lovers of good, traitors, reckless, blinded with pride, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having an outward form of godliness, though denying its power 2 Tim 3:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These verses describe the condition of human society at the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Each of the things spoken of here can be called a sign of the Lord s second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first condition is that men will be lovers of self and lovers of money.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today it is hard to find anyone who does not love himself or love money.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the last days men will love themselves the most, followed closely by money.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Man s lover will be money.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There also will be boasting, arrogance, reviling, and the blaspheming of God.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today there are people who teach and without natural promote disobedience to parents and being unthankful, unholy, affection, and implacable.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such ones are nearly the same as beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today there are also many who are slanderers, without self-control, savage, and nonlovers of good, who are traitors, reckless, and blinded with pride.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>People today do not want to be restricted; they all do things recklessly and arrogantly under the guise of freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is also a particular characteristic of people today to be lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Pleasure is simply entertainment, involving all kinds of amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>People today are lovers of pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Movie theaters are full for almost every show, and often there are no empty seats at bars and dance halls.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Gambling and travel are also frequent pleasures among people today.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There are pleasures for those in the upper class and pleasures for those in the lower classes.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>People love every kind of pleasure, but they do not love God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Furthermore, they have an outward form of godliness but deny its power.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>These are all signs of the Lord s second coming, and they should remind us that we must watch and be prepared for the Lord to come.</S>

   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You have stored up treasure in the last days James 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the last days people will love to store up treasure because they will be lovers of money.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is a sign of the Lord s second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even as it happened in the days of Noah, so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man: they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage...Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building Luke 17:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>These verses describe the condition of the people in the days of Noah: they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, and they were being given in marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When speaking of the condition of the people in the days of Lot, the condition of buying, selling, planting, and building are added.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>According to the Lord, the condition of the people in the day of His return will be the same as it was in the days of Noah and Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Eating, drinking, marrying, being given in marriage, buying, selling, planting, and building seemingly are the most important matters in human society today.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>People strongly promote these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Nothing that a person does today can be separated from these things.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The emphasis on these matters is a strong sign that the day of the Lord s second coming is near.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>6.</S>

   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They will not tolerate the healthy teaching; but according to their own lusts they will heap up to themselves teachers, having itching ears, and they will turn away their ear from the truth and will be turned aside to myths 2 Tim 4:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Another sign of the Lord s coming is that people will not tolerate the healthy teaching but according to their own lusts will heap up to themselves teachers, have itching ears, and turn away their ears from the truth and be turned aside to myths.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Believers today truly are in this condition.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we speak the healthy teaching to them, they feel it is dry and boring, and they become restless.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They like to hear myths and teachings that are according to their own lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is an abnormal condition and tells us that the day of the Lord s second coming is near.</S>

   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The fig tree represents the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In Matthew 21:18-20 the fig tree, the symbol of the nation of Israel, was cursed by the Lord and withered because it did not produce fruit for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The Jews lost their nation and were scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>According to prophecies in the Bible, however, the Jews will recover their nation.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The Lord s word concerning the fig tree branch becoming tender and putting forth its leaves refers to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When Israel, like the fig tree, becomes tender and puts forth leaves, the Lord said that His coming would be near.</S>

   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>These are signs that the withered fig tree is growing tender in its branches and putting forth new leaves.</S>

   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>People in the world desire peace and security, but when they say, Peace and security, that is, when they feel safe and peaceful, sudden destruction will come upon them.</S>
