<h2 class="head2">The Triune God&rsquo;s Operating in the Believers</h2>
<p>The second crucial point for our experience of Christ in Philippians 2 is found in verse 13. This verse says, &ldquo;For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;for&rdquo; in verse 13 connects this verse to verse 12, and the phrase &ldquo;so then&rdquo; in verse 12 connects this portion to verses 5 through 11, which tell us to let the living mind of Christ be in us to transform us that we may live a mingled life of God and man. By this we live Christ and magnify Christ. Based on this, verse 12 says, &ldquo;So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only as in my presence, but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.&rdquo; Some may use this verse to argue that salvation is not by faith but by works. However, salvation here is not the eternal salvation from eternal perdition. Salvation here as in chapter one is our daily salvation. To work out our salvation is to live out our salvation with fear and trembling.</p>
<p>According to verse 14 this daily salvation saves us from murmurings and reasonings. These two small &ldquo;gophers&rdquo; require a very powerful, practical, daily salvation. Without this strong and practical daily salvation we will all remain in murmurings and reasonings. Therefore, we need a divine operation. Verse 13 says that it is God who operates in you. God here is not simply God the Father, but rather is the processed Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. It is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit who operate in us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure. When we let the living mind of Christ be in us, we live a life that is a mingled life, and we will experience the Triune God operating in us. He is operating in us both the willing and the working. The willing is a decision within, and the working is an action without to carry out the decision within.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Holding Forth the Word of Life as Luminaries</h2>
<p>The third crucial point in chapter two is found in verses 15 and 16 which tell us that we are to hold forth the word of life as luminaries. As the luminaries hold forth the light of the sun, we as luminaries of Christ hold forth the word of life. Holding forth strongly implies speaking. If we do not speak the word of life, how could we hold it forth? If we let Christ&rsquo;s living mind be in us doing His transforming work, then we can experience the Triune God operating in us. Right away we become the luminaries of Christ speaking His word of life. This is the experience of Christ in chapter two.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Counting All Things Refuse<br />
for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ</h2>
<p>Chapter three verse 8 speaks of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. Paul does not say the excellency of Christ, but the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. To experience Christ we firstly need the knowledge of Christ. We must know Him. This chapter stresses very much the knowledge of Christ. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection.&rdquo; Therefore, to know Him is crucial to our experience of Him. We cannot experience Him without knowing Him. The knowledge of Christ is excellent, and this knowledge is even an excellency. Paul counted everything refuse, rubbish, dog food, for the excellency of knowing Christ. Most readers of Philippians 3 consider the excellency here to be the excellency of Christ the Person. However, this is not correct. We must stress here the knowing of Christ. Christ Himself stressed that He would build His church not upon Himself as the rock but upon the revelation concerning Him. The revelation is for knowing. Without the revelation concerning Christ surely we could not know Him. We need this revelation to know Christ. When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, Christ was there, having passed through all the major steps, perfected, completed, and consummated in full. However, Saul of Tarsus had no knowledge concerning this Christ. On his way to Damascus the day dawned and the light came. He began to see the vision, the revelation concerning Christ (Acts 26:19). By seeing this vision he gained a knowledge, and that knowledge became to him a treasure, an excellency. For this knowledge which he treasured, he counted everything as refuse, dregs, rubbish, filth, which is thrown to the dogs, the dog food or dung.</p>
<p>Among all the things which Paul counted dung the first was the religious or Judaic things. In verses 5 and 6 he gives us a list of his Judaic status. He counted not only these things as loss but also all things, including rank, position, fame, and wealth. The loss of all things to Paul was the loss not only of his Jewish status but of everything.</p>
