   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO EXPERIENCE THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Apparently, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is hard to experience, but in actuality it is very easy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It depends on several things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, it depends on our need.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do we truly sense the need for the outpouring of the Spirit, or are we just talking about it?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many Christians today do not sense the need of the Holy Spirit upon them as power.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should ask the Lord to cause us to sense the need.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have the Spirit already, but we need to apply the Spirit and experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do not have the need, there is no need to talk about this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second, we need a special, specific consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we sense the need, we must consecrate ourselves again to experience the Holy Spirit as power upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Third, we must be obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Acts 5:32 says that God gives the Holy Spirit to those who obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we never deal with the Lord, we will not know how disobedient we are.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the previous century, a certain sister sought the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Seeking this experience, she prayed and consecrated herself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Women at that time had long hair, which they wore high on their head.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When this sister prayed, she sensed that the Lord was demanding that she "tear down the tower" on her head by cutting her hair.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, she would not obey.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One night when meeting with some Christians, she prayed, "Lord give me the experience," but the Lord said, "Give me your hair."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually she made the decision to obey the Lord and cut her hair, and at that very moment she experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I met another sister who lived outside of Beijing, the ancient capital of China.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She came from country people who lived on farms.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before she was saved, a large chicken belonging to her neighbor wandered on to her farm, and she caught it and killed it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the neighbor came to find the chicken, she lied and said that she did not know where it was.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After a few years she was saved, and in the church there was much prayer for the experience of the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She also was one seeking this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For many days whenever she knelt down to pray to the Lord for the power of the Holy Spirit, her prayer had no answer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, the thought of a large chicken came to her mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One day she remembered how she had taken her neighbor's chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She bought a chicken larger than the first one, took it to the neighbor, and confessed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Immediately after that she received the experience of the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are many stories such as these.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some persons could not experience the power of the Holy Spirit simply due to one sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This shows us how we must be obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we sense the need for the Spirit and we consecrate ourselves to the Lord, we must be obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Fourth, if there is no struggle between us and the Lord, we may simply receive the experience of the Spirit by claiming it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not care about our feelings; we should just receive by claiming.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have had many personal experiences of this kind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I know that to serve the Lord I need power, so I sense the desperate need of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Second, I consecrate myself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Third, I fear only one thing, that is, a struggle between me and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Struggling with the Lord is awful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To have a struggle with the Lord is serious.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There have been many false rumors about me, but by the grace of the Lord I am not afraid of them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The only thing I am afraid of is a struggle between me and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as there is no struggle between me and the Lord, I am afraid of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If there is a struggling between you and the Lord, I beg you to deal with it right away.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then you can receive the experience of the Spirit by claiming it.</S>
