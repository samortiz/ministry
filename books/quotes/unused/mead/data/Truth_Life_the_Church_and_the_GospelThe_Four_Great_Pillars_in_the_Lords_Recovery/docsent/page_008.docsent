   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE LEARNING AND EXPLAINING THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What delights us beyond all else in the church is seeing so many young people being raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we see the older people, we also cannot help but smile, because they are the fathers, the base of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without the older ones, there would be no young people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, when we see the young ones, our hearts leap for joy because they are the future of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, when the young people rise up to serve, our joy is magnified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, those who serve practically in the churches in every place, especially the young ones, must learn some skills and secrets.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since you have a heart to serve, you must learn how to lead the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you do not know how to lead others, how can you serve?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you do not have any ability, how then can you lead?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, I hope that we would all learn some solid lessons in the matter of service.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE WHOLE EARTH NEEDING</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE GOSPEL AND THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul said that he was sent not only to preach the gospel but also to teach the truth 1 Tim 2:7; 2 Tim 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that it is not sufficient just to preach the gospel; we should also teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The main emphasis of the Bible is the gospel and the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The gospel is God Himself, and the truth is also God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must study the Bible thoroughly until we can see that the gospel is God Himself and that the truth is also God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The gospel is not merely a kind of message but God Himself; the truth is not merely a doctrine but God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must have the realization that what the whole earth needs today is the gospel and the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible was completed two thousand years ago and was given to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Unfortunately, due to the degradation of the church, the light of the gospel dissipated and the light of the truth also became dim.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From the history of the church, we see that after the apostles passed away, the light of the gospel and of the truth gradually faded until the seventh century when it was totally lost for a duration of ten centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>World history calls this period the Dark Ages.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then came the time of the Reformation when the primary work of the reformers was to release the truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From then on the light of the truth began to rise like the sun from the east at daybreak.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Slowly the long night passed away and a ray of morning sun began to appear.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although the light at that time was weak, it shone more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today it can be said that the light of the gospel and of the truth is shining as bright and full as the sun at noonday.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, much of the light of the gospel and of the truth has been released only within the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Outside of the publications in the Lord s recovery, the most recent light one can find is light that was released in the middle of the nineteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may say that the light in Christian publications has been extremely sparse for the past one and a half centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a result, the theology taught today in every country covers the light of the truth only up to one hundred fifty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Lord s recovery, however, the light of the truth is up-to-date.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Three hundred years ago the Philippines was under the occupation of the Spaniards.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Spain was a Catholic country.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even though five centuries ago the Reformation brought in the light of the truth, it did not have much impact on the basic nature of Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, when the Spaniards came to the Philippines, instead of bringing the truths recovered through the Reformation, they brought the old Catholic theology of the Dark Ages.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through their political power they spread Catholicism to all of the Philippines.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thirty years ago when I first came to the Philippines, I spent some time observing the situation in Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I went to the so-called Cathedral of Jesus the Black Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There was a sculpture of this so-called Jesus the Black Nazarene, the toes of which had been worn down from being touched by the Catholics.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I saw this, I could not help but shake my head and sigh, thinking to myself, O pitiful ones, how could you be deceived to such an extent?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I really hated that superstitious situation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day I saw many people crying and yelling in the streets, so I asked the brothers what was happening.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They told me, These people are repenting for having robbed and stolen from others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, after repenting today, tomorrow they will rob and steal again.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I was really grieved in my heart because that situation was absolutely contrary to the gospel and the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Not only is the Philippines like this, but Catholicism in South America is also in the same condition.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have lived in the United States for over twenty years, and by observing the situation I have discovered that the Americans are equally superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This fully proves that what the whole earth needs today is the light of the gospel and the light of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Regardless of nationality or race, people need the pure and high gospel and truth.</S>
