   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the book Born Crucified, the writer tells a story that occurred during the Civil War in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A man was chosen to go to the front to fight at the sacrifice of his life, yet he had a wife and six children.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Another young man offered to go to replace this man, to be his substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Both parties agreed, and the authorities put this into their records.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then that young man who replaced the first man went to the war and was killed in action.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later, the authorities still tried to draft the first man into service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the first man told them to look at their records, which said that the other man was his substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He claimed that he had died in the person of the young man who was his substitute, his representative.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The author uses this case to illustrate that Christ was our Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the legal record, this is a good illustration, but according to the thought of our identification with Christ, this illustration is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ was our Substitute on the cross not just legally, to make a legal record in the heavenly account.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He also came to be our Substitute in the way of identification.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, He came into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He did not come to replace man but to be man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the way of identification, He came to become us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Spontaneously, He is our Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the medical field, a doctor will give someone an injection at a spot on their body for the benefit of their entire body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The doctor injects only one spot, but this one spot represents the entire body, so the entire body receives the injection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This spot where the injection takes place is not a kind of substitute of our entire body in a legal way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This spot is a substitute for the entire body in the way of identification.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, when this spot receives the injection, the entire body receives it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ could be our Substitute only in the way of identification.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If He had never become us, He could never have been our Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If He had not become us, His being our Substitute would have merely been according to a legal record.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But because He became us, His being our Substitute is according to the way of identification.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we need to consider once more who died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to say, "I died on the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Christ was incarnated, He took us upon Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He put on blood and flesh Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, when He was crucified, we were crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All of us as a part of Christ, received the injection of His death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The writer of Born Crucified also told a story about an old missionary who had lived a defeated Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day he was reading the Bible, and his eyes fell upon the words in Galatians 2:20 "Christ liveth in me."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This phrase enlightened that man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The book says that though he was a solid Presbyterian, he was jumping around his table with joy, saying, "Christ liveth in me!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ liveth in me!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Christ who lived in this Presbyterian missionary is the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some may speak of the doctrine of identification, but they do not see that our identification with Christ can be experienced by us only in the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Christ who was our Substitute became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are a number of people in Christianity who teach that the three of the Divine Trinity are three separate persons.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To say this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is no separation among the three, but there is a distinction among the Father and the Son and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The three of the Godhead are one.</S>
