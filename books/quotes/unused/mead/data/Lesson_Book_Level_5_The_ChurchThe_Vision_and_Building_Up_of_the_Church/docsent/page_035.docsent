   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. As Revealed by the Lord in Matthew 16:18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Matthew 16:18 we have the Lord's first mentioning of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this verse He says, "On this rock I will build My church.''</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is revealed here is the universal church for the unique testimony of the Lord in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The universal church is to be built by Christ, the Son of the living God revealed by the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Peter declared that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord said to Him, "You are blessed, Simon Bar-jona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens'' Matt 16:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only the Father knows the Son Matt 11:27 and can reveal the Son to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Son revealed by the Father is now building the universal church, not the church in a nation or the church in a city.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The universal church is to be built on the rock of the revelation concerning Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This revelation is the crucial factor, the central point of the building up of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church is not to be built up according to any doctrine, creed, or so-called belief.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The gates of Hades, Satan's power of darkness, shall not prevail against the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, the church has the keys of the kingdom of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That means the church has the authority to bind the devil and to loose all God's people for His church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How glorious and powerful is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE LOCAL ASPECT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The other aspect of the church is the local aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is important to see the universal aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is equally important to see the local aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many Christians see very little concerning the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Others may see something concerning the universal aspect of the church, yet they do not regard the local aspect of the church to be important.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A. The Believers Living in the Local Churches</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to live in the universal church practically, we have to live in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, we cannot live directly in the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is impossible for us to live in the universal church without living in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord is building up the universal church, and each of us is living practically in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Matthew 18:17 the Lord said that if, as a believer, you have a problem with another believer, you should tell it to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Surely the church mentioned in this verse is not the universal church; it must be the church in the place where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are in Seoul and you have any problem, you should tell the problem to the church in Seoul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you are in Pusan, you should go to the church in Pusan; if you are in Hong Kong, you should go to the church in Hong Kong; and if you are in New York, you should go to the church in New York.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church to which you should tell your problem is the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>B. The Local Churches Being the Local Expressions of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The local churches are the local expressions of the Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:27; Eph 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is only one Body, but there are many expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Universally, all the churches are one Body, and locally, every local church is a local expression of that universal Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A local church is not the Body; it is only a part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is a local expression of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church in Seoul is not the entire Body; it is a part of the entire Body as the Body's local expression.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>C. All the Local Churches Constituting the One Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the local churches constitute the one Body of Christ Eph 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, "I will build My church.''</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here the church is in the singular number, indicating that it must be the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But in the Acts and the Epistles, a number of times the Bible says "the churches'' the churches in Syria, the churches in Asia, the churches in Macedonia, and the churches in Galatia.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How could the Bible refer first to one church and then to many churches?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is because the one church, the universal church, is the totality of all the churches, and all the churches are local constituents of the one universal church.</S>
