   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE PRODUCING OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The course of the church means the progression of the church, or what we normally call the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN ETERNITY PAST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we speak of the course of the church, we are referring to the origin and the progression of the church, and we must begin with eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church came out from God s eternal plan; therefore, in eternity past, before the creation of all things, God s intention was the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that in God s intention the church has existed from eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why we can say that apart from the Triune God, the church is the most ancient thing Eph 3:9-11; 1:4-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>HIDDEN IN GOD The Church Being a Mystery Hidden in God</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though the church existed from eternity past, it was hidden in God 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In other words, even though God wanted the church in eternity past, He did not tell anyone not even the angels anything about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In creation the church was God s direction, His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God created all things in order to build the church; His creation was directed toward the church, and the church was its goal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Moreover, many aspects of creation typify the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, God did not tell anyone about His intention, direction, or goal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the church definitely existed but was hidden, and because it was hidden, it was a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If I had some word to speak but never opened my mouth, everyone would say that I was hiding some mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I have something to say, but I hide it in my heart, it is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the same way, the church was a mystery because it was hidden in God from eternity past; it existed, but it was not spoken of, because it was hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During the time that the church was hidden, only God Himself knew about it; no one else knew about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Despite the fact that there were some important types of the church in creation, the angels and the people of the Old Testament did not understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Old Testament age, many people, matters, and things typified or symbolized the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, the people who passed through these incidents or read about them later did not understand that these stories indicated and referred to the church, because in the Old Testament age the church was still hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some people read the Old Testament inaccurately, thinking that the church is in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the contrary, the Old Testament never directly speaks of the church; rather, it contains only implications and types instead of plain words.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This does not mean that the church did not exist before the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church has existed from eternity, but before the New Testament age it was always hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church was hidden until the time of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The mystery spoken of in Ephesians 3:3-6 is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 4 says, By which, in reading it, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The mystery of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ s mysterious story is in the church; it can be said that without the church, Christ would no longer be a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, the central point in the mystery of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To know the mystery of Christ is to know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first part of verse 5 says, Which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Other generations refers to the generations before the age of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God did not make the mystery known to men in the age of Adam, in the age of Abraham, or even in the age of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not even Isaiah and the other prophets, who foretold the incarnation of the Lord Jesus, knew about this mystery, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In other generations God never made the church known to man as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit v. 5b . The word prophets does not refer to Old Testament prophets but to New Testament prophets, like the ones in Acts 13:1: Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The prophets in the New Testament received revelation from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the apostles and the prophets came forth at the beginning of the New Testament age, the Holy Spirit revealed and opened up the mystery to them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ephesians 3:6 continues to say that this mystery is that in Christ Jesus the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the Body and fellow partakers of the promise through the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This shows that the mystery from eternity past was a mystery hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From eternity past through the Old Testament age up until the apostles and prophets of the New Testament, this mystery was hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In other words, this mystery was hidden from eternity past until the apostles and prophets received the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Colossians 1:26 says, The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the past it was a mystery, but now it has been manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 26 does not clearly say the word church, but from verse 24 we can see that this mystery is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 24 clearly says, His Body, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The first time the Bible speaks of the church is in Matthew 16:18.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The second time is in Matthew 18:17.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These two verses were spoken by the Lord to His disciples when He was on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In other words, the Lord spoke of the church only after He was incarnated and recognized by His disciples as the Christ, the Son of the living God 16:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord said, I will build My church v. 18 ; will indicates that the church had not yet been built.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, at the time the Lord spoke this word, from the human perspective the church still seemed to be something in the future, but in reality the church existed for a long time in God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before the time of the New Testament, however, the church was a mystery hidden in God.</S>
