   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WOOD AND STONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the building of the tabernacle there were no stones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The tabernacle was built with gold and wood.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Gold signifies the nature of God, and wood denotes the humanity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the tabernacle as the dwelling place of God was built with Christ s divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The temple was built primarily of stone, but also partly of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, it was a combination of wood and stone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Wood is also mentioned with respect to the rebuilding of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Haggai 1:8 says, Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although wood is mentioned in Haggai, it is not mentioned in Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Zechariah we see the topstone Zech 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that the rebuilding of the temple was also mainly with stone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How could there be a topstone without a foundation stone?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And how could there be a topstone without a cornerstone?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The buildings in the holy land were constructed in the following manner: there was a foundation stone, a cornerstone that held the walls together, and a capstone, called the topstone, that covered the building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The mention of the topstone in Zechariah 4:7 thus implies that there was a foundation stone and a cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, in the rebuilding of the temple there was more stone than wood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is confirmed by the Lord s word in Matthew 24:2.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this verse the Lord Jesus, speaking of the temple, says, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s ultimate building, the New Jerusalem, will not contain any wood.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It will be built of gold, pearl, and precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God s building began with wood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Gradually stone was added.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ultimately there will be no wood; there will be nothing but stone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>FROM COTTON TO STONE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to see how this applies to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we first came together as the local church, there was hardly any stone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We came with the gold and the wood, with Christ s divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that time the building of the church was a matter of Christ s divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The beginning of any local church is always like this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Gradually, as we grow in Christ and Christ grows in us, we become more involved with Christ and we become stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the past you probably were not even wood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, you were a heap of cotton.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Look back at the time you first came into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Were you not cotton?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I can still remember the day I came into the church in 1932.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Without a doubt I was just a heap of cotton.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I was soft, warm, nice, and kind, and everyone liked me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Gradually I changed from cotton into hard wood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then eventually the wood was petrified through the flowing of the divine life within me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This flow carried away my wooden nature and replaced it with heavenly, divine minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Apparently, I am still wood; actually, I have become stone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When in my experience I was a ball of cotton, I had little to do with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ was the gold and the wood with which the tabernacle was built, and I was a ball of cotton within the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When you are a ball of cotton, you may love the Lord and believe in Him, but in your actual experience you have very little involvement with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is He, and you are you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is the gold and the wood, and you are a ball of cotton.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eventually, however, in the church life, you become more involved with Christ, and Christ is wrought into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we enter into the New Jerusalem, we shall no longer be balls of cotton or pieces of wood; we all shall be precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every precious stone is hard.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Lord s recovery today the need is for stone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not cast away those who are balls of cotton.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We shall certainly keep them, but keep them in the hope that they will daily and gradually change from cotton to wood and from wood to stone.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Ultimately, God s temple, God s habitation, will be built with stone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord Himself is the foundation stone, the cornerstone, and the topstone, and we also must be living stones 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the New Testament we are told clearly that the building material for the church is not wood, hay, and stubble; it is gold, silver, and precious stones 1 Cor 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>THE WAY TO BECOME STONES</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I believe the Lord s testimony in Europe will be subjected to more tests than His testimony in the United States because Europe is the territory of the mother prostitute and her older daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The local churches in this territory must be strong, and every one in them must be a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When Peter was brought to the Lord, the Lord changed his name from Simon to Cephas, which means a stone John 1:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In Matthew 16 Peter received the revelation that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God, and the Lord Jesus said to him, Thou art a stone, and upon this rock I will build my church Matt 16:18, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>. Here we see that the church is built with the stone on the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The only way we can become stones is by enjoying Christ and eating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we eat, a metabolic change takes place in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By eating we take food into us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Eventually, this food is digested and assimilated into our very fibers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This brings about a change, a transformation, of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is not sufficient to have the doctrine of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must open our being, exercise our spirit, and take Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should not take the doctrine of Christ into our mentality; we must take Christ as the life-giving Spirit into our being and let this Spirit be the transforming element that will change us metabolically.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is not a matter of the outward correction of our behavior, but of the inward transformation of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In this way we become stones.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is what the Lord desires today.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I am not interested in merely teaching you or edifying you.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I am doing my best to minister the element of Christ into you.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I do not like to pass on knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Instead, I would minister the transforming Christ into you.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you take this Christ into you, you will never be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Each of these messages is an injection.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>After you have received these injections, you could not be the same even if you wanted to.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Hallelujah for the injections of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I have the full confidence that these heavenly injections will make us stones for the church today and ultimately for the New Jerusalem.</S>
