   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WAY TO GO ON</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I do not wish to see anyone taking the extreme way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do not condemn those who are engaged in commerce as soon as you meet them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They did not have the opportunity to choose their occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I knew a brother who was quite pure when he left school.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After he went into business, his heart gradually became corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He tried to make money day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you wanted him to buy something for you, he would try to make some money in the process.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He always tried to make some money from others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is too poor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe such a person has been corrupted in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We hope that anyone who can choose his own occupation will not go into pure commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must open the eyes of those who are already in it and help them to have a change.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not embarrass them, but at least show them the way clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Pure commerce is never a good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We hope that ten or twenty years from now, it will be a tradition among us that no one goes into pure commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hopefully, in the future all the brothers and sisters among us will build up the habit of shunning pure commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As God's children, we would rather be teachers or manual laborers; we would not go into pure commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We would till the land and harvest wheat, barley, or rice and then sell the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We would raise lambs from our sheep and then sell them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We would have our hen lay eggs and then sell them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We would have our cow produce milk and then sell it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We would make fabric and then sell it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can do all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more we work and produce, the more God will bless.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The worst thing that can happen to us is that our brothers and sisters simply make a great deal of money.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nothing could be worse than this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today our brothers and sisters are the poorest among all those in the other denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are not careful, we could become the richest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because we are more honest, diligent, and frugal than others, and because we do not lie, smoke, drink, or live in big mansions, it is possible that within a short time, all of the brothers and sisters will become wealthy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John Wesley once said before he died, "I am concerned for our people in the Methodist assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They are honest, diligent, and frugal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Soon they will become the richest people in the world."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such a word has indeed come true today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Methodists are the richest people in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But their testimony has been lost as a result.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We hope that all the new believers will earn their living by their own labor.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We hope that they will not make money by taking in with one hand and taking out with the other.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our principle is to increase the abundance of the land, not the money in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do this, the money we receive will be clean, and when we offer it to God, it will be acceptable to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every dollar will end up in a good place.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose a brother makes a basket and sells it and then offers the money to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is much better than another brother who buys ten baskets, sells them, and then offers up his profit to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The amount of money offered may be the same, but the nature of the money is different.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We hope that many brothers and sisters will see this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must either labor with our hands or we must produce something.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Both are according to the proper principles.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I cannot forbid anyone from going into the business of pure commerce, but I would advise everyone to try his best to avoid pure commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This occupation will always drag a Christian down.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We hope that the new believers among us will please the Lord in their choice of occupations.</S>
