   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE TWELVE FILLING UP WHAT IS LACKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE AFFLICTIONS OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 1:24; 1 Pet 3:18; Heb 9:26; Isa 53:3-5, 7-8; John 12:24; Luke 12:50; Phil 3:10; Rev 1:9; 2 Tim 2:10; 2 Cor 1:5-6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1:24 Paul says, Now I rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I first read this verse, I was surprised and troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I wondered how there could be any lack in the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the time, I was fully under the religious concept that it was impossible for Christ to have any lack.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, in this verse Paul says clearly that he was to fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>TWO KINDS OF SUFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Are not the sufferings of Christ already complete?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How can it be necessary for the afflictions of Christ on behalf of the Body to be completed?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus underwent two kinds of suffering: the suffering for redemption and the suffering for producing and building up the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>None of us can have any share in His suffering for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To say that we can participate in this suffering is to speak blasphemy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He alone is the Redeemer, and the suffering for redemption was fully accomplished by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are neither qualified nor positioned to share in the Lord s suffering for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In typology, on the day of atonement, only the high priest, who made atonement for the people, was allowed to enter into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The high priest was a figure of Christ as the unique One capable of accomplishing redemption and qualified to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A number of verses speak of Christ s sufferings for the accomplishment of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, 1 Peter 3:18 says, For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ, the righteous One, died for the unrighteous ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was the only One qualified to bear this kind of affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hebrews 9:26 and Isaiah 53:3-5, 7-8 also indicate that Christ suffered to accomplish redemption on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this suffering we have no share.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was borne by Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although we cannot participate in Christ s suffering for redemption, if we are faithful to Him, we must share in His suffering for the producing and building up of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul was a pattern for us in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Immediately after his conversion, he began to share in this suffering of Christ, to partake of the afflictions of Christ for the sake of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is contrary to the concept that nothing related to Christ can be lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to this concept, whatever Christ is and does is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But here is a word telling us that at least one thing related to Christ is lacking His afflictions for producing and building up His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For the producing of His Body, Christ suffered a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But because this suffering has not been completed by Christ Himself, there is the need for His faithful ones to make up this shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul did not suffer for redemption, but he did suffer for the producing and building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Apostle Paul was a pattern for the believers to follow 1 Tim 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must consider Paul as a pattern, not as someone who was so high that no one else can be like he was.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because by the Lord s mercy Paul was set up to be a pattern for us, whatever he was, we can be also.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must believe in the Lord s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the mercy of the Lord made Paul a pattern, then His mercy can accomplish in us the same thing that it did in Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that just as Paul suffered for the producing and building up of the Body of Christ, so we must also suffer for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ, of course, took the lead to suffer for the producing and building up of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the apostles and believers must follow Christ s footsteps in suffering this kind of affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus said, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This verse does not speak of Christ s redeeming death, but of His producing, generating death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ fell into the ground and died as a grain of wheat in order to produce many grains for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to John 12:26, those who desire to serve Him must follow Him in this regard.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Luke 12:50 the Lord Jesus said, But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straightened till it be accomplished!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The word baptism in this verse refers to Christ s all-inclusive death on the cross, a death that was not only for redemption, but also for producing the Body through the release of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As the Lord s word to His disciples in Mark 10:38 and 39 makes clear, they also were to share in the baptism with which He Himself was to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Philippians 3:10 Paul speaks of knowing the fellowship of Christ s sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These sufferings are not for redemption, but for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot have fellowship in Christ s sufferings for redemption, but we need to have much fellowship in Christ s sufferings for the church.</S>
