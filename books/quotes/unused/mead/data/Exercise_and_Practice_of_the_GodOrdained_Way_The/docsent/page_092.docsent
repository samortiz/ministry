   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE THE PRACTICE OF THE GROUP MEETING Scripture Reading: Heb 10:24-25; 2 Tim 2:2; Eph 4:11-12 BEGINNING THE GROUP MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will continue to fellowship concerning the practice of the group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First we must consider how we should come to a group meeting and how we should enter into a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not come to the group meeting in a religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should come in a normal and spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may sing if we come alone, or we may fellowship if we come with another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is always good to come speaking, either to the Lord or to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we wait until we come to the meeting to sing or speak, that is religious.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all have to learn to do this naturally and spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then when we enter the meeting, we can sing, pray, or simply praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is better not to ask about others, but if we are burdened, we should pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not have anything foreign or religious in the group meeting; we must be in spirit and in life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then when another comes in, he can simply join us in whatever we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether we are singing or praying, he can easily join our singing or say "Amen" to our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this way the group meeting has begun.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then as others come, they may also come speaking or singing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>FELLOWSHIPPING, INTERCEDING, MUTUAL CARE, AND SHEPHERDING</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everything must be done in a natural, or normal, way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are many ways to practice the group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may have heard that a certain brother has just had an automobile accident.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When you come to the meeting, you may say, "Brothers and sisters, Brother John has been in an automobile accident."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then some will spontaneously intercede for this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the group meeting, singing, fellowship, and interceding should all come forth in a normal and spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, the group meeting must take care of the proper fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many things should have happened since the group meeting the previous week.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, when we come together, we should fellowship with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This kind of fellowship can spontaneously turn to intercession for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then following intercession, we may have some mutual care.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After praying for the brother who has had the automobile accident, someone may know if he is at home or in the hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then immediately some may go to visit him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Along with the shepherding, we may need to render some help.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should consider this brother's family and the financial situation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some sisters may want to go to visit his wife and children.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All these things can be done in a very spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the group meeting, we have to take care of fellowship, intercession, mutual care, and shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By the mutual fellowship, we can know one another's situation and consider one another.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Hebrews 10:24-25 there are three important words concerning the group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 24 says that we should "consider one another for inciting to love and good works."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To "consider" implies fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we do not fellowship, how can we consider one another?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The next word is "inciting."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This considering should issue in our inciting one another to love and good works.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then in verse 25, we are to be those "exhorting" one another.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not take these three words consider, inciting, and exhorting as a doctrine, but we should immediately practice these things in our group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we consider one another, we will surely have something to fellowship when we come together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This kind of fellowship will spontaneously usher the meeting into intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This prayer for one another will bring us into a mutual care for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then, the mutual care leads to shepherding, and the shepherding leads to the rendering of help, whether it be spiritual, practical, or material.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through these practices, our group meeting will thoroughly cover the needs of the saints.</S>
