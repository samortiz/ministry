The brothers and sisters in Tai County moved to the rural areas or neighboring villages for awhile. Thank the Lord that we have been under His blessing. Most of them have moved back recently, but a small number still remain in Yi-Lin. The biggest difficulty is unemployment among the brothers. Most of the brothers are blue-collar workers who have been laid off. Although some brothers have started businesses of their own, they are only loaves in the hands of the disciples. There is not enough for distribution. Please pray for us.</p><p>We have no news from the church in Dung-Tai. Both mail and sea communication have been cut off, and we do not know how the brothers and sisters are doing. The brothers and sisters in Yien-Chen are dispersed in the countryside. Brother Wang Hsueh-yu's home is now in Ma-Chang, and Brother You Shan-fu has moved his whole family to Si-You-Tsuang. Brother You Chan-ting has moved his whole family to Shiao-Kwan, Fu-Ning. Brother Jie's family has moved to East Village in Yien-Chen. We have no news as to whether or not Brother Fei and Brother Lee have moved. Brother Wang is still in Yi-Lin, but he is planning on going elsewhere to preach the gospel. Fu-Ning capitulated on the sixth of this month, and the saints there have moved to East Village in Fu-Ning. According to one brother, they had one Lord's table meeting on the fourth. We have heard nothing from them since. Presently, we have not received any letter from Brother Pei Dah-shen.</p><p>During the most dangerous period, the church in Yi-Lin only met in the morning. The Lord's table was suspended once. Presently, the battle is still raging about thirty Chinese miles from Yi-Lin, and we can frequently hear the sound of cannons and bombs. A few of the brothers and sisters in Yi-Lin who could move went to the nearby villages. About forty to fifty who could not move are now living with my father (Wu Wei) in a walled community. At one time there were over ten brothers from out of town; there are still four who have no place to go. Brother Suen Deh-ming from Shanghai is still in Yi-Lin. Neighboring churches like Dong-Gou, Ban-Hu, and Soo-Jia-Tsui are quite shaken. However, one brother told me that the brothers and sisters have not suffered any harm. The Lord is worthy to be praised! My father is now in Yi-Lin. I will go to Tai County soon. We are not able to receive any news about the other co-workers because of the war. In North Village in Fu-Ning, Brothers You Tien, Chang Kwai, and Hu Siao-lan are meeting with the brothers and sisters. We have no further news from them and are quite concerned about them.</p><p>Brother Wu Ming-hui</p><p> (This letter was probably written after May 18.)</p><h2 class="head2">North Village, Ning-Hai, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear honorable brothers and sisters:</p><p>Since receiving Issue Nos. 2, 3, and 6 of The Open Door, we know that you have received special grace from the Father and are in peace. We also rejoice at hearing about the work in all these places. The Lord has brought us through the past four years according to His grace. There are four orphans and a heartbroken sister staying in Sister Yun-sien's house. Another sister from Ning-Po also sought refuge there. Her husband died when he was fleeing from the war, and she is now tragically left with three children. Please pray for us. Every afternoon we pray together at four-thirty. On Thursday we have a Bible study meeting, using the book Bible Studies for Beginners. We have received the enclosed sum of money from the offering box in Ding's household, which is designated for brothers and sisters who have suffered because of the war. Greetings to you.</p><p>Sisters in the Lord,<br />Tu Yun-sien, Ge Shi-lien, Chiang Jin-chiu<br />May 10<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(On June 26, we received a postcard from Tu's family in Ning-Hai saying that Sister Tu suffered a bullet wound and has been hospitalized for over a month. Please pray for them.)</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 32: The Open Door (2) &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
