God's eternal economy is to have a Body for Christ, and this Body consummates the New Jerusalem. The Bible ends with Christ as the Son of Man, as the consummation and completion of God's eternal economy. Nathanael recognized Jesus as the Son of God (John 1:49), but Jesus told Nathanael that he would see the angels ascending and descending upon the Son of Man (v. 51). Christ as the Son of Man is the reality of the ladder which Jacob saw in Genesis 28:12. John 1, the introduction to the Gospel of John, ends with Christ as the Son of Man being a ladder that joins earth to heaven and brings heaven to earth. The entire Bible also ends in this way, that is, with Christ Himself as the Son of Man being a heavenly ladder. This heavenly ladder is the New Jerusalem.</P><P>We have seen that the New Jerusalem as the goal of God's economy is the universal incorporation of the consummated God with His regenerated believers. God in His Divine Trinity is an incorporation, mutually coinhering and working together as one (John 14:10-11). Furthermore, Christ is in the Father, we are in Christ, and Christ is in us (v. 20). The conclusion and totality of these three ins is the Spirit of reality, who is Christ Himself, to be the reality within us (v. 17). The Spirit of reality came not only to be with us but also to be in us. Our being in God the Son and God the Son being in us and also in the Father reveal an incorporation. This incorporation is first the Body of Christ and then the New Jerusalem. Ephesians 4 speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father (vv. 4-6). The three of the Triune God&#151;the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father&#151;are constituted and incorporated with the believers. We have spent much time to study the humanity of Christ from the prophecy of the Old Testament and from the fulfillment in the New Testament to see a view showing us that God's economy is to have a Body for Christ which consummates the New Jerusalem&#151;the enlarged, universal incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers.</P><P>Now we want to conclude our fellowship concerning the revelation of the humanity of Christ in the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God. In the previous message we saw Christ as the Son of Man from His incarnation through His resurrection. In this message we want to see Him as the Son of Man from His ascension through eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. Ascending to the Heavens in His Humanity</H2><P>John 6:62 reveals that Christ ascended to the heavens in His humanity. As the Son of Man He is sitting at the right hand of God (Matt. 26:64a; Mark 14:62a; Luke 22:69). Furthermore, Stephen saw Him as the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God (Acts 7:56). Sitting is for resting, whereas standing is for working. Because a member of His Body was suffering on this earth, the Son of Man was seen standing at the right hand of God. This indicates that the Lord was greatly concerned for His persecuted one.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of the Humanity of Christ &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
