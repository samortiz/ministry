   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTEEN EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION 10</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we will continue to consider Christ as the Priest who trims the lampstands, the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>l.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>the Beginning of the Creation of God</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Revelation 3:14 Christ is revealed as the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1 The Amen</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ has a name, and His name is called Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The title Amen has various meanings: reality, yes, let it be.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Amen is a kind of eternal yes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because Amen is the Lord s name, our saying Amen is equal to calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we say Amen, we mean O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May we all learn to say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the Amen, Christ is also the ending.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In His address to the church in Laodicea the Lord declares Himself to be the Amen first, the faithful and true Witness second, and the Beginning last.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These expressions in such an order show us that He is One that we cannot explain.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The order of these titles is not according to our human logic.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is the Beginning of the entire universe, the Witness to maintain it, and the Amen, the ending.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whatever God intended to do including His intention to establish many local churches and to consummate the New Jerusalem will be done.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For instance, God wants us to be overcomers and co-kings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead of stating that we cannot be such, we need to simply say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To all of God s promises and to all that God desires to do, Christ is the Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is significant that He declares Himself to be the Amen not in the first epistle to the churches in Asia but in the last epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is the Amen, He is everything, and He is Amen to everything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all need to see and know Him to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the One who is all-inclusive, excellent, marvelous, mysterious, and wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>2 The Faithful and True Witness</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word Amen, from Hebrew, means firm, steadfast, or trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord is the firm, steadfast, and trustworthy One.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, He is the faithful and true Witness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates that the church in Laodicea, the degraded recovered church, is not firm, steadfast, trustworthy, or faithful and true as the Lord s witness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is the true Witness, and He is faithful and true in testifying.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He never tells a lie in His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His being the faithful and true Witness is for dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A liar, a false witness, can never give life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we would give life to others, we must be faithful and true.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must have no falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we will be qualified to give life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because He is living and holy and faithful and true, He is qualified to impart life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Christ we see that God is love and light and that He is holy and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, the New Testament reveals that Christ is the embodiment of God Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For Christ to be the embodiment of God means that He is the portrait of God, and as such, He is the testimony of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because Christ is the testimony of what God is, He is called the faithful and true Witness Rev 3:14; 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As God s Witness, Christ bears God s testimony to show us what kind of God He is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>3 The Beginning of the Creation of God</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The beginning of the creation of God refers to the Lord as the origin, or source, of God s creation, implying that the Lord is the unchanging and ever-existing source of God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This indicates that the church in Laodicea has changed by leaving the Lord as the source.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moreover, as the beginning of the creation of God, He is the chief of the creation, the first of all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ being the beginning of the creation of God means that the entire universe as God s creation began from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As the unchanging and ever-existing source of God s work, Christ was the beginning of God s entire creation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Without Him nothing could happen, because He was the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God s dispensing is to dispense His life into His human beings, His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is Christ who originated the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This indicates that the entire creation is under His control, His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is the beginning, the origination, of God s entire creation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, the entire creation is under His direction for the purpose of dispensing God into His chosen creatures.</S>
