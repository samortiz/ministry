[3]  Thank the Lord that since the publication of this book in the fall of 1928, believers from various places have put in orders for it.
[4]  I give thanks with all my heart to the Lord whom I serve, for He has given me the privilege to write this book.
[5]  I had hoped that a better writer would be raised up to fulfill this responsibility, but it has pleased the Lord that I should take it up myself.
[6]  Today I rejoice because I have finished the last section of this book.
[7]  The spirit and soul mentioned in this book, and their respective functions, are important matters.
[8]  Since God has spoken this, we can see that there is a distinction between man's spirit and his soul, and from this we can conclude that man is composed of three parts: spirit, soul, and body.
[9]  Genesis 2:7 says, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."
[10]  In the beginning, God created the figure of a man with the dust of the earth and then breathed into his nostrils "the breath of life."
[11]  When the breath of life came in contact with man's body, the soul was produced.
[12]  This signifies not only that the soul is produced from the union between the spirit and the body, but that after the soul is produced from this union of the spirit and the body, both the spirit and the body are incorporated into the soul.
[13]  The apostle said in 1 Corinthians 3:16, "Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?"
[14]  After reading this verse, we can see that the apostle was inspired to consider man a temple.
[15]  Just as God dwelt in the temple in time past, in the same way the Holy Spirit dwells in the believers.
[16]  CHAPTER TWO THE SPIRIT AND THE SOUL THE SPIRIT
[17]  Further on, we will see that all communications between God and man lie within this spirit.
[18]  If a believer does not know what his spirit is, he will not know how to fellowship with God in the spirit and will substitute the work of the spirit with soulish activities such as that of the mind and the emotion.
[19]  The spirit contains the function of the conscience, although this does not mean that the spirit is the conscience.
[20]  "For Jehovah your God hardened his spirit" Deut 2:30 .
[21]  In addition to the spirit, the organ with which he communicates with God, man also has a soul.
[22]  Man is conscious of his own existence because of the activity of the soul.
[23]  Some who have studied the Bible have pointed out that there are three words for life in Greek: 1 bios, 2 psuche, and 3 zoe.
[24]  Although all three words denote life, the life which they denote is different.
[25]  Now that we have seen the soul as our personality, our organ of deliberation, and our life, we can conclude that this soul is the true "I"; it is the self.
[26]  Man, like the angels, has a spirit, and like the lower animals, also has a soul.
[27]  After observing the way God commanded man in Genesis 2 concerning what to eat and what not to eat, we can see that the man God created is not a dead machine under God's manipulation.
[28]  If he had exercised the will in his soul to take the fruit of life, God's own life would have entered into his spirit; it would have saturated his soul and would have changed his body, so that he would not have needed to die or see corruption and would have received the "eternal life."
[29]  God forbade man to eat of this fruit, not only for the purpose of testing man, but because He knew that within man was the spiritual life and the soulish life, and that if man were to eat of this fruit, his soulish life would develop, and his spiritual life would die.
[30]  The work of the enemy begins with the need of the body.
[31]  He first told her to eat of the fruit, something that was entirely related to the body.
[32]  Next he took one step further to tempt her soul by telling her that if her body would take the fruit, her eyes would be opened, and she would know good and evil.
[33]  As a result her spirit rebelled against God, and she wondered whether God had forbidden her to eat because His intention was wicked.
[34]  Adam existed by the breath of life, which is the spirit.
[35]  The spirit has God-consciousness; it knows God's voice, fellowships with God, and has a very keen knowledge of God.
[36]  CHAPTER FOUR THE WAY OF SALVATION THE JUDGMENT AT GOLGOTHA
[37]  Death came into the world because of man's fall.
[38]  This death, which is a spiritual death, a death which separates man from God, came through sin.
[39]  How shameful is the cross as an instrument of punishment!
[40]  "And He who sent Me is with Me" v. 29 . Therefore, He was able to pray, "Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. And I knew that You always hear Me" 11:41-42 . However, while He was on the cross if ever there was a day He needed God's presence, it had to be that day probably no other day exceeded that day He cried, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" Matt 27:46 . His spirit was actually separated from God.
[41]  The meaning of death is to be separated from life.
[42]  Since death means to be separated from life, and God is life, then to be dead is to be separated from God.
[43]  To be born again is not a matter related to our body, as Nicodemus thought, nor is it a matter related to our soul, because not only is the "body of sin" to be made of none effect Rom 6:6 , but also "they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts" this is the soul Gal 5:24 .
[44]  Therefore, in the Bible we see that only spirit can serve Spirit Rom 1:9; 7:6; 12:11 , only spirit can know Spirit 1 Cor 2:9-12 , only spirit can worship God who is Spirit John 4:23-24; Phil 3:3 , and only spirit can receive revelation from God who is Spirit Rev 1:10; 1 Cor 2:10 .
[45]  We must be careful not to consider the substitutionary death of the Lord Jesus and our co-death with Him as two separate matters.
[46]  Those who pay attention to knowledge and understanding have this tendency.
[47]  However, it must not be so in our spiritual life.
[48]  This word is often seen in the Bible and is used in various senses, but chiefly in reference to an unregenerated person.
[49]  He says that if you wish to overcome the flesh, you need to put to death the practices of the body "by the Spirit" v. 13 . Although the flesh consists of the soul and the body, there is nevertheless a particular connection between the "flesh" and the physical flesh, that is the human body.
[50]  The Lord Jesus has said that every unregenerated man, born but once of man, is flesh and is in the realm of the flesh.
[51]  During the time of unregeneration, men live in the lusts of their flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and are by nature children of wrath Eph 2:3 for "it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God" Rom 9:8 .
[52]  But since at this time man is dead unto God Eph 2:1 , being dead in his offenses and in the uncircumcision of his flesh Col 2:13 , he is not in the least conscious of his being in sin and is perhaps still proud of himself, thinking that he is still better than others.
[53]  God's salvation, which saves people from the deserved punishment of the flesh and the power of the flesh, was accomplished in the cross of His Son.
[54]  Now He places this salvation before every man, that whoever receives it may be saved.
[55]  Because the flesh is absolutely beyond repair, God cannot expect man, after believing in His Son, to have anything to please Him if He does not give man something new, something other than the flesh.
[56]  Therefore, when a man believes that the Lord Jesus died for him and receives the Lord Jesus to be his personal Savior, God gives him a new life, that is, His own uncreated life.
[57]  After a believer has been regenerated, it is most important for him to know how much he has received from his regeneration and how much is left of his natural endowment.
[58]  Knowing these things will keep him advancing in his spiritual journey.
[59]  Therefore, we need to explain here what is included in man's flesh and how the Lord Jesus in His redemption deals with the elements of the flesh.
[60]  Every believer can, like Paul, be filled with the Holy Spirit at the time he believes and is baptized Acts 9:17-18 .
[61]  However, many believers do not truly believe as an accomplished fact that Christ has died and been resurrected for them, nor do they sincerely apply in practice the principle of death and resurrection which they are called by the Holy Spirit to obey.
[62]  Hence, they still remain subject to the control of the flesh, just like those who have not died and been resurrected, although in fact, they have died and been resurrected according to what has been accomplished by Christ, and they should die to themselves and live to God according to their duty as disciples.
[63]  The apostle's struggle in Romans 7 was a struggle against the sin that dwells within the body.
[64]  He said, "For sin, seizing the opportunity...deceived me...killed me...I am..sold under sin...It is no longer I that work it out, but sin that dwells in me" vv.
[65]  A believer should allow the Holy Spirit to search his heart so that he may be enlightened by God to know what things are forbidden by the law of the Holy Spirit and the law of nature, what things are obstructing him from the exercise of temperance and self-control, and what things are restricting him from serving God freely in the spirit.
[66]  The more a believer is enlightened by the Holy Spirit, the more will he see the pitiful state of the flesh, and the fiercer will his battles against the flesh be, but all the more frequent and evident will his failures become.
[67]  Whenever he suffers a defeat, the Holy Spirit will further reveal to him the sin and weakness of his flesh and generate in him a deeper sense of self-reproach and a determination to battle against the sin of the flesh.
[68]  He lays down many ordinances, such as touch not, taste not, handle not, and the like, unconsciously thinking that corruption of the flesh is due to the lack of set rules, culture, and education, and that since he has put it through such spiritual training, it will give no trouble in the end. Little does he know that as to the subduing of the lusts of the flesh, these rules and regulations are absolutely ineffective Col 2:21-23 .
[69]  On the contrary, after believing in the Lord for many years, they are still entangled by sins and have become fleshly believers.
[70]  "For when we were in the flesh, the passions for sins...operated in our members to bear fruit to death.
[71]  Even though we may pay attention to experience, we still hold fast the facts we have before God because what God has accomplished for us and our experience of the accomplishment of God are two inseparable matters.
[72]  We need to realize that even though we can put to death the flesh and cause it to be annulled original Greek meaning for "destroyed" in Rom 6:6 KJV , it nevertheless still exists.
[73]  A very great mistake that people make is that they think that they have extinguished the existence of sin and have uprooted the flesh from within them.
[74]  A believer should realize that, on the one hand, he is a new creation in Christ, having the Holy Spirit dwelling in his spirit, having the death of Jesus working in him, and having the sanctifying life, but that, on the other hand, he still has the sinful flesh and can still sense the existence of the flesh and its filthiness.
[75]  CHAPTER FOUR THE BOASTINGS OF THE FLESH THE OTHER ASPECT OF THE FLESH
[76]  Do the aforementioned items include all the works of the flesh?
[77]  Besides these, are there any more works of the flesh?
[78]  What has been said earlier mainly stresses the aspect of the sins of the flesh, that is, the lusts of the human body, but not yet the other aspect of the flesh.
[79]  The flesh is at enmity with the Holy Spirit not only in the matter of sinning against God but even in the matter of serving God and pleasing God, for it is done out of its own strength, not by being led simply by the Spirit and depending entirely on the grace of God.
[80]  God's purpose is that the believers would be completely free of the old creation and enter completely into the new creation in experience.
[81]  It has no need to depend on the Holy Spirit, no need to be humble, no need to wait upon God, and no need to pray and beseech God, but only has to decide by itself, think by itself, and perform by itself.
[82]  The goodness of the flesh which centers on the self is always evil in the eyes of God because it is not the work of the Holy Spirit, and it does not issue from the life of the Lord Jesus.
[83]  It is not that we do not proclaim the truth or that we do not confess the person and work of Christ as our only hope or that we do not want to glorify His name, but that, because our confidence is in the flesh, many of our works are dead before God.
[84]  If the believer is so self-confident as to perfect the work of the Holy Spirit with the strength of his flesh, he not only will not be able to attain a perfect spiritual living but also will always be drifting about.
[85]  However, it is true that wherever the flesh is serving God, the power of sin is strengthened therein.
[86]  Therefore, Satan is willing to allow the believers to put to death the sinful part of the flesh, but he deludes the believers into retaining the good part, realizing that if the good part of the flesh remains, the life of the flesh will be kept.
[87]  At this time, it would be good for the believers to refresh their memory concerning God's verdict on the flesh.
[88]  No matter how much the believers trust the flesh, God has said it is of no profit and does not help the spiritual life.
[89]  But how can the believers see what God sees?
[90]  God hates the flesh and the conduct of the flesh so much, yet, except for the evil acts of the flesh, the believers still are lenient with the flesh and cannot be as absolute as God is.
[91]  Moreover, the believers still do many things in the flesh with self-trust, self-reliance, and self-confidence, considering that they have received God's grace to the full and are able to utilize the flesh to have righteous acts.
[92]  Because of this, the Holy Spirit of God must lead the believers through the most shameful pathway that they may know the flesh and thus have God's view.
[93]  Therefore, God allows the believers to fail, become weak, and sometimes even to commit sin, so that they will know whether or not there is any good in the flesh.
[94]  At best, it still has some mixture of corruption; perhaps God often permits the believers to experience Romans 7 so that they will finally be willing to say as Paul said, "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells" v. 18 . How difficult it is to learn to say this word! Unless the believers have gone through many painful failures, they are always self-dependent and always think that they are capable.
[95]  If we read the following verses, we will see how humble he was: "Not having my own righteousness" v. 9 ; "If perhaps I may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead" v. 11 ; "Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue, if even I may lay hold of that for which I also have been laid hold of by Christ Jesus" v. 12 . If the believers want to attain to the state of being completely spiritual, they must have the thought of not having obtained and not have the slightest self-confidence, self-satisfaction, and self-pleasing, which are the proofs of trusting the flesh.
[96]  Because the flesh is very subtle, the believers must moment by moment have the deeper work of the Holy Spirit through the cross.
[97]  Once the believers see the standing of their own flesh before God, the cross and the deeper work of the Holy Spirit are indispensable.
[98]  If the believers do not reject all goodness in the flesh, they will see that in many things, although the flesh seems to be very powerful and very capable in working, when the real calling of God comes, calling them to prepare to go to Golgotha to suffer, they will be as weak as water, shrink back, and not be able to go forward.
[99]  "In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ" Col 2:11 .
[100]  We should be willing to allow the power of the cross, as a knife of circumcision, to completely cut off from us everything which is of the flesh.
[101]  This kind of "cutting" should be deep and should make a clear separation so that nothing of the flesh can be hidden or remain.
[102]  If we commit our flesh to the cross, we commit it to the curse, acknowledging that there is no good thing in the flesh and that it has no other destiny except to be cursed by God.
[103]  If we let the Spirit do a deeper work by the cross, then the circumcision which we have received will become more real day by day.
[104]  "For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh" Phil 3:3 .
[105]  SECTION THREE THE SOUL CHAPTER ONE THE WAY TO BE DELIVERED FROM SIN
[106]  Romans 6 is the basis for the believers to be freed from sin.
[107]  When the Lord Jesus went to the cross, He not only brought our sin there, but also brought us, our beings, there.
[108]  The first is mentioned in verse 11: "So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus."
[109]  However, if he becomes complacent, thinking that living a life of overcoming sin is the highest living and does not allow the cross to terminate his soul-life, he will remain in the realm of the soul and consider the experience of the soul as the experience of the spirit.
[110]  We have already seen that the soul is our inherent life.
[111]  It is the power that makes it possible for us to live, to have our being, and to exist.
[112]  It is because, even though the cross has worked and dealt with the sinful nature of the believer, the soul-life is still existing!
[113]  Although all sins issue from the sinful nature and the soul merely follows its direction to execute its command, nevertheless the soul is, after all, inherited from Adam.
[114]  Thus, the danger at this time is that he tries to please God with his own power and does not know how to exercise the life of the soul, which is given to him by God and is already in him, to increasingly strengthen the life of the spirit through the Holy Spirit in order to follow the dictates of the new nature.
[115]  If a believer knows only what it is to be delivered from sin but not what it is to "deny the self," to "lose the soul-life," then the danger is that at this time he will use the strength of the self, that is, the soul-life, to accomplish all of God's will in him, to do God's work, and to live out God in his daily living.
[116]  He does not know that apart from sin there are two powers now within him: the power of the spirit and the power of the soul.
[117]  The power of the spirit is the power of God which he received at his regeneration.
[118]  The power of the soul is the power of self which he received naturally at his birth.
[119]  If he uses the power of the soul, or the power of the spirit concurrently with the power of the soul, he will become a soulish man a fleshly man.
[120]  If the believer does not apprehend this or is not willing to obey God in this way, henceforth his living will be serving God merely by the soul-life and the power of the self.
[121]  We do not mean that the experience of a soulish believer is entirely of the soul, though believers of this type are many.
[122]  Although the Holy Spirit has been dwelling in their spirit and has caused them to experience freedom from sin by the work of the cross, inevitably sometimes they follow their soul and sometimes their spirit.
[123]  Such an experience of a mixed spirit and soul indicates that there are two sources within the believer: one is of God, the other is of man; one is of the Holy Spirit, the other is of self; one is intuitive, the other rational; one is spiritual, the other is natural one is of the spirit, the other is of the soul.
[124]  CHAPTER TWO THE EXPERIENCE OF SOULISH BELIEVERS THE LIVING OF THE SOULISH BELIEVERS
[125]  Soulish believers often live a kind of emotional life.
[126]  Before the believers become spiritual, the Lord often enables them to feel His presence.
[127]  Although there are times that the Lord does not give them such a feeling, because they have not reached a complete life of faith, very often the Lord gives them the feeling of His presence in order to gradually train them not to rely on feelings but to depend on faith alone.
[128]  Soulish believers are not behind others in the matter of works.
[129]  They think that it is always good to do God's work, but they do not know that it is really good only when they do the work which God gives them.
[130]  Naturally, in such preaching, one relies on the message more than on the Lord.
[131]  The entire heart of these believers depends on what they preach to move human hearts instead of on the Holy Spirit to reveal to men their need and the Lord's supply to fill up their lack.
[132]  CHAPTER THREE THE DANGERS OF SOULISH LIVING THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SOUL-LIFE
[133]  We have mentioned before how the soul-life is manifested.
[134]  The manifestation of the soul-life can very generally be classified into four categories: 1 using one's own natural ability; 2 being obstinate, stubborn, and disobedient to God; 3 pretending to be wise, having many opinions and plans; and 4 seeking spiritual experience through feelings.
[135]  This is because 1 the soul-life itself is the natural ability, and the organ of the soul is divided into 2 the will, 3 the mind, and 4 the emotion.
[136]  In conclusion, the work of the soul is to cause the believer to live by his own natural life; to work and to serve God by his own ability and will; to seek to know the Lord, draw close to the Lord, and know the Lord's presence by his feelings; and to use the ability of his mind to understand the Word of God, to calculate, to plan, and to infer.
[137]  Many believers cannot perceive the damage of their soulish experiences.
[138]  They only consider that to sin in doing "things of the flesh" could pollute the spirit, and this is the thing that should be truly rejected and eliminated.
[139]  The soul-life is the common life of all people, and all animals have this life.
[140]  If a believer merely receives teachings in his mind, then no matter whether he opposes or agrees, he can never see in his heart the reason for the biblical teaching that the soul-life should be rejected.
[141]  When believers have not reached or are not willing to reach what God wants them to reach, they are inevitably in danger.
[142]  Since God's goal is for the believers to live in the spirit, not in the soul, neither in the body, if they do not live in the spirit, they will suffer loss.
[143]  The order of God's working is first to have the Holy Spirit moving in the human spirit, then to shine as light in the mind soul , and then to have His work being carried out by the body.
[144]  If a child of God has received grace and experienced deliverance from sins but does not go further and seek to overcome the natural life, and continues to live in his soul-life, he will see that his soul once again joins together with the body, leading him to go backward and causing him to again commit the sin from which he was once delivered.
[145]  Verses 14 and 15 of chapter three say clearly what the relationship between the soul-life and the work of Satan is: "But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not boast and lie against the truth.
[146]  CHAPTER FOUR THE CROSS AND THE SOUL THE CALLING OF THE CROSS
[147]  In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus at least four times called His disciples to renounce their soul-life, to put it to death, to follow Him.
[148]  The Lord knew that renouncing the soul-life is an absolutely indispensable requirement if man is to follow Him, to attain to perfect status, to be like Him in serving men, and to do the will of God.
[149]  Although the Lord Jesus spoke about the soul-life in all these four callings, He had a special emphasis in each.
[150]  In Matthew 10:38 and 39 the Lord Jesus said, "And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it."
[151]  Such a loss of the soul-life's natural love on the cross enables the soul-life to let the Holy Spirit pour God's love into its heart before God, thus causing all the soul's love to be through God and in God.
[152]  In Matthew 16:24-25 the Lord Jesus also spoke about the relationship of the soul-life and the cross: "Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it." In these verses, our Lord again called His disciples to take up the cross, to be willing to put the soul-life to death so that they might lose their soul-life.
[153]  What is spoken of here and what was spoken of previously in Matthew 10 are not the same.
[154]  The part of the soul-life emphasized in Matthew 10 is the affection.
[155]  It is as if he were thinking, "You, Lord, are going to the cross to suffer in such a way, although You are doing the will of God, although You are accomplishing the purpose of God, and although You are acting according to the plan of God.
[156]  Just as I do not care for Myself, as even at the cross I am still doing the will of God unconditionally, you also should not care for your soul-life but be willing to lose it to do what God wants you to do."
[157]  THE CROSS AND THE SOUL'S LOVE OF THE WORLD
[158]  In Luke 17:32-33 our Lord has a similar word, but what is pointed out there is concerning the things of the world: "Remember Lot's wife.
[159]  Whoever seeks to preserve his soul-life will lose it, and whoever loses it will preserve it alive."
[160]  Here the Lord speaks again that we must lose the soul-life, but what the Lord speaks here especially stresses the believers' reluctance to lose their belongings.
[161]  In John 12:24-25 the Lord Jesus again talked about the problem of the soul-life: "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.
[162]  He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life."
[163]  CHAPTER FIVE THE SPIRITUAL BELIEVER AND THE SOUL THE DIVIDING OF THE SPIRIT AND THE SOUL
[164]  The reason we have made the effort to speak so much on the distinction between the spirit and the soul and their activities is to bring us to this point.
[165]  What a God-seeking believer should fear the most is the activity of the soul beyond the limitation set up by God.
[166]  Even when one is willing to consecrate himself to God, he still may hold the thought that it is his work now and that he has to complete what he is consecrating in order to please God.
[167]  All opinion, work, and thinking ability in the soul-life must be willing to be put to death so that we can regain His true life by the life and guidance of the Holy Spirit.
[168]  If we do not reject our self and lose our soul-life, but instead follow its idea, opinion, and suggestion, and if we do not constantly deny its right and unconditionally and unreservedly put it in the ashes, without longing for what we have lost, we cannot expect to have a spiritual life and work that pleases God.
[169]  It is simply that, first, God by His Word and through His indwelling Spirit can differentiate experientially the function and expression of the soul from that of the spirit, teaching the believer to know what is the move of the spirit and what is the move of the soul.
[170]  With the word of God, their soul is divided from their spirit by their High Priest, the Lord Jesus, so that the soul no longer affects the spirit and the spirit no longer is controlled by the soul.
[171]  In creation, the first step of the word of God was to separate the light from the dark.
[172]  Likewise, the word of God now works as a sharp sword inside of us through the Holy Spirit to distinguish the spirit from the soul, so that the dwelling place of the most noble God can be completely separated from base feelings, and we may know how much our soul should submit to the One who is above.
[173]  This causes us to know how the spirit is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit of God and how the soul with all its power is to move not by itself, but according to the will of the Holy Spirit manifested through the human spirit.
[174]  Today's High Priest employs the word of God to divide the soul from the spirit of the believer.
[175]  As we have said before, the High Priest is working because we have accepted the cross.
[176]  Now we want to talk about how, in practice, the Lord Jesus divides our soul and spirit.
[177]  The believer must ask the Lord to show him the detestableness of a life of the spirit and soul mixed together and must know that in God there is a life that is both higher and deeper, completely of the spirit, and not affected by the soul.
[178]  If the believer is not willing and does not want the dividing of his spirit and soul, but rather prefers to enjoy what he himself sees as good, God will respect the character of man and will never force him.
[179]  Therefore, the believer should daily take the attitude of Romans 6:11, reckoning that he is truly dead to sin, and wholeheartedly keep this attitude in his will: "Do not let sin therefore reign in your mortal body" v. 12 . Only by this can he have the possibility of not letting the soul-life sin again through the mortal body.
[180]  If the believer daily bears the cross, refuses the self, not being directed by the flesh for one moment, and has the Holy Spirit of God constantly reveal the activities of the soul in his daily living, this is a living of the spirit.
[181]  We have mentioned that the spirit, soul, and body in a human being are like the holy temple, which is divided into the Holiest of all and the outer court, and that God lives in the Holiest of all.
[182]  In this way the cross exerts a real and solid effect on the life and experience of the believer, causing him to lose his soul-life and to not have independent acts but rather to completely wait for and rely on the spiritual life to originate, to generate, the power to live and work.
[183]  Now, however, because our soul is being governed by the spirit, we can be freed from such disturbance.
[184]  The Lord Jesus said, "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls" Matt 11:29 .
[185]  If we are willing to surrender to the Lord, willing to take His yoke, and willing to walk according to the His will, our soul will not be aroused.
[186]  If we are willing to imitate the Lord and if we will learn of Him, seeing how the Lord was despised by others and how the Lord followed not His own will but the will of God, then the turmoil in our soul will be calmed down.
[187]  The reason sorrow and grief come is that we are not willing to be satisfied with the same kind of treatment that the Lord received and that we are not willing to submit to God's will and arrangement.
[188]  If we put the soul-life to death and completely surrender to the Lord, our soul the soul with sensitive nerves will rest in the Lord and not misunderstand the Lord.
