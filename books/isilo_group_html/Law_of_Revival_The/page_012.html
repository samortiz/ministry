THE LAW OF REVIVAL</h2>
<p>Sometimes we sense a need for revival even though our spiritual life is advancing smoothly. We may sense that we have become old. This is a sign that we need to be renewed and revived. For example, a brother may sense a lack in the messages that he gives. This sense is a sign that he needs a new beginning in relation to giving messages. A sister who was supplied when she read the Bible may lose the sense of satisfaction. This sense of dissatisfaction is also a sign, requiring that she be revived in relation to reading the Bible.</p>
<p>Besides the conditions within us, the Lord has arranged for the discipline of the Holy Spirit to create different situations in our environment to force us to sense the need for a revival. We might be disheartened by the news we receive, or we may be troubled by a word of misunderstanding or by problems in our family, among the saints, or in the work. These are all signs that we need a new revival. We may quote the Lord&rsquo;s words in Matthew 11:28: &ldquo;Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest.&rdquo; However, this verse may be merely doctrine to us, because we have no experience of it. But when the Holy Spirit works in our environment, there may be heavy burdens pressing upon us. These burdens indicate that we need to enjoy and experience Christ again. These burdens also reveal that Christ is our rest. By receiving such a Christ and enjoying His rest by faith, we will be revived again.</p>
<p>In the past we said that when there is a new situation in our environment, we should immediately hand the problem over to the Lord. But we need to see that it is not merely a matter of handing our problem over to the Lord; rather, it is a matter of experiencing the law of revival in our spiritual life. Some people tend to remain in whatever problem they encounter instead of being revived by contacting and experiencing the Lord. Remaining in our problems means that we do not know the law of revival. We know the law of revival in the physical realm, and we spontaneously live by this law: we are revived by eating when we are hungry and drinking when we are thirsty. However, in the spiritual realm we do not eat when we are hungry, nor do we drink when we are thirsty. Instead of contacting the Lord when problems arise, we sigh, lament our situation, and suffer a great loss.</p>
<p>May God enable us to see the law of revival and to apply this law so that we would be delivered from the self into Christ. The more we experience the cycle of revival, the more our element will decrease, and the element of Christ will increase. This is the way for us to grow and be strong. Furthermore, in spite of our environment, we will be living and fresh, that is, revived.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING OPEN IN ORDER TO ENLIVEN OTHERS</h2>
<p>We should also learn to be open. After being revived and living, we should not be closed. Rather, we should remain open so that there would be a flow between us and the other saints. We should let living water flow out from us into others and receive the living water that flows out from others. The more we flow out, the more we will have the inflow. As a result, we will be enlivened, and others also will be enlivened.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters have listened to many messages, but they still are not living. Hence, we do not need more messages. We need to enliven the saints, but we must first be enlivened before we can enliven others. When everyone is enlivened, we will be able to advance. We must not hold on to routines, meeting and serving according to old ways and old forms. We have to &ldquo;overturn&rdquo; the saints until they are enlivened. There is no regulation for us to follow; we simply need to enliven the saints one by one. The saints simply need to come together in order to enliven one another. Those taking the lead must be the first to be living; then they can enliven the other saints. This is crucial. Our being enlivened depends on our knowing the law of revival and regularly applying this law. Then we can be revived moment by moment, and our condition will always be fresh and living.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Law of Revival &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
