From that time until the present a little more than thirty years have passed. From the first conference I emphasized the term "the Lord's recovery." I told the dear saints that the Lord sent me to this country for nothing but His recovery.</P><P>Although the ministry has continued to stress the matter of the Lord's recovery throughout these years, according to my observation, even some dear saints who have been with us for many years are still not clear concerning what the Lord's recovery is. Because there are many new ones and young ones in the recovery, I feel very burdened concerning this matter. We need to speak about the Lord's recovery, to fellowship about the recovery, and to make transactions among ourselves concerning the Lord's recovery. We are here for the recovery. The purpose of the seven messages in this book is to make the Lord's recovery clear to all the saints.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
