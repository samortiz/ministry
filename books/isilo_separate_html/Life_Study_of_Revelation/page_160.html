Let us use, once again, the illustration of the Jewish people today. There may be thirteen or fourteen million Jews on earth, but less than three million of them are in the nation of Israel. Are not the millions of Jews in New York City genuine Jews? Yes, they are. However, although they are Jews and although their number exceeds the number of those in the nation of Israel, they are not the nation of Israel. Actually and practically, the nation of Israel is composed only of those Jews who have returned. Of the thirteen or fourteen million Jews, at least eleven million have lost the ground of the nation of Israel. As a result, though they are typical Israelites, they are not the nation of Israel. Only those Israelites who returned to the land of their forefathers and who stand, live, and fight there are the nation of Israel. Likewise, all Christians are God&rsquo;s people, but the vast majority of them have lost the ground of being God&rsquo;s people.</p><p>Many are offended when we say that we are the church. They say, &ldquo;What! Are we not also blood-redeemed and Spirit-regenerated?&rdquo; We realize that there are a great many blood-redeemed and Spirit-regenerated Christians and that some of them are rich in the Lord; yet they have lost the ground of God&rsquo;s people as the church. There are some Jews in New York City who are millionaires; they are much richer than the poor Jews who returned to Palestine. But those poor Jews are the nation of Israel and the rich ones in New York are not. Some wealthy Jews in New York City have donated a lot of money to the nation of Israel. But no matter how much they donate, still they are not the nation of Israel; they are citizens of the United States. They may say, &ldquo;I love the nation of Israel and I am for the nation of Israel.&rdquo; Although we would thank the Lord for this, nevertheless this does not make them the nation of Israel. The only way for them to be the nation of Israel is to return to the land of their forefathers to stand and fight alongside those poor Jews who have already returned. Only then will they be an actual part of the nation of Israel. Only then will they be not only for the nation of Israel; they will be the nation of Israel.</p><p>Likewise, it is not the Christians in the denominations, sects, and free groups who will bring forth the man-child. To bring forth the man-child there is the need for at least a portion of God&rsquo;s people to come back to the proper standing of the woman. Those who have this standing have God alone and nothing else. They are the woman on the proper ground to bring forth the man-child.</p><p>Once again I say that if we would understand the Bible, especially the prophecies, we must understand it by life and for life. The interpretation the Lord has given us is not only by life and with life&mdash;it is, much more, for life. We all must actually and practically be a part of the woman. If you can only say, &ldquo;I have been redeemed by the blood and regenerated by the Spirit and filled with the Spirit,&rdquo; you are a real Christian&mdash;thank the Lord for this&mdash;but you are not actually and practically part of the woman who is bringing forth the man-child. You are like the Jews in New York City who declare that they are Jews and that they are for the nation of Israel. They are Jews, but they cannot say that they are the nation of Israel. They help the nation of Israel and they are for the nation of Israel, but they are not the nation of Israel in a practical way. In like manner, today it is not the scattered children of God, those who have lost their ground, who will bring forth the man-child. Only that part of God&rsquo;s redeemed people who have seen His economy and who are willing to return to the standing, the ground, of the chaste woman will bring forth the man-child.</p><h2 class="head1">RETURNING TO THE UNIQUE GROUND</h2><p>If we would be included practically in this chaste woman, we must forsake all things other than God and Christ and return to the unique ground to have Christ as our only husband. We refuse to become impregnated by anything other than Christ. We will only be made pregnant of Christ, for He is our unique husband. In addition to Him, we have no one and nothing. Today, we have the standing of this woman. However, if you are the wife of Mr. Smith, why are you living with Mr. Jones? You may say, &ldquo;I am the wife of Mr. Smith. We were properly married in a certain year, month, and day.&rdquo; This is correct, but with whom are you living? Do you live only with Mr. Smith, or also with someone else? Perhaps you do not stay with another man, but you stay with your pet dog alone in your house. By doing this, you lose the ground of being Mrs. Smith. Doctrinally, you are the wife of Mr. Smith, but actually and practically day after day you are not Mrs. Smith. You have lost this ground and are still losing it. If you would return to the ground of being Mrs. Smith, you must drop every other man and every other thing, and return purely, singly, and uniquely to be one with Mr. Smith. Then you will actually, practically, and absolutely be the wife of Mr. Smith. It is this wife who will bring forth children, not only for Mr. Smith but of Mr. Smith. May the Lord have mercy on us. This is not a doctrine; it is very practical. We thank the Lord that He has opened His Word to us and that He has opened our eyes to see this vision. Now our need is to be faithful to this vision. &ldquo;O Lord, we thank You for bringing us back to the proper standing of Your people. Thank You, Lord, that we are actually the woman who will bring forth the man-child. Lord, not only are we the woman, but we expect to eventually become the man-child.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_159.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_161.html">Next</a> </body></html>
