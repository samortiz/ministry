<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Being the Life Lived Out by the Believers,<br>Who Have Been Regenerated to Become<br>God-men, Not by the Life of Their Old Man<br>but by the Divine Life in Their New Man</H2><P>Paul was this kind of person. He said, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" (Gal. 2:20). We all need to be like Paul in being able to speak such a word. We must be able to boast by saying, "I am a God-man. The life that I am living is a life lived by God and man together; it is God and I living together." This kind of life lived by God and us together is the life lived out of the believers, who have been regenerated to become God-men, not by the life of their old man but by the divine life in their new man (Rom. 6:4-6; Eph. 4:22-24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Being Conformed Daily to the Death of Christ by the Power of Christ's Resurrection and Living and Magnifying Christ through the Bountiful Supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ</H2><P>The God-man life is also one that is conformed daily to the death of Christ by the power of Christ's resurrection and lives and magnifies Christ through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 3:10; 1:19-21). We have received the power of Christ's resurrection; hence, we can live a crucified life by this power, being conformed to His death. Paul was this kind of person. Not only so, when he was in prison, he lived and magnified Christ by enjoying the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. We also should live this kind of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Overcoming the Self, the Flesh,<br>and the Involvements of the Flesh&#151;<br>Sin, Satan, and the World</H2><P>When Christ was crucified on the cross, He dealt with our old man, our flesh, and the involvements of the flesh&#151;sin, Satan, and the world. We, the God-men, in living the God-man life by the Spirit, can now apply what Christ has accomplished on the cross to overcome the self, the flesh, and the involvements of the flesh&#151;sin, Satan, and the world (Rom. 6:6; Matt. 16:24; Gal. 5:24; Rom. 8:3; Heb. 2:14; John 12:31).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Overcoming Religion, Culture, and<br>the Tide and Amusements of This Age</H2><P>Not only so, in our living the God-man life, we must also overcome religion, culture, and the tide and amusements of this age. Is it good to celebrate Christmas? I must say that that is the culture of religion. Is it good to celebrate the New Year? I must say that that is the tradition of the world. We are having this conference during the Chinese New Year period, which causes many of you to forsake the tradition of celebrating the New Year. This is actually quite good. Also, what about celebrating birthdays? That is the tide of today's age. I must ask, when you are there singing the "happy birthday" song, can you say that God and you are singing together? Besides these, there are many other amusements of this age that we need to overcome. Paul said that the Lord gave Himself up for us to deliver us from the present evil age (Gal. 1:4). The age mentioned in Galatians 1:4 refers particularly to the religious world, which is Judaism. He also said, "Do not be fashioned according to this age" (Rom. 12:2). Hence, the God-man life also includes overcoming religion, culture, and the tide and amusements of this age.</P>
