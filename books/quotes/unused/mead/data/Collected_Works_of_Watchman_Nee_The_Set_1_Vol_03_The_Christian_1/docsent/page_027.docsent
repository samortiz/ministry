   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The work of the first day is the first step of the redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Without light coming into the world, God and man would never have the opportunity to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without the Lord Jesus coming into the world, sinners would not be able to see God the Father, who is expressed by the only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we can see how the work of the first day and the Lord Jesus' coming into the world are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The shining of the light comes about through the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"And the Spirit of God brooded upon the face of the waters" Gen 1:2, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The same principle is true with incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The angel told Mary, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore also the holy thing which is born will be called the Son of God" Luke 1:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Son of the Most High was born of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the world does not receive this conception of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, light was called for on the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light" Gen 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This we have said already: the Lord Jesus came to the world as light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now let us look at another place in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Simeon saw the Lord Jesus as a child, he said, "Now You release Your slave, Master, according to Your word, in peace; for my eyes have seen Your salvation, which You have prepared before the face of all the peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of Your people Israel" Luke 2:29-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Who wants to be enlightened by Him?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God declared that the light was good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"And God saw the light, that it was good" Gen 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first word which God spoke to our Lord Jesus Christ was, "This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight" Matt 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Aside from His Son, no one can please the Father's heart because "those who are in the flesh cannot please God" Rom 8:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One of the strange phenomena among sinful human beings today is the thought that their own behavior is perfectly satisfying to God and that the Lord Jesus is more or less like them!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How blind is a man of the flesh!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He cannot see the beauty of the Lord Jesus and thereby fall in love with Him!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, God always considers that this Light is good.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Blessed are those who have God's view!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Light and darkness are separated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"God divided the light from the darkness" Gen 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here we see a wonderful harmony in the record of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The book of Hebrews says that the Lord Jesus is "a High Priest...holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners and having become higher than the heavens" 7:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How different this man is from ordinary people!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is willing to share our human nature, yet He does not have the root of sin like us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Light is separated from darkness; Christ is distinct from sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God gave light a name.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"And God called the light Day" Gen 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Likewise, the name of Christ was given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His name was not given by Joseph and Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When He was still in His mother's womb, the angel told Mary, "You shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins" Matt 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before He was born, He had prophesied through the prophet, saying, "Jehovah has called me from the womb" Isa 49:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is Jesus; therefore, He is the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since the Savior has come, how do you treat Him?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The world did not ask for a savior.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through His special grace, the Lord Himself came to the world and became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Savior has come, and the light has shone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But who are those who will receive Him?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Word becoming flesh is the first scene in the beginning of the redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In himself, man is extremely feeble and of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is man?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Man is just dust!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Man is limited and bound; all of man's virtues if there are any have limitations which cannot be transcended.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Man's thought, character, behavior, and ethics are completely from man; they can never be higher than this level.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Weakness, degradation, and sin are man's common qualities.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If there is any merit, it can never go beyond the human realm.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, if man remains man weak, defeated, sinful God will not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He wants man to be perfect in character, morality, behavior, and thought, according to His own standard.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Otherwise, God would never choose man for His companion, giving man eternal life and having man with Him in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Unless man reaches God's level of perfection himself, he cannot receive these things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What hope does man have?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is very important that God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The birth of Jesus is the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord Jesus is God, yet He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, He is God and man; He is man as well as God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Originally there was a chasm separating God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God could not become man, nor could man become God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, the Word became flesh when the Lord Jesus came to this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is a floating pontoon bridge between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God and man met in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Man did not become just God, neither did God become just man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord Jesus expresses God, and He also represents man.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He is the unique God, and He is also the unique Man.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Because He is both God and man, God is able to give grace to man in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Because He is both man and God, man is able to draw near to God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Now there are men on earth who are filled with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Man has the possibility to receive God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God's life is able to enter into the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Originally, it was impossible for God and man to be joined together; however, God and man have been joined in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>From this point there is the possibility for God and man to be joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Incarnation is not the totality of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is the very first step of salvation; this step proclaims the nature and issue of the coming salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, this is not the direct reason for incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The reasons that the Son of God "Himself...partook of the same blood and flesh " are 1 "that through death He might destroy...the devil"; and 2 "release those men " Heb 2:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>All have sinned, and the wages of sin is death.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The one who has the power of death is the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Sin leads man to death, and through death due to sin, the devil dominates man.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Therefore, for God to save man, He had to solve the problem of the penalty of sin by destroying the power of death, which is under the command of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The penalty of sin is death, but death requires a physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Thus, the Lord Jesus "partook of the same blood and flesh ."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Since He had a physical body, He was able to die and redeem man.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Therefore, God had "a body...prepared" for Him "to do Your will, O God"; this will is "the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all...having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down forever" Heb 10:5, 7, 10, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The devil had the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Since no man could overcome death, Jesus obtained a human body, died, and also resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He overcame all the power of the devil and destroyed him.</S>
