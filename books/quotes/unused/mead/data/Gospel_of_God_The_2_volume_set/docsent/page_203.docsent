   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ARGUMENT BASED ON JAMES 5:20</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>James 5:19-20 says, "My brothers, if any one among you is led astray from the truth and someone turns him back, let him know that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save that one's soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some people also infer from these two verses that a saved person can perish.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To them, in verse 19 we have the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then in verse 20, we have the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To them, verse 19 says to turn a brother back, and verse 20 says that in turning back the brother, the soul is saved from death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This would mean that some brothers need to turn back, and some need to have their souls saved from death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Would this not say plainly that a brother can lose his salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to understand these two verses, there are a few things here that we have to pay attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, James 5:19 and 20 are like a lone mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are not connected to the preceding verses, and they have nothing to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the other Epistles in the Bible have greetings and benedictions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>James is the only book that ends this way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verses 17 and 18 speak of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All of a sudden these few words seem to break in from nowhere.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a very peculiar thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, from chapter one until the end, the book of James is on practical love among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because of love, there is the mercy, the care, and the concern for the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is what the book of James shows us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From 1:1 to 5:18, there is a continuous line, a definite goal, and a subject.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verses 19 and 20, however, seem to drop down from nowhere.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One can say that 1:1 to 5:18 are very organized.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we do not know where these two final verses come from.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Third, in principle, since James 1 through 5 speaks of love expressed in one's conduct, verses 19 and 20 should not deviate from this point.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They should also tell us what we should or should not do when we love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a sinner continues in the error of his way, and you save him in love, you are saving a soul from death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In addition, you will also cover a multitude of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All readers of the Bible know that what covers a multitude of sins is love 1 Pet 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The many sins spoken of here do not refer to sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They refer to the sins before man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you turn a sinner from the error of his way, God will no longer remember his sins and will cast them into the deep sea.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All his sins will be under the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now what about us?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose Brother Yuan was a very evil man before he became a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His past history is very black and unseemly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I know his past history and stories of his past.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I could lay them out and expose them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if I expose his sins of the past, I am acting contrary to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has cast his sins into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After we are saved, God does not mention our past sins any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I see a brother, I have to cover his past because among us God has covered our past sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 20 is on the matter of principle, and verse 19 is on the matter of example.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In other words, verse 20 is the formula, the law, and the principle of action, whereas verse 19 is the case study and the individual incident.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 20 says that if anyone turns a person, he will not die and his sins will be covered before God and before men.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 19 shows us what happens when one brother among us is led astray from the truth or has erred in his way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to turn him back.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The exhortation in verse 19 is based upon the principle in verse 20.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you see a brother in the church led astray from the truth, you have to recover him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When a sinner is turned, his soul will not die and his many sins will be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This being the case, how much more should we do the same on behalf of a brother?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What James was saying here was that we should do unto the brothers as one would do unto the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>James is telling us here that a Christian should treat his brothers and sisters with love and should recover them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This portion is not speaking of a brother perishing.</S>
