   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-SIX DEALING WITH TEMPER SALVATION EFFECTING A CHANGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN DISPOSITION AND CONDUCT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After a man is saved, he should experience a definite change in his disposition as well as in his conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Salvation changes us in life, in disposition, and in conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The most important change in a believer's disposition and conduct is a change in his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The greatest problem many people have before they are saved is their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a man has been a Christian for many years and yet has not experienced any change in his temper, he will lose his testimony before the Gentiles and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Under normal circumstances, a man should experience a change in his temper as soon as he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE PROPER MARKS OF A BELIEVER</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the time a person is saved, we should tell him that he should have a few marks or signs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first mark is loving one another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Loving one another is the Lord's charge to His disciples John 13:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It should be the strongest mark of a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second mark is meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord says that the meek are blessed Matt 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He entered Jerusalem on a little colt.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a mark of His meekness 21:5 and a pattern for us to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The third mark is self denial.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord said, "If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself" 16:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A Christian should not try to build up himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, he should deny himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fourth mark is patience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A believer has to learn patience under all kinds of circumstances 1 Cor 13:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fifth mark is to rejoice always.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A saved person should not be short in his joy under any circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Rejoice in the Lord always" Phil 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a commandment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The sixth mark is peace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have the peace of God, and this peace guards our hearts and thoughts Phil 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The seventh mark is lowliness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord says, "I am meek and lowly in heart" Matt 11:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to take His yoke and learn from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ does not remain lofty on high but stoops in lowliness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A worker should tell new believers these seven things and remind them that these are normal expressions of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then he should point out that anger and temper are incompatible with the disposition of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>TEMPER BEING INCOMPATIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>WITH A CHRISTIAN CHARACTER</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Temper is incompatible with the proper Christian expression.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is incompatible with a believer's very disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should realize that where love flourishes, temper cannot remain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord charges us to love everyone, no matter who he is, even if he is our enemy Matt 5:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we love a person, we will not be angry with him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot love a person and be angry with him at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Temper is contrary to the very nature of love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our whole Christian life should consist of nothing but love for others; we should not be angry at anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord also charges us to be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is meek in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible says He is meek and lowly in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He renders comfort to others all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a man is meek and his meekness is lived out in his attitude and walk, he will not lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A man with a temper is a coarse person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Temper is the coarsest of all human sentiments, while love is the finest of all sentiments.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Love is expressed in meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a man is meek before God, he surely will not have a quick temper.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Third, we have to show the new believers that the Lord wants us to deny ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Specifically, denying ourselves means rejecting the self.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Denying one's self is not speaking for one's right and learning to endure in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No matter how others treat us, we will not be angry.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God's children should reject their self and be free from the self.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When they are free from the self, temper will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Temper is a mark of those who refuse to deny the self.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Fourth, we have to show the new ones that one strong Christian characteristic is patience.</S>

   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Temper is contrary to patience.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is true that some people treat us unreasonably, but we should always love, and love is not easily provoked.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord has arranged various circumstances around us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should be patient and should not lose our temper easily.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Fifth, a Christian should rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God has given us a life that rejoices always.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is possible for us to be without a temper.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Temper has no place in a Christian's life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our Christian life should be filled with joy from the very start.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is because the life we have is a joyful life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Sixth, a Christian not only has joy but peace as well.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Like joy, peace is a part of the life a Christian possesses.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Nothing can disturb the peace we have within us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have to pray that the Lord would guard our hearts and thoughts from any attack.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This will keep us from losing our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Seventh, a Christian is lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>A child of God should be the most lowly person in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Temper and lowliness are incompatible with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>An angry man is never a lowly man; there is no humility at all within him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God's children should follow the lowly Lord and take the lowly path.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They should learn to not lose their temper in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We have to say to new ones, "Matthew 5:22 says that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Anger and temper are incompatible with a believer's walk."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The greatest and most frequent problem a believer faces is his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Temper is linked to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>A new believer should deal with this matter at the beginning of his Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is the most basic dealing he should experience.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Some may ask, "Why is it so crucial to deal with our temper?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Why must we solve this problem?"</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We must deal with this clearly before we can help others.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We must settle this issue thoroughly before we can present a straight pathway to the new believers.</S>
