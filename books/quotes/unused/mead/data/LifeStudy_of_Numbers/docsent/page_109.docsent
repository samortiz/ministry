   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WATER FOR IMPURITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Chapter nineteen of Numbers is a very peculiar chapter in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not easy to understand why this chapter is here.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this chapter a heifer is burned with other items, and the ashes are used to make a water for impurity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By reading the whole chapter we can understand that the impurity, the uncleanness, refers mainly to the filthiness of death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This water is a provision to get rid of the effect and impurity of death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Immediately after the rebellion in chapter sixteen, death was everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In one day fourteen thousand seven hundred people died, and their carcasses lay everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In many of the tents in the camp, there were dead bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A man became contaminated by touching a dead body 19:11 , by being present when a person died v. 18 , or by entering the tent where a dead body had been v. 14 . The entire population of two million Israelites was under the effect of death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They were all in a situation of impurity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, there was the need for the water for impurity to annul the effect and impurity of death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Probably, in Exodus and Leviticus God did not have the thought concerning the water for impurity, because in those times there was not such a popular, universal death as in Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Numbers 19 death overshadowed the entire people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After the death of the fourteen thousand seven hundred, virtually all the tents and every vessel in the tents became contaminated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Wherever anyone went or whatever he touched, he became unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In chapter seventeen, the budding rod was a vindication of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then, in chapter eighteen, the regulations were restated as a reconfirmation of the compensation to the priests and the Levites so that the problem would be settled forever.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Finally, in chapter nineteen, the water for impurity was invented to deal with the universal effect of death among God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A. Its Composition</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us first consider the composition of the water for impurity and see how this water was composed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A Heifer</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"This is the statute of the law which Jehovah has commanded, saying, Tell the sons of Israel to bring you a red heifer without blemish, in which there is no defect, and upon which a yoke has never come" 19:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This heifer, the principal component of the water for purification, signifies Christ for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>a. Red</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The color red signifies the likeness of the flesh of sin, for the bearing of man's sin outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Christ was incarnated, He became in the likeness of the flesh of sin Rom 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without Blemish</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The heifer was without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This signifies that Christ was without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although Christ was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, within Him there was no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He did not have the sinful nature.</S>
