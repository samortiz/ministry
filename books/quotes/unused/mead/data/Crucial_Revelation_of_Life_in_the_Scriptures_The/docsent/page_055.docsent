   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Much more, we shall be saved in His life from death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This kind of saving from death includes being set free from sin, and also includes sanctification, transformation, conformation to the image of Christ, and the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are independent because we are short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Ezekiel 37 the bones were dried up thoroughly, so every bone was individual and separate from the other bones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The bones were separated and detached from one another because there was no life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because there was no life, they were disjointed, separated, and absolutely individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The bones of our human body are joined together to be one body through, by, and with life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In like manner, we are built together into one Body through, by, and with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE TRANSFORMATION AND GROWTH OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to be impressed that in many respects we are still full of death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are still so weak, loose, sloppy, careless, independent, individualistic, and unwilling to be coordinated with others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All these are signs of our weakness, and our weakness is simply deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more life we have, the more this life will swallow up the death in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then there will be a real transformation in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not think that transformation is something that happens in a sudden way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Transformation goes on hour after hour, moment by moment, and little by little all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By the Lord's mercy, I have been under the transformation of the inner life for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not think that it is necessary to pray and fast for a period of time to undergo the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Transformation does not come in a sudden way but works in a very normal way day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Bit by bit the transformation of the inner life works in a very normal and ordinary way, even with the small things in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may not be able to sense the transformation of life, but after a certain period of time there will be a difference in our being because of the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We cannot see much growth in life in a young child from day to day, but after a year we are able to see some growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From one day to the next we cannot see any difference in the flowers or fruit trees.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But after a certain period of time, we are able to see the flowers blossom and the fruit trees bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The growth of the plant life is not something that comes suddenly but gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After a certain period of time, we are able to see the blossoms and the fruit, the evidence of the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we mean business with the Lord to enjoy Christ as the life within us, there should be a change with us after a certain period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If there is no change or progress with us after a certain amount of time, this indicates that we are not enjoying the saving inner life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more that we say, "O Lord, Amen," the more life we will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Spontaneously, we will be saved in His life from all the signs of death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We will be saved from all the weakness and inability to meet God's requirements according to His divine standard.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>KNOWING THE POWER OF THE LORD'S RESURRECTION LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Philippians 3:10a Paul said that he wanted to know the power of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This power is His resurrection life which raised Him from among the dead Eph 1:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to know and experience the life power of the Lord's resurrection to be saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>SAVED IN LIFE TO REIGN IN LIFE AND BE BUILT UP INTO THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to bring this fellowship to the Lord and pray-read the verses in the Scripture reading in Romans until we sense that the life within us is really ruling and reigning like a king.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we will not only walk in newness of life Rom 6:4 and not only be saved in life 5:10 , but we will also reign in life 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we will have the full freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We will reign as a king in life by taking Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nothing will be a bondage to us because we will be free in our enjoyment of the saving life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we are being saved in His life, we will be sanctified, transformed, and built up into the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sanctification, transformation, and the building up of the Body come out of the saving of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE WAY TO ENJOY THE SAVING OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The way that we enjoy this saving of life is revealed in Romans 10.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verses 12 and 13 tell us that the Lord is rich to all who call upon Him and that whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we call upon the name of the Lord, we are saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we call upon Him, we enjoy the saving life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May the Lord be merciful to us so that we may enjoy His saving life to the fullest extent day by day.</S>
