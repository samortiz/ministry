   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRACTICE OF FELLOWSHIP IN A SMALL GROUP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to our present situation there is an urgent need for the light of the truth and the supply of life in the small groups; there is not much need for in-depth explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In our practice of the small groups, we need to have the light of the truth and the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we come to a small group meeting, there should not be any formality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The meeting can begin in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the chair that you sit on is not comfortable, you can switch to a little stool.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a small group there is no need for polite talk or religious rituals and methods.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we come together, we should greet one another spontaneously and have a spirit of mutual concern, mutual teaching, and mutual care.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may say, Thank the Lord, we have two more saints today than the last time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Another saint may say, Yes, I really thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Last time I came and tasted the sweetness of fellowship among the saints, so I am here again today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then a more experienced saint may say, Thank the Lord, our fellowship last time was really sweet, and he may continue with a prayer: Lord, we thank You that this brother came last week and was touched and graced by You.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way, spontaneously everyone will enter into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Perhaps the brother who was graced by the Lord would follow in prayer and say that he received much help last time from reading a portion from Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a good opportunity to enter into the truth of the Bible according to his need.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To pursue the truth in fellowship during a small group meeting, we can use the Recovery Version as much as it is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The purpose of reading the Recovery Version is to help the saints understand the Bible, see light in the truth, and receive the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This depends on our labor in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, before the meeting we must read through the portion of the Scriptures that will be covered that day with the related footnotes and Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can practice with Romans 1:1-4.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the meeting we can read the outline for this portion and then read the text.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the small group there may be time to read only four verses, but in our preparation we should prepare more verses.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not need to read the footnotes, nor do we need to recite the verses.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We only need to remember the thought in the verses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After reading the verses, some saints can speak the content of the verses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more experienced saints can add a little explanation of the verses.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then there can be prayer related to the content of the verses: Lord, we truly thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You are the subject of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The gospel is not concerning heaven or hell but concerning You.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the flesh, You are the Son of Man, and indeed You are a man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the Spirit of holiness, You resurrected from the dead and were designated the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, You are the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You are God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The footnotes are for us to be equipped.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, we need to study the footnotes thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If someone in the small group meeting asks about the meaning of the Spirit of holiness, we can explain, but not in the way of a study.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can also say that if the saints want to know more, they can get a copy of the Recovery Version and study it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to use the Life-study messages, we must prepare before the meeting so that we know which points need to be stressed and which points do not.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, Message 2 of the Life-study of Romans is on the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose the first paragraph is read in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you get to the portion that says, The Christ in the four Gospels was among the disciples; the Christ in Romans is within us, we should take the opportunity to speak three or five sentences to stress this point.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may say, After Christ died and resurrected, He became the life-giving Spirit who dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Or we can select a different portion from the message that concerns Christ and read it together to emphasize life and not truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this case we may say to the others, The book of Romans shows that the Lord Jesus today is not the same as He was with Peter, James, and John.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today He has passed through death and resurrection and has become the life-giving Spirit to dwell in us and to be our life practically.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have the same life and the same living with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then all the saints can fellowship based on the portion of the message that was read.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After the fellowship we can give a three to five sentence summary, such as, Paul s word in this portion is a crystallized speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It shows that our precious Lord Jesus is a man in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is also God with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He went through human living, died, resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit to dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We hope that after this fellowship we all will live in Him every day, taking Him as our life, having fellowship with Him daily, and living Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All those in attendance will never forget this kind of summary.</S>
