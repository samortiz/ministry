Other than Christ, God has not given anything to man. But it is strange that even though man claims that he knows this fact and has heard it already, he may still hold on to many things apart from Christ.</p><p>The main cause of poverty is pride. Pride is evil, and it is foolish to be proud. Only those who are in darkness can be proud. Everything that man is proud of is worthless in the eyes of God. Unfortunately many people do not realize this; they do not realize how worthless the things that they take pride in are. Those who are in the light will never be proud even if you force them to be so. Light alone can strip a person of everything. It shatters him and restricts his vision to the Lord alone. The whole matter rests on how much we have seen the Lord. If we have not seen Him, our experiences are merely isolated events. Even if these experiences are scriptural or spiritual, they are worthless in the eyes of the Lord.</p><p>First Corinthians 1:30 is one of the great verses in the New Testament: "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption." The colon after the phrase "who became wisdom to us from God" indicates that wisdom includes righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</p><p>We must note that this verse does not say that Christ has become our Justifier, Sanctifier, or Redeemer. It says that Christ has become our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are three important items in God's salvation. On the one hand, we have to know that Christ is our objective Justifier, Sanctifier, and Redeemer, but on the other hand, we have to go on to know that Christ is our subjective righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Many people can testify that Christ is their Justifier, Sanctifier, and Redeemer, but they do not know that Christ is also their righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. We must consider what it means for God to say that Christ is our wisdom: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BECOMING OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>Man needs righteousness when he comes before God. Righteousness has much to do with God. As soon as we think about God, the question of righteousness comes in. Suppose you leave your bedroom and go downstairs to meet a guest. The first thing that comes to your mind is the way that you are dressed. You will surely tidy up a little. Similarly, when man comes to God, the first thing that comes to his mind is the question of righteousness. Without righteousness no man can see God. In the Christian life, righteousness is a very basic matter. If a Christian has not settled the issue of righteousness, his foundation is not secure.</p><p>Christians often consider righteousness to be something related to conduct. The world also thinks that man's righteousness has to do with his conduct. When it says that a man is not righteous, it means that his conduct is not very good. This is why Christians often come to God based on their own conduct. If their conduct on a certain day is poor or if they have lost their temper and engaged in arguments, they dare not pray when they come to the prayer meeting. Even when they pray, they can only pray in a soft voice. But if they behave well on that day and do not lose their temper or argue with others, they will pray with a loud voice in the prayer meeting. These Christians are using their own conduct as the standard of their righteousness. But God takes Christ as the standard of our righteousness.</p><p>I have found one interesting thing in my life&mdash;conduct and righteousness are two different things. In the past I thought that my conduct constituted my righteousness when I came to God. Now I see that only Christ is my righteousness. Our conduct is not our righteousness. I have discovered that my righteousness is a person, the One who is sitting on the throne. Brothers and sisters, we can improve our conduct; we can be more diligent and love others as ourselves, but none of these things can be counted as our righteousness. Our conduct can improve and change; it can change for better or for worse, but this will not change our righteousness, because our righteousness is the unchangeable One on the throne. Now I come to God through Him. Ten or twenty years from now, I will still come to God through Him. He does not change.</p><p>Such a revelation will greatly change your Christian life. You will see that good behavior cannot justify your boasting before the Lord, nor should bad behavior become a cause for discouragement before Him. Only Christ is your righteousness! This is a law, something that will never change. You can criticize my poor conduct, but you cannot criticize my righteousness. Christ as my righteousness is unblamable. My righteousness is Christ&mdash;this is the greatest salvation. A Christian can be a believer for ten years and improve his conduct in many ways, but until he realizes that Christ is his righteousness, he will not know what salvation is. Simply listening to this message will not give you deliverance; deliverance only comes when you have a true revelation. In the past you received Christ as your Savior. Now you need to receive Christ as your salvation.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 45: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (5) &nbsp; pg 34</div><br></body></html>
