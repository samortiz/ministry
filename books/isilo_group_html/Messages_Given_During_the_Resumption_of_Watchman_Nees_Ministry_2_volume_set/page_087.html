Concerning Knowing<br>the Brothers and Sisters</H2><P>Do we have a definite understanding about the condition of the brothers and sisters? Do the brothers and sisters know each other? One brother has been in the church for two months, but this Brother Cheng, who has been in the church for three years, still does not know that one's first name; he only knows that his surname is Chen. We are saying that brothers and sisters should have fellowship one with another. But if we do not even know the names of one another, how can we have fellowship? Can you tell me twelve names of brothers and sisters who are here? Paul could remember so many names in Romans 16. I do not mean that you have to know everything about the brothers and sisters, but at least you have to know their names. If you do not know their names, it is too vague to say that you are practicing the brotherly love.</P><P>Today I have no message to give to you. I have come to bother you. If you want me to give you messages, I can give them to you every day for three months, and I will still not exhaust the messages. However, what I am doing here today is not giving you messages.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Concerning Our Testimony<br>in Our Daily Life</H2><P>Do we have a real testimony at home? Have we lost our temper at home? Have we preached to the members of our own family? Have we prayed for them? Have you ever prayed with a few brothers in private for others, for your colleagues, your classmates? If you have not done these things, you are not living a solid Christian life. Let me ask you: Do you agree with what I am saying?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EXPERIENCING THE LORD IN A PRACTICAL WAY,<br>AND BEING A PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN</H2><P>If we want to follow the Lord, we have to be a practical Christian. Only by experiencing the Lord in such a practical way will we know what humility is and what it is to serve the Lord. Our message meetings in the future do not need too much doctrine. We only need to check if others are willing to go on. May the Lord be merciful to us and give us a thorough repentance, so that we would no more be just a Chinese, but be another kind of person, one with a pure heart and clean hands.</P><P>[Editor's note: After Brother Lee's words, the brothers and sisters prayed a little. Then everyone sang "Just as I Am," the last two stanzas. Four or five more prayed. Brother Mak wept, and other sisters wept. After this, the brothers and sisters all agreed that Brother Lee should speak ten or even one hundred times more severely than he did, and everyone raised their hands to show that they would take these words.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCLUDING PRAYER</H2><P>Concluding prayer at 11 p.m.: Lord, be merciful to us. For many years we have had only the outward works and zeal. Others may have thought that we were quite good, and we ourselves have thought that we were quite good. But this time you have enlightened us, and now we realize that we have nothing. All our works are wood, grass, and stubble, and they cannot stand the fire. We confess that we love the world, that we indulge ourselves in the flesh, that we do not have love, and that we have sinned much. O Lord, wash us with the precious blood of Jesus Christ. Preserve us and strengthen us in the days ahead. In the name of the Lord Jesus, we pray. Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FELLOWSHIP WITH BROTHER WEIGH KWANG-HSI</H2><P>[Editor's note: conversation between Brother Lee and Brother Weigh after the meeting.]</P><P>Brother Lee: It is hard for you to handle the work in Hong Kong, Canton, and Swatow all by yourself.</P><P>Brother Weigh: It would be best if some co-workers can come from Shanghai and work in these three places, which can serve as stations. When these three stations are strengthened, there can be further spreading out.</P><P>Brother Lee: When I was in Shanghai, I talked with Brother Yu concerning the matter of the inner life, and we both have the same feelings. Sometimes even the examples are similar. In the future, the way to build up the church is by the three things: the gospel, the revival, and life. All three things have to go on at the same time. Concerning this, everyone feels the same. I thought that I was the only one to use the term "migration," but I found out that Brother Nee also used this term.</P><P>Brother Weigh: Concerning Brother Nee, he felt that there are some things that are hard for him to do. He has received no commission to do what you are doing now, but neither can his burden be released among the ordinary brothers and sisters. This time when you go to Amoy and Foochow, perhaps you can have more talks with the brothers and sisters who are really for the Lord. Hopefully, there can be more fellowship with the co-workers and the elders.</P><P>Brother Lee: At present, there is practically no testimony in Canton. Outwardly things look good, but inwardly it is empty. These few places need some serious work done in them. May the Lord be merciful. God has no intention for us to keep His will in an outward way. This time in Swatow, I have not expected others to understand my words. I only hope that some would receive light before the Lord in a genuine way.</P><P>[The fellowship lasted until midnight.]</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_086.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_088.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 87</div><br></body></html>
