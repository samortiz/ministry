   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE THE SALVATION OF GOD 2 Date:Saturday evening, March 11, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading:John 1:14, 16-18; Rom 8:6, 9-11, 13-14, 28-30</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Witness Lee: The goal of God's salvation has always been to put His life into man and to make it man's life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This goal was foreordained by God before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before the world ever came into being, God planned to work His life into a group of people and to express this life through them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Unfortunately, during the past two thousand years of church history, very few people have seen this light clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Most people do not see this light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Perhaps you are one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Your view of God's salvation may be something like this: Our forefather Adam fell.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He incurred a debt of sin before God and committed acts of sin within himself Rom 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This fallen man could not remove his sinful debt or turn from sinful acts no matter how hard he tried.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the one hand, man has inherited the debt of sin in Adam; he is condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the other hand, he has the life of sin within him, and spontaneously he commits acts of sin outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The result is condemnation by God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But one day the Lord Jesus, the second man, came.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He came as the last Adam 1 Cor 15:47, 45 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He died and shed His blood for us, thus settling our sinful debt.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His salvation saves us from a life of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a higher realization.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who do not have such a high realization only know that they are sinners and that they cannot go to heaven if they do not believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If they believe in Him they will have peace, and the Holy Spirit will come upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When they die one day, they will enter blissful enjoyment in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although our concept may not be that low, we have to admit that our view of God's salvation is not as high as God's. If our understanding of God's salvation is according to the above description, we have taken God's salvation as a crutch to solve only our problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If all we know is that man has sinned and is suffering and that he can go to heaven and have joy through faith in Jesus, we have a very elementary, simple, superficial, and shallow understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some may have seen something higher.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They may see that a man has inherited nothing but sin and death in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once he is in Christ he is justified and liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But a person who knows God's salvation to this extent can only say that God's salvation delivers him from sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In his daily living and in his dealings with God, he is concerned with one thing only deliverance from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He deals with unclean thoughts, transgressions with the tongue, jealousy, pride, etc. But if we were completely delivered from sin today, would we still need God's salvation? Perhaps we think that we are justified before God as long as we have the right view and live a righteous, pure, and virtuous life, not losing our temper or casting evil eyes on others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we have uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord and are meek, right in our words and conduct, and fully submissive to inner, spiritual feelings, have we reached God's goal?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose we are fully satisfied with our personal life and have fully realized our spiritual aspirations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Does this mean that God's salvation is fully realized in us?</S>
