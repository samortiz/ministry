   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Soulish believers love to learn to use spiritual terminology.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They delight in learning all the terms, phrases, and special expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When there is an appropriate occasion, they will use them one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While working, they use spiritual words as the material for their speaking, although perhaps without their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is also true in their praying.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Soulish believers are very ambitious, always desiring to stand out among men.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They have a strong sense of vainglory in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They aspire to be powerful workers, greatly used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is the reason?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They want to gain some position for themselves, that is some glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They like to compare themselves with others probably not so much with those whom they do not know, but with their co-workers and those they know.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such comparison and secret competition are very fierce.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They look down at those who are behind them, regarding them as falling far too short.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Compared with those who have higher and deeper spiritual experiences, they think they are in no way inferior.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They always desire to be great and to be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They hope that their work will be prosperous and that it will be presentable.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Naturally these things are deeply hidden in their heart, unknown to others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of course, sometimes these thoughts are mingled with other purer thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, the prevalence of such thoughts is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is easy for soulish believers to become self-satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the Lord were to use them to save a person, they would be exceedingly happy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If they were to succeed once, they would be elated, considering themselves successful in the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Should they know a little or learn a little, they think that they have reached a very profound stage.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A common indication of soulish believers is that they, like a small vessel, are easily filled.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They do not have the view of seeing how great the depth of the ocean is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As long as there is some water in their bucket, they are complacent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They have not yet lost themselves in God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Otherwise, whatever happens will be to them as if nothing has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their eyes remain focused on their puny selves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, they are affected very easily by a small gain or loss.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a capacity is the reason God cannot use them more.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If they become so happy and boast to such an extent when ten persons are saved, what will happen if a thousand persons are saved?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After some successful work in their preaching, soulish believers always have a thought that they are very wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Often they dwell upon their superiority and self-delight, thinking that they are different from others, "greater than the greatest apostle," to sum this up in one word wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes they are sad because others do not regard them so.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They think that others treat them in this way simply because they are without eyes to recognize that they are the prophets from Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sometimes they think that in their message there are several ideas which no one has ever discovered, and if the audience cannot appreciate the marvelous points, they become troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After some successful work, they will dwell in their self-satisfaction for a day or two, or at least they will feel self-contented for a few hours.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Under such a condition they often think that soon the church of God will see a great evangelist, revivalist, or writer in them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If no one pays attention to them, how sorrowful they are!</S>
