However, they are mainly for man to enjoy in the age of the kingdom and not in the age of the church. In the age of the church God's riches are not as abundant. However, the church and the kingdom are closely related. As soon as the church age passes away, the kingdom age will come. All of God's provisions for the church are a preparation for the kingdom age. The salvation described in 1 Peter 1 has to do with the coming age. In God's eyes He has prepared only one set of blessings for those in this age and the next age; there are not two sets of blessings. Therefore, God wants to have a group of people in the church age who will have a foretaste of the riches of the kingdom in the coming age.</p><h2 class="head2">Eternal Life</h2><p>In Luke 18, the Lord mentions one kind of eternal life, which we inherit in the coming age. It is for the kingdom and not for the church. However, in John 6 the Lord says, "He who believes has eternal life" (v. 47). Actually, the eternal life that Christians receive in the church age is no different from the eternal life that God's children receive in the kingdom age. But the eternal life in the kingdom is a general blessing, whereas the eternal life in the church today is a foretaste and a pledge.</p><h2 class="head2">Forgiveness of Sins</h2><p>Zechariah 13:1 says that in that day there will be an opened fountain for the people of Israel for sin and for impurity. In the church believers are already experiencing the forgiveness of sins. This is a foretaste.</p><h2 class="head2">Rest</h2><p>Hebrews 4 mentions another Sabbath rest, which is enjoyed in the kingdom. But in Matthew 11:28 the Lord said, "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest." This is something that we can enjoy today.</p><h2 class="head2">Regeneration</h2><p>Ezekiel 36:26-27 refers to the kingdom age, in which God will lead the Israelites back to their own land and give them a new heart and a new spirit. In the church we are regenerated and have a new heart and a new spirit. For God's chosen people, the Israelites, both the indwelling and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit will be experienced in the kingdom (Joel 2). But in the church today we have a foretaste of these gifts (Acts 2).</p><h2 class="head2">The New Covenant</h2><p>Jeremiah 31 shows us that the new covenant is something that God will establish with the house of Israel. But today the church is enjoying all the contents of this new covenant (Heb. 8:8-12).</p><h2 class="head2">Resurrection</h2><p>The resurrection spoken of in Revelation 20 is in the future. But today Christians are resurrected with Christ already.</p><h2 class="head2">The Gifts of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Joel 2:28-32 tells us that the Holy Spirit will be poured out in the future, but in Acts 2 the church experienced it first.</p><h2 class="head2">The Annulling of Death</h2><p>Revelation 20:14 says that death will be thrown into the lake of fire. This is something that will happen in the future. However, 1 Corinthians 15 says that the power of death has been removed in the church (vv. 55-57), and Christ has nullified death (2 Tim. 1:10).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> </body></html>
