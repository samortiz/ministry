   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE THE LORD'S ABUNDANT BLESSING UPON ZION Psalms 126 to 134 Scripture Reading: Psa 126:1-6; 127:1; 128:5; 129:5-8; 132:3-5, 7-8, 11, 13-18; 133:1-3; 134:1-3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Book V, as we have seen, indicates how the house and the city of God become the praise, safety, and desire of the saints, and how Christ comes to reign over the whole earth through the house and the city of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the main theme of this book, and this is the ultimate issue of all the books.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now not only do we have Christ, the house, and even the city, but everything is ready for Christ to come, to take over the whole earth, and to reign as the King with His saints through the house and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now what must we do?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is nothing left to do but to praise and shout our hallelujahs.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, Book V is a book of hallelujahs, a book of hallelujah Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first section of Book V is composed of the thirteen Psalms from Psalm 107 to 119.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen in this section the two outstanding Psalms of Christ, Psalms 110 and 118.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second section of Book V is composed of the fifteen Psalms of ascent, from Psalm 120 to 134.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this section the house and the city of God are the center.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, in the first section of Book V we reach the highest peak of Christ Himself, whereas in section 2 of Book V the house and the city of God are the focal point.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some say that according to history these Psalms of ascent were sung by the people of Israel while they were ascending from the plain to the mountain of Zion for worship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Others say that these Psalms were used extensively by the captives when they returned from Babylon unto Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether they were used by one company or the other, both were ascending from a lower place to a higher one; both were going up to Jerusalem, the city of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From the very content of these fifteen Psalms of ascent, we do have ground to believe that these songs were indeed sung either by the worshippers ascending to Zion or by the captives returning from Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should never forget Psalms 110 and 118 in the first section of Book V. Neither should we forget Psalm 122 in the second section of Book V, the Psalms of ascension it is the first precious one in this group.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"I rejoiced when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE CAPTIVITY TURNED</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we come to Psalm 126, another outstanding Psalm in this section.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It opens in this way: "When the Lord turned the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream" v. 1 . The turning of their captivity was like a dream because it was too good, too great, too wonderful, and it occurred so quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You remember the account of Peter's release from prison in Acts 12.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When he came to the door of Mary's house, the people reacted as if they were in a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It seemed too good to be true.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peter himself, when he was first released, imagined that he was in a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the release of Peter from prison is quite insignificant when compared with the return of the captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many times when I have considered the recovery of the church life I also have felt as if I were in a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is so good.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We never expected it, and it came so quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I believe that many of you feel this way also.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You would say, "Now I am in the church life!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Two years ago I would never have thought I would be here, and even a few months ago I never imagined this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But, hallelujah, here I am.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I must be dreaming!"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is too wonderful; it is too sweet; it is something which has transpired so quickly and unexpectedly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hallelujah, we are the returned captivity, and we are all in a wonderful dream.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet, praise the Lord, it is so real!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord has turned the captivity of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Psalmist continues, "Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the nations, The Lord hath done great things for them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The saints rejoiced with singing for the return of the captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was a great thing the Lord did for them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the returned ones were still not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Something had taken place as in a dream, but they still needed more turning.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore verse 4 says, "Turn our captivity, O Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is as if the Psalmist were saying, "We are just partly turned; a great part is not turned yet.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may rejoice for ourselves, but we must cry to the Lord for others."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A great part of the captivity has not yet been turned.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"Turn our captivity, O Lord," as the streams restored and as the sheaves brought in.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For many years I was familiar with the last two verses of Psalm 126: "They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing seed for scattering, shall come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I never realized, however, that these two verses are the Psalmist's words for the return of the captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we cry to the Lord to turn our captivity, the tears flow down.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many dear saints in ancient times experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They wept as they prayed for the return of the captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then they went out to sow the seed, the seed of turning, the seed of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the opening chapters of Ezra the names of a good number of returning ones are recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But Ezra was not included in this group.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It was years later that Ezra and others returned to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After the first group returned from captivity unto Jerusalem, there should be another group to follow them out of captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, those who first returned sowed the seed of the recovery with tears.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then the day came when another group returned as the bringing in of dried sheaves from a dry land.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>So many returned to Jerusalem with the sheaves of the returned people.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must read these two verses in such a context.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today we can shout Hallelujah for such a dream as in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are in the local church life!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But look at the situation: thousands of the Lord's people are still in captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We may shout for ourselves, but we must weep for them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must sow the seed of recovery with weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The captivity is just as the dried sheaves; therefore we must water the captivity with our tears.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we do, it will not be long before more captives will be brought into the church life just as the bundles of sheaves.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What about the city where you live?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Are there not many still in captivity?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Do you not need to be burdened as a sower to sow the seed of the Lord's recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We all should be so burdened; we all should weep with tears saying, "Lord, turn the captivity just as the restoration of dried sheaves in a dry land."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we sow like this, we will soon come with rejoicing, bringing our sheaves with us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We will come to the next conference with sheaves.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They that sow with tears shall reap with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The sheaves will be brought to the temple of God as firstfruits.</S>
