   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 2 DAY 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Cor 15:45 The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>6:17 But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Spirit Being One with Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all need to see that our believing in Jesus and our being baptized into Him means that He comes into us and we are put into Him so that He and we become one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is in us, and we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is possible only because of the two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is the divine Spirit, and we have a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The divine Spirit is in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, in our spirit we are one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>51</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First Corinthians 15:45b tells us that the last Adam, the Lord Jesus our Savior, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This Spirit has come into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, 1 Corinthians 6:17 says that we have become one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Within us there truly is the fact that the two spirits are mingled as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 2 Timothy 4:22 Paul says, "The Lord be with your spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This implies that the Lord is Spirit; otherwise, He could not be able to enter our spirit and be with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This again proves that the Lord Spirit has become one spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Practicing Being One Spirit with the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The highest Christian life is a life of the two spirits becoming one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This surpasses ethics and morality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today you and I do not merely have a conscience, the innate knowledge of good and the innate ability to do good, nor do we only have a created spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Within our created spirit we also have the Spirit of God, who is our Redeemer and who became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today I want to help everyone to practice living by this mingled spirit, that is, to practice being one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Your being saved is not just a matter of your sins being forgiven, your being cleansed by the blood, or your being redeemed and regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>More than that, the Lord as the Spirit has entered your regenerated spirit and mingled with your regenerated spirit to become one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the most precious point.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>52</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ has become the life-giving Spirit as the life and life supply in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we must live in our spirit to experience the salvation and the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man has a three-layer constitution: the outermost layer is the body; within the body is the second layer, which is the soul; and within the soul is the third layer, which is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today Christ is the Spirit, and within us we also have a spirit; therefore, we can experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The two spirits the Lord's Spirit and our spirit are mingled and have fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This may be compared to metal conducting electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we sin, an insulation comes between us and the Lord and then the "electricity" cannot pass through.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At such a time we need to open up to Him in our spirit to repent and confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this way the barrier of sin is removed; immediately we can have fellowship with the Lord Spirit and once again experience His salvation within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the Lord Jesus is no longer a doctrine to us but a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As the Spirit, He now indwells our spirit so that we can daily experience Him as our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>53</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to contact God in spirit, sometimes we have to stop the activities of our body and our soul, and then we have to cry out to God and call on the Lord Jesus from our deepest part.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do this, immediately there will be light within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever we stop the activities of our body and our soul, allow the Spirit to work in us, and call from our spirit, "O God!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>O Lord Jesus!" then, instead of being in our outward activities, we remain in our spirit, the innermost part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>54</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many times I have been asked how I, as an elderly man, could be so active and so energetic.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>My secret is that I am one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today, many toys are made to operate by electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is electricity which makes them so active.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because we are one spirit with Christ, we have the heavenly, divine electricity energizing us continually.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>55</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
