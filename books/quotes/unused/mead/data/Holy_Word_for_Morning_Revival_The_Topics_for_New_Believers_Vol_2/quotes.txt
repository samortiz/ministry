[1]  Exo 3:14 And God said to Moses, I AM WHO I AM.
[2]  Isa 9:6 ...A Son is given to us...and His name will be called...Eternal Father...
[3]  Matt 28:19 Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[4]  Acts 7:2 ...The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham....
[5]  Many more particulars concerning God s person are revealed in the New Testament than are unveiled in the Old Testament....God s way of revealing this is to present a little in one place and a little more in another place....These points may be compared to the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that need to be put together in order to form a complete picture.
[6]  The fellowship of the Spirit is the impartation of the grace of the Lord with the love of God, since the Spirit is the transmission of the Lord with God for our experience and enjoyment of the Triune God with all His attributes.
[7]  Matt 16:16 And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[8]  1:5, 7 ...God is light....Walk in the light...
[9]  When we speak of God s attributes, we refer to all that belongs to God.
[10]  Heb 12:10 ...That we might partake of His holiness.
[11]  Phil 2:13 For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.
[12]  Holiness is one of the main attributes of our God....The mentioning of holy three times, as in Isaiah 6:3, implies the thought of God being triune....The emphasis here is that the Triune God is holy and is triply holy, referring to the quality of God s nature God s being.
[13]  Hymns, #12 O God, Thou art the source of life,
[14]  Acts 10:36 ...Announcing the gospel of peace through Jesus Christ this One is Lord of all .
[15]  Matt 1:23 ...They shall call His name Emmanuel which is translated, God with us .
[16]  In order for us to enjoy God s dispensing, we need to consider all the aspects of who Christ is and what Christ is.
[17]  Rom 9:5 ...The Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever.
[18]  1 Cor 1:30 But of Him God you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.
[19]  Christ as the sanctification from God to us 1 Cor 1:30 is not only sanctifying us in position, but in disposition also, so that we can be set apart to God from everything common....Through Him, the divine dispensing is continually transmitted into us, sanctifying our whole being spirit, soul, and body making us holy, full of the divine element to live out an excelling living.
[20]  Gal 2:20 I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me...
[21]  Phil 1:21 For to me, to live is Christ...
[22]  Gen 1:2 ...The Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters.
[23]  According to the entire revelation of the sixty-six books of the Bible, the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is for God s dispensing....God s desire with His strong intention is to dispense Himself into His chosen people as their life, as their life supply, and as their everything.
[24]  In Jeremiah 2:13 God refers to Himself as the fountain of living waters; in John 4:14 Christ is the fountain of water springing up in the believers into eternal life; and in Revelation 22:1 the Spirit is the flow, the river of water of life.
[25]  79 This divine title is first used when God came in to prepare a forerunner of the Lord Jesus Luke 1:15 and a human body for Christ v. 35 . This indicates that the Holy Spirit is related to the incarnation of God.
[26]  He also sends forth God the Spirit to impart His life into us that we may become His sons in reality....Once we have been born of the Spirit, we need the Spirit in order to grow in life.
[27]  Phil 1:19 For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[28]  2 Cor 3:18 But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
[29]  It indicates that in the Spirit there is not only the divine element of God but also the human element of Jesus and the elements of His human living and suffering of death.
[30]  The Spirit of Christ is concerning Christ in His divinity, who conquered death and became the life in resurrection with the resurrection power, indicating that in the Spirit there is the element of divinity that became the death-conquering and the life-dispensing Spirit Rom 8:9b .
[31]  The Spirit of Jesus Christ refers to the Spirit, comprising all the elements of Jesus humanity with His death and Christ s divinity with His resurrection, who becomes the bountiful supply of the unsearchable Christ for the support of His believers Phil 1:19b .
[32]  The Spirit is called the Spirit of reality because whatever the Father in the Son is and whatever the Son is, is realized in the Spirit....God the Father is light, and God the Son is life.
[33]  Rev 1:4 ...Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne.
[34]  John 7:39 But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.
[35]  The seven Spirits in Revelation 1:4 undoubtedly are the Spirit of God because They are ranked among the Triune God.
[36]  97 The Spirit of God was there from the beginning Gen 1:1-2 , but at the time the Lord spoke this word, the Spirit as the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , was not yet, because the Lord had not yet been glorified.
[37]  John 20:22 ...He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.
[38]  On the day of His resurrection Christ breathed Himself into His disciples as the holy breath....The divine breath in John 20:22 is the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God reaching His redeemed people.
[39]  But after Christ s resurrection these elements were compounded into the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God became the Spirit, the compound Spirit symbolized by the compound ointment see Life-study of Exodus, Messages 157-163 .
[40]  Rom 8:2 For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.
[41]  The record concerning the compound ointment in Exodus 30 is extremely significant....The revelation concerning the compound ointment was not given in chapter one of Exodus...but toward the end of chapter thirty, after God s dwelling place the tabernacle and the priesthood God s serving ones had been revealed....
[42]  John 1:12-13 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
[43]  Rom 8:17 And if children, heirs also; on the one hand, heirs of God; on the other, joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him.
[44]  When we became children of God, we were not born of our physical life, our fallen life, or our created life we were born of God, the uncreated life.
[45]  Rom 8:29 Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers.
[46]  Matt 16:24 Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.
[47]  1 Pet 4:15-16 For...if one suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name.
[48]  Matt 13:38 ...And the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom...
[49]  2 Cor 5:17 So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[50]  Based upon the fact that the Spirit of God dwells within the lover of Christ John 14:17 , God the Father and the Son come to the lover of Christ and make a mutual abode with him v. 23 . John 14:23 says that if anyone loves the Son, the Father and He will come to make an abode with him.
[51]  Hymns, #840 Freed from self and Adam s nature,
[52]  Eph 3:9 And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things.
[53]  Many dear saints throughout the centuries received light on many things in the Bible, but they missed the mark of God s divine economy and the goal of God s eternal purpose.
[54]  1 Cor 12:13 ...In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks...
[55]  On the day of His resurrection,...after showing the disciples His hands and His side John 20:20 , the Lord breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit v. 22 .... Then after appearing to His disciples for a period of forty days, the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens.
[56]  John 19:34 But one of the soldiers pierced His side...and immediately there came out blood and water.
[57]  1 John 4:13 In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit.
[58]  190 When God issues out, He becomes the church....The intrinsic significance of the church, from the entire New Testament, is that the church is God s total reproduction, God s continuation, God s increase, God s full growth, and God s rich surplus....Such a high vision of the church needs us to pray, Lord, give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation to see and to know what Your church is.
[59]  Hence, we can see that oil being poured upon a stone signifies that God is poured upon man, that God is mingled with man....When God as the Spirit comes upon and into His redeemed people, the two are mingled together.
[60]  Gal 6:16 And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.
[61]  195 God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God.
[62]  The heavens, the earth, and man, created by God, are not God s masterpiece; but the church, the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all 1:23 , the corporate and universal new man 2:15 , is a masterpiece.
[63]  1 Tim 3:15 ...The house of God, which is the church of the living God...
[64]  220 What then is the difference between the Body and the new man?...The Body of Christ is a matter of life, whereas the new man is a matter of person....Both the life and the person are Christ....On the one hand, the church is the Body of Christ, and we take Christ as our life to act, to work, and to bear responsibilities.
[65]  Psa 145:13 Your kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and Your dominion is throughout all generations.
[66]  John 3:3 ...Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
[67]  Thus far in the past five weeks ...we have covered five major items : God, Christ, the Spirit, the believers, and the church.
[68]  Genesis 1 says that God created man in His own image and that He gave man the authority to rule all the created things v. 26 ....If we are to have the full image of God to express God and to realize the full authority to represent God, to subdue His enemy, to subdue this earth, God Himself must be our life.
[69]  229 Hence, the kingdom of God is also God s reign in a particular way in the sense of life....The Lord s word to Nicodemus in John 3 reveals God s reign in the sense of life.
[70]  The plants in the plant kingdom have the plant life, and the animals in the animal kingdom have the animal life....From the Lord s word to Nicodemus we can see that, if we human beings would know the things of the divine kingdom, we need another life, the divine life, God s life.
[71]  The kingdom of God in the sense of life is actually Christ Himself Luke 17:21 as the seed of life sown into His believers, God s chosen people Mark 4:3, 26 , and developing into a realm in which God may rule as His kingdom in His divine life.
[72]  Eventually, it will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God, an eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God s eternal life for all God s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity Rev 21:1-4; 22:1-5, 14 .
[73]  When the prodigal son returned to his father, he repented and said, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you v. 21 . Against heaven equals before you God the Father . Sinning against heaven is sinning before God, because God the Father is in heaven 11:2 . After we received the call from the heavens, we became another kind of people, people no longer of this earth but of the heavens.... This means that today we are under a rule that is with the heavenly nature.
[74]  Remember, the kingdom of God refers to God s reign in a general way, from eternity past to eternity future, but the kingdom of the heavens 235 in scope is narrower than that of the kingdom of God, since it includes only the church in this age the dispensation of grace and the heavenly part of the millennial kingdom in the coming age.
[75]  Matt 13:31-33 ...The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field, and which is smaller than all the seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.
[76]  Phil 3:14 I pursue toward the goal for the prize to which God in Christ Jesus has called me upward.
[77]  Hymns, #945 The Son of God has come to sow
[78]  Rev 1:1 The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves the things that must quickly take place; and He made it known by signs, sending it by His angel to His slave John.
[79]  In the sixty-six books of the Bible, all the records of plain words, prophecies, and types in the Old Testament, beginning from God s creation, progressing through Satan s rebellion, man s fall, God s promise of redemption to fallen man, God s dealings with the Patriarchs, God s calling of His chosen people, their redemption, their being formed into a nation, their failure, and their recovery, and concluding with their looking to and waiting for Christ; and all the records of plain words, prophecies, and signs in the New Testament, beginning from John the Baptist and the ministry of the Lord Jesus, progressing through the Lord Jesus death, resurrection, ascension, and ministry after His ascension, the work of the apostles, the calling, salvation, and maturity of the believers, the establishment and building up of the church, the Lord Jesus second coming and the things that He will do in His second coming, the establishment of the millennial kingdom, the termination of Satan and his followers, including demons and human beings, and the passing away of the old heaven and the old earth, and concluding with the coming of the new heaven and new earth, are consummated in the New Jerusalem.
[80]  275 The Triune God, His economy, Christ s redemption, God s salvation, the believers, the church, and the kingdom all consummate in this one item the New Jerusalem, 276 which is the greatest and highest divine sign in the New Testament, and the one richest in meaning.
[81]  Rev 21:2 And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God...
[82]  Heb 12:22 But you have come forward to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem...
[83]  The New Jerusalem is the holy city Rev 21:2, 10 ....In the New Testament the word holy means not only separated unto God but also saturated with God, whereas in the Old Testament to be made holy is only to be separated unto God.
[84]  286 As God s habitation, the New Jerusalem will be the tabernacle of God with men for eternity.
[85]  That type was first fulfilled in Christ as God s tabernacle among men John 1:14 and will eventually be fulfilled in the fullest way in the New Jerusalem, which will be the enlargement of Christ as God s dwelling place.
[86]  Rev 21:14, 18-19 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb....And the...wall was jasper....The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation was jasper...
[87]  22:1-2 And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.
[88]  Rev 21:22 And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.
[89]  23 And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.
[90]  Instead, he saw that the temple was the redeeming God v. 22 . 317 The holy city as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in, and God and the Lamb as the temple are for us to dwell in. In eternity we will not dwell in a material city; we will dwell in the Triune God.
