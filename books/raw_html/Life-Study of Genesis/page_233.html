<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Rebellion of the Human Race</H2><P>The second factor of the cause of the fourth fall was the rebellion of the human race. The whole human race rebelled collectively against God's right and authority. As we have seen, the issue was a matter of who would have the right in this universe, of who would have authority on earth. The entire human race was stirred up, having been instigated into rebellion, to declare that they did not care for God's right or for God's authority.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) Man Not Using the Spirit</H2><P>In the first fall man did not use his spirit. If you read Genesis 3, you will see that Adam and Eve had probably forgotten about their spirit. They did not use it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) Man Acting by the Soul</H2><P>In the second fall man acted by his soul. If you read the story of Cain in Genesis 4, you will see that he was a man who was one hundred percent in the soul. He was absolutely outside of his spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) Man Walking according to the Flesh</H2><P>In the third fall man walked according to the flesh. Can you see these three steps? Firstly, man neglected the spirit; secondly, he acted by the soul; and thirdly, he lived and walked absolutely according to the flesh. So by the time of Genesis 6 man had become flesh (6:3). God could no longer tolerate this fallen flesh and He sent the flood as His judgment upon it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>4) The Whole Human Being<br>Rising Up Collectively to Rebel against God</H2><P>In the fourth fall man rose up collectively to rebel against God. His whole being was stirred up by Satan to rebel against God. If you consider your experience, you will find these four things within yourself. Sometimes we do not use our spirit and sometimes we go by the soul. At other times we are much worse, behaving ourselves according to the flesh. At other times the situation is even worse, for deep within us we may say, "I don't care for God." I believe that we have all said this. If we have not said it many times, at least we have said it a few times. I do not believe that there is anyone who has never said this. Although we might not have spoken these words outwardly, deep within we have said, "I don't care for God. He is too troublesome. I am a free person. I don't want to be bothered by God." Even after coming into the church life, there is still within you this sort of satanic instigation. This is the work of Satan to build up Babel in your being once again. Whenever you say that you do not care for God, it means that you intend to build a city and a tower. That is rebellion, the rebellion that comes from Satan's instigation.</P>
