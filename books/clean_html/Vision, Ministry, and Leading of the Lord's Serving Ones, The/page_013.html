<h2 class="head1">UNDERSTANDING THE LORD&rsquo;S DESIRE</h2>
<p>We need to understand the Lord&rsquo;s desire in relation to His command. We can see this in Paul&rsquo;s experience at the end of Acts when he was put in prison. We must ask whether Paul&rsquo;s imprisonment was according to the Lord&rsquo;s command or His desire. There is no record in Acts of the Lord commanding or leading Paul to be imprisoned; rather, there is a record of the Holy Spirit, through the brothers, trying to stop him from going to Jerusalem, which eventually led to his imprisonment (21:4, 10-14). Paul was not imprisoned by the Lord&rsquo;s leading. Rather, Paul&rsquo;s imprisonment was the result of his great love for the Lord.</p>
<p>The record of Acts shows that although the Lord wanted Paul to be in chains, He did not command him to be in chains. It is difficult to understand this seeming contradiction, but it can be likened to a father knowing that his desire for his son can be accomplished only through much suffering. Consequently, he will say, &ldquo;Do not go,&rdquo; even though his desire for his son remains. Paul loved the Lord so earnestly that if the Lord had commanded him not to go, he would have followed the Lord. Paul would have said, &ldquo;If I go, my actions will be rash and against the Lord&rsquo;s will.&rdquo; Paul, however, not only lived according to the Lord&rsquo;s command but also according to the Lord&rsquo;s desire. We must learn to understand the Lord&rsquo;s desire. At times the Lord&rsquo;s desire may be the opposite of His command. The son&rsquo;s accomplishment of a father&rsquo;s desire often must come from more than a response to a command; it must come from an understanding and acceptance of the father&rsquo;s desire. We must be willing to ask ourselves whether we are dutiful sons who act only according to a father&rsquo;s commands or whether we are loving sons who respond to a father&rsquo;s desires.</p>
<p>Many are confused when they read about Paul&rsquo;s final journey to Jerusalem. Through the brothers, Paul was told not to go (21:4, 11-12), yet he still went. In the night following the rioting of the Jews and Paul&rsquo;s arrest, however, &ldquo;the Lord stood by him and said, Take courage, for as you have solemnly testified to the things concerning Me in Jerusalem, so also you must testify in Rome&rdquo; (23:11). After Paul appealed to Caesar, he encountered a storm on his way to Rome. At this point, an angel of the Lord appeared to Paul and said, &ldquo;Do not fear, Paul; you must stand before Caesar&rdquo; (27:24). Whether Paul&rsquo;s final journey to Jerusalem and his subsequent encounters were according to God&rsquo;s will or against God&rsquo;s will is a great question in theology. Seemingly, it was God&rsquo;s command for him not to go, while at the same time, it was God&rsquo;s desire that he would go. Paul&rsquo;s move was apparently contrary to God&rsquo;s command, but actually it was according to God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>Hence, we should not treat the Lord&rsquo;s command as an excuse to avoid difficulties; satisfying the Lord&rsquo;s desire is equally as important. All those who love the Lord should love Him to the point of exceeding His commands. Only such a love truly satisfies the Lord&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>We often wish that the Lord&rsquo;s commands would not be so high in order that things would be easier, but requirements associated with the Lord&rsquo;s command often are much lower than those associated with His desire. We must learn to be able to say, &ldquo;Lord, I would not only keep Your commands but exceed the requirements of Your command.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s last journey exceeded the Lord&rsquo;s command. He lived in the Lord&rsquo;s desire, and this pleased the Lord. The Lord did not command Paul to be imprisoned for His sake, but it was His desire that such a lover of Him would be in chains for Him. Thus, the Lord encouraged him again and again. We must hold on to this fact: the love with which we love the Lord must exceed His command. Those who do not love the Lord in this way will avoid the weighty and choose the light. May we be willing to choose the difficult and avoid the easy and to choose the weighty and avoid the light in serving the Lord.</p>
