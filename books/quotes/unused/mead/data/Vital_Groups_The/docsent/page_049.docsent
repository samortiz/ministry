   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This way of speaking is right and good.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although I appreciate it, I would still say that it is old.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because the United States is an old Christian nation, many people have already heard this kind of presentation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to learn to present Christ in a new way.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not put man in front of a book teaching him many things, including how to live a marriage life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God, after creating a perfect man, brought that man into a garden which included the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God warned this man not to eat the other tree, the tree of knowledge Gen 2:9, 16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man must eat the right tree or he will be poisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man needs to eat only one thing the tree of life.</S>
