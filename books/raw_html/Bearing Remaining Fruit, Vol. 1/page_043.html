<h2 class="head1">HAVING A LONG-TERM VIEW IN TAKING THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>We know that the Lord Jesus is faithful to us. He spoke in the Gospel of Luke that He sends us out in the midst of the wolves, but among the wolves there are sons of peace who are pre-chosen by God (10:3-6). However, we need to be well prepared that some sons of peace may not remain to be sons of peace for their whole life. The name <em>Barnabas</em> in the New Testament means &ldquo;son of encouragement.&rdquo; In the beginning, Barnabas was truly an encouragement to Paul. It was he who brought Paul into the New Testament ministry, and it was also he who brought Paul with him to go out to work. Eventually, though, he did not last long as an encouragement. Acts 15 shows us that Barnabas, this son of encouragement, because of his natural relationship in personnel matters, no longer worked together with Paul. This put Paul in a very difficult situation. Finally he separated from Paul (vv. 36-39), but the Lord sent Timothy to Paul, which caused him to be joyful.</p>
<p>We need to remember that no one can frustrate the Lord&rsquo;s way, but we also should not expect that this way will proceed smoothly without difficulty. Some have testified that after praying, confessing their sins, being filled, and going out, they baptized three to five families, and everything went smoothly. Others, however, fellowshipped that despite their effort no doors were open to them, or even when doors were opened to them, no one received the gospel. This truly caused them to despair. However, do not lose heart. We must believe that as long as we go out, there will be some profit. Do not worry about how many of the newly baptized ones will remain. It is a universally true principle that those who are optimistic are happy for everything, while those who are pessimistic worry about everything. We all should have an optimistic attitude and firmly believe that this way is the best way. No other way can gain so many people. Recently twenty thousand people have been baptized; even though eventually fifteen thousand are unstable, we still have gained five thousand people. Even among these five thousand there may be over three thousand who are weak, but there are still over one thousand who are stable. The joy in the universe is because of these one thousand.</p>
<p>Not all of our children are intelligent. If every child were intelligent, the world would be in disarray. If every American was capable of being the president, the world would be turned upside down. Americans would constantly contend one against another, and there would be no peace. We thank and praise the Lord that while some are intelligent, some are foolish. While we are taking this way, we should not look only at the dark side; we should also look at the bright side. In the Bible there is first evening and then morning (Gen. 1:5). This makes up one day. Everything has a bad side, but we should never be discouraged. Although we dare not say that this way is a broad highway without any difficulty, we know that this way is absolutely right and can be successful.</p>
<p>We may go out to knock on doors for the whole night, and no one may be baptized. We may go out again for a second night, and still no one may be baptized, and on the third night only two are baptized. It seems that we labored for the whole week for only two to be baptized. It was as if the Lord did not listen to our prayers. In actuality, though, this is more profitable than not going out at all. Moreover, the profit will be great because it will &ldquo;snowball.&rdquo; Then in the future these compounded benefits will be added to our account. Therefore, do not be narrow-sighted or shortsighted. Rather, your vision should be broader and farther. This way is right. If we firmly believe this way and are faithful in taking it, after not too long the whole earth will be filled with our brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>If we consider the new way with this view, we will not be afraid if no one is baptized through our door-knocking, because today is not the only day in the universe. There are three hundred sixty-five days in a year, and we can always labor. Satan can never overcome us. He can cause us not to be able to gain people today and tomorrow, sending away all the sons of peace and giving us only wolves. In the end, however, we still will meet the sons of peace. Eventually, the Lord will add to us the lambs.</p>
<p>We are truly full of joy and hope within. There is no problem for us to go on. The Lord said, &ldquo;Go in peace!&rdquo; The work we are doing is a work of peace, the people we are seeking are the sons of peace, and the way we are taking is a way of peace. As long as we take this way, our success is assured.</p>
