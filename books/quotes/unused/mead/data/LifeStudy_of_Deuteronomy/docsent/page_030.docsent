   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THIRTY-EIGHT YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The rehearsal of the law is the respeaking of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This rehearsal, this respeaking, was for the training of the new generation after the purging of the old generation through their wandering of thirty-eight years in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That wandering had been used by God to produce a new generation, and this generation needed the training of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They needed to be trained with and by the law.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE REHEARSING OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verses 2 and 3 say, "Jehovah our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not with our fathers did Jehovah make this covenant, but with us, we who are all here today alive."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that the Ten Commandments were the covenant God made with Israel at Horeb, especially with the present new generation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is according to the biblical principle that the children are always included in the father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the reason that the covenant made at Horeb included even those Israelites who had not yet been born at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the sight of God, the covenant made at Horeb was actually made with the present new generation of Israel.</S>
