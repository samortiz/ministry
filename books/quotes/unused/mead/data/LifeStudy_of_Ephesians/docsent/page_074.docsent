   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall give a further word concerning how to put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>CREATED AND RENEWED</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The way the New Testament speaks of the new man may sound strange to our natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to 4:24, the new man is created in righteousness and holiness of the truth, but according to Colossians 3:10, the new man is being renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can the new man be both created, which has nothing to do with anything old, and renewed, which is related to something old?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The creation of the new man is one thing, but the experience of the new man is another.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From Christ s side, the new man has already been created.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But from our side, our experience, the new man is being renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the new creation, the new man has been completed by the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But according to our experience, the new man is in the process of being renewed daily.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My burden in this message is to point out how the new man is being renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This renewing is actually the putting on of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we pointed out in the previous message, the new man has been created, but now our need is to put him on in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>AN INWARD, SUBJECTIVE RENEWING</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Greek word rendered put on is used with respect to clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose a brother has a suit of clothes tailor-made for him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may say that the suit has been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now the brother must put on this suit in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He cannot put it on all at once; rather, it is a gradual, step-by-step procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The putting on of a suit of clothes, however, is not a fully accurate picture of the putting on of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The putting on of a suit is objective, whereas the putting on of the new man involves an inward renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not put on the new man in an outward, objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the contrary, the putting on of the new man begins from within; it is related to an inward, subjective renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the time of our regeneration, the new man was put into, or born into, our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now this new man must spread into every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This spreading of the new man is the putting on of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is also the renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By this we see that the putting on of the new man is not an outward, objective matter, but an inward, subjective experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have pointed out that on the cross Christ has slain the ordinances in order to produce the one new man in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, in the resurrection of Christ, the new man was created and brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, the life-giving Spirit came into our spirit, bringing with Him the new man as a finished product.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this way the new man was born into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, since the time of our regeneration, the new man has been in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now the new man must saturate every part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This spreading is both the putting on of the new man and the renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As Colossians 3:10 says, we need to put on the new man, which is being renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How much of the new man we put on depends on how much we are renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>PUTTING OFF THE FORMER MANNER OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both Ephesians 4 and Colossians 3 indicate that in order to put on the new man, we first need to put off the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ephesians 4:22 says, Put off concerning the former manner of life the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The words manner of life imply a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before you were saved, you had a certain manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Perhaps you worked five days a week and then in the evenings or on the weekends amused yourself with certain worldly entertainments.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To some, the manner of life may be gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To others, it may be going to certain places or eating certain foods.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These are all part of the manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In every country of the world and among every people there is a characteristic manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we truly desire to be renewed, we need to put off the former manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By putting off our manner of life, we put off the old man in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To bury the former manner of life is virtually the same as burying the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, my burden in this message is not simply to encourage you to put off the old man; it is specifically to encourage you to put off your former manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many of the saints in the Lord s recovery still hold on to their old manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not say that I am legal, conservative, or old-fashioned in telling you to put off your former manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To have this attitude toward what I am saying here is a sign of being caught in the evil current of today s satanic system.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should not be swept along by the current of this age; instead, we should bury our former manner of life and even hold a funeral for it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To speak merely of putting off the old man is too doctrinal.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The actual putting off of the old man is the putting off of the former manner of life, which always involves ordinances and our way of living.</S>
