Experiencing the Cross</H2><P>The elders must also bring the brothers and sisters into the experience of the cross. They need to help the brothers and sisters to see that their old man has already been crucified and terminated. Their carnality, their flesh, temper, disposition, ambition, and aspirations have been terminated on the cross. They can be fleshly elsewhere, but not in the church, because in the church everyone has been crucified. They can be ambitious and have high aspirations elsewhere. But in the church, they can neither have an ambitious heart nor a high aspiration. They are just a pile of ashes, a terminated man on the cross. They can fight for name and fortune in any social organization or covet position. But in the church they are all buried in the grave already. They are all dead and buried ones. Here there is no name or fortune to fight for and no position to covet. You have to help the brothers and sisters to take the cross. Of course, this is a deeper lesson.</P><P>These are the directions in coordination. While you are helping one brother, you may feel that he is good in the gospel, and he is most suitable to take the platform. You have to help him in this area, developing him, encouraging him, perfecting him, and giving him the opportunity to practice. You may not be very good at giving a gospel message. You can introduce him to those who are experienced in this and encourage more contact with them. In this way you will produce one who is good in gospel preaching.</P><P>Many times those who are managing are not necessarily those who can do the things themselves. However, they can get help from those who can do the things. This is church management. In teaching her children, a mother may not necessarily know English or chemistry very well. But she knows when her children need to learn English and chemistry, and she can ask for help. This is the way to manage the church.</P><P>When we spoke about coordination, we emphasized the need for the brothers and sisters to be brought into the coordination. But when we speak about the direction in coordination, we are emphasizing the need for the brothers and sisters to have a definite direction in their coordination. Some will be directed into the aspect of the gospel and others into the aspect of the perfecting. For example, a brother has learned the lesson of the cross. You, as one who manages the church, in bringing him into the coordination, should channel him into the direction of perfecting. He should be brought into a perfecting function; he should learn to pick up the burden and the responsibility to help the other brothers and sisters learn the breaking of the cross. You are an elder, and the authority of the church is in your hand. When you give him the opportunity and the position, he will be perfected. Eventually, this brother will be able to stand up regularly in the church to testify concerning the cross and to release messages on the cross. In three to five months, many brothers and sisters will have learned to take the cross. This is what I mean by the direction in coordination.</P><P>Take another example. Some sisters have learned some very good lessons in fellowshipping with the Lord. The elders should try their best to open up more meetings for these sisters to exercise their function in coordination, so that they can go on in the direction of perfecting others. In the end, even some brothers may get the help from these sisters. Here is a member that has some specialty. The elders should have good management here and should use this specialty well. I believe the brothers and sisters can understand what I mean now.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_121.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_123.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Elders' Management of the Church &nbsp; pg 122</div><br></body></html>
