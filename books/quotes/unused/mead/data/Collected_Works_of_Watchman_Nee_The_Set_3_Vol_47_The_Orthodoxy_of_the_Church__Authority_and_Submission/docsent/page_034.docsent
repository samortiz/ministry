   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Today if you have left the denominations and have seen the church, then only the Word of God can be the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Consider a brother who is born again.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Can you say that he is not a brother?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is a brother if he knows the truth clearly, and he is still a brother if he does not know the truth clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If he stays at home he is my brother, and if he falls into the ditch by the street he is still my brother.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If there is a problem, I can only blame my Father for begetting him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The special characteristic of Philadelphia is brotherly love today this way is the only way for us to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But we should never have this kind of attitude: I love the brothers who are clear and the brothers who are lovable, but those who are not lovable I will not love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether he is clear or not, that is his business.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should never say, "You are a rebellious one.''</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What we see this year, we did not see last year.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Perhaps next year he will also see what we have seen this year.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>While he reads the Bible, the Lord will also show him the light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's heart is great; so ours must also be great.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must learn to have a heart that is large enough to include all of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever we say "we'' and yet do not include all the children of God, we are the biggest sect, for we are not standing in the position of brotherly love but exalting ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The way of Philadelphia is the way we must take.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The difficulty lies in the fact that Philadelphia includes all the brothers, yet some are not able to include as much.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let me give you an illustration: Before the war with Japan I went to K'un-ming.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There was a brother there of the _______ Church who asked me to talk with him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was a very good brother.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he saw me he said, "Do you remember that I asked you a question in Shanghai?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You still have not answered how we can cooperate.''</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I said, "Brother, you have a _______ Church in which I have no part.''</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He said, "Right, but you need not worry about that; what I mean is that we can cooperate nicely before the Lord.''</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I said, "I have a church, and I am in it, Paul is in it, Peter is also in it, and so are John, Martin Luther, John Wesley, and Hudson Taylor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You too are in it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church that I have is so great that all who are in Christ, whether great or small, are in it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You and I have a difference: I only build up one church; you wish to build up two churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My work is only the church of Christ, not the _______ Church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If your aim is to build up the church of Christ and not the _______ Church, then I can absolutely cooperate with you.''</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brothers and sisters, do you see the difference here?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That brother's love was not great enough.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He stresses the church of Christ within the _______ Church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is building up two churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After I spoke he confessed that that was the first time he saw what it was all about.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He held my hand and said that he hoped this question would not be raised again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brotherly love means that we must love all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If one has some weakness, that is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I say that all the children of God must be baptized by immersion, but I cannot say that because one does not do it this way, he is not a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is regenerated if he is immersed in water, and he is also regenerated if he is not immersed in water.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may regard his regeneration as the mistake of all mistakes, but my Father has begotten him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord forgive me for speaking in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Indeed, when there is opportunity, we must read the Bible with him to let him know that the eunuch and Philip went down into the water and also that the Lord Jesus came out from the water Acts 8:36-38; Matt 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Baptism in the Bible is man going down and man coming up, not just two fingers going down and coming up.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But we cannot say that he is not a brother because he has not yet done this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The basis of being a brother is life, not baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although we believe that baptism is right, we are not the Baptist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The basis of fellowship is the blood and the life of the Holy Spirit, not knowledge, not even the knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The only question is whether or not one has the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If he has been regenerated, he is a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Loving one another is but to stand in this position.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever we bring in other things and add requirements, we are a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Consider the matter of the breaking of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul, a new believer, arrives in a certain place; someone has brought him there, and he really has a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They know he is a brother, so he can break bread.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is absolutely no need for a second requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Does he believe that the great tribulation will last seven years?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Is the rapture partial or whole?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we inquire of people in this way, we are basically wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we only love the brothers who are the same as we are, we are sectarian, and this is contrary to the testimony of brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thank God we are all brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Everyone redeemed by the precious blood is a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If something of ourselves comes out, it must be pride.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some say, "Only we are right; you brothers are all wrong.''</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But the bread must include all the right as well as all the wrong brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When you desire to follow the Lord in such a way, when you desire to love all the brothers, it does not mean that all the brothers will love you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You should realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sardis came out from Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Although Sardis was following the will of the Lord, it is unavoidable that she would be hated by Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Likewise, just as Philadelphia came out from Sardis, the denominations will also be against you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Because they must maintain their organization, they will say that if you act in this way, you do not love your brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>From their point of view, loving the brothers is equal to loving Sardis, as if loving the brothers and loving the denominations are not two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Those who have a motive to maintain the denominations will criticize your love as lacking because you are not building up their denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But you must be clear: Loving the brothers themselves and loving the denominations which these brothers love are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Moreover, we must realize that loving the whole church is simply based upon whether or not one is a brother; if one is a brother, we love him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is loving the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we only love a part of all the brothers, then we are only loving the brothers who are within our circle.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This kind of love for the brothers is not really love for the brothers, but love for division.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we do not abandon this love of sect, we cannot love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The love of sect is not only not right; it is positively wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Loving a sect is the greatest hindrance to loving the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Unless a man rids himself of the love of sect, he cannot love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Yet a man who loves the brothers because he has no love of sect will be criticized by others as having no love.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is commonplace; do not think this is strange.</S>
