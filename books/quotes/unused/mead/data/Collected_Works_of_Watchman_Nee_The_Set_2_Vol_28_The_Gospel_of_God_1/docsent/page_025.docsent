   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE COMING OF CHRIST BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD'S REQUIREMENT IN RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to the earth was God's requirement in righteousness; it was not God's requirement in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a very serious word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If there had been love without righteousness, the Lord Jesus would not have needed to come to the earth, and the cross would have been unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because of the problem of righteousness the Lord Jesus had to come.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without righteousness, God could save us any way He wants to.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He could overlook our sins, or He could forgive them lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He could take a permissive attitude toward our sins, or He could be completely unconcerned about them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If God said, "Since all have sinned, I will let you go this time; just do not sin again," there would be no need for a Jesus of Nazareth in the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Apart from the requirement of righteousness, there was no need for Jesus of Nazareth to come.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The coming of Jesus of Nazareth was a requirement of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When sin entered the world, God's government was damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His prescribed order in the universe was broken; His glory was trodden under; His holiness was profaned; His authority was rejected; and His truth was misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When sin entered the world, Satan laughed and the angels testified that man had failed and had fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If God were to judge sin mercilessly, He would be without love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if He were to let man's sins go without judging them, He would be without righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because God loves the world and, at the same time, He is righteous, He had to send the Lord Jesus to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because He is righteous, He had to judge sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because He is love, He had to bear man's sins for him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I must emphasize these two statements: God must judge because He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And God bears man's judgment and punishment because He is love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without judgment, we see no righteousness; with judgment, we see no love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, what He did was to bear the judgment on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this way, He manifests both His love and His righteousness in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE CROSS MANIFESTING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS AND LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the cross is where God's righteousness is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The cross shows us how much God hates sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is determined to judge sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was willing to pay such a great price as to have His Son nailed on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God was not willing to give up His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If God were willing to give up His righteousness, the cross would have been unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because God was not willing to give up His righteousness, He preferred to have His Son die rather than give up His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The cross is also the place where God's love is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The burden for our sins should be on us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not bear it, it is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But to bear such a burden is too much for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For this reason, He came and bore it for us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That God was willing to bear the burden shows His love.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That God actually did bear the burden shows His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For God to have us bear the punishment is righteousness without love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For God to have us not bear the punishment is love without righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because He takes away the punishment and bears it for us, there is both righteousness and love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The cross meets the requirement of righteousness and the requirement of love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our salvation today is not "backdoor merchandise"; we have not received it fraudulently or improperly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have not been saved illegally.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have been saved in a clear and definite way through judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For us forgiveness is free, but for God there is no such thing as free forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For Him, forgiveness comes only after the redemption from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For example, if you break the law and the court requires you to pay a thousand dollar fine, you must pay the fine before your case will be dismissed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the same way, we are saved only after being judged on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our salvation comes after we suffer the judgment for sin in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is a salvation that comes only through judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are judged; then afterwards we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God's love is here, and God's righteousness is also here.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Let me give an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Suppose that there is a brother who is a millionaire, and suppose that I am one of his debtors.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Let us say that I owe him a big sum of money, an amount as large as the ten thousand talents mentioned in the book of Matthew 18:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When I borrowed the money from him, I signed a promissory note.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the note the amount that I owe him and the date and month that the amount must be repaid in full was listed, together with the terms and conditions of penalty.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Suppose that now I go to him and say, "I spent all the money that I borrowed from you, and it is impossible for me to earn this money back and repay you at such a time as this, when the economy is slumping.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I even have a problem taking care of my food and living.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Please have mercy on me and let me go.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Let me have the promissory note back."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If I implore him this way, can he return the note to me?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The promissory note clearly records the amount that I borrowed from him and the period of time in which I must repay him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is a contract not only for me to keep, but one that he has to abide by as well.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As the debtor, I have the responsibility to repay him the money within the set time.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As the creditor, he also has a responsibility to fulfill, which is to return the promissory note to me only upon receipt of the money.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If he returns the note to me before receiving the money, even though he does this out of his love and concern for me, he is not being righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Because we human beings are simply unrighteous and are used to unrighteous acts, it seldom occurs to us that free forgiveness is a form of unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But God cannot do something unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If God forgave us freely, He would be unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Furthermore, going back to the illustration, let us suppose that this brother returns the note to me without receiving the money.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This will affect me in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The next time I have money I will be indiscreet in using it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I have found that I can use others' money easily and loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Hence, this brother's free forgiveness is unrighteousness with him and a bad influence on me.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Now suppose that this brother is righteous, but does not want me to repay.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What can he do?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Let me tell you what I once did in a similar situation.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Someone once came to my home to borrow money.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He was a nominal Christian, so I told him that according to the Bible Christians should not borrow money.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But he begged me to loan him the money all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Originally I considered simply giving him the money.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But I knew that he was irresponsible with other's money because some brothers had come to me beforehand and told me that this person borrowed often from the brothers, and warned me not to loan him anything.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>So on second thought I decided that I would not simply give the money to him, but would loan it instead.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When I handed him the amount he asked for, I asked him when he would return it to me.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I pressed him for a payment date, even though I knew that I would never be paid back.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Borrowing was his habit; it was his life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But I could not tell him that I did not expect to be paid back, for that would have invited more borrowing.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Therefore, I made him set a payment date.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When the date arrived, I purposely wrote a letter to him, reminding him that the due date had come.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>After he received my letter, he came to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>But before he was able to say very much, I interrupted him and told him to go home and see his wife, for she had something to tell him.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>So off to his home he went.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Actually, prior to his coming to see me, I had taken the exact amount of money he owed to his home and had given it to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I told her that when her husband came home she should tell him that I had sent him this sum of money for the payment of his debt.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>When the husband reached home, the wife told him what I had said.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Then he opened the package and found the exact amount of his debt.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He understood what to do next.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>He came back to my home and returned the money to me.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In this act, you can see love and you can see righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If this man had been forced to pay, there would have been no love.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>But if I had allowed him not to pay, I would have been unrighteous, for I had said specifically that the money was given as a loan.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Not only would I have been unrighteous in myself, but I also would have exerted a bad influence on him.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The next time he would have been more irresponsible.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Thus, I did what I did.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We owe God "ten thousand talents of silver," but we have no way to repay.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Now God is doing the same thing for us.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Because He loves us, He cannot ask us to pay Him back.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>But because He is righteous, He will not tell us that we have no need to repay at all.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>For us to pay Him back is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Yet for God to release us from our obligation is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Thank and praise Him that He has come to give us the "money," that we can pay back what we owe Him.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The collector is God, and the payer is also God.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Without collecting, there is no righteousness; but if we are made to pay, there is no love.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Now God Himself is the collector; hence, righteousness is maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>And God Himself is also the payer; hence, love is maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>The collector is the payer.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>This is the biblical meaning of redemption from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Therefore, Jesus the Nazarene came and bore our sins in His body onto the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>God Himself came to bear our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Our sins were judged by God in the person of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>The blood of the Lord Jesus shed on the cross is proof of this judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>We come to God by this blood.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Through the Lord Jesus we tell God that we have been judged.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Now we are turning over to Him what the Lord Jesus has paid for us.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>It is true that we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>But we are not irresponsible; there has been the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>It is true that we had a debt.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>But we are not avoiding it; the debt has already been paid.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>We have the blood, which signifies the accomplished salvation of the Lord Jesus, as the receipt proving that God has paid our debt back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>This is why the blood in the Old Testament was sprinkled seven times within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>This is why it had to be brought to the propitiation cover on the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>God has to forgive every sinner who comes to Him through the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>There is no way for Him not to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Let us return to the previous illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Suppose I borrowed ten thousand talents of silver from a brother and I have no money to pay him back.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>One day he comes to my home and says, "You owe me ten thousand talents of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Now you must pay me back.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>I am not an irresponsible or loose person.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Whatever I do, I do seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>You have to pay me back.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>Now here are ten thousand talents of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Bring this to my house tomorrow and pay back your debt.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Then you can take back your promissory note."</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>I would expect that when I go to his house with the money the next day I will be able to redeem the promissory note.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>But suppose that after I hand him the money, he says that because the money was given to me by him the day before, he will not return the promissory note to me.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>Can he do such a thing?</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>When I hand him the money, does he have the right not to hand me back the promissory note?</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>No. He had the right not to give me the money the day before.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>If he did not give me the money the day before, at most I can say that he does not love me.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>I cannot say a word more.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>But if he has given me the money and I pay him back, he is unrighteous if he still keeps my note; it is not simply a matter of him not loving me.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>If he is righteous, he has to hand me the note when I hand him the money.</S>
