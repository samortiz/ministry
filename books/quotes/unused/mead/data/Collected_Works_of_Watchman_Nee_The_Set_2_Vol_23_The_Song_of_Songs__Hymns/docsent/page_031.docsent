   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. Seeking Help</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>from the Daughters of Jerusalem 5:8</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 8 says, "I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the maiden cannot find help from spiritual men, she seeks help among those who are less advanced than she is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When she feels that she has offended the Lord and has lost His countenance, in her desperation she tries to find help even from the daughters of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Her words amount to an admission of her failure and that, if possible, they should pray for her.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Her sense of failure is so deep that she feels that even babes in the Lord can render her some help.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She is not ignorant of their immaturity, and she realizes that their fellowship with the Lord is not perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is why she says, "If ye find my beloved."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She knows that they may not find Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet in her deep remorse and helplessness, she hopes to find one or two persons who can render some help.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Her own prayers seem to go unanswered, and she now turns to others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>She wants to convey the message, "I am sick of love."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She used this expression once before, but her condition was different than it is now.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She had been in the midst of an intimate tide of fellowship, but now she is in a time of dryness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not surprising for a person to speak such a word at a time when feelings run high.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But when darkness is all around and there are contrary feelings, it is not easy to speak such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This proves that she has made a considerable advance in the life of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She has learned to take control of her environment, and she can control her own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This love sickness does not arise from an overindulgence in love, but from a hunger for love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>G. The Question</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>of the Daughters of Jerusalem 5:9</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 9 says, "What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although the daughters of Jerusalem do not have deep experiences in the Lord, and although they are not filled with the life of the new creation, they can see that the maiden is the fairest among women.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The humility, holiness, and glory of the new creation are admired and acknowledged by all, even by those who do not possess them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although the maiden no longer sees the countenance of her beloved, she is nevertheless the fairest among women.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She has not lost her beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is never appropriate to consider Christ in the way of comparison, for He is beyond comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet in the eyes of ordinary people, comparisons are unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Their eyes have not yet seen His absoluteness; therefore, they can only know Him by comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, this Beloved is far more than any other beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This word also shows that though these women are the inhabitants of Jerusalem, they have not received a personal revelation of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They can only receive the reflected light that shines out from her.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>H. The Maiden's Impression of the Beloved 5:10-16</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mr. Darby said, "It is, I judge, a fine moral perfectness of thought that the bride never speaks of the Bridegroom's perfections to Himself as if she were to approve Him; she speaks of Him fully as expressive of her own feelings and to others, but not to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He speaks freely and fully of her to herself as assuring her of His delight in her.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we think of Christ and our relation with Him, this is beautifully appropriate" Synopsis of the Books of the Bible, J. N. Darby, Vol. 2, p.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>265 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God uses the questions of other people to bring out the maiden's impression of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This causes the revelation which she once received to shine within her again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This spontaneously recovers her to her initial position.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The revelation we have of Christ through the Holy Spirit may become blurred, but the wonderful thing is that it will never be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The maiden is still the teacher of the daughters of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even in her failure, she is still stronger than the daughters of Jerusalem in their time of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 10 says, "My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the very beginning, she speaks of her beloved in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The word "white" in the original language denotes a kind of bright and shining whiteness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This speaks of His purity and His separation from sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet His whiteness is not a dead whiteness or a pale whiteness, but one that is white and ruddy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that He is full of life and power in the same way that David was a man ruddy in countenance, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>1 Sam 16:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Throughout His life, He was a man full of power and life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From the time He was twelve years old until today, while He sits at the right hand of God, He has never been short of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The word "chiefest" in the original language means "lifted up as a banner" or "banner-carrier."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This means that Christ is the uplifted banner among tens of thousands of people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is the One on whom all eyes are set.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ is our banner, and we look to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is also like a banner-carrier.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means that He is the crucified Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"When the adversary comes like a flood,/The Spirit of Jehovah will lift up a standard against him" Isa 59:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The standard refers to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hence, the Lord Jesus' being the banner-carrier refers to His being the slain Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Wherever He goes, tens of thousands follow Him, and He is beyond comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After the maiden covers the general descriptions, she goes on to meticulously describe the revelations and impressions she has received of the Lord.</S>
