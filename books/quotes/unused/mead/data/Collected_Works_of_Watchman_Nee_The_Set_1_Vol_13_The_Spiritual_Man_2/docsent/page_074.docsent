   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR A LIFE OF FEELING THE BELIEVER'S EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When believers have a love relationship with the Lord and are fully satisfied with Him, they usually enter into the experience of a life of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Such an experience is very precious to them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It normally comes after the experience of being freed from sin and before entering into the experience of an absolute spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because many believers lack spiritual knowledge, they often regard this experience, which comes after their freedom from sin and gives them much happiness, as the most spiritual and heavenly experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the happiness which proceeds from a life of feeling is so satisfying, they find it difficult to part with this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A believer with a life of feeling senses that the Lord is so near, as though he can touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He feels that the Lord's love is so sweet; he also feels that he loves the Lord very much.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A fire seems to burn in his heart, and he enjoys a kind of unspeakable happiness that makes him feel as though he were already in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Something seems to stir in his heart, and it yields an unspeakably comfortable feeling as though he had seized the most valuable treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This kind of feeling remains with him wherever he goes and in whatever he does.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When a believer goes through such an experience, he has no idea of where he is; it seems as though he has soared out of this world to be with the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At such times, reading the Bible is very enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more he reads, the more the feeling of happiness increases.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Praying also becomes very easy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He finds it gratifying to express his feelings to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It seems that the more he prays, the brighter the heavenly light shines.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is also able to make many resolutions to the Lord as an indication of his love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He loves to be quiet, alone, and face to face with God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If he could, he would forever shut the door behind him to fellowship with the Lord because he experiences a happiness which no tongue or pen can describe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Previously, he enjoyed living among the crowd, finding something there that could fill his need.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now, however, he prefers to be alone since the happiness which he obtains before the Lord cannot be compared to that which is derived from the crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a believer feels this way, he desires to be all the more quiet, for fear of losing his happiness among the crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During this time, working for the Lord becomes very easy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Formerly he did not have much to say to others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now it seems very enjoyable to tell others about the Lord because of the fire of love burning in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The more he speaks, the better he feels.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is also very willing to suffer for the Lord because he feels the Lord is so close.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He even rejoices at the thought of dying for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All burdens become light and all difficulties become easy in this kind of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When a believer feels this way, his behavior also changes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Perhaps he was talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now he can be quiet with the help of his feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When he sees others chattering, he secretly condemns it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps he was frivolous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now he can be very solemn.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When other believers lack godliness in certain aspects, he senses it most acutely and condemns it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When a believer goes through such an experience, he definitely becomes more sober in his conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, he seems to have developed a keener sense of judgment which enables him to see the shortcomings of others even more.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such a believer tends to secretly feel sorry for others because he thinks they do not have his kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He considers his own happiness as an excellent thing and pities his brothers and sisters for not being able to comprehend it!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When he sees them calmly serving the Lord, he invariably concludes that their lives are boring.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only a life like his, full of God's happiness, can truly be the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It seems that the other believers are merely walking in the valley, while he alone soars on the mountain top.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, does this kind of experience last?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Can a believer feel this way every day and be happy all his life?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many believers do not have this experience for long.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What grieves the believer the most is that in less than a month or two generally speaking , the happiness which he most desires suddenly vanishes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One morning when he wakes up as usual to read the Bible, the former taste is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He may pray, but after uttering a few phrases he runs out of words.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He feels that something is missing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the past it seemed that other believers were lagging behind him spiritually; now he feels just like one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His heart seems to have cooled off considerably.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The feeling of a warm fire burning within has disappeared, and he has no idea where it has gone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He does not feel the Lord's presence or His nearness; the Lord seems very far from him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He does not even seem to know where the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When he suffers, he feels the suffering, not the happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When he preaches, it is no longer enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He utters a few sentences and finds himself with no desire to carry on.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In short, everything seems dark, dry, cold, and dead.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It appears as though the believer has been left by the Lord in the tomb with nothing to comfort his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The lasting joy which he hoped to retain is now lost.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>During such a period, the believer will think that he has sinned, and that God has forsaken him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If he has not sinned, why is the Lord no longer with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He may search his recent conduct to determine where he offended the Lord, hoping that upon confessing, the Lord will come back, fill him anew, and restore the intimacy and happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, when he examines himself, he cannot find any particular sin; everything is generally the same as it was before.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It seems that if his present condition caused the Lord to forsake him, why did his past condition not cause the Lord to forsake him?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If he has not sinned, why did the Lord depart from him?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He does not have the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He simply assumes that he has offended the Lord in some way and that the Lord has forsaken him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Satan also accuses him, making him believe that he has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hence, he cries for forgiveness before the Lord, hoping to recover what he has lost.</S>
