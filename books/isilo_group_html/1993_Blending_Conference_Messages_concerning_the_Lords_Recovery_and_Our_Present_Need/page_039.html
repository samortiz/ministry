Psalm 133 shows us that God's people dwelling in unity is the base of God's anointing and of God's refreshing grace that they may participate in the God-commanded blessing of life forevermore.</li>	</ol><li>Versus division:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Divisions (sects) are of the flesh.</li>	<li>Divisions are not only of the flesh but also according to the manner of man&#151;1 Cor. 3:3.</li>	<li>Divisions damage Christ as the unique One and His Body&#151;1 Cor. 1:10-13.</li>	<li>The Corinthian believers were divided while they were still meeting together to take the Lord's supper not for the better but for the worse; thus, the apostle would not consider that they came together to eat the Lord's supper&#151;1 Cor. 11:17-20.</li>	<li>No reason and no excuse to be given to any kind of division and no justification for it.</li>	<li>The apostle charged us to turn away from those who make divisions and to refuse a sectarian man&#151;Rom. 16:17; Titus 3:10.</li>	</ol></ol><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>1993 Blending Conference Messages concerning the Lord's Recovery and Our Present Need &nbsp; pg 39</div><br></body></html>
