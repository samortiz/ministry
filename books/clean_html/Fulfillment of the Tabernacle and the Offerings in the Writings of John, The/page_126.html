<h2 class=head2>To Receive Blessing</h2><p>In 13:17 the Lord Jesus said, “If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.” This indicates that to practice foot-washing is to receive blessing. However, if instead of practicing foot-washing, we conceal within us our feelings concerning the defects of the brothers and sisters, there will be much accumulation of dirt to hinder our fellowship. If we know the significance of foot-washing and practice it, we shall be blessed. Foot-washing is a way to receive blessing.<h2 class=head2>To Sift the False One</h2><p>Foot-washing also sifts the false one (13:18-30). Among Christians today there are many tares, many false ones, because spiritual foot-washing is not practiced. But whenever we practice this foot-washing, the false ones are exposed.<p>Chapter thirteen of the Gospel of John puts together three matters: foot-washing, Judas’ betrayal of the Lord, and Peter’s self-confidence. The fact that these matters are put together indicates that foot-washing sifts the false one and also exposes the real, yet self-confident, one. Among those who claim to follow Christ, there are two problems related to fellowship. These problems are falsehood, signified by Judas, and self-confidence, signified by Peter. Today’s society is full of falsehood and self-confidence. Peter was genuine, but with his genuineness there was self-confidence.<p>The best way to keep the false ones away from the church life is to practice foot-washing. The more we practice foot-washing, the more the false ones will be sifted. Because foot-washing exposes, the false ones cannot stand it. It is possible to be a false one at a love feast, but it is not possible to be a false one when foot-washing is practiced. Only the genuine ones can receive foot-washing. The false ones cannot tolerate it.<p>If a local church practices foot-washing, no false one will be able to remain. Foot-washing closes the door to every false one. The reason today’s religion is full of false ones is that there is no practice of foot-washing. Instead of foot-washing, there is politics, and politics produces false ones.<p>False ones are also produced by politeness. Some may be troubled to hear that politeness produces false ones. If you turn to your spirit, stay in the spirit, and live and walk according to the spirit, I doubt that you will be merely polite. I believe that you will see that the Spirit leads you only to be genuine, humble, frank, and upright. Politeness, on the contrary, may be only beautified hypocrisy. If you try to be polite, what you are actually doing is beautifying your hypocrisy. This can be compared to a mortician applying cosmetics to a dead body. In human society today, there is a certain kind of beauty, but this beauty is that of cosmetics applied to a dead body. Politeness may be nothing more than dead beauty.<p>We have seen that foot-washing exposes the false ones and does not allow them to remain. It was at the time of foot-washing that the Lord Jesus released the word that Judas would betray Him. Instead of concealing the matter, the Lord released what was on His heart. Concerning Judas’ betrayal, the Lord Jesus was troubled in spirit: “When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in the spirit and testified and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you will betray Me” (v. 21). The Lord Jesus revealed what was troubling Him. Here we see the principle, set up by the Lord’s example, that foot-washing sifts the false one.<h2 class=head2>To Expose the Self-confident One</h2><p>We have indicated that foot-washing also exposes the self-confident one. Foot-washing will expose whether we are proud or humble, whether we are self-confident or trust in the Lord. Peter was exposed by foot-washing. Although he was genuine, he was also very self-confident. Therefore, at the time of foot-washing the Lord said to him, “Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, a cock shall by no means crow until you deny Me three times” (v. 38). The Lord loved Peter to the uttermost, but Peter denied the Lord to the uttermost. Before Peter denied Him, he was self-confident, and this self-confidence was exposed by foot-washing.<p>I am glad that in the church life we do not practice literal foot-washing as a legality. But we do have spiritual foot-washing in order to eliminate all defects so that we may have clear fellowship with one another and with God. Through the practice of foot-washing, everything becomes genuine, frank, pure, clean, and clear. No dirt is concealed, and no falsehood or self-confidence remains.<p>If we practice foot-washing in the church life, no false one will remain. Moreover, the strong, self-confident ones will be subdued. If someone had asked Peter about his denying the Lord, he may have said, “I was full of self-confidence. But the Lord had a way to bring me down. The Lord washed my feet, and I was exposed. But I still need your foot-washing, and I am willing to receive it.” This is needed in the church life.<p>Apparently the record of foot-washing in John 13 is not important. Actually, it is crucial in a very practical way. If there is no foot-washing, we cannot have the church life. From over fifty years’ experience in the church life, I realize that all the churches on earth need the practice of foot-washing. In order to maintain clear fellowship with one another and with the Lord, we need the reality of foot-washing.
