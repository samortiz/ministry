   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Divinity Unveiled in Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is wrong to say that humanity was unveiled in divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, divinity was unveiled in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If your Christian life is an unveiling of your humanity, that is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If this is the case, you get the glory and the exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You are the one manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Christian life is a life of divinity unveiled in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Divine Attributes Shown</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>in the Human Virtues</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Christ's human living, the divine attributes were shown in the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He loved people, that was a display of His human virtue, yet within that human virtue was the divine attribute as the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can illustrate this by considering a glove and the hand within it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The glove may be likened to the human virtues, and the hand to the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The real contents of the glove is the hand, just as the real contents of the human virtues of Christ are the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has many attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One attribute is love, another attribute is light, and another attribute is kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All these are His attributes, and they were lived out of the man Jesus as His virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All of God's attributes became the virtues of the man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Gospels show us the man Jesus loving people, but actually this was God's love expressed in Christ's love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The inward reality is the divine attribute and the outward appearance is the human virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First Peter 2:9 speaks of the virtues of our Lord, not His attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In His nature are the attributes, but in expression the attributes become the virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The attributes are of God, and the virtues are of the man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The virtues of the man Jesus are filled, mingled, and saturated with the attributes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not love anyone without the inward attribute of God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Otherwise our love for people is an empty love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is a virtue in appearance but there is no reality within it as an attribute.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Divine Life Mingled with the Human Life</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>to Have One Living without a Third Entity</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Christ's human living, the divine life was mingled with the human life to have one kind of living without a third entity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ's virtues were a mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>C. In Mercy, Love, and Grace,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>and Not in the Condemnation of the Law</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In His human living, Christ was God manifested in the flesh to express God in mercy, love, and grace and not in the condemnation of the law John 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Mercy is the source of God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without God's mercy there is no source for God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is because the ones whom God loves are pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are pitiful, yet He loved us because He is merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Mercy is the source of God's love, and grace is the instrument of God's love, so mercy, love, and grace are actually one thing.</S>
