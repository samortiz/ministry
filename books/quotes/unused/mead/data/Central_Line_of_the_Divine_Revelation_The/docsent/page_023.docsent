   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE DIVINE DISPENSING MESSAGE FIVE GOD'S CREATION OF MAN IN THE VIEW</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ACCORDING TO THE DIVINE ECONOMY 1 Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26a; Eph 1:11b; Matt 28:19; 2 Cor 4:4b; Col 1:15a; Phil 2:6; Heb 1:3; 1 Thes 5:23; Heb 4:12b; Gen 2:7; Zech 12:1; Prov 20:27; Gen 2:8-9</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Prayer: Lord, we trust in You for the study of such a deep word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, open up Your secrets and show us the hidden mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, we like to know Your heart with Your desire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We like to open ourselves to You.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, do open Yourself to us that we may have a thorough fellowship with You.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, do cover us with Your precious blood and anoint us with the anointing ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thank You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the foregoing messages we have covered four main things: God in His titles, God in His person, the divine economy, which is the eternal plan of God, and the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These four things serve as an introduction to the subject of this series of messages, which is "The Central Line of the Divine Revelation."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have been in the Lord's ministry for over sixty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through all these years, by studying the word of God in the Bible and the writings of others, I have discovered that in the Bible there is a central line which has been missed by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In most of the Christian bookstores, it is difficult to find any publication concerning the dispensing of God or God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to my knowledge, those of the inner life spoke much about God's plan, and one of their writers, Mrs. Charles A. McDonough, published a book entitled God's Plan of Redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the word economy was not used in regard to God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This might be because in Ephesians 1:10, 3:9, and 1 Timothy 1:4, the main verses in which the Greek word oikonomia is used, some versions of the Bible rendered this word as dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Dispensation is not a wrong translation, but its denotation has been spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A better translation of the word oikonomia is administration or economy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the denotation of the word oikonomia, there is the thought of a household administration.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, God's economy is God's household administration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In God's economy the main item is to dispense God Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This thought is new.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word economy is in the Bible, but the word dispensing is not.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nevertheless, the fact of dispensing can be found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The divine economy and the divine dispensing are the central line of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During the past thirty years, I have nearly finished the life-study of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today, I am beginning a new study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The subject, points, and facts are the same, but the view is different.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I call this study "The View of the Divine Dispensing according to the Divine Economy."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The title of this message is "God's Creation of Man in the View of the Divine Dispensing according to the Divine Economy."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The phrase in the view of in this title is used to show that God's creation of man was in the view of His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A view is different from a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In doing anything, we must have a view.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In setting up a school or a business, we should not do it without a view.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In creating man, God had a definite view.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God created man in the view of His dispensing.</S>
