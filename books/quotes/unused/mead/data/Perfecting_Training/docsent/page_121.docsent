   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY STAYING IN THE MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for Your redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How we thank You that we are the redeemed people!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We thank You, Lord, for Your cleansing and redeeming blood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We thank You for the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We thank You for the Spirit that dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, we thank You for this time that we can all come together to touch Your Word and to get into Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, we believe that You are one spirit with us right now.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, we do claim this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We claim Your presence and Your anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We claim Your up-to-date speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, grant us new light, new thought, and even new utterance and new expression.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Make today s fellowship new.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do cover every one and shame the enemy again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jesus is the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jesus is the Victor!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lord, we praise You and worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this message we will cover just two verses in Romans 8, verses 8 and 9.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the reading of these two verses, we need to pay special attention to the little preposition in. In the New Testament and especially in Paul s writings, prepositions mean a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In fact, in the Greek language, the prepositions are crucial words.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The meaning of certain phrases or clauses or sentences depends upon the prepositions used in them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, as we have pointed out in the Life-study of 1 Corinthians, Paul was very careful in his choice of prepositions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 2 of chapter one Paul wrote to the church of God which is in Corinth...with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place....</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here Paul used the preposition with rather than the conjunction and.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the conjunction and had been used, it would indicate that these phrases were equal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But because the preposition with was used, it indicates something subordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means something different.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This illustrates the importance of the prepositions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Romans 8:8-9, the crucial words are not big words.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The crucial word is the small preposition in. It is used four times in these two verses.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Chinese translation of the Bible says that those who are of the flesh cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Of course, the English translation does not use the word of.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It uses the word in. But although you read the word in, I am afraid that your understanding may be of.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 9, you would not, of course, say that the Spirit of God dwells of you, but you might say that the Spirit of God dwells with you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That would not be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even many Christians today like to use the word with.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They say the Lord is with you or God be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not many would say that the Lord is in you or that God is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>SOURCE AND POSITION</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Why in verse 8 and at the beginning of verse 9 did Paul use the preposition in ?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In these two verses, the preposition of indicates the source and the position.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When you say that you were born of the Spirit, it means that the Spirit is the very source of your regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Likewise, when you say that you were born of the flesh, it means that the flesh was the source of your natural birth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE PRESENT CONDITION</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The preposition in, however, indicates something different; it indicates the present condition.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to the source of the new birth, you are of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But according to today s spiritual condition, you are in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In indicates the condition of your present living.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If, in your spiritual condition, you are still only of the Spirit and not in the Spirit, this indicates a shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because these two verses emphasize the preposition in and not the preposition of, it indicates they are not talking about the position or the source; they are talking about the condition, the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those who are in the flesh does not refer to source or position but to condition and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You may be a person of the Spirit, yet you are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You were born of the Spirit, and the Spirit is your source and position, yet your condition is not in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Your condition is that you are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>So according to your condition and present day experience you are not in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You were born of the Spirit, and according to your position, you are still of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You are a person of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You are a person in the position and of the source of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But you don t live in the Spirit, and you don t walk in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>So you are not in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For example, you may be of America and yet live in another country.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A person may be of the Spirit and yet live in the flesh, but a person who is merely born of the flesh could never live in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Verse 8 says that those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Does this refer to believers or unbelievers?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Although it may include both believers or unbelievers, I believe that Paul was referring to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You have to realize that Romans 8 is not speaking about the initial salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This has already been covered in the previous chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In chapters one and two, none were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In chapters three and four some were saved and justified.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This means that by the time Paul reached chapter eight he was not dealing with unbelievers, but with believers.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Check with your own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>During the course of a day sometimes you are in the spirit, and sometimes you are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When you come to the meetings, there is a good possibility that you are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When you are at home, though, sometimes you may not be in the spirit; you may be in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>So on the one hand, we really are of the Spirit, but on the other hand, sometimes we are not that much in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>These three prepositions in, with, and of mainly touch the matter from our side.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Now let us consider the matter from the side of the Spirit.</S>
