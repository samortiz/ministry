   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE DESCENDANTS OF ABRAHAM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ISRAEL AS THE CHOSEN PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Israel, as the chosen descendants of Abraham, is seen in the record from Genesis 11:10 through Malachi 4.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This group of people occupies most of the writing of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With the exception of the first ten and a half chapters of Genesis, which speak of the first two groups of people, the remainder of the Old Testament concerns this group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. Being Called</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Adam was a father, Noah was a father, and Abraham also was a father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Adam was the father of the created ones, Noah was the father of the saved ones, and Abraham was the father of the called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The group God created failed, and the group God saved also failed; therefore, God came to call out another group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. Inheriting the Promise</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God called Abraham and gave him the promise of grace, and later his descendants inherited this promise.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The content of this promise is the gospel that God is preaching to us today Eph 2:17; Gal 3:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>C. Falling into Egypt</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although the descendants of Abraham were heirs of the promise, they did not stand firm in their position to inherit the promise; rather, they left Canaan and went down to Egypt, falling from their position as heirs of promise to a position of slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>D. Going Out of Egypt</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They suffered afflictions in Egypt as slaves, so God came in to deliver them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Delivered by God out of Egypt, they were able to leave their position as slaves and return to their position as heirs of promise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>E. Receiving the Law</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After they came out of Egypt and arrived at the foot of Mount Sinai, they received the law from God; they received God s holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>F. Passing through the Wilderness</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then they passed through the wilderness, where they received God s leading, encountered numerous circumstances, and saw many signs and wonders.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In their journey God was manifested on many occasions among them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>G. Entering into Canaan</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They conquered the seven tribes of Canaan and captured the land of Canaan, allotting it for their inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>H. Gaining the Land to Establish the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once they had gained the land, they established the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This brings us to the time of David and Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I. Becoming Desolate and Being Captured</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not long after they established the kingdom, they were defeated, desolate, and carried away to the Gentile nations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The cause of their defeat, the condition of their desolation, and the result of their captivity are all recorded in 1 and 2 Kings and 1 and 2 Chronicles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>J. Being Restored and</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Returning to Their Own Land</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When seventy years of captivity were fulfilled, they were restored and brought back to Jerusalem in the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>K. Becoming Desolate Again</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>after Their Restoration</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not long after they were restored and returned to their own land, however, they became desolate again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>L. God Coming to Judge and</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>to Forsake Them Temporarily</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Due to God s judgment, the third group of people came to a temporary end at this point.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Matthew 23:37-39, Luke 19:41-44, 21:5-6, 20-24, and 23:27-31 all show how God would judge His elect, the people of Israel, temporarily forsaking them until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can be very clear about the things concerning Israel as the chosen people of God if we remember these twelve points.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this long section of the Old Testament, from Genesis 11:10 to the end of Malachi 4, even though the Gentiles are sometimes mentioned, they are not the main subject; they are mentioned only because of their association with the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this long section of the Bible, the main character is Israel, the chosen people of God, the descendants of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In summary, there are three groups of people in the Old Testament the adamic race, the descendants of Noah, and the descendants of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We also can say that there are three fathers in the Old Testament: the first is the father of the created people; the second is the father of the saved people; and the third is the father of the called people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we keep these things clearly in mind, we will have a thorough and accurate knowledge of the Old Testament.</S>
