   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There are also those from within who may be considered as "indoor barking dogs."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One of them may ask you where you meet.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then he may ask you if you know a certain brother there.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When you say that you do, he will begin to tell you many things about this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then when you go to your next meeting and see this brother, the sight of his face will quench you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Your feeling and attitude toward him will have been affected, and your oneness with him will have been damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is much barking today to distract us from the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Much of this barking comes from the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We pointed out previously that the saints who have gone to Russia for the Lord's move have seen that the Russian Orthodox tradition still remains there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some refused to be baptized after they received the Lord because they had been baptized when they were infants.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although religion was cut off in Russia by Lenin more than seventy years ago, the "barking" of traditional religion still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This barking can distract the proper, normal Christians from the way of the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On our Christian way, there is much barking to distract us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes the wives can speak things to distract their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A wife may say, "In the past we used to attend every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But now I don't like to go to the church meetings too often."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The husband then may ask, "Dear, what is the reason?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She may then say that two of the elders are not very nice and that she does not like to see them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such speaking will spontaneously, secretly, and hiddenly distract her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By receiving this speaking, her husband will be cooled down in his feeling toward the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How can we overcome all of this barking?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The invisible vision keeps us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul told King Agrippa, "I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision" Acts 26:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul did not disobey the heavenly vision which he had received.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Vision keeps us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Vision strengthens us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The barking cannot affect us because we have seen something so real.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope that all of us will see a vision of the real oneness in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we see such a vision, we will not be distracted by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We will not be distracted by the division and confusion in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will only care for what we have seen in the trance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through these messages, the Lord has brought us into a trance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this trance, we have seen the oneness in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We see that we have to remain in this oneness because we were born into it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Oneness in Practicality</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The other aspect of the oneness is the oneness in practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All of the believers in Christ were born into the oneness of reality, but we all need to go on until we arrive at the oneness in practicality.</S>
