   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then 2 Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord be with your spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we put all these verses together, we can see that the exercise unto godliness depends on the exercise of the spirit, where the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you are going to exercise your self unto godliness, you have to know how to exercise your spirit because the very God is in your spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. More Profitable than Bodily Exercise</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Greek text of the New Testament, the word for "exercise" is the same as the English word "gymnastics."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the days when the Apostle Paul wrote these epistles, gymnastic exercises were practiced by the Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the historical background of the word used by Paul was the exercise of bodily gymnastics.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even today, people are learning more and more how to exercise their body for their physical health.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the Apostle Paul utilized this word to stress the vital need of another kind of gymnastics, another kind of exercise that is not related to the physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This kind of gymnastics pertains solely to the matter of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps some brothers have daily exercises or gymnastics for their body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Well, this is good, for Paul said that bodily exercise has some profit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is good, but only to a certain degree.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, Paul describes another kind of gymnastics which is good forever both for today and for eternity!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He says that this second kind of gymnastics gives us profit for the life today and for the life in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we should pay more attention to this other gymnastics, the exercise of our spirit.</S>
