   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Hebrew, the original language, there are altogether seven words in Genesis 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Each of these seven words has independent meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's inspired record does not say that at the beginning of time, God molded the heavens and the earth into being, or that He made them out of some elements.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It says that the heavens and the earth were created.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How clear is the word created!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To create is to make something out of nothing; it is to create something out of void.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not to make something out of some existing elements.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word create is bara in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"In the beginning God bara the heaven and the earth" Gen 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word bara is used three other times in Genesis 1 and 2: 1 "And God created bara great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good" v. 21 . 2 "So God created bara man in his own image" v. 27a . 3 "In it he had rested from all his work which God created bara and made" 2:3b .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To create is to make something out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The great whales and every living creature do not have an outward body only, but a life-element within them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The only way that this can be done is through God's direct work of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why it says that God created the great whales and every living creature 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is a very good reason for the Bible to say "created" instead of "made."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same way, although man's body was made from the dust, 2:7 tells us that man has a spirit and a soul which cannot be made from any physical material.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why the Bible says that God created man according to His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Genesis 2 there are three words for the act of creation: 1 Bara, which means to make something out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have covered this briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>2 Asah, which means to make.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This word is very different from the first.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Bara is to make something out of nothing, while asah means that there is some raw material first, and then something is made out of the raw material.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A carpenter can make a chair, but he cannot create a chair.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In describing most of the work during the six days, this word is used.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>3 Yatsar, which means to complete, has the sense of a potter molding a piece of clay into shape.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the word used for formed in 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Isaiah 43:7 shows the relationship between these three words: "Everyone who is called by My name, / Whom I have created, formed, and even made for My glory."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To create is to make something out of nothing, to form is to mold into shape, and to make is to work from some material.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Genesis 1:1 uses the word bara.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The phrase in the beginning is a further proof that God created the heavens and the earth out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no need of any hypothesis.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since God has said this, man should believe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If man wants to fathom God's work in the beginning with his finite mind, he will only expose his own presumptuousness!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"By faith we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God" Heb 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, who can answer God's challenge to Job concerning the creation?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God created the heaven and the earth in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The heaven does not refer to the heaven that surrounds our earth but rather to the heaven of the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This "heaven" has not changed since the creation of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although the heaven has never changed, the condition on earth has changed!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we want to understand Genesis 1, it is very important to differentiate between the earth in verse 1 and the earth in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The condition of the earth in verse 2 was not the condition at the beginning of God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the beginning when God created the heaven and the earth, His creation was perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is not a God of confusion 1 Cor 14:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, the condition of void and confusion in verse 2 was not the original condition at the time of God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How could God possibly have created an earth that was void and without form?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can answer this question by reading one verse alone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"For thus says Jehovah, / Who created the heavens / He is the God / Who formed the earth and made it; / He established it; / He did not create it waste, / But He formed it to be inhabited: / I am Jehovah and there is no one else" Isa 45:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How clear this is!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The word waste in this verse is the same as the word without form in Genesis 1:2, which is tohu in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Unfortunately, translators of the Bible have not used the same word in both places.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"He did not create it the earth without form."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Why then does Genesis 1:2 say that "the earth was without form"?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is easy to find the solution.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Genesis 1:1, God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The earth that God created then was not void and without form.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Later there was a cataclysm, and the earth became without form and void.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 3 does not refer to the original creation, but to a restored earth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, and then during the six days, He re-created the world.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The world in Genesis 1:1 was the original world, while the world in 1:3 is our present world.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Genesis 1:2 describes the transitional condition of desolation after the initial world and prior to our present world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We do not base our explanation on Isaiah 45:18 alone even though Isaiah 45:18 alone is sufficient as a proof .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have other evidences.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>According to Bible scholars, in Hebrew the first word in verse 2 is a conjunction, which should be translated as and.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth, and the earth was without form, and void."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The "and," according to Hebrew usage as well as that of most other languages proves that the first verse is not a compendium of what follows, but a statement of the first event in the record.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For if it were a mere summary, the second verse would be the actual commencement of the history, and certainly would not begin with a copulative.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A good illustration of this may be found in the fifth chapter of Genesis Gen 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There the opening words, "This is the book of the generations of Adam," are a compendium of the chapter, and, consequently, the next sentence begins without a copulative.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>G.H. Pember, Earth's Earliest Ages, 1942, reprinted 1975, p.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>31.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, what follows in Genesis 1:2 is not a detailed explanation of the record in 1:1, but an independent, distinct, and later event.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The creation of the heavens and the earth is one thing, and the earth becoming without form and void is another.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Later we will explain why the earth became void and without form.</S>
