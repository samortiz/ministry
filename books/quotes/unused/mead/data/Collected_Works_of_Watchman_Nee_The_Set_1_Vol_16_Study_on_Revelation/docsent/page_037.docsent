   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 11:4</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Olive trees" produce oil and the "lampstands" give light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is oil, and there is light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The olive trees and the lampstands were standing at the time of Zechariah Zech 4:11-14 , they were standing when John was writing the book of Revelation, and they are still standing now.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The words translated "anointed ones" see Zech 4:14, KJV , when translated directly from the original, are "sons of oil."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that these two persons are filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"The Lord of the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Jews have their kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Genesis 14:22, God is the possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the Jews lost their kingdom, God was known only as the God of the heavens Dan 2:18, 28, 37, 44 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now He is again called the Lord of the earth, for He has returned to His Old Testament position and has again acknowledged the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What kind of people are these two witnesses?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Perhaps they are those who sell the oil to the five foolish virgins Matt 25:1-2, 8-10a , or perhaps they are those who give a little help to the persecuted ones during the time of the great tribulation Dan 11:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Revelation 11:5</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"And if anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And if anyone desires to harm them, thus must he be killed."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These two oppose the whole world and Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"If anyone desires to harm them, thus must he be killed."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We see that these two persons must know even the evil thoughts that arise in people's hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They witness with force; thus, they are not preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They perform miracles only to protect themselves and to support the Jews and the remaining Christians during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The miracles are not for saving people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Revelation 11:6</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"These have the authority to shut heaven that no rain may fall during the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they desire."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Rain" signifies God's grace because God sends rain on the just and on the unjust Matt 5:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"No rain" means that God withdraws His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Revelation 11:7</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"And when they have completed their testimony, the beast who comes up out of the abyss will make war with them and will overcome them and kill them."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The beast or the wild beast signifies Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word "beast" is mentioned thirty-six times in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thirty-six is six times six, six being the number of man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The very name of the wild beast signifies his personality, work, and all that he has.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lamb is mentioned twenty-eight times in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Twenty-eight is seven times four.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This special name signifies the Lord's personality, work, and perfect relationship with both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This beast comes up out of the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Revelation 13:1 says that the beast comes up out of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, the abyss is below the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The abyss is the dwelling place of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One who comes up out of the abyss must be a resurrected person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to Revelation 17:8, we know that the beast will have died and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The authority of the two witnesses enables them to kill people at will, but they cannot kill the beast because he is a resurrected beast.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Revelation 11:8</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"And their corpses will be on the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From the physical point of view, "the great city" is Jerusalem, but according to its spiritual meaning, this is Sodom the place famous for its sin and Egypt the place that opposes God .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Historically, it is the place where the Lord was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The manner of the death of these two witnesses may be similar to the crucifixion of the Lord, because verse 8 says, "Where also their Lord was crucified."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The word "also" emphasizes that their death was just like the kind of death that the Lord suffered in crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This corresponds with the crucifixion of the prophets in Matthew 23:34-35.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Revelation 11:9</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"And those of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations see their corpses for three and a half days, and they will not allow their corpses to be placed in a tomb."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"Those of the peoples and tribes and tongues" means that representatives from all peoples and tribes and tongues come to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These two persons become the common enemies of mankind, so when the nations hear that they have been killed, they come to see what has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to Joel 3:1-2 and Zechariah 12:3 and 14:2, people from every nation come to Jerusalem at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The "three and a half days" fall between three and four days.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>These are neither like the Lord who did not see corruption for three days John 2:19; Acts 2:30-31 nor like Lazarus who began to stink after four days John 11:17, 39 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The three days, the four days, and the three and a half days are recorded by John alone.</S>
