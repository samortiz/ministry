 <h2 class="head1">IV. LEVITICUS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Writer(s), the Place, and the Time</h2>
<p>(Please see this section in Genesis.)</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of Leviticus is the redeemed&rsquo;s worship to God and their living of a holy life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Background</h2>
<p>After the children of Israel built the tabernacle for God&rsquo;s dwelling place, they needed to know how to worship God, to offer to God, to serve God, to live before God, and to feast before God. Without the proper revelation from God, they would practice according to their own concept. Therefore, God purposed to give them a book that would reveal His concepts and His ways.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>[The central thought of Leviticus is that Christ is everything in the fellowship, service, and life of God&rsquo;s redeemed. Dr. C. I. Scofield once pointed out that Christ can be seen in every page of this book. In Leviticus Christ is everything. He is the offerings, He is the high priest, and He is everything in the living of God&rsquo;s redeemed people. Leviticus, therefore, is a book on Christ and full of Christ.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The General Sketch</h2>
<p>The general sketch of Leviticus is this: [Through the tabernacle, with the offerings, and by the priests, God&rsquo;s redeemed are enabled to fellowship with God, serve God, and be God&rsquo;s holy people living a holy life, which expresses God.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Sections</h2>
<p>1) Ordinances concerning offerings (chs. 1&mdash;7), 2) ordinances concerning service (chs. 8&mdash;10), 3) ordinances concerning living (chs. 11&mdash;22), 4) ordinances concerning feasts (ch. 23), and 5) other ordinances and warnings (chs. 24&mdash;27).</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. NUMBERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Writer(s), the Place, and the Time</h2>
<p>The events recorded in this book took place between 1490 B.C. and 1451 B.C. (Please see this section in Genesis.)</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of Numbers is [God&rsquo;s redeemed formed into His army and their journey in fighting for God.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Background</h2>
<p>After the children of Israel had been saved out of Egypt and supplied by God, and after they had received revelation from God and built the tabernacle for God&rsquo;s habitation, God spoke to them from the tabernacle. Having learned how to worship God and to live a holy life, they needed to go on. This book showed them how.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The central thought of Numbers is this: [Christ is the testimony and center of God&rsquo;s people, and the Leader and goal of their journey and fighting.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The General Sketch</h2>
<p>The general sketch of Numbers is this: [The redeemed and sanctified Israelites were formed into a holy army of God, which was to proceed by following God&rsquo;s leading and was to fight for Him.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Sections</h2>
<p>1) Being formed into an army (1:1&mdash;9:14), 2) journeying (9:15&mdash;20:29; 21:4-20; 33:1-49), and 3) fighting (21:1-3; 21:21&mdash;32:42; 33:50&mdash;36:13).</p>
