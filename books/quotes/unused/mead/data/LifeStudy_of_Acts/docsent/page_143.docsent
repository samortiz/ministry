   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO BEREA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Acts 17:10 says, And the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas during the night to Berea, who when they arrived, went into the synagogue of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why did the brothers immediately send Paul and Silas to Berea?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They sent them immediately because the apostles were in danger of being killed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If they had delayed even a little, they might have been put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once again, upon arrival in Berea, Paul and Silas went into the synagogue of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As usual, their reason for doing so was to grasp the opportunity for preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul and Silas were bold, going into the Jewish stronghold.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was necessary in order for them to gain God s called ones who were held in the fold of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Acts 17:11 and 12 say, Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily, to see whether these things were so.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore many of them believed, and there were not a few Greek women of high standing and men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Vine says that the Greek word rendered more noble indicates that the Bereans were more noble minded.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>F. F. Bruce says that the word means to be liberal, free from prejudice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I believe that these Bereans were not stubborn, but were quite wise.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever we are stubborn we cannot be noble.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A noble person is always wise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bereans were noble in receiving the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Acts 17:13 tells us that the opposition spread from Thessalonica to Berea: But when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that the word of God had been announced by Paul in Berea also, they came there as well, agitating and troubling the crowds.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It seems that these opposers became professionals, not doing any other business except to follow the apostles and to oppose God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not know who hired them or who paid their expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Actually, they were hired by the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>TO ATHENS Sent by the Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because of the opposition that had come to Berea, immediately the brothers sent Paul off to go as far as the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there v. 14 . As in verse 10, the word immediately is used to describe the brothers sending Paul away from the city.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 15 continues, And those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as quickly as possible, they went off.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Athens was the capital of Achaia, a province of the Roman Empire, the center of enlightenment in science, literature, and art for the ancient world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through the apostle Paul s visit to such a center, the gospel of the kingdom of God reached the people of the highest culture.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Reasoning with the Jews and Confronting</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>the Epicurean and Stoic Philosophers Paul s Spirit Provoked</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>by the Idolatry in Athens</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Acts 17:16 says, Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked in him as he beheld that the city was full of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The spirit here was Paul s human spirit Zech 12:1; Job 32:8; Prov 20:27 , regenerated by the Spirit of God John 3:6 , indwelt by the Lord the Spirit 2 Tim 4:22; Rom 8:10-11 , and witnessing with the Spirit Rom 8:16 , in which he worshipped and served God John 4:24; Rom 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a spirit was provoked by the many idols in Athens.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even the highest culture did not prevent the people in Athens from worshipping idols, because within them, as in all mankind, was a God-worshipping spirit created by God for man to seek and worship Him cf.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Acts 17:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, due to their blindness and ignorance, they took the wrong objects for their worship v. 23 . Now the true God, who created the universe and them, sent His apostle to announce the true object whom they should worship vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>23-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why was idol worship prevailing in Athens, the most cultured city?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The reason is that in every human being there is a God-seeking and God-worshipping spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Of course, many do not seek the true God or worship the true God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, they have the wrong object of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nevertheless, the fact that people worship something or are seeking something to worship is a strong proof that man needs God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is a need in man, especially in man s spirit, for God as the true object of worship.</S>
