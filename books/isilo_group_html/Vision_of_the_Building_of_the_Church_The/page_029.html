OF THE FURNITURE OF THE TEMPLE</h2>
<p>Finally, we also must see that not only was the temple larger, more stable, and more weighty than the tabernacle, but the furniture in the temple was also made anew, and their dimensions were increased. The altar, the laver, the showbread table, the golden lampstand, and the incense altar were all reconstructed, and in most cases their dimensions were increased. In the tabernacle the altar had been five cubits square and three cubits high, but in the temple it was twenty cubits square and ten cubits high. In the tabernacle there had been only one golden lampstand, but in the temple there were ten of them. In the tabernacle there had been only one showbread table and one laver, but in the temple there were ten showbread tables and ten lavers. Everything in the temple was renewed and enlarged.</p>
<p>The only item that remained unchanged, that was not replaced, and that did not increase in size was the Ark. We know that the Ark was a type of Christ Himself. Our Lord is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He is the Lord who is ever new, so He does not need to be renewed. Moreover, He is eternally complete and perfect, so He does not need to be made larger.</p>
<p>However, our experience of Christ should change. Our experience of the cross, the Holy Spirit, and Christ as our life, light, acceptance, and sweetness should be renewed, deepened, and enlarged. This is very much according to the principle of the temple. The enlargement of the temple signifies the strengthening of the church, and the renewing and enlargement of the furniture in the temple signifies the renewing and enlargement of the saints&rsquo; experience of Christ.</p>
<p>This picture indicates that our spiritual experience must match the stature of the church. We cannot have a large church yet be lacking in spiritual experience. This would be like having a huge temple yet having small lampstands, small showbread tables, small altars, and small lavers. The temple and the furniture would be incompatible. Therefore, in a church of considerable size, the size of the altar (that is, the experience of the cross) must be proportionately increased. The preaching of the gospel must be with greater impact so that when people come in, they would be strongly convicted and saved. At the same time, the believers&rsquo; consecration to God must also be increased so that there is truly a large altar. Furthermore, when the church is enlarged, there must be the enlargement of the bronze laver. In other words, the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit and the washing by the Holy Spirit must be more intense, frequent, and renewing. In the same way, the showbread table and the golden lampstand, which signify Christ as our life supply and light, must also be enlarged. In addition, the golden incense altar (that is, our fellowship with God and our experience of being accepted by Him in Christ) also must be strengthened, increased, and enlarged.</p>
<p>We must see that the temple was focused on the unchangeable Christ. In other words, Christ is the center of the church, and He is also the center of all of the saints&rsquo; spiritual experiences. Christ is forever the same, but the church must gradually be strengthened and enlarged, and the saints&rsquo; spiritual experiences must also gradually be renewed and enlarged. These two&mdash;Christ and the church&mdash;must match each other. Neither can be lacking. In this way, we will not have a mere outward, empty shell without the rich, inward content, nor will we have merely the content without the matching outward appearance. The normal building of the church can be manifested only when both the inside and the outside are complete. May God be gracious to us!</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision of the Building of the Church &nbsp; pg 29</div><br></body></html>
