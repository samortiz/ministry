   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO RECEIVE THE OVERCOMING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How does God give us the overcoming life?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He gives us the overcoming life by giving us His Son, who becomes our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul said, "For to me, to live is Christ" Phil 1:21a .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul did not say that we should live by Christ, that we should live by His strength, or that we should live by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He said that for him to live was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our greatest misconception is to think that God gives us Christ to help us to overcome our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is true that we have to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the way is not by Christ granting us the strength to overcome our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The biblical way is to set ourselves aside and to allow Christ to overcome for us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ died for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now Christ is living within us and for us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If Christ were not living for us and if Christ only died for us on the cross, it would be impossible for us to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is not here to sustain us or to strengthen us to overcome our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is here to set us aside and to live within us in our place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is overcoming sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why Paul said that for him to live was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only when Christ lives for us can we say that for us to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If Christ is not living for us, we cannot say that for us to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are not living by Him, and we are not living by imitating Him or living by drawing from His strength.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For us to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not a matter of Christ strengthening us, but a matter of Christ becoming our life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>VICTORY BEING CHRIST LIVING FOR US WITHIN</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Three years ago I was working in America.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One day after a meeting, a doctor invited me to go to his home.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His wife said to me, "Please pray for me."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I asked, "Why do you want me to pray for you?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She said, "I have several naughty boys, and they make me lose my temper all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I tried to be patient when the first child was born, and I tried to endure when the second child was born.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, when the third child came along, I felt powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When all four are together, I can no longer hold back, and I begin to lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more they are together, the more I lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I cannot be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What should I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I smiled at her and said, "Do you really want to be patient?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She answered, "It would be wonderful if God would grant me patience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then I could keep from losing my temper."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I said, "You are not lacking in patience."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She said, "What do you mean?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If I am not lacking in patience, what do I lack?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I said, "You lack Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You do not lack patience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you pray for patience, God will never give it to you, because Christ is our patience."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ does not help us become patient; He does not give us the power to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is patience within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is a great difference between these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We do not lack patience; we lack Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ is our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He does not help us become patient.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He does not give us the strength to make us patient.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is living within us and for us, and He is living out His patience within us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ within is our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This verse shows us that God has made Christ our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It does not say that Christ helps us to become sanctified or gives us the strength for sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ does not give us the strength for us to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather, He becomes our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ is our very sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is victory.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Victory is for Christ to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many people are familiar with Galatians 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But few see the real significance of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We often think, "Since it should be no longer I that live, I must strive and struggle to live no longer."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Actually, it is not a matter of us striving or struggling to live; it is a matter of Christ living.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is no longer I who live, but Christ who is living.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This means that Christ is living instead of us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ has redeemed us from sin on the cross, and He is now living within us and for us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is an exchanged life: It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.</S>
