<P>Hymn #541 in Hymns is concerning the experience of Christ versus all things. It speaks of the things that replace Christ, such as the law of letters, philosophy, and religion. All these things are really "Shebnas" which replace Christ. According to Isaiah 22, Shebna was "fired" and replaced by Eliakim as the steward over the king's house. Darby said that Shebna typifies a false Christ. He should be removed and replaced by Christ. Christ should not be replaced by us. Instead, we should be replaced by Christ. All of us are "Shebnas" who should be removed and replaced by the real Eliakim. Christ, our Eliakim, should replace everything and everyone in God's economy. We should sing Hymn #541 with such a realization. This hymn says:</P><ol class="decimal"><li>Not the law of letters,<br>But the Christ of life<br>God desires to give us,<br>Saving us from strife;<br>It is not some doctrine,<br>But 'tis Christ Himself<br>Who alone releases<br>From our sinful self.<br><br></li><li>Any kind of teaching,<br>Any kind of form,<br>Cannot quicken spirits<br>Or our souls transform;<br>It is Christ as Spirit<br>Gives us life divine,<br>Thus thru us to live the<br>Life of God's design.<br><br></li><li>Not philosophy nor<br>Any element<br>Can to Christ conform us<br>As His complement;<br>But 'tis Christ Himself who<br>All our nature takes<br>And in resurrection<br>Us His members makes.<br><br></li><li>Not religion, even<br>Christianity,<br>Can fulfill God's purpose<br>Or economy;<br>But 'tis Christ within us<br>As our all in all<br>Satisfies God's wishes,<br>And His plan withal.<br><br></li><li>All the gifts we're given<br>By the Lord in grace,<br>All the different functions<br>Cannot Christ replace.<br>Only Christ Himself must<br>Be our all in all!<br>Only Christ Himself in<br>All things, great or small!</li></ol>
