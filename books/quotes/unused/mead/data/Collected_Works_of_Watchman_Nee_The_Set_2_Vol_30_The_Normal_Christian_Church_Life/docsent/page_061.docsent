   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We must differentiate between the work of the elders, and the work of the prophets and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Their work is different, but they are not necessarily different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is quite possible for one person to act in both capacities.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The elders are those who hold office in a local church; the prophets and teachers are the gifted ministers in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The elders are for church government at all times; the prophets and teachers are for ministry in church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever there is a church, the Lord not only appoints elders for its government, but also gives gifts to some brothers to constitute them ministers for the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But this does not mean that elders have nothing to do with the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever government in the meetings is necessary, they can exercise authority there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As to ministry, though they cannot minister as elders, yet, if they are also prophets or teachers, they can minister in that capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is almost imperative that elders be prophets and teachers; otherwise, they cannot rule the church effectively.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The point to be remembered is that church meetings are the sphere for the ministry of the Word, not the sphere for the exercise of any office.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is for the exercise of gifts unto edification.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since both apostleship and eldership are offices, one in the work and one in the church, so both of the officers, as such, are altogether out of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But God will be gracious to His church to give it gifts for its upbuilding.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church meetings are the place for the use of these gifts for mutual help.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All meetings on the "round-table" principle are church meetings, and all meetings on the "pulpit-and-pew" principle are meetings belonging to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The latter may be of a passing nature, and not necessarily a permanent institution, whereas the former are a regular feature of church life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A round-table enables you to pass something to me and me to pass something to you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It affords opportunity for an expression of mutuality, that essential feature of all relationships in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the local churches we must discourage all meetings on the "pulpit-and-pew" principle, so that, on the one hand, God's workers shall be free to travel far and wide proclaiming the glad tidings to sinners, and, on the other hand, the new converts shall be cast on the Lord for all needed equipment to serve one another.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus the churches, having to bear their own responsibility, will develop their own spiritual life and gifts through exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is all right to have an apostolic meeting when a worker visits the locality, but when he goes, meetings of the pulpit-type should be discontinued.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Prophets, teachers, and evangelists in the local church may also take such meetings from time to time, but they should be regarded as exceptional, for they foster passivity and do not on the whole make for the spiritual development of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let us consult the book of Acts in order to see the example God set for His Church in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"And they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers....And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart" Acts 2:42, 46 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such were conditions in the early days of the Church's history.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The apostles did not establish a central meeting place for the believers, but these "continued steadfastly in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They moved from house to house having fellowship one with another.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can now draw our own conclusions from the three points we have considered.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>1 Wherever there is a group of believers in any place, a few of the more mature are chosen from their number to care for the others, after which all local responsibility rests upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From the very outset it should be made clear to the new converts that it is by divine appointment that the management of the church is entrusted to local elders and not to any worker from another place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2 There is no official meeting place necessary for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The members meet in one or more houses, according as their numbers require, and should it be necessary to meet in several houses, it is well for the whole church to congregate from time to time in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For such meetings a special place could be obtained either for the occasion, or permanently, according to existing church conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>3 The church meetings are not the responsibility of the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Local believers should learn to use the spiritual gifts with which God has entrusted them to minister to their fellow believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The principle on which all church meetings are conducted is that of the "round-table," not of the "pulpit-and-pew."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When any apostle visits a place, he could lead a series of meetings for the local church, but such meetings are exceptional.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the usual church gatherings the brethren should all make their special contributions in the power and under the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But to make such meetings of definite value it is essential that the believers receive spiritual gifts, revelation, and utterance; therefore, the workers should make it a matter of real concern that all their converts experience the power of the outpoured Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the examples God has shown us in His Word are followed, then no question will ever arise in the churches regarding self-government, self-support, and self-propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And the churches in the different localities will consequently be saved much unnecessary expenditure, which will enable them to come freely to the help of the poor believers, as the Corinthians did, or to the help of the workers, as did the Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the churches follow the lines God Himself has laid down for them, His work will go forward unhindered and His kingdom be extended on earth.</S>
