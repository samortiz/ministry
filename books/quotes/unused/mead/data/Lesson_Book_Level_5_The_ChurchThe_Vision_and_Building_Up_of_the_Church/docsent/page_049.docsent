   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Church in Antioch</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Acts 13:1 opens with the words, "Now there were in Antioch, in the church that was there.''</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This clearly refers to the local church established in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Acts 14:26 and 27 say that Paul and Barnabas "sailed away to Antioch, from which they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And having arrived and gathered the church together, they declared all that God had done with them.''</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 27 does not say that they gathered the believers but that they gathered the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that the church in its essential meaning is a meeting, a congregation or assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There was such a church, such a congregation, in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Including Prophets and Teachers</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Acts 13:1 tells us that in the church in Antioch there were "prophets and teachers: Barnabas and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.''</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Prophets are those who speak for God and speak forth God by God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They sometimes speak with inspired prediction 11:27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Teachers are those who teach the truths according to the apostles' teaching 2:42 and the prophets' revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Both prophets and teachers are universal as well as local Eph 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the establishment of the local churches started with the one hundred twenty in Jerusalem, only typical Jews were involved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But according to the record in Acts 13:1, the prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch were from a number of different sources.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Barnabas was a Levite, a Cyprian by birth 4:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Niger, whose name means black and should denote a Negro, was probably of African origin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Lucius the Cyrenian was from Cyrene in North Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Manaen was the foster brother of Herod and was governmentally related to the Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Finally, there was Saul, a Jew born in Tarsus and taught by Gamaliel according to the law of Moses 22:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The fact that the prophets and teachers here were composed of Jewish and Gentile peoples with different backgrounds, education, and status indicates that the church is composed of all races and classes of people regardless of their background, and that the spiritual gifts and functions given to the members of the Body of Christ are not based upon their natural status.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 13:1 the Lord set up a pattern for the spreading of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From Antioch the Lord's move turned to reach the Gentile world, and in the Gentile world there were many different kinds of people, people of different cultures, races, and statuses.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, at the very beginning of this turn, the pattern was established to indicate that the churches are composed of all races and classes of people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Antioch, the Holy Spirit set Barnabas and Paul apart to be sent out to establish more churches among the Gentiles Acts 13:2-4 .</S>
