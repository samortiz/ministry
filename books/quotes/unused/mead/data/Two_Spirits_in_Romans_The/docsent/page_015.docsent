   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Mingled Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Through regeneration our deadened spirit was enlivened and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now the all-inclusive Spirit dwells in our spirit and has mingled Himself with our spirit, making us one spirit with Him 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although human words cannot adequately define this mingling, it is nevertheless a fact that the processed Triune God as the Spirit has mingled Himself with our spirit to produce one mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The mingled spirit is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul purposely composed Romans 8 in a simple way so that we could understand his utterance, yet the reality that he describes is mysterious and abstract to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even our physical body and the life within it are mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our psychological being, including our heart, mind, emotion, and will, is even more mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot physically locate these parts, yet we know that they are within us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We also have a human spirit, which is abstract and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now that we are saved, we have something more mysterious within us the Triune God as the Spirit mingling Himself with our spirit to be one mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Romans 8:4 says, That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Bible translators have had difficulty discerning whether the spirit mentioned in this verse is the divine Spirit or the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to see that in Romans 8, the Spirit is no longer merely the Spirit of God, as He was in creation Gen 1:2 , but also the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of the resurrecting One.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, this all-inclusive Spirit is mingled with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans 8:16, which says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit, mentions the two spirits together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, the spirit in verse 4 refers not merely to the divine Spirit or the human spirit but to these two spirits mingled together as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every believer has such a mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to Romans 8:4, we should walk not according to scriptural doctrines or regulations but according to the mingled spirit that is within us and is even a part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Greek word for walk in verse 4 refers to the general walk in our daily living, including our eating, dressing, marriage life, family life, school life, job life, and church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must have our being according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not need to try to fully understand what or where the mingled spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We cannot fully understand our psychological heart, yet we know that we have such a heart because of the feelings it gives us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the same principle, we know that we have a mingled spirit within because we sense its function.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Perhaps when we are speaking with our spouse, something within us does not agree with us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we are considering whether to buy a certain item, something within us may say, Do not buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not consider it any further.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before we were saved, we did not have this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever we wanted to do something, such as go shopping, we would simply do it and would not be bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, since being saved, we often sense a speaking within.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead of trying to fully understand the mingled spirit, we simply need to believe that we have a mingled spirit and walk according to the mingled spirit in every area of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to have every corner and avenue of our being according to this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The mingled spirit is very close to the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Romans is part of Paul s completing ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After the time of Paul, when different teachings had damaged the church, John brought in the mending ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In his mending ministry John speaks of the anointing 1 John 2:20, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When electricity moves, it becomes a current.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Just as the current of electricity is electricity in motion, the anointing is the mingled spirit functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the mingled spirit functions in us, it becomes the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, to obey the anointing is to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not Living according to Our Nature, Culture, Ethics, Religion, or Habit</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may exercise our spirit in the meetings, but most of us forget about our spirit when we go home.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, we live two different lives.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In our home, marriage, school, and job we live according to our nature, culture, ethics, religion, and habit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To live according to our nature is to do things quickly if we are a quick person or slowly if we are a slow person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not take the excuse of our nature, saying, I was born this way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How could you expect me to do things differently?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Neither should we take the excuse of our culture, claiming that because we come from a certain place, we must behave a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we take this excuse, it means that we move, walk, live, and have our being according to culture.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the church meetings we are all one in spirit, but after the meetings we may make excuses based on our nature or culture.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We also should not live, walk, and have our being according to our ethical concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Perhaps we have stopped stealing or lying since becoming a believer, but we may do this according to ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We also have all been influenced by religion.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may think that it is good to be godly, pious, and religious.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Finally, we are also very habitual.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No matter if we are old or young, we have all built up habits, and much of the time we live according to habit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Though we love the Lord, are in the church, and want to have a good testimony, we unconsciously and spontaneously live, walk, and have our being according to our nature, culture, ethics, religion, and habit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is altogether wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may understand the teachings of living Christ and practicing to be one spirit with the Lord, but these teachings must become our daily walk, living, and being.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our walk should be to daily live Christ, and we should have our being by practicing to be one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to constantly live according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whatever we say or do must be according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Before we say something to our spouse, we should consider whether it is according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are too loose in our home life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are careful in the meetings, but we become loose as soon as we go home.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We may want to relax and feel free at home, but we must not forget to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should live a life that is according to the spirit at every time and in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This means that we even dress and groom ourselves according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Walking according to the Mingled Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Issuing in the Body of Christ, Preparing the Bride, and Bringing the Lord Back</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we walk according to the spirit, Christ will come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A daily walk according to the spirit will issue in the Body of Christ, the fullness of God, the new man, and the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Walking according to the spirit will cause the bride to be prepared and will eventually usher us into eternity by bringing the Lord back.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, Romans 8 is practical, crucial, and central.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Walking according to the Mingled Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Causing the Meetings to Be</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>a Normal Exhibition of Our Daily Life</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The meetings should be an exhibition of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we do not walk and have our being according to the spirit in our daily life, our exercise of the spirit in the meetings will be a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We should come together to meet in the same way that we live and walk.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Our calling on the name of the Lord when we meet should be a result of our calling during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Our praying when we come together should be a result of our praying unceasingly throughout the day.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The meetings are not a performance but a normal, ordinary continuation and exhibition of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We need to practice to live and have our being every moment according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is not adequate even to live according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The spirit s requirement is higher than the letter of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must reject our nature, culture, ethics, religion, and habit and take the mingled spirit as the standard of our living.</S>
