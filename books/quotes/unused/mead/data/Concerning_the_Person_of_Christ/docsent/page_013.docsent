   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. In the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Old Testament shows us that Christ needed to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to be a man He needed to become the seed of the woman as well as a seed of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Jesse, David, etc. At the beginning of the New Testament, Matthew chapter one shows us that Christ actually became the Son of Abraham and the Son of David v. 1 ; He also became a descendant of Isaac, Jacob, Judah, and Jesse vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2, 5-6 , born of the virgin Mary v. 16 . He definitely became the seed of the woman, to be a real man, just like any ordinary man, having ancestors and genealogy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Later, the second half of Matthew chapter one, Luke 1:30-31, and 2:5-12 tell us that Christ was conceived through the Holy Spirit and, following the normal human course, came out of His mother's womb to be a child.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, the prophecy in Isaiah 9:6, For unto us a child is born, was fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Luke 2:21-24 also shows us that this child who was born from His mother's womb was circumcised on the eighth day according to the laws of the Israelites and was given the name Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And when the days of His mother's purification were fulfilled, He was brought to the temple and was presented to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everything was done according to the ordinary human way, proving He had definitely become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Again later, Matthew chapter two shows us how Christ as a child was protected by His mother, taken away by Joseph to escape to Egypt v. 14 , brought back to the land of Israel v. 21 , and went to dwell in Nazareth and was thus called a Nazarene v. 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Luke 2:40-52 also shows us that the boy Jesus grew, and waxed strong, went every year to Jerusalem after the custom of the Israelites, and increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He had the proper living of a normal boy growing into manhood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Matthew 13:55 says He is the carpenter's son, and Mark 6:3 says He is the carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This tells us that after He grew up He worked with Joseph as a carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This fully proves that He is absolutely man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Matthew 4:3-4, after His baptism and before He started His ministry, the devil came to tempt Him, luring Him to manifest Himself as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the Lord replied, Man shall not live.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This answer indicates that He acknowledged Himself to be a man and held firmly to the status and position of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later, on numerous occasions He called Himself the Son of Man, thus acknowledging Himself to be a man Matt 8:20; 9:6; 10:23; 11:19; 12:8, 32, 40; 13:41; 16:13, 27; 17:9, 22; 20:18, 28; 24:30, 37; 25:31; 26:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even in the Gospel of John, a book which testifies that He is God, the Son of God, He not only often called Himself the Son of God, acknowledging that He has the divinity and the Godhead and is the same as God 5:17-23, 25-27; 8:36; 9:35-37; 10:33, 36; 14:13; 17:1 , but He also called Himself the Son of Man, confessing that He is a man, has human nature, and is the same as man 1:51; 3:13; 5:27; 6:27; 8:28; 12:23; 13:31 .</S>
