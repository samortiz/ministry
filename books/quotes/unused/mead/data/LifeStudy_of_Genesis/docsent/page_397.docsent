   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>6 Of God's Mercy</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's selection is also of God's mercy Rom 9:14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God said to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion" Rom 9:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all are the objects of God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How we thank Him that He has had mercy on us!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"It is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy" Rom 9:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>7 Of God's Grace</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's selection is also of His grace Rom 11:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is somewhat difficult to understand mercy and grace as they are related to God's selection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although we were selected and foreknown by God in eternity past, when God came to call us, we were in a pitiful situation, a situation which required God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The enemy, the Devil, might have said to God, "Look at this one who is Your selection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How pitiful he is!"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then God might have said to Satan, "Satan, don't you realize that this is a very good opportunity for Me to show My mercy?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Without such a pitiful person, how could I show My mercy?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If everyone were perfect and up to your standard, I would have no one on whom to show mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Satan, this chosen one is the right one to be the object of My mercy."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What about grace?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we have seen, grace is something of God wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although we were so pitiful, God did not reject us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, regardless of Satan's accusations, He had mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God might have said to Satan, "Satan, I shall not only show mercy to My chosen ones, but I shall work Myself into them."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When God is wrought into our being, that is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are not only the objects of God's mercy; we are also the objects of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are under God's mercy, and His grace is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I can testify that I am under the divine mercy and that in me there is the divine grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is all due to God's selection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Is this not your experience as well?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all can testify that though we were most pitiful and miserable, God came in and granted us His mercy and we repented.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that very time, something divine God's grace was wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now we are not only under God's mercy; we also have His grace, the living person of Christ as the Spirit, within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is God's selection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the record of Jacob's life, we see something which can be designated as mercy and something which can be designated as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>8 Followed by God's Predestination</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's selection in eternity past was followed by His predestination Rom 8:29; Eph 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is difficult to explain the meaning of the word predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to the Greek, it means to be pre-marked.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God has marked us out beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before we were born, God foresaw and foreknew us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We not only were chosen by God in eternity past; we were also pre-marked, and His mark is now upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even the angels know that we have been pre-marked.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, predestination means that God has marked us out beforehand for a certain destiny to be His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He has chosen and predestinated us unto sonship Eph 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>9 Followed by God's Calling</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God's selection is followed by His calling Rom 8:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God selected us in eternity past and called us in time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We cannot experience God's selection or predestination, but we have all experienced His calling.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all have been "hooked."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I can testify strongly that one day, as a very ambitious young student, I was "hooked" by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although I tried my best to get off the hook, I never succeeded.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every Christian has had the same experience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We were going our way and then one day the Lord "hooked" us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What can we do?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more we try to get off the hook, the bigger it becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This hook is large enough to cover the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Wherever we go, the hook is there.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you escape to a Las Vegas casino, you will find that the hook is there.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is what it means to be called.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many parents have rebuked their God-hooked children, saying, "Why are you so stupid?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Why must you go to meetings every night?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Don't you know that you have a future?"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We go to meetings because we have been caught by the divine hook.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Who can resist this hook?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>No one.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When this divine hook comes to visit you, there can be no resistance.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the Lord's calling, His gracious visitation.</S>
