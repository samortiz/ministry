   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Live Birds</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The live birds signify that Christ is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is living because He is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Clean Birds</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The clean birds here signify that only Christ is clean and is without any defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this matter, Christ and we are opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With us everything is unclean; with Him everything is clean.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are uncleanness, but He is cleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Two Birds</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The two birds signify, on the one hand, that Christ died for us that our filthiness might be taken away and, on the other hand, that He rose for us that we might be delivered from our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ died on the cross to take away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is typified by the first bird.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ rose from among the dead for us that we might be delivered from our weakness by the power, strength, and energy of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This life is the resurrection life, life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is also the divine life, the eternal, uncreated life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We receive this life from the resurrected Christ, who is typified by the second bird.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, these two birds signify two aspects of Christ Christ in crucifixion and Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>B. With Cedar Wood</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Cedar wood v. 4b; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>1 Kings 4:33 signifies the honorable and high humanity of the Lord, which enables Him to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Old Testament, plants are often types of the Lord's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Wood, in particular, is such a type.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Cedar wood typifies the uplifted humanity of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>C. With Hyssop</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1 Kings 4:33 Solomon "spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hyssop was among the smallest of the plants.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The hyssop in Leviticus 14:4b signifies that the Lord was willing to be lowly in becoming in the likeness of men that He might be nigh to man and become man's Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, as typified by cedar wood, the Lord has the highest standard of humanity; on the other hand, as typified by the hyssop, He was willing to be lowly that He might be available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>D. With Scarlet</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Scarlet v. 4b , a dark red color, implies much in typology.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Scarlet here signifies that the Lord lowered Himself to become a man that He might do the will of God and shed His blood on the cross for our redemption, thus becoming the honorable and high King.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The color scarlet signifies the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus it signifies Christ's redemption accomplished by His shedding His blood on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Scarlet also implies kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ was slain, crucified, for redemption and through that redemption He became the King.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Savior has become the King not by fighting but by dying, by being crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>E. With an Earthenware Vessel Filled with Living Water, over Which One Bird Was to Be Killed</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 5 says, "The priest shall order one bird to be killed in an earthenware vessel over fresh water."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Hebrew word translated "fresh" literally means "living."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>An earthenware vessel filled with living water over which one bird was to be killed signifies that through death in the flesh the Lord offered Himself to God through the eternal and living Spirit cf.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Heb 9:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The earthen vessel signifies the Lord's humanity, and the living water signifies the living and eternal Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Over an earthen vessel filled with living water a bird was to be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This signifies that Christ was killed in His humanity filled with the living, eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Hebrews 9:14 we have the fulfillment of this type.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This verse tells us that Christ through the eternal Spirit offered Himself to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When He was dying on the cross, He offered Himself to God through the living water the eternal, living Spirit of God that filled Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ was not alone when He was on the cross, for the eternal Spirit was in Him and with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Without Paul's word in Hebrews 9:14 we could not understand the type in Leviticus 14:5.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the type a number of details are covered in a very simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Here we have an earthenware vessel, living water, and a bird that was slain.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we put this type together with Hebrews 9:14, we see that when Christ the slain bird was being crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was in His humanity the earthenware vessel , yet within Him was the eternal Spirit, the living Spirit of God the living water .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through the Spirit who filled Him, Christ offered Himself to God.</S>
