   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>H. O Jehovah Our Lord, How Excellent Majestic</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Is Your Name in All the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 8:9 repeats the first part of verse 1 by saying, "O Jehovah our Lord,/How excellent is Your name/In all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This strengthens the thought concerning the excellency of the Lord's name in all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The earth now is full of the excellency of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now the earth is not a messy earth but an excellent earth because the excellency of the name of Christ fills all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this verse the psalmist considers that the earth is as excellent as the heavens, as indicated in the first part of the Lord's prayer: "Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth" Matt 6:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I would like to repeat the goal of this psalm once more.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The goal is to join the earth to the heavens and to bring down the heavens to the earth, making these two one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we are victorious and overcoming every day, this is our reality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today with us, the earth is joined to the heavens, the heavens are brought down to the earth, and the two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But with the unbelieving ones and with the defeated Christians, the heavens are far away and the earth is dark and messy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why the unbelievers need all kinds of worldly amusements and sinful pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But we do not need them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need only Christ and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we live Christ and live in the church life, the heavens and the earth are one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With us, our earth is really joined to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With us, the heavens are always here.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here on earth we have the excellent name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On this earth today the only excellency is with the name of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is such a name!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have this precious name on earth, and we also have our splendor, our glory, above the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, with us, the earth and the heavens will be one in a complete way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the coming age, in the millennium, in the age of restoration, the heaven is down and the earth is up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There we will enjoy God's salvation to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the millennium all of us will be babes and sucklings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There will be no older ones, no fatigued ones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everyone will be fresh, young, living, and full of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today many Christians like power, but the Bible in Psalm 8 speaks of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to be full of strength to praise the Lord, to express God's consummated work in His redemption.</S>
