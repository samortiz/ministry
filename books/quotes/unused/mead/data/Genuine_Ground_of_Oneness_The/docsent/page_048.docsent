   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although many of us have experienced grace, we still do not know grace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What a pity!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is possible to know only in a doctrinal way that Christ is our life supply for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to know grace experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose a brother is having a problem with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If he consults a pastor in Christianity, the pastor may exhort him with Paul's words about husbands and wives in Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He then may proceed to advise the brother or to admonish him with respect to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such instruction, however, is altogether void of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What this brother needs is for someone to minister life to him and to pray with him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this way, grace will be supplied to him, and he will be able to face the situation with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All married brothers and sisters must learn to go to the Lord and pray, "Lord, I need You.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I cannot bear this situation any longer."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Simply by opening to the Lord in this way, grace is dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through such a supply of grace, you are able to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Recently a brother testified how the situation between him and his wife reached a stalemate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He rarely spoke to her, and she rarely spoke to him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One day he asked his wife to pray with him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After that time of prayer, everything was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a testimony of the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The brothers who live together may experience friction and feel that living in a brothers' house is unbearable.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the brothers feel this way, they should go to the Lord, contact Him, and tell Him that they cannot bear their living situation any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As they pray in this way, the supply of grace will come to them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A situation that took place in the church in Chefoo more than forty years ago illustrates the sufficiency of the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Two brothers had a serious disagreement regarding finances.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One brother claimed that the other owed him a certain amount of money.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The other brother denied the first brother's claim.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually, they brought the problem to the elders of the church who endeavored to straighten out the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, no solution came forth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the contrary, the brothers even argued in the presence of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, I told these two brothers that whoever received the Lord's grace would be willing to forget the debt altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I said that the "court" in the church is completely different from a worldly court.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The difference is that the church "court" cares not for who is right or who is wrong; rather, it supplies grace to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you receive the Lord's grace, you will praise Him and be willing to regard the matter as settled.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The two brothers and the elders were surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then I suggested that we all pray together.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After a time of prayer, the two brothers began to weep and then to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually they were willing to let everything go, and there was no further problem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, we all feasted on the Lord's grace.</S>
