First Corinthians 12:13 says, &#8220;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body...and were all given to drink one Spirit.&#8221; In this verse there are two important words, baptized and drink. To be baptized means that you enter into the water, and to drink means that you let the water get into you. After this glorious baptism there must be the drinking. You need to drink often. Drinking follows baptism. Once you are baptized, you must drink. Baptism puts you in a position where you have the qualification, the standing, and the authority to drink. The water for baptism is the water for drinking. It is the same water. This life-giving Spirit is the Spirit for baptism and the Spirit for drinking. After baptism you need to drink.<p>How do we drink? First Corinthians 12:3 tells us: &#8220;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; In other words, whoever can say, &#8220;Jesus is Lord!&#8221; is in the Holy Spirit. Therefore, each time you say, &#8220;O Lord,&#8221; you are in the Holy Spirit. Each time you say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus,&#8221; you are taking a drink of the Spirit.<p>Sister M. E. Barber wrote a hymn, Hymns, #73. The second stanza in this hymn says: &#8220;Blessed Jesus! Mighty Savior! / In Thy Name is all I need; / Just to breathe the Name of Jesus, / Is to drink of Life indeed.&#8221; This is evidence that this sister truly had the experience of drinking. We need only to breathe the name of Jesus, that is, to call on the Lord Jesus, &#8220;Lord Jesus! Lord Jesus! Lord Jesus!&#8221; Then we will drink of His life. This calling does not need to be very loud. In order not to disturb others, we may at times call softly, &#8220;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&#8221; In any event we must drink. When we call softly, &#8220;O Lord Jesus!&#8221; we are firstly quenched within, then we also are enlightened. After a few more minutes of calling, the inner light will become brighter, and we will end up dealing with our sins. This is truly marvelous! We must drink in this way.<p>Finally, I would like to mention Romans 8, 9, and 10. Apparently these three chapters are not connected, but actually they are completely related. Chapter eight speaks of the living water being in us. Verses 9 and 10 show us that the Spirit of God dwells in us; that is the Spirit of Christ in us, and that is also Christ in us. This refers to the living water. Chapter nine says that we who drink of this living water are vessels. For example, water is poured into a cup, so the cup is a vessel. We are vessels to be filled with the living water. How do we get filled? Romans 10:12 says that the Lord is &#8220;rich to all who call upon Him.&#8221; Do you, as a vessel, want to enjoy the riches of the Lord? There is only one way, and that is to call on the name of the Lord. It is good to listen to messages because they can be helpful to you. However, you must call on the Lord&#8217;s name yourself. Once you call, His riches will become your drink, your supply. Then as a vessel you will be filled with the riches of the Lord of all. It is in this way that we can have the subjective experience of the Lord.<p>Hallelujah! This God has gone through a process to become water that is drinkable, and He is right here. We only need to call on His name, and He as the Spirit will enter into us so that we can enjoy His riches.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Subjective Truths in the Holy Scriptures &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
