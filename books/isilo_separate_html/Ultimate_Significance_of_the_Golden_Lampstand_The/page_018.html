the Lamps of Fire for Burning</h2>
<p>In Revelation the seven shining lamps have developed into seven burning lamps of fire. They are not only shining lamps but also fiery lamps&mdash;burning lamps of fire, lamps burning with fire. The lamps of fire imply judgment. The seven lamps are not only enlightening and burning; they are also judging. Actually, the seven shining lamps in Revelation 4 become seven great furnaces burning before the throne of God.</p>
<p>We must remember 1 Corinthians 3:10-13: &ldquo;Let each man take heed how he builds upon it....But if anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble, the work of each will become manifest.&rdquo; How will it become manifest? One day each man&rsquo;s work will be &ldquo;revealed by fire&rdquo; (v. 13). If our work in the church is gold, silver, and precious stones, that is excellent, for it can stand the test of fire. However, if our work is wood, grass, and stubble, it is fuel to be consumed by the fire. Therefore, with the seven lamps, there are not only the enlightening and the burning, but also there is judgment in the burning. We must know that whenever God moves, He judges. A dragging, hesitant person cannot follow God&rsquo;s move. When God moves, He always moves with His judgment.</p>
<p>We all like bright lamps. In our house at night, when all around us is darkness, we certainly like to have a shining lamp for illumination, but no one wants to have a lamp of fire. If we returned home and discovered that our house was on fire, not by the enlightening of shining lamps but by the burning of lamps of fire, we would be greatly alarmed. Do not forget that the golden lampstand in Exodus has the shining lamps, whereas in Revelation it has the burning lamps. In Exodus, the emphasis of the golden lampstand is on its shining; there is no implication of burning. In Revelation, however, the golden lampstand not only shines, but it has advanced from shining to become burning lamps of fire.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Experiencing the Burning of the Seven Lamps</h2>
<p>We all like to testify that we saw the light when we came into the church, but what did the light do shortly afterwards? Eventually, we were burned by the light which we saw. Initially the light we saw was a shining, but ultimately it was a burning. The old concepts, the old thoughts, the poison of tradition, and other matters were all burned away. We may compare these to bags of grass. In the past we carried many &ldquo;grass bags,&rdquo; and we treasured them so much that we were reluctant to discard them even after we came into the church. Many brothers and sisters came from Christianity; this is especially true in the West. When certain ones came to their first meeting, I secretly observed in my heart that they had come with &ldquo;bundles of grass bags.&rdquo; Nevertheless, when they came back to the meeting a week later, I could see that the &ldquo;top bundle&rdquo; was in flames. They were not aware of it, but I saw it. I was happy inwardly, and I thanked and praised the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Let it burn!&rdquo; Another two weeks would go by, and I could see that all the &ldquo;grass bags&rdquo; were burned to nothing, and the fire had spread to the rest of their being. In the past some among us were pastors or traveling preachers. They did a great deal of &ldquo;grass&rdquo; work and were full of &ldquo;grass.&rdquo; However, when they came into the church, they saw the light, and after a short time, the light became a burning fire. What burned them? It was not doctrines but light. The light of the Holy Place in the church eventually becomes the fire burning before the throne.</p>
<p>Is this not your experience? I trust that the sisters have had this kind of experience. When some first came into the church, they saw the light, but within a few days this light began to burn, and it burned one thing after another. At the beginning, they may have said, &ldquo;It is so good to be in the church! It is so sweet to have the Lord&rsquo;s presence! Thank and praise the Lord!&rdquo; However, before they could finish saying &ldquo;Thank and praise the Lord,&rdquo; something within them began to trouble them, saying, &ldquo;What about changing your attitude towards your husband?&rdquo; They may have said, &ldquo;O Lord, I am not the only one at fault; he is also wrong. Why should I change but not him? Since he is the head, he should change first. If he will deal with his sins by confessing his mistakes to me, I will do the same for him. I will not confess my mistakes before he does.&rdquo; Nevertheless, the burning within those sisters did not allow them to eat or sleep well. Previously, it was, &ldquo;O Lord, the church life is so sweet!&rdquo; but now it is not so sweet. Rather, it is like bitter medicine because there is nothing they can do except confess. What causes this? It is the burning.</p>
<p>Some say, &ldquo;Why are you the church, and we are not?&rdquo; Everyone fights to be the church. Let them go ahead and fight, but if they want to be the church, they have to take the bitter medicine and experience the burning. Let the &ldquo;grass bags&rdquo; and their temper be burned away. When everything is completely burned away, there is the golden lampstand. The golden lampstand comes out of burning. In a recent combined meeting for the breaking of bread, the brothers and sisters were excited when they saw the large bread spread on the table. However, when the time came for the bread to be broken, the shining light may have become the burning fire, and the Lord may have said to some, &ldquo;Do you want to break this bread? Have you dealt with the differences of opinion you have with the brothers and sisters?&rdquo; This is the burning of the seven lamps, and it is our experience.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
