   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR THE PUTTING TO DEATH OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE RENEWING OF THE INWARD MAN 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:10-18</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 4:10 Paul says, Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this verse Paul speaks of the putting to death of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why does he use this expression here?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To answer this question, we need to consider once again who Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The origin, the source, of the man Jesus is God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jesus is God incarnate, God conceived in a virgin s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Outwardly, Jesus is a man, but inwardly He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, Jesus is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This Nazarene is a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When He was on earth, outwardly He was lowly in every respect.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was born in a manger, and He grew up in the home of a poor carpenter in the despised town of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, inwardly Jesus was glorious, for the most high God was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Outwardly Jesus was a lowly man; inwardly He was the most high God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Truly Jesus is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE DEATH OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we must go on to see something concerning the death of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When many Christians mention the death of Christ, their understanding is limited to redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to their concept, the death of Jesus was only for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Often they quote the verse which says, Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is absolutely true that the death of Christ was for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We believe this just as much as other Christians do, if not more.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, redemption is just one aspect of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His death also has many other aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 2 Corinthians 4 we see the aspect not of redemption and not of the imparting of life, but of destroying, consuming.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to this chapter, the death of Jesus is for the consuming, the wearing out, of our outward man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For this reason, Paul says in 4:16 that our outward man is decaying.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although the man Jesus was God incarnate, God becoming a man, it was necessary even for His outward man to be consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the outward condition, the Lord Jesus was lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in a spiritual sense, the Lord Jesus was not an insignificant man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the contrary, Jesus equaled the entire old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When He was crucified, it was not only a man from Nazareth who died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Jesus was crucified, the entire old creation, including all of us, was crucified also.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus died for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose, not merely for the accomplishment of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first goal in God s eternal purpose is to terminate the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus, as God becoming man, was part of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was not through incarnation that He became a man in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, through incarnation He became a man in the old creation, a man who needed to be consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the age of thirty the Lord Jesus came forth to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>During the three and a half years of His ministry, He was constantly being put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a mature man of thirty, He was continually under the process of killing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do not think that Jesus was crucified only for the six hours He was on a material cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No, for at least three and a half years He was crucified daily.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every day He lived a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord Jesus was nailed to the cross daily.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes He was crucified by His mother.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Other times He was crucified by Peter or some other disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Jesus was nailed to the cross even by His disciples love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, the more Peter loved the Lord Jesus, the more he crucified Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, before He was literally crucified by the Romans, Jesus had been repeatedly crucified by His mother, His brothers, and His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In John 7 we have an example of the Lord s being crucified by His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Actually, during the three and a half years of His ministry the Lord Jesus was not mainly living He was dying.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He was living a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is what Paul means by the putting to death of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is a slow, gradual, and continual crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now we can understand that the Lord Jesus was crucified not only during the six hours He was on a literal cross.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For at least three and a half years, He was crucified continually, gradually, and slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the words of Paul, this gradual crucifixion is the putting to death of Jesus.</S>
