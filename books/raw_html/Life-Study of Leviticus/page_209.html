<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIFTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>THE SABBATH YEAR AND THE JUBILEE</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Lev. 25:35-55</h1><p>In this message we shall cover some further matters related to the jubilee.<h2 class=head2>K. The Way to Sustain a Brother Who Had Become Poor</h2><p>Leviticus 25:35-38 speaks of the way to sustain a brother who had become poor.<h2 class=head3>1. A Brother of the Israelites Becoming Poor and Unable to Support Himself</h2><p>A brother of the Israelites becoming poor and unable to support himself (v. 35a) signifies a believing brother becoming poor and unable to take care of himself. From the type here we are told how to take care of such a brother.<h2 class=head3>2. Sustaining the Poor Brother That He May Live with You, Not Taking Interest from Him in Money nor Gain in Food</h2><p>“If your brother beside you becomes poor and is unable to support himself, then you shall sustain him as you would an alien or a sojourner, so that he may live with you. Do not take interest from him or increase, but fear your God, that your brother may live with you. You shall not give him your money at interest, nor give him your food for gain” (vv. 35-37). This signifies that we should help the brother who becomes weak in spirit without taking any advantage of him.<p>In the church life it is possible to take advantage of a brother while we are helping him. We may take advantage of a brother not only in one way and in one aspect but in a number of ways and in a number of aspects. We should not do this, for we should never take advantage of a brother who is weak. Instead, we should take care of him in love so that he may live before the Lord as we do. We should live by Christ, in Christ, and with Christ, and our brother should live this way with us.<h2 class=head2>L. Concerning a Brother Who Had Sold Himself to Another Brother</h2><p>Leviticus 25:39-55 concerns a brother who had sold himself to another brother.
