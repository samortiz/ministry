   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE NEED OF THE CHURCHES ABROAD HOLDING TRAININGS FOR</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>LOCAL AND OVERSEAS SAINTS AND</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ENCOURAGING OVERSEAS SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>TO STUDY IN TAIWAN</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the churches in Taiwan continue to advance, and the co-workers are willing to receive the burden to help the churches abroad, there will be substantial results.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It would also be good to have a joint gathering or training every year or every other year for the saints from various local churches in Taiwan and abroad to attend.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Each term of training could be either three weeks or a month.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The saints from various churches can come together to participate in the training, just as the children of Israel kept the Feast of Tabernacles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The brothers and sisters who are serving the Lord can come together at least once every two years to have a training in which they live together and meet and fellowship together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This training could also be held every year.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe that this would be a great help to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The co-workers who go abroad to labor for the Lord should take note of the saints who are seeking and promising.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The co-workers can even encourage the young saints in Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia to come to Taiwan to study, attend meetings, and learn the language for the purpose of translation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When these young ones finish their education and return to their countries, they will be a great help to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The co-workers going abroad and the young overseas saints coming to Taiwan will cause the work to progress.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It will double the results with half the effort.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>TITHING FOR THE CHURCHES ABROAD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The co-workers going abroad and the young saints coming to Taiwan will increase the burden of the churches and the co-workers in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The spiritual and material burden will be heavier.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this reason, the churches in Taiwan should begin tithing for the churches abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that no matter how much the churches receive in offerings, they should give one-tenth to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Old Testament the Levites received the tithe of the Israelites and then gave one-tenth of what they had received to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was pleasing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Never think that your church does not receive much and therefore cannot tithe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a selfish thought.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible says, Give, and it will be given to you Luke 6:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Beginning from January of 1971, all the churches should offer ten percent, no matter how much they receive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose a local church receives ten thousand New Taiwan dollars, but it needs twelve thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What should this church do?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The elders should still endeavor to offer one-tenth and then commit the lack to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is according to the Lord s word in Malachi 3:10, which says, Bring the whole tithe to the storehouse that there may be food in My house; and prove Me, if you will, by this, says Jehovah of hosts, whether I will open to you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord said that we should prove Him by our giving, and He will open the windows of heaven for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not wait until we receive a surplus in order to give ten percent; rather, we should first set aside ten percent by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the churches would practice this, the offerings would increase.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Giving in this way will double what we receive from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Give to the Lord, and He will give to you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the way for the saints to be blessed and, even more, for the churches to be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Regardless of whether we have enough to meet our need, the churches in Taiwan must offer one-tenth by faith to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord will bless this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This will not only test us but also confirm the experience of the saints throughout the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No one has ever suffered a loss because of loving the Lord and offering material blessings to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without exception, what the Lord gives us in return is more than what we give to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This applies to individuals and also to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must look to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If every church would practice this, we will bring in the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The churches in Taiwan should give for the needs in South Korea by helping the saints there to purchase land for the construction of a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Such a project cannot be accomplished within a short time; nevertheless, we should ask the Lord to lead us in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By the Lord s leading, we may have a gathering of all the churches in East Asia every year or every two years.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The financial need for such a gathering would be large.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The burden would be too great for the churches to meet this need within a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Perhaps the churches can make an offering every month to meet this need.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This does not have to be a rigid practice.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the churches are so led, they can send the offering to the business office of the church in Taipei, designating its use for the East Asia conference.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this way funds will gradually be accumulated, and it will be easier to bear the financial burden at the time of the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must meet this need for the Lord s sake.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here is another example.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There are two halls in the church in Taipei that can each accommodate about a thousand saints, but both meeting halls are in need of renovation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need a place that can hold two to three thousand people for a training.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the future we will need to rent a hall that is large enough to hold ten thousand people in order to hold a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Of course, we may not be able to build such a large meeting hall in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Nevertheless, the church in Taipei should have a meeting hall that can seat two thousand five hundred to three thousand people so that we may regularly carry out trainings there.</S>
