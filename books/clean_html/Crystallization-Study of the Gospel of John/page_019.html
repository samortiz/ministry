<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. GOD'S EXISTENCE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Self-existing and Ever-existing</H2><P>God is self-existing and ever-existing, without beginning and without end.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. From Eternity to Eternity</H2><P>Psalm 90:2 says that He is God from eternity to eternity. John 1 begins in verse 1 with eternity past and ends in verse 51 with eternity future.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. GOD'S PERSON</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. God Being Triune</H2><P>God is triune, three-one&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (John 14:16-17, 26; 15:26). Matthew 28:19 says clearly that we are to baptize people into the name (singular) of the Father and of the Son and of the Spirit. There are three Persons, seemingly, yet one name. The entire Bible openly and clearly reveals the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Three Coinhering</H2><P>The three coinhere (John 14:10, 20). To coinhere is to exist in one another, to mutually indwell one another. Only the Triune God can be like this. He says clearly in John 14: "I am in the Father and the Father is in Me" (v. 10). The Father does the work in the Son's speaking. They are one, yet still there is the distinction between the Father and the Son.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Three Being Equal</H2><P>The three of the Godhead are equal. No one is higher or lower than the others.</P>
