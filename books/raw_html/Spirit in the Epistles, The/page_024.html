<h2 class=head1>THE FILLING SPIRIT</h2><p>And do not be drunk with wine…but be filled in spirit. (5:18)<p>When the spirit occupies the mind, the will, and the emotion, this means that the mind, the will, and the emotion are filled with the spirit. Thus, the spirit rules over the entire being and occupies the entire being. The word spirit here does not have a definite article; it denotes neither the Holy Spirit nor our spirit in a definite way. Rather, it refers to the spirit formed out of two spirits. We have this spirit in us, but it is still not in our mind, emotion, or will. This spirit is only in our spirit; it has yet to enter into every part of our being. Now we need to let this spirit spread into every part of our being so that our entire being is filled with the spirit. Many people today talk about being filled with the Holy Spirit. Actually they are referring merely to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. To have the outpouring is an outward matter, whereas to be filled is an inward matter.<p>When we repented and were saved, the Lord came into us. At that time our mind was turned, our emotion loved the Lord, and our will decided to receive Him. We opened our heart to the Lord, and He came in with rejoicing. However, gradually our mind, our emotion, and our will become closed to the Lord, and we shut Him up in our spirit. Some do it sooner, while others do it later. Eventually, your spirit becomes a prison. The Lord Jesus has found a prison instead of a dwelling place after He came into us. Do you know the difference between a prison and a dwelling place? You can go in and out freely in a dwelling place but not in a prison. Brothers and sisters, is the Lord Jesus residing in you or being imprisoned in you? Do you give the Lord Jesus freedom? Do not lock Him up any longer. Rather, open your heart again; turn your mind, emotion, and will to Him again. Then He is able to spread outward, and the result of this spreading is that He makes His home in your heart. Then He occupies your entire being, and every part of your being is filled with Him.<p>It would be a wonderful thing if some of us Christians could be occupied by the Lord within five years. The common situation is that we are constantly struggling with the Lord. In the morning we give our whole being to the Lord, but in the evening we take back one half. Then the next morning we take back another quarter, and in the end only a quarter is left. The Lord is frustrated within you, but all He can do is to wait patiently. After two weeks He comes to draw you again. Therefore, you repent and confess your sins again. Your mind is turned to Him and your emotion wants Him. You do this in the morning, yet at noon you change your mind again. Therefore, the Lord has been struggling with us for many years.<p>However, brothers and sisters, the Lord will always win. You can never win. If He cannot subdue you in one year, He will wait for five years. If He cannot subdue you in five years, He will wait for ten years. If He cannot subdue you in this age, in the coming age He will subdue you. But if you let Him get through sooner, you will be happy and He will also be happy. Otherwise, He will suffer and you also will suffer.<h2 class=head1>THE FIGHTING SPIRIT</h2><p>And receive…the sword of the Spirit, which spirit is the word of God. (6:17)<p>The sword of the Spirit is obviously for fighting. Therefore, this Spirit is also the fighting Spirit. When you are occupied by and filled with the Spirit, you are equipped to fight the spiritual battle for the Lord.<h2 class=head1>THE PRAYING SPIRIT</h2><p>Praying at every time in spirit. (v. 18)<p>This spirit does not refer to the Holy Spirit but to the spirit formed out of two spirits. We need to pray in this spirit.<p>Dear brothers and sisters, these eight items are the work of the Spirit of life in us as the seal and pledge. Through these eight items of work, He coordinates us into the Body and builds us into the church. When you turn to your spirit, you have the light and revelation concerning the church, the revelation concerning the mystery of Christ. You are also one with others. Since you are one, you are built and your spirit is strengthened. When you are strengthened, you are renewed; when you are renewed, you are filled; when you are filled, you are equipped to fight. It is in the fighting spirit that you pray. You pray for the spread of God’s kingdom and for the revelation of the mystery of God. This is the church life and the Body life. The Body life is in this Spirit. This is the Spirit in Ephesians.
