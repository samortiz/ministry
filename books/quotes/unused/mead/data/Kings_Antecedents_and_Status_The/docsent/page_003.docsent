   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR BIOGRAPHIES OF ONE PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jesus is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With Him there are many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No one can exhaust in language who and what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Who else in history has four unique biographies written of him?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although the New Testament is a short book, it begins with four biographies of one Person, four books telling us of the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Each of us has four sides: the front and the back, the right and the left.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you look at me from the front, you can see seven holes on my face.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if I turn my back to you, all the holes disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On my right side you can see a little hole, and on my left side, another little hole.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you would make an accurate copy of my image, you need to take a picture of every side.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is exactly what has been done in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why do we have four Gospels?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because Christ has at least four main aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is great!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because He is all-inclusive and unsearchably rich, He needs several biographies.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John present different aspects of Christ because each writer was a different kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Matthew, for instance, was a tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Among the Jewish people in ancient times, a tax collector was a despised person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nevertheless, Matthew wrote the first biography of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Mark was an ordinary man, and Luke was a physician and a Gentile.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At first, John was a common fisherman, but eventually he became the very aged, experienced apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Each wrote a different biography about the same Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This living Person needs many biographies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE EXPANSION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The book of Acts is the expansion of this wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is the branching out of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This Christ has expanded from one Person to thousands and thousands of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was once the individual Christ, but in Acts He has become a corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Following the Acts, we have all the Epistles, which give a full definition of this wonderful, universal, great Man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is the Head, and the church is the Body: this is the universal Man, Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Finally, we have the book of Revelation as the consummation of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This book gives us a full picture of the Body-Christ, the individual Christ incorporated with all His members to become the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE ORDER OF THE FOUR GOSPELS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us return to the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If I were to arrange the four Gospels, I would put the Gospel of John first.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When reading the Bible, many Christians start with John and then proceed to read Luke, Mark, and Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The human concept is the exact opposite of the divine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The divine concept starts with Matthew and proceeds through John; the human thought starts with John and goes back to Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many of us would begin reading the New Testament with John because John is so wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is a book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After John, we would read Luke because Luke is a book of the Savior, telling us of many cases of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then, of course, we would come to Mark because Mark is short and simple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>People read Matthew last because Matthew is too difficult, too mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Not only is chapter one difficult to understand; the parables in chapter thirteen and the prophecies in chapters twenty-four and twenty-five are also difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Chapters five, six, and seven, the Sermon on the Mount, are especially difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No one can practice it!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You strike me on the right cheek, and I turn to you the left.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You force me to walk one mile, and I walk two miles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You take my outer garment, and I give you my inner garment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is too much!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only Jesus can do it!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, many place Matthew last.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>John is dear and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In John, Jesus is everything, and we do not need to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, we like John, but not Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may not say this in plain words, but we have such a feeling in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Nevertheless, the divine order is best.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God put Matthew first.</S>
