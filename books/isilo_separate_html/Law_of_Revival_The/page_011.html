BIG AND SMALL REVIVALS</h2>
<p>If we know the law of revival, we will contact the Lord as soon as we feel oppressed. When we contact Him, our inner being will rise up and be revived. When we feel old, we simply need to contact the Lord again. As soon as we touch Him, we will be refreshed and experience a revival. If we would touch the Lord when we feel hungry, tired, weary, dry, old, or dead, we would always have a revival. We would have big revivals and small revivals. We would also have several revivals in one day. Furthermore, as a result of such frequent revivals, we would grow quickly; we would advance according to the law of life. </p>
<p>In the physical realm there are four seasons in a year, which form a cycle. Every spring is a big beginning, a big revival. There are three hundred sixty-five days in a year, and every day is a small cycle. Hence, every morning is a small beginning, a small revival. Furthermore, the three meals that we eat within the twenty-four hours of one day are also small revivals. Besides these revivals, sleeping and resting are also small revivals. By means of these continuous cycles of big and small revivals, our physical life can exist, grow, and become strong.</p>
<p>This principle also applies to our spiritual life. There are also big revivals and small revivals in our spiritual life. For example, when we were saved, we were raised out of death and received God&rsquo;s life. This was a big revival. When we forsook our past and gave ourselves to the Lord, we had another big revival. Through such big revivals we are filled with joy and feel as though we are soaring in heaven. When we lose this feeling after a period of time, it is time for a revival that will deliver us from living according to our feelings to living by faith and that will enable us to enter deeper into the Lord. Such a revival is a big revival. Hence, a Christian has at least three big revivals: salvation, consecration, and deliverance from living according to his feelings into living by faith.</p>
<p>Besides the big revivals, we also have many small revivals in our daily life. For example, if a sister receives a telegram that her mother is gravely ill, the sister will be down. But if she knows the law of revival, she will realize that such a feeling is a sign, urging her to contact Christ, look at Him, experience Him, and gain Him. As soon as she experiences Christ in this way, she will be uplifted. This is a small revival. Here is another example. A brother may feel hurt because a colleague at work said something sarcastic and mocked him. This feeling is a sign, telling him to contact Christ, cast this burden on Him, and enjoy Him in this matter. If the brother will experience Christ in this way, he will immediately have a small revival. We can be revived at least three times a day: in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening.</p>
<p>In addition to the situations in our outward environment, we also have situations that involve our heart. A sister may always have sweet fellowship with the Lord, but one morning the fellowship is blocked, and the sweet taste disappears. As a result, she will feel very sad. This feeling is a sign, telling her to seek a revival. This feeling should also cause her to see a weakness, which will lead her to know a virtue of Christ. Our weaknesses expose what we lack of His virtues. Hence, we can enjoy Christ according to our weaknesses. This is a revival. We can experience such revivals many times in a day.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE LAW OF REVIVAL<br />
ENABLING US TO BE REVIVED EASILY</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 12:10 the apostle Paul said, &ldquo;I am well pleased in weaknesses...; for when I am weak, then I am powerful.&rdquo; Paul knew how to live by the power of Christ when he was weak and how to touch the joy of Christ when he suffered. He also was able to apply the law of revival; hence, he was always being revived. We need to know and apply this law so that we too can regularly experience being revived. This is the way to be saved from being weighed down by our problems.</p>
<p>A brother might stop attending the meetings because the burden of his children&rsquo;s problems, his wife&rsquo;s poor health, and his financial situation is too heavy for him to bear. On the one hand, we sympathize with his situation. On the other hand, we cannot justify his action, because the Christ who dwelt in Paul also dwells in him. Paul said, &ldquo;When I am weak, then I am powerful&rdquo;; therefore, this brother should be able to say the same thing. If this brother knows the law of the spiritual life, he also will be able to say that he is powerful when he is weak. The Lord has permitted his environment to serve as a sign that he needs another revival. He does not need to plead for a revival. Instead, he needs to see that the Lord who indwells him is resurrection and is full of power; the Lord is able to break through death. This brother needs to see, believe, and accept this fact. Then he will even be able to say to Satan, &ldquo;If you create more sufferings and stir up more problems, I will be able to enjoy more of Christ. When I am weighed down, then I am released; when I am weak, then I am strong; when I am in misery, then I am full of joy.&rdquo; This brother will be revived when he sees Christ. Even if the means of his livelihood are not stable, the environment will not frustrate him from being in the meetings. On the contrary, when he comes to the meetings, he will be full of vitality, released in spirit, and his whole being will be buoyant and elated. He will be able to testify, even if in tears, of how the Lord visits him and is with him in his difficult situation. We may say that this is the testimony of a person who has met and enjoyed the Lord, but this is actually the testimony of a person who has experienced another revival.</p>
<p>If we know the law of revival, being revived will be a simple matter. We do not need to be weighed down or oppressed until, being unable to bear it any longer, we pray desperately and touch the Lord accidentally before we can rise up. We need only to know this law and know that the Lord is dwelling in us with all His riches. Whenever we feel deadened, weighed down, or oppressed, or when we suffer the attack of our environment, we should draw on the Lord&rsquo;s great power, and we will be revived immediately. As long as we know the law of revival, it will not be difficult to eat when we are hungry or to drink when we are thirsty.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT REMAINING WEAK OR OPPRESSED</h2>
<p>In the New Testament age Christ is everything to us. If we are down, He is in ascension; if we are deadened, He is resurrection; if we are weak, He is strong; and if we are in darkness, He is light. Every weakness that we possess enables us to see a particular virtue of Christ. He can meet the need in every weakness. Hence, as Christians, we have no reason to be continually miserable. We should rejoice when we are miserable. Neither do we have any reason to stay weak for a long time; we should be strong when we are weak. Figuratively speaking, there is no reason for us to hunger continually. If there were a famine that issued in a shortage of food, we would have reason to be hungry. But we have an abundance of food; the resurrected Christ dwells in us to supply our every need. Therefore, we should no longer be hungry. We have no reason to sigh or lament, because we can eat when we are hungry.</p>
<p>We have no reason to be deadened in the meetings, because when we are deadened, then we are enlivened. Paul said that when he was weak, then he was powerful. Being weak includes feeling miserable, oppressed, weighed down, or deadened, being closed and in darkness, and every other negative condition. Similarly, being powerful includes being joyful, bright, uplifted, released, living, open, and every other positive condition. Hence, the principle of &ldquo;when I am weak, then I am powerful&rdquo; can be applied to all our situations.</p>
<p>In the past we explained how to live by faith, how to enjoy the riches of Christ, how to eat, drink, and enjoy God, and how to fellowship with the Lord and live in this fellowship, but we neglected the law of revival. The Lord is presently leading us to see that the proper spiritual living involves the law of revival, the cycle of revival. The more we are revived, the more we will be fresh, living, strong, open, and mature.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
