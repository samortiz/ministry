   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING A LIFE OF ONENESS IN THE CHURCH Putting Our Trust in the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Having No Choice of Our Own</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, it is wonderful to come together in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the other hand, however, it is difficult to come together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even for two brothers to live together in the same room is a hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One may want the windows closed, and the other may want them open.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since the church life is a life of togetherness, what can we do?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must all put our trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The two brothers can say, Lord, if You put us together, we have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot choose to have the windows open or shut.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, it is up to You.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To keep the windows open or shut does not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must learn the lesson of not having any choice and of leaving everything up to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Having No Confidence in Ourselves</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>but Doing All Things by the Body</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, in our life of togetherness we should not do things by ourselves or have any confidence in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must not say, I am very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I checked with the Bible, and what I am doing is fully scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I prayed that the Lord would give me signs, and I received several.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now I am clear that what I am planning to do is of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts 5:29 says that it is necessary to obey God rather than men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not pressure me; let me go.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You are merely men, and I must obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If anyone holds this attitude, he is deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church life is the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If our body remains in the United States, our hand cannot say, I am clear to go to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I must obey this feeling and not the body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In principle, this is what some of us have done in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the Body does not share our feeling, we should say, Praise the Lord, I am enjoying the Body-Christ, not an individual Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do this, we will be safeguarded.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Body is a real safeguard to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the past I sometimes felt that the brothers were too slow to understand the Lord s will and that as long as I was clear, I could go on without them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, however, I realized that this was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is to be individualistic and not to care for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all need to learn the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should never do things in the church life in an individualistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must always be checked by the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whatever the Body says is better, and if the Body does not agree, we should not go ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the Body will be our safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As long as we take care of the Body, we are fully protected.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Not Dealing with Others</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>to Correct or Adjust Them, but Ministering</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>the Life Supply through Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the church life we should also avoid dealing with others in the way of correcting or adjusting them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we realize that some brothers are wrong in some matter, we may think that we have a burden from the Lord to charge them to repent and change their attitude and way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This never works.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What we have in our physical body is simply the circulation of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The circulation in the Body of Christ is fellowship, not dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we feel that some brothers are wrong and are even causing a loss to the Body, we should not go to them to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should pray to the Lord again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we may have the deep sensation from the Lord to fellowship with some other brothers, pray for the needy ones, and seek the Lord s leading together.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Eventually, we may contact the ones who are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At this time we should not touch their mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to leave their mistakes to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then after several contacts, we can fellowship with them about the needs.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is to keep the circulation of blood in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The circulation of blood carries nourishment, and within this nourishment are the elements that spontaneously kill and discharge the germs.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Perhaps after several times of fellowship, they may mention their problem to us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At that time we still should not touch their problem too much.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should only say a little, ministering life to them on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may not even know at what point the disease is healed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Simply by our fellowship we bring the circulation of life again and again until the problem is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then they may testify, Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our problem is gone and under the Lord s blood.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Death will be swallowed up by life even if we never talk to them about their mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To deal with people never works.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What we always need in the church life is fellowship, the circulation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After a short time in the church life, a young brother may still have his old, improper appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should not go to tell him, Brother, you need to know that in the church we should not look like this.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is to deal with him in a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Rather, we should pick up a burden for that brother and go to him with one or two others for the purpose of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>While we are fellowshipping with him, the Holy Spirit, the life within, will speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then after we leave, he may go to adjust his appearance, and in the next meeting we will see a new shining face.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We may be surprised at the Lord s transforming work in this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The brother will not have a mere outward correction.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He will have transformation out of the life supply he received through our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we deal with a new one wrongly, we will damage the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should simply pick up the burden to fellowship with that one.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>All the Members Functioning</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>to Fellowship in Life and by Love</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The denominations in Christianity depend on one or a few pastors, but in the Lord s Body we do not need that kind of pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Instead, we need the fellowship of all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>All the members are the promoters, not of correction but of the circulation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As long as life circulates among us, it will regulate, transform, and shape us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Therefore, we should not go to people to correct them.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We must put our trust in the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We should always go to our fellow members to fellowship with them in life by love.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is a daily work.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Day after day we will see the growth, transformation, and wonderful change in all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In this way we will remain on the proper ground of oneness with the necessary fellowship to enjoy the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is the proper way to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Never Gossiping but</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Treasuring the Precious Body Life</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We must also never gossip or spread any negative word.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Even if we see the shortages or weakness of a certain brother or sister, we can tell it to the Lord, but we should never speak it to anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We need to pray for the members.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Any kind of gossip only spreads death in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Gossip is a spreading of germs to kill the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We must treasure the fact that we are in the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The Body life should be so precious to us that we would not do anything to damage it.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we see some weak points in one another, we should bring the situation to the Lord, pray, and seek the Lord s leading to go to fellowship with the involved parties, not to point out their weaknesses but to minister life so that the life supply will swallow up the weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is the proper way to preserve the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We must be on the proper ground, and we must fellowship again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Then we will enjoy the Body-Christ.</S>
