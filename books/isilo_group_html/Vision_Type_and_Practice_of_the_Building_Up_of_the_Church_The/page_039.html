<p>To say that the tabernacle is the dwelling place of God is a general statement. God did not dwell in the Holy Place; He dwelt in the Holy of Holies. Hence, although we may experience some building in the Holy Place, strictly speaking, we still cannot become His dwelling place. In order for us to become God&rsquo;s dwelling place, we must have the experience of the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>The saints who confess their sins, are forgiven, cleansed, and manifest fine white linen in their conduct are still in the outer court. They are not yet in the tabernacle. They have good conduct but no building. Gradually, these saints will grow and come to know that Christians should not only have good outward conduct but should also know Christ as their inner life and enter into the experience of the mingling of God with man so that they can be blended as one in the divine nature. At this point, God&rsquo;s building will be seen among them, but His presence among them will not yet be complete, for they will not yet have the Ark. To experience Christ as our bread of life, our light of life, and our acceptance into God&rsquo;s presence is to enjoy things from God; it is not our entering into God.</p>
<p>The bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar in the Holy Place correspond to the three items inside the Ark, which was in the Holy of Holies. The hidden manna in the golden pot, the two tablets of the covenant, and Aaron&rsquo;s budding rod were in the Ark (Heb. 9:2-4). The bread of the Presence in the Holy Place corresponds to the hidden manna in the Ark. Christ is the bread of the Presence, our bread of life, and He is hidden in God as the hidden manna. The light of life causes man to know what is right and wrong and is typified by the golden lampstand. The light hidden in God is the inner law of life, which is typified by the two tablets of law inside the Ark. In the same principle, the experience of the acceptable fragrance at the incense altar in the Holy Place corresponds to the budding rod, the resurrection power, in the Holy of Holies, because the budding rod was proof of Aaron&rsquo;s being accepted by God (Num. 17:1-10).</p>
<p>The three pieces of furniture in the Holy Place were manifest. The bread of the Presence was on the table, the light shone from the golden lampstand, and the sweet savor went up from the golden incense altar. This means that the experiences of Christ as the bread of life, the light of life, and the acceptable fragrance are manifest. The experiences in the Holy of Holies, which are deeper, involve the hidden manna, the hidden law, and the hidden resurrection power, as typified by the three items in the Ark. Our experiences of Christ in the Holy of Holies are not manifest but are hidden in God.</p>
<p>Let us use an example to illustrate the difference between the experiences of the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. A brother who lives in the outer court will sense when he is not right and will condemn himself, deal thoroughly with his sins, and adjust his behavior. When he is led by God into deeper experiences of knowing Christ as life, he will realize that to be a Christian is not a matter of outward conduct but of experiencing Christ as his satisfaction, light, and acceptable fragrance before God. He will be filled with joy from such experiences. As a result, he will call hymns, pray, and testify in the meeting, as if he is setting forth the bread of the Presence, shining forth the light of the golden lampstand, and emanating the sweet fragrance of the golden incense altar. His functioning will cause the saints to be satisfied, to be enlightened, and to receive the sweet-smelling savor. However, this is only an experience of the Holy Place.</p>
<p>After a period of time, he will not sense God&rsquo;s presence as before, and his prayers and his eating and drinking of the Lord will lose their taste. He will feel dry instead of watered and will not receive much light from the Word. As a result, in the meeting he will not be able to set forth the bread of the Presence, to shine forth the light of the lampstand, or to emanate the sweet-smelling fragrance. This is the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to lead this brother into the experiences of the Holy of Holies. The three pieces of furniture in the Holy Place are seen, but in the Holy of Holies the three items in the Ark are hidden.</p>
<p>Christ as the bread of life is the bread of the Presence set forth in the Holy Place; He is also the hidden manna in the Holy of Holies. Christ as the light of life is the light of the golden lampstand shining in the Holy Place; He is also the hidden law in the Holy of Holies. Christ as the acceptable fragrance to God is emanating a sweet savor in the Holy Place; He is also the hidden budding rod in the Holy of Holies. Thus, a brother who has deeper experiences in God&rsquo;s presence may not be that excited in the meetings, but those who contact him can immediately sense that he has a supply of hidden manna, that he understands God&rsquo;s heart and ways, and that he has the authority of resurrection and the power of resurrection. These are very practical in him. He may not speak often, but once he opens his mouth, others will sense that he has the hidden manna, the hidden law, and the hidden power and authority of resurrection within him. Such a brother is in the Holy of Holies with God&rsquo;s presence, the Ark, and the throne of grace. This is the practical difference in our experience between the Holy of Holies and the Holy Place.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Type, and Practice of the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 39</div><br></body></html>
