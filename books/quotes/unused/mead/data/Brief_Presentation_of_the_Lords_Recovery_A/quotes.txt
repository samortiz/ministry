[3]  In Jeremiah 2:13 God refers to Himself as the fountain of living waters; in John 4:14 Christ is the spring of water that wells up in the believers unto eternal life; and in Revelation 22:1 the Spirit is the flow, the river of water of life.
[4]  In His resurrection and ascension, Christ became both the Lord of all and the Christ of God Acts 2:36; Rev 11:15 .
[5]  The Spirit is the Holy Spirit Acts 16:6b , the Spirit of God Rom 8:9a , the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7 , the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9b , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19b , and the Spirit of life Rom 8:2a .
[6]  Although I was in Christianity for years, I never heard anyone speak concerning the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[7]  However, the Spirit of Jesus is mentioned clearly in Acts 16:7, the Spirit of Christ is spoken of in Romans 8:9, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ is mentioned in Philippians 1:19.
[8]  By reading these three books, we can see that today the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of God, has become something further: He is the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[9]  The eternal life is the life with which the believers are regenerated and which becomes the believers' life Col 3:4a , making the believers the children of God John 1:12-13 and the members of Christ Eph 5:30 .
[10]  The believers are regenerated in their spirit by the Spirit John 3:5-6 with the divine life, which is Christ Col 3:4a , to be the children of God John 1:12-13 , having the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4b , and to be the members of Christ Rom 12:5 in the union of the divine life.
[11]  The believers have Christ living in them as the pneumatic Christ, the Spirit, indwelling them Rom 8:11 .
[12]  The believers are the branches of Christ as the vine tree, the organism of the Triune God, to express the processed Triune God in bearing fruit for the increase of Christ John 15:1-5, 8, 16 .
[13]  The church is the church of God 1 Cor 10:32 , chosen and predestinated by God the Father Eph 1:3-6 , redeemed by God the Son Eph 1:7-12 , and sealed by God the Spirit Eph 1:13-14 .
[14]  The church is the fullness of Christ, and it is also the fullness of the processed Triune God Eph 3:14-19 , filled with the riches of Christ and with the immeasurable Christ Eph 3:8b, 17-19a .
[15]  The church is the mingling of the processed Triune God with the believers Eph 4:3-6 , being built up as the organic Body of Christ by the gifted members every joint of the rich supply and by each functioning part through the growth in life Eph 4:11-13, 15-16 .
[16]  Following the above six main items of the Lord's recovery, I would like to add two more items, that is, the recovery of the church ground and the recovery of the practice of the local churches.
[17]  Such a oneness was imparted into the spirit of all the believers in Christ, in their regeneration by the Spirit of life with Christ as the divine life; this oneness has become the basic element of the church ground.
[18]  The New Testament presents us a clear picture that all the local churches, as the expression of the universal church the universal Body of Christ are located in their respective cities.
[19]  The third element of the church ground is the reality of the Spirit of oneness, expressing the unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ on the unique ground of locality of a local church.
[20]  The above-defined ground of the church is also the base of the genuine and proper fellowship of all the believers, which is called "the fellowship of the apostles" in the divine revelation Acts 2:42 , a fellowship that is with the Triune God and with all the members of Christ 1 John 1:1-3 .
[21]  The church of God, as the living Body of Christ, needs the local churches for its existence and function.
[22]  The administration of a local church should not be under the control of any high church.
[23]  A local church is built up by the functioning of all its members with the perfecting of the gifted persons, such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers Eph 4:12 , through:
[24]  The gifted persons carry out their ministry in perfecting all the members of a local church in a locality, that all the members of that local church will be able to do what the gifted persons can do Eph 4:12 in the above-mentioned four items, for the building up of that local church, issuing in the building up of the universal Body of Christ.
[25]  Actually, the building up of the local churches is the building up of the Body of Christ, because the local churches are the Body of Christ as its expression.
[26]  A SUPPLEMENTARY WORD I. THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CHURCHES
[27]  As we have seen in this book, the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine revelation concerning eight basic and major items: God, Christ, the Spirit, the eternal life, the believers, the church, the proper ground of the church, and the practice of the local churches.
[28]  The fellowship of the Body of Christ is very similar to the circulation of the blood in our body.
[29]  We have been enlightened to see that Christ has a Body and that we are members of His Body, that is, members of Christ Himself.
[30]  If we do not understand the church as the Body of Christ, we should simply look at our own body.
[31]  Individually, we are members of the Body of Christ, and all the local churches are parts of this one unique Body of Christ.
[32]  Ephesians 4:4-6 depicts a oneness that is universal: "One Body and one Spirit, as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."
[33]  Some brothers may be afraid for others to come and visit them.
[34]  But what we need today among the churches is more divine circulation, more fellowship.
[35]  It seems that there is no problem with the universal fellowship of the Body of Christ; however, when we put this fellowship into practice, immediately it becomes a local fellowship, the fellowship of the local churches.
[36]  The local churches, which are the expressions of the unique Body of Christ, are scattered on this earth in the localities where the local churches exist to express the Body of Christ.
[37]  Every local church should receive all kinds of genuine believers in Christ Rom 14:1-6; 15:1-7 .
[38]  The third thing for which a believer can be kept away from the fellowship of a local church is the committing of gross sins and living in these sins, not being willing to repent of them and forsake them 1 Cor 5:9-13 .
[39]  But once such a one would repent and forsake his sins, the church should forgive him and receive him into the fellowship of the church, that we may not be taken advantage of by Satan 2 Cor 2:5-11 .
[40]  The title "the church of God" denotes not only that the church belongs to God, but also that the church must have the nature of God.
[41]  The genuine oneness of the Body of Christ must be practiced with the unique ground of locality within the limit of the boundary and jurisdiction of the locality in which a church exists, that is, on the ground of locality, as with the church in Jerusalem Acts 8:1 , the church in Antioch Acts 13:1 , the church in Cenchrea Rom 16:1 , the church in Corinth 1 Cor 1:2 , and the seven churches in the seven cities in Asia Rev 1:11 .
[42]  The second factor of a denomination is a special fellowship based upon a special teaching in a realm narrower than that of "the fellowship of the apostles" Acts 2:42 .
