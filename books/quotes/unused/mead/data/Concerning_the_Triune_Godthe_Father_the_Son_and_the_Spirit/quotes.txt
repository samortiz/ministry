[1]  The Triune God the Father, Son, and Spirit is a mystery, in fact, a mystery of mysteries!
[2]  The Scriptures in many instances and in many ways tell us that God is uniquely one.
[3]  In Isaiah 6:8 God says, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?"
[4]  The matter of the Father, Son, and Spirit is revealed mostly in the Gospel of John.
[5]  He is the God who was from the beginning and who was with God 1:1-2 , equal with God 5:18, 23 , one with the Father 10:30 , come out from God 13:3; 7:29 to express the Father 14:8-9 and live by the Father 6:57 , and finally in the flesh 1:14 as the Lamb of God 1:29 He was crucified and died, shedding His blood for redemption 19:34 .
[6]  The matter of the trinity of the Godhead the Father, Son, and Spirit was already revealed in the Old Testament:
[7]  In Psalm 110:1 David says, "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool" KJV .
[8]  The Lord here, of course, is God, and the One whom David calls "my Lord" is the Lord Jesus, as He Himself indicated in Matthew 22:42-45.
[9]  According to the above passages we also see that: 1 the Father is the source, because the Son proceeds out of the Father; 2 the Son is the manifestation, because the Son is given unto us and comes to us; and 3 the Spirit is the One who enters into us, because the Spirit is put into us for us to possess and enjoy.
[10]  In the Spirit of God we have the Indwelling God: the Power of God dwelling in human body and working in it what the Father and the Son have for us....what the Father has purposed, and the Son has procured, can be appropriated and take effect in the members of Christ who are still here in the flesh, only through the continual intervention and active operation of the Holy Spirit."
[11]  Besides Matthew 28:19 and the Gospel of John, the following places in the New Testament also reveal to us the trinity of the Godhead either implicitly or explicitly:
[12]  Second Corinthians 3:17 says, "The Lord is the Spirit."
[13]  Therefore, according to Darby's realization, verse 17, "The Lord is the Spirit," indicates that the Lord is that Spirit which gives life, as mentioned in verse 6, and this Spirit which gives life, of course, is the Holy Spirit.
[14]  In his book The Spirit of Christ, chapter twenty-five, Andrew Murray says, "It was when our Lord Jesus was exalted into the life of the Spirit that He became 'the Lord the Spirit.'...The disciples knew Jesus long, without knowing Him as the Lord the Spirit....There may in the ministry be much earnest gospel preaching of the Lord Jesus as the Crucified One, without the preaching of Him as the Lord the Spirit....It is as the knowledge and acknowledgement of Christ as the Lord the Spirit, and of the Spirit of Christ as changing believers into His likeness, lives in the Church, that the ministry among believers will be in Life and Power, in very deed, a Ministry of the Spirit."
[15]  Furthermore, 1 Corinthians 15:45 states, "The last Adam became a life-giving spirit."
[16]  The last Adam, of course, is the incarnated Lord Jesus, and the life-giving Spirit, of course, is the Holy Spirit.
[17]  It is easy to read the Bible, but it is not easy to understand it.
[18]  Some may ask the following question: In John 17 the Lord Jesus was praying to the Father if you say the Son is the Father, then how could the Son pray to the Father?
[19]  It is difficult to explain this matter adequately in doctrine, but in our experience it is really so.
[20]  In the first stage of my Christian life, whenever I prayed, according to the general concept, I prayed to the Lord in heaven.
[21]  Second Corinthians 13:14: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship Gk. of the Holy Spirit, be with you all."
[22]  The Scriptures say that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son John 14:10-11, 20 , but the Bible never says that the Son is in the Spirit.
