ON THE FLOW OF THE WATER OF LIFE</h2>
<p>In the New Testament age, our spirit is the Holy of Holies, and God has established His throne of grace in us. In the Son and through the Spirit He dwells in our spirit. Hence, we must turn to our spirit to touch the throne of grace so that He can flow into our spirit and out of our spirit. Thus, all the elements of His divine life will flow into us and out of us. For example, this flow will bring us into His light and cause us to see our filth, corruption, and shortage. Furthermore, we will be enlightened in regard to His plan, His work, His leading, and His will. If we do not allow God to flow in us, it will be difficult to know His leading and will. However, when we let God flow freely in us, we spontaneously touch His feeling and understand His leading. In this flow we receive His cleansing, His dealing, His purifying, and His enlightening. All our spiritual experiences depend upon the flow of the water of life.</p>
<p>Genesis 2 speaks of a river flowing out of the garden of Eden, and gold, bdellium (pearl), and precious stones (onyx) are associated with this flow (vv. 10-12). This shows that the flow brings in gold, pearl, and precious stones. Without a flowing river, there would not be any gold, pearl, or precious stones. If we desire to be filled with these elements, we must allow God&rsquo;s life to flow in us continually through our fellowship with Him. As we fellowship with God by turning to our spirit to pray, by turning to the Holy of Holies to touch Him, there will be a flow in our spirit. All spiritual experiences take place in the fellowship and are perfected in the fellowship. Without such a fellowship, there will be no flow.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES<br />
BEING REALIZED THROUGH PRAYER</h2>
<p>If a person hears the gospel but is not willing to pray, what he hears and what he feels will not become real to him, no matter how much he has been touched. This can be likened to wrapping a package with string but not tying a knot in the string. Without securing the string with a knot, the package will not be secure. A person who hears the gospel but never prays is like an unsecured package. As soon as he encounters some difficulty, all the content in his &ldquo;package&rdquo; will be lost. However, if he prays, &ldquo;O Lord, I am a sinner,&rdquo; his salvation will become firm and secure; he will have a feeling that he has tied a knot. Similarly, when we listen to a message, read the Bible, or read a spiritual book, we must tie a knot by praying about the things that have touched us. If we do not pray, we will be like an unsecured package.</p>
<p>Our spiritual experiences become solid and firm within us when we pray. Consider the experience of consecration. We did not have an experience of consecration merely because we thought about consecration, saying to ourselves, &ldquo;I have been purchased by God, and I belong to the Lord. I should consecrate myself, and I will.&rdquo; Instead, we prayed to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, You purchased me with Your blood, and now I belong to You. I consecrate myself to You.&rdquo; With a few simple words, we &ldquo;tied the knot&rdquo; in the matter of consecration. In the same way, we need to pray in order to deal with our sins. If we do not pray, we will not experience the matter of dealing with our sins. Whenever the Spirit touches us concerning any matter, we need to pray in order to gain the reality of this experience.</p>
<p>We hear messages, read spiritual books, and study the Bible, but we rarely pray. We have not tied many knots in our spirit; as a result, we have not been solidly constituted with spiritual experiences. Many of the messages that we hear reach our mind but do not enter into our spirit. Our problem is not that we need to listen to more messages but that we need to pray more. We have not received the content of the messages we have heard into our spirit because we have not tied the knot with prayer. Some saints have been listening to messages for many years, and even though they have a clear understanding of the truth, their spirit is weak. Their mind has been trained because they exercise their mind to understand, but their spirit is weak because they have not exercised their spirit through prayer. We urgently need to rise up to exercise our spirit by praying more. We must exercise our spirit until it becomes strong, living, and released. Then our spirit will be released when we go to a meeting or to visit the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We have a practice of listening to messages in a meeting, but we do not have a practice of praying with our spirit. This is like participating in a soccer game but not using our feet to kick the ball. There is no benefit if we only look at the ball with our eyes. Similarly, when we come to a meeting, we must exercise our spirit. If our spirit is strong, we will not wait for the scheduled time to begin. As soon as we arrive, we will begin to pray, and those who arrive later will also pray. Moreover, we will not be rigid in the order of the meeting, such as singing first and then praying. We will function spontaneously, just like ball players on a soccer field. If our spirits are strong when we come together, we will enter the Holy of Holies, release our spirits, touch the throne of grace, and lift up our holy hands to pray (1 Tim. 2:8). When our spirits are exercised to this extent, we will enjoy the normal service of the priesthood.</p>
<p>When we come to a meeting today, however, our spirit is often dormant. When it is time for the meeting to begin, there are more empty seats in the front than in the back. This is not a normal situation. When we come to a meeting, we should be like ball players who are eager for an opportunity to play. Regrettably, our meetings are just the opposite. We have a habitual pattern, and it is not easy for us to change. Unless a person is leading us in the meeting, our spirits seemingly are on vacation. Many of us are only spectators, and it is as if we are watching a show in a theater. If this is our condition, those whom we bring to salvation will be just like us. Many Christians are in such a desolate condition that they cannot pray, and they are unwilling to pray. If this is our situation, how can God flow among us? How can God accomplish anything He desires among us? It is a basic principle in the New Testament that God only works by flowing through man and by working together with man.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 51</div><br></body></html>
