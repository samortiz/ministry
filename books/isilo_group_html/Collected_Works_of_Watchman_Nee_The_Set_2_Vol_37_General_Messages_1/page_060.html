In Isaiah 49:5 we see the work of the Lord on earth. Verse 4 tells us whether the Lord's work on earth was successful. What was God's purpose in sending the Lord Jesus to the earth? It was for the purpose of turning the house of Jacob back to God, to gather them to Him. But what was the result? Did he succeed? According to man's view, our Lord failed completely. The house of Jacob did not turn to Him, and the Israelites rejected Him, denied Him, and crucified Him on the cross. Even one of His disciples betrayed Him. This is why verse 4 says, "But I said, I have labored in vain;/I have used up my strength for nothing and vanity." Brothers and sisters, in these circumstances&mdash;being despised by men on earth, with no result in the work, and seemingly having accomplished nothing for God's will&mdash;we surely would have wept in sorrow. Even if we had not wept, we surely would have been sad, and even if we had not been sad, at the very least, we would have become passive. But our Lord was different. After He said, "I have labored in vain;/I have used up my strength for nothing and vanity," He said, "Yet surely the justice due to me is with Jehovah,/And my recompense with my God." Although He did not gain what He hoped for and missed what He yearned for, His justice was with Jehovah. Although He had labored much and there did not seem to be any result in the work, His justice was with Jehovah. In other words, whether or not He was treated justly was something up to Jehovah. "My recompense [is] with my God." Although He could not obtain anything from the house of Jacob or from the Israelites, He would receive His reward from the Lord. Therefore, He was satisfied; He did not complain, weep, or grieve. This is the Lord's attitude.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, this shows us one thing&mdash;we cannot be directly related to our work; we can only be directly related to God. We cannot be directly connected to affairs or people; we can only be directly connected to God. Whenever we are directly related to work, affairs, and people, we will feel hurt, weep, and suffer as soon as we encounter difficulties and adversities. But if we are directly related to God, we will rejoice when we are rejected. Even when difficulties arise and everything seems to have failed, we will be able to rejoice. If we are directly related to God, no success or failure will touch us. We will only care for one thing&mdash;whether or not the justice due to us is with the Lord and whether our recompense is with Him. If our justice is with the Lord, our recompense will be with Him also.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>Matthew 11 speaks of the Lord's experience and attitude on earth; it matches the record of Isaiah 49. The entire chapter is about heartbreaking matters. First, John the Baptist sent his disciples to ask the Lord Jesus: "Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?" (v. 3). This meant: "Are You the Messiah? Are You the Christ?" The forerunner of Jesus was now in doubt as to whether He was the Coming One! According to man, this was a very disappointing response.</p><p>John the Baptist came neither eating nor drinking, and men said that he had a demon. The Son of Man came eating and drinking; He came among men, communicated with men, and desired to save men. No one should have had anything to say about Him, yet they said that He was a gluttonous man and a drunkard. One group criticized people both for eating and for not eating; they always had something to say one way or the other. Another group had a lust for talking; they always found things to criticize no matter what our Lord did. They could always find something to say about Him. The Lord's forerunner was reviled as being possessed by demons, and the Lord Jesus was criticized as being a gluttonous man and a drunkard. He performed many miracles in Capernaum, Bethsaida, and Chorazin. But in the end, the people of Capernaum would not receive Him, and the men of Chorazin and Bethsaida rejected Him. Everything in Matthew 11 shows us the Lord as One who was distrusted, reviled, and rejected.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, what would you do if you encountered such a series of difficulties in your life, your work, or among your acquaintances? You would inevitably feel heartbroken and discouraged; you would feel that everything was over. But our Lord was different. The Bible speaks of His attitude: "At that time Jesus answered and said, I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight" (vv. 25-26). "At that time" means at that very moment. Under these circumstances and at the moment that He was doubted, reviled, and rejected, our Lord was able to say, "I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth." He had no bitterness, hatred, indignation, or wrath in His heart, and He could say, "I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth." Brothers and sisters, when you are being doubted, reviled, and rejected without a cause, can you extol the Lord? The time to extol Him is not when we gain something. The time to extol Him is not when our work is prosperous and we are welcomed and admired by many. We should extol Him when we are being doubted, reviled, and rejected for no reason. Brothers and sisters, can you extol Him at such times?</p><p>Our Lord extolled God here. What did He say? He said, "I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants." Here is the greatest comfort: "Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight." Since it was well-pleasing in the Father's sight, what more need be said? For the Lord Jesus, it was well-pleasing in the Father's sight for John to doubt Him. It was well-pleasing in the Father's sight for others to criticize Him as a gluttonous man and a drunkard. It was also well-pleasing in the Father's sight for the men of Capernaum, Bethsaida, and Chorazin to reject Him. He was satisfied with whatever was well-pleasing in the Father's sight. Therefore, He could say, "I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth." Many times, we cannot say, "Father." It seems as if we no longer believe that our God is our Father. Yet our Lord could say, "Father." He still felt that the Father was very near to Him. We often cannot say, "Lord of heaven and of earth." It seems as if we no longer believe that there is a Lord in heaven and on earth. Yet our Lord was satisfied with whatever was well-pleasing in the Father's sight. Therefore, He could say, "Father, Lord of heaven and of earth." He saw that everything was according to the Father's good pleasure. Therefore, He could say, "Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight." Brothers and sisters, can you say, "Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight"? Are you sorrowful, sad, and heartbroken just because you are misunderstood and facing difficulties? Can you utter a word of thanksgiving as a result of satisfaction in God's good pleasure? Can you say to God, "Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight"? Brothers and sisters, can you say this?</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 37: General Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 60</div><br></body></html>
