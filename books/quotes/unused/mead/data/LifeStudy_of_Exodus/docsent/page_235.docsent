   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE MURDER AND THE LYING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITHIN MAN SIGNIFYING THAT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE DEVIL, THE SOURCE OF MURDER AND</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE FATHER OF LIES,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>IS WORKING IN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The murder and the lies within man signify that the Devil, the source of murder and the father of lies, is working in fallen man 21:14; 23:1-2; John 8:44; 1 John 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We know from John 8:44 that the Devil is the source of murder and the father of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that if we have murdering and lying within us, the Devil is working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because the Devil works in fallen man, it is very easy for people to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Children lie automatically, without being taught to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may lie not only in words, but also by gestures and facial expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lying is a sign of the Devil living and working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Fallen men are liars because, according to the natural life, we are all children of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually Exodus 23:1 does not use the word lie.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead, this verse speaks of raising a false report.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Spreading rumors and raising false reports may be even worse than lying.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As long as a person has murdering and lying within him, the Devil, the source of murder and the father of lies, is working in him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we trace murder and lies to their source, we shall find the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>V. ONE WHO SLAYS A PERSON BY ERROR</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>SIGNIFYING THAT IN THE EYES OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>FALLEN MAN IS A SINNER BY MISTAKE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>WHO MAY FLEE INTO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Exodus 21:13 says, And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that one who kills another by mistake has the right to flee for refuge into a place appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that, in the eyes of God, fallen man is a sinner by mistake and may flee into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He prayed, Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing Luke 23:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This prayer opened the way for God the Father to come in and forgive mistaken sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All those who are sinners by mistake are qualified to flee into Christ as the city of refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How wonderful that God may look upon us as mistaken sinners and provide us with Christ as our city of refuge!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Are you a sinner by mistake, or are you a willful sinner?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Your repentance toward God indicates that you are a sinner by mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you are a willful sinner, why did you repent?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To repent means that you confess you are wrong and are sorry for it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Any sinner who repents is a mistaken sinner, one who can be graciously forgiven by God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to 21:14, a person who killed another willfully had to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This verse says, But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that willful sinners must perish.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who perish do so because they refuse to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The fact that a certain person does not repent indicates that he is not a mistaken sinner, but is a willful sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a person repents, God will regard him as a sinner by mistake and will forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Such a one may flee into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if anyone refuses the gospel and does not repent, God will regard him as a willful sinner, one destined to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whether you are a mistaken sinner or a willful sinner is determined by whether or not you repent.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 21:13 and 14 we see a precious matter related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is implied in 21:13.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was the One delivered into the hands of mistaken sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If God had not delivered the Lord Jesus into the hands of the Jews and Romans, the Lord would not have been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After God delivered Him into the hands of those who crucified Him, the Lord Jesus prayed for the ones to whom He had been delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He asked the Father to forgive them, because they did not know what they were doing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It seemed that God the Father said in reply, Yes, it was I who delivered You into their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now I am ready to answer Your prayer by forgiving them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, according to what is indicated by 21:13, Christ is the One delivered into the hands of mistaken sinners and killed by them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We killed Christ, but we killed Him by mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God delivered Christ to us sovereignly, and we mistakenly put Him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, 21:13 not only indicates Christ; it also indicates you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to this verse, we who killed Christ by mistake may now flee into Him as our city of refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Saul of Tarsus was one who killed Christ by mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When he was persecuting the believers, the Lord Jesus appeared to him and said, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Acts 9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To Saul s understanding, he was persecuting Stephen and other believers, not the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The very fact that Saul asked the Lord who He was implies that he was persecuting Him by mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He did not realize what he was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For this reason, he could say of himself in 1 Timothy 1:13, Who formerly was a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insulting destructive person; but I obtained mercy because being ignorant I acted in unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In ignorance and by mistake, Saul persecuted the believers and blasphemed God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But God forgave him and opened the gate into Christ as the city of refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What good news that mistaken sinners can flee into Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Exodus 21:13 is the unique verse in the Bible indicating that God delivered the Lord Jesus into the hands of mistaken sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Acts 2:23 we are told that Christ was delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, and Romans 4:25 says that He was delivered for our offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But these verses do not say to whom He was delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Only in 21:13 do we see that God delivered the Lord Jesus into our hands to be killed by our mistake.</S>
