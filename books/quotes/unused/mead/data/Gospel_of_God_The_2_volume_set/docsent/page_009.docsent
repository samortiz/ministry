   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Among all the sins, there is one which tops the list.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This one sin brings in all sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By this one sin, all other sins follow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible says that sin entered into the world through one man Rom 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I want to ask you, What sin did that one man commit?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Was it fornication, theft, murder, arson?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There were no such things in Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the evil, filthy, and terrible things that happen in the world today come from one incident involving Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But what did Adam do?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Adam did not murder; he did not commit fornication; he did not commit any of the evil and filthy sins in the world today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The sin that Adam committed was simple and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Adam thought that God was holding one thing back from him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He thought that if he were to eat of the fruit of that tree, he would be like God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The sin that Adam committed was actually a problem that developed between him and God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God expected Adam to be standing on his proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But Adam did not believe that what God had given him was profitable for him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He began to doubt the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A problem developed concerning the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Adam did not commit that many sins in this incident.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He did not gamble; he did not set his eyes on evil things in the streets; he did not read evil books.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Adam's sin was a problem that arose between him and God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Following that, many sins came.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once Adam sinned in this way, all kinds of sins followed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sins are after their kind, and they all come one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, the first sin was not the sin that we would have thought.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first sin was the unique sin in the Old Testament, the sin of not loving God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After a problem developed between man and God, problems among men began to develop.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the garden of Eden, a problem developed in man; then, outside the garden of Eden, the older brother murdered the younger, and all kinds of sins followed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, we see that sins did not begin in a serious and filthy way, as we might imagine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible shows us that sins began with something very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But actually the first sin was the most serious one a problem between man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we look into the New Testament, we see the Lord Jesus saying many times that he who believes has eternal life John 3:15-16, 36; 5:24; 6:40, 47; 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are probably fifty or more times that the Lord indicates that he who believes has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who then are those who will perish?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Is it the murderers who will go to hell?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is it the fornicators who will perish?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Is it those who have filthy thoughts and improper behavior who will go into perdition?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not necessarily.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Gospel of John tells us again and again that it is those who do not believe who are condemned John 3:16, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who do not believe have the wrath of God upon them always John 3:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus said that the Holy Spirit came that the world would be convicted concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment John 16:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why concerning sin?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Is it because you have gone to the movies lately?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Is it because you have gambled lately?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Is it because you have murdered someone or have committed arson?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No. "Concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me" John 16:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The greatest difficulty we have today is that we consider filthiness sin, but we do not pay much attention to the Lord's word to see what God considers sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord said that he who does not believe has been condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The reason man commits all his sins is that he does not have a proper relationship with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the Old Testament, it was when man lost his proper relationship with God that all kinds of sins were committed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the New Testament, it is when man loses the proper relationship with the Lord Jesus that all kinds of sins are committed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Here lie all the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While you are sitting here tonight, you may think that even though I have proven that you are a sinner, you really have not committed very many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But no one in the whole world can say that he has not committed the sin of not loving God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Neither is there anyone in the whole world who can say that he has not committed the sin of not believing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For this reason, no one can say that he is not a sinner.</S>
