<p>Leviticus 12:3 says, “On the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.” To be circumcised is to be cut; it is to have that part of our being which is condemned in the sight of God cut off. Actually, our entire being should be circumcised, cut off. For our whole being to be circumcised is for it to be put to death.<p>We were born uncleanness, which is good only for death. In our first course we were good for nothing but death. This was the reason John the Baptist commanded people to repent (Matt. 3:1-2). John then baptized, put into death, those who repented (vv. 5-6). To be baptized is to be buried. When we repented, our whole being was cut off, put to death, and then it was buried. According to Colossians 2:11-12, our baptism was our circumcision. Therefore, to be circumcised simply means to be put to death and buried.<p>Our being in the first course had to be terminated by being cut off and buried. This happened on the eighth day, the day of resurrection. The old man, the man in the first course, was terminated by death. In typology, in figure, this death is signified by circumcision. This is why, in the Old Testament, according to God’s dispensation, God’s economy, every male had to be circumcised on the eighth day. This is a type signifying that everyone should be terminated, cut off, and that this termination should take place in the resurrection of Christ. This is according to God’s economy.<p>In Adam we were born into the first course, but in Christ we were reborn into the second course. Our first course started when we were born, and our second course started when Christ was resurrected. When Christ was resurrected, we were resurrected with Christ and in Christ (Eph. 2:5; 1 Pet. 1:3). This means that with us the second course started before the first course. We were resurrected in Christ before we were born in Adam. It is a wonderful fact that before we were born we had already been resurrected.<p>Our salvation is the greatest miracle in the universe. Before the foundation of the world, we were chosen and predestinated in Christ (Eph. 1:4-5). In eternity we were destined to be in Christ. Then, in time, we were born, and eventually we became believers. Now we are in Christ.<p>God in His economy determined that we would have a new start through Christ’s death and by His resurrection. Christ’s death was a knife that cut off our entire being. After being put to death by Christ’s death, we were regenerated in His resurrection. Thus, we have the eighth day as a new start, and we are now in the second week.<p>We have pointed out that circumcision signifies that the flesh of an unclean person is put aside through the death of Christ that he might be brought into the resurrection of Christ, not only to be cleansed but also to have a new beginning of life. The flesh is our entire being. The Bible regards fallen human beings as flesh (Rom. 3:20). Our flesh has been put aside by the death of Christ, that is, by the cross. As a result, we have been brought into the resurrection of Christ, not only to be cleansed but also to have a new beginning of life.<p>In your reading of Leviticus 12, have you ever realized that this chapter indicates that we have been put to death and then put into the resurrection of Christ? Our being put to death is indicated by the word “circumcision,” and our being put into the resurrection of Christ is indicated by the words “the eighth day.” Circumcision signifies the cross of Christ, and the eighth day signifies the resurrection of Christ. In our first course we were born in uncleanness and into uncleanness; we were even born uncleanness. But in God’s salvation we have experienced the eighth day, which has brought us into a new course. This is the new beginning that we have in Christ.<p>We need enlightenment and also the spiritual sight to see Christ in chapter twelve of Leviticus. With the light and the sight we shall have a clear view of Christ in this chapter. The word “Christ” is not found in Leviticus 12, but there are indications that Christ is here. Christ died for us to terminate our first course and, on the eighth day, to begin our new course in His resurrection.
