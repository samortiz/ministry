        <h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH MATERIAL RICHES</h2>
<p>In Matthew 6:21 the Lord explained why we need to store up treasures in heaven: &ldquo;Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s teaching concerning material riches is not merely a matter of our material riches being consumed by moth and rust or being stolen by thieves; it is a matter of our heart. Material riches attract our heart. Wherever our treasures are, there will our heart be also. If we store up our treasures on the earth, it will be extremely hard for our heart to mind the things in heaven. As a result, instead of submitting to the authority of the heavens, we will live outside the kingdom of the heavens. The Lord wants us to live in the kingdom of the heavens and to submit to the authority of the heavens; therefore, our heart must be on the things in heaven. Our treasures must be in heaven.</p>
<p>In verses 22 through 23 the Lord said, &ldquo;The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light; but if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!&rdquo; Just as our eye is the lamp of our body and can make our body full of light or full of darkness, so also our heart is a lamp that determines whether there is light or darkness within us. If our heart is set on earthly treasures, then our heart is covered, and we are full of darkness. Hence, material riches cause our heart to be full of darkness.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.&rdquo; The children of Israel could not see, because there was a problem with their heart. However, whenever their heart turned to the Lord, the veil on their heart was taken away. Hence, in Matthew 5 the Lord said, &ldquo;The pure in heart...shall see God&rdquo; (v. 8). To be pure in heart means to be single and focused in one&rsquo;s heart. In 6:22 the Lord said, &ldquo;If therefore your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light.&rdquo; Our eyes cannot look at two things at the same time. If we try to look at two things at the same time, our vision will be blurred. If we love the Lord and also love mammon, our eye will not be single, and we will be full of darkness.</p>
<p>Verse 24 says, &ldquo;No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.&rdquo; This verse speaks of service. Whatever our eyes focus on and our heart desires becomes what we serve. Some people want to love the Lord and the world at the same time. On the one hand, they serve God, but on the other hand, they also serve material riches. The Lord said that we cannot serve God and mammon. If we love God, we have to leave material riches behind. If we continue to carry material riches with us, God will leave us. For this reason, the Lord spoke emphatically in this section concerning material riches. If we want to follow the Lord in a proper way and learn to live in the kingdom of the heavens, we must thoroughly deal with our attitude toward material riches. Those who do not thoroughly deal with material riches cannot live properly in the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING ANXIOUS ABOUT CLOTHING AND FOOD</h2>
<p>Many people store up treasures for themselves and serve mammon because they want to take care of their living; they worry that there might not be something to eat, to drink, or to put on. The Lord touched these practical matters to teach us not to be anxious about these things. He said, &ldquo;Do not be anxious for your life, what you should eat or what you should drink; nor for your body, what you should put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body than clothing?&rdquo; (v. 25). The Lord wants us to consider: If God can give us life, can He not give us food? If God can give us a body, can He not give us clothes? Since God has given us life and a body, He will surely give us the food that our life needs and the clothes that our body needs. In verse 27 the Lord asked, &ldquo;Who among you by being anxious can add one cubit to his stature?&rdquo; Even though these things are small in God&rsquo;s eyes, they are not in our hands. Therefore, it is useless for us to be anxious about them.</p>
<p>In verse 26 the Lord asked us to look at the birds of heaven: &ldquo;They do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father nourishes them.&rdquo; In verses 28 and 29 He asked us to consider the lilies of the field: &ldquo;They do not toil, neither do they spin thread. But...not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.&rdquo; We are of much more value than the birds of heaven and the lilies of the field. So why should we fear that God would not nourish us?</p>
<p>In verses 31 through 33 the Lord said, &ldquo;Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed? For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.&rdquo; The Lord said that we should not be anxious about our food or our clothing. God gave us our life and our body. The length of our life and the stature of our body are ordained by God. Hence, He will surely prepare food to nourish us and clothes to cover us. The Gentiles are anxiously seeking these things, because they are like orphans who do not have a heavenly Father, but we have God as our Father. He knows our every need. Therefore, we do not need to be anxious about these things. We need only to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to us.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
