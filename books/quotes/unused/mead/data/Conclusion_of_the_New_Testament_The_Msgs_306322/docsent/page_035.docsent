   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE EPISTLES 23 41.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Image of God and the Treasure</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second Corinthians 4:4-7 shows that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the image of God and the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The image of God refers to Christ as our outward expression, whereas the treasure refers to Christ as our inward content.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should bear Christ as the image of God without, and we should have Christ as the treasure within.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to enter into the rich and full enjoyment of this Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>a. The Image of God</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 2 Corinthians 4:4 Paul speaks of Christ, who is the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The image of God is a subject that concerns a great many Bible teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is exceedingly difficult to understand and to define the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Twice the New Testament tells us that Christ is the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Aside from the aforementioned verse, Paul refers to Christ as the image of God also in Colossians 1:15.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The expression the image of the invisible God implies that although God Himself is invisible, His image is visible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The invisible God has a visible image, and this image is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John 1:18 says, No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that Christ, the only begotten Son of God, came to man to express what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ being the image of God means that He is the expression of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although God is invisible, He is expressed by a living person, that is, Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This living person as the expression of God is the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>1 The Illumination of the Gospel of His Glory</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Shining in the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 2 Corinthians 4:4 Paul says that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine on them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This verse indicates that the terms God, image, Christ, glory, gospel, and illumination are all in apposition to one another; thus, they all refer to the same wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is the image, the image is Christ, Christ is the glory, the glory is the gospel, and the gospel is the illumination.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, the expression the image of God shows that the image is in apposition to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God, who is the source, has an image, and this image is simply God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we see the image of God, we see God; if God disappears, His image disappears as well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since in verse 4 the image and God are in apposition to each other, they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the image of God is nothing less than God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second, as we have pointed out, the image of God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As the image of God, Christ is the expression of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Third, Christ is the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is confirmed by Hebrews 1:3, which says that Christ is the effulgence of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Fourth, Christ, the glory, is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Acts tells us that the believers preached Christ Jesus as the gospel 5:42; 8:35; 11:20; 17:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This shows that the gospel is not something separate from Christ; rather, Christ is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today some Christians in their preaching separate the gospel from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But according to the divine revelation in the Bible, the gospel is a living person, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ who is the gospel is the image of God, and the image of God is God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, the gospel is God Himself embodied and expressed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Fifth, the gospel is the illumination, the enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The gospel is the gospel of the glory of Christ, which illuminates, radiates, and shines in the heart of man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the gospel came to us, it came to us by shining, and this shining brought into us Christ, who is the image of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a result, Christ, the living person, was illuminated into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many believers can testify that when they heard Christ as the gospel, a certain impression of Christ entered into them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although they may try to reject this impression of Christ or erase it from their being, they cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once the impression of Christ is illuminated into us, it remains within us forever.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This illumination is the gospel, this gospel is the glory, this glory is Christ, Christ is the image of God, and as such, Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, what has been illuminated into our being is a living person, the Triune God embodied in Christ, who is the image, the expression, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, we need to see that the gospel of the glory of Christ first shines into us, and then it shines out from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more the glory shines within us, the more it penetrates into our being and saturates it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Eventually, the inner glory will consume, swallow up, our entire inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ will shine out through us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Such a shining cannot come by way of teaching; it can come only through the experience of Christ who is Himself the glory of God and the manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We praise the Lord that Christ has shone into the depths of our being, that now He is shining within us, and that He will shine throughout our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, we need to pay attention to the inner shining of Christ as the glory within.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The goal of God s economy is that we all shine forth His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As we are under such a shining, Christ saturates us with Himself, and we enjoy the sweetness of Christ living in us to be our life and our person.</S>
