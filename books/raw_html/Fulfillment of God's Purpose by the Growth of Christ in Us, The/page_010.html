<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE WAY TO HAVE THE GROWTH<br>OF CHRIST WITHIN US</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 3:6-7; Mark 4:14-20; Eph. 4:15, 13m; 2:21; 1 Pet. 2:2-3, 5; Col. 2:19; 2 Pet. 1:1, 3-4; 3:18; 2 Cor. 3:17-18</H1><P>We have seen that God, Christ, the Spirit, and the Word are all life to us. Furthermore, we have seen that the way to take in God is by contacting the Spirit and the Word through calling on the Lord in prayer. This is the spiritual breathing, drinking, and eating. We eat by drinking, drink by breathing, and breathe by calling on the name of the Lord. Whenever we call on the Lord by praying and reading the Word, we take the Lord into us. The Lord today is in the Spirit and in the Word, and He even is the Spirit and the Word. Both the Spirit and the Word are the breath of God. The Spirit is the pneuma, the breath, and the Word is God's divine breath. So the way for us to take in the Word and the Spirit is to breathe, and the way to breathe is to call on the Lord. This is so clear and simple, yet so real and rich.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GROWTH OF LIFE</H2><P>In this chapter we want to go on to see that life grows. Anything living always grows, and growth is the issue of life. There is always some issue that comes out of life. The first issue of life is growth. All forms of life&#151;the human life, animal life, and vegetable life&#151;exhibit growth. The divine life is the same. The divine life is the highest life, the life on the highest plane. Because the divine life is the highest life, it has the highest growth.</P><P>Paul said, "I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth" (1 Cor. 3:6). I wish to say a word to all the dear ones who are serving the Lord. We have to listen to the apostle Paul. He said, "I planted." He did not say, "I taught." With mere teaching nothing grows. But anything planted is something of life. With life there is growth. So we Christian workers have to learn not to merely teach, but to plant.</P><P>Paul also said that Apollos watered. Today among the Christians teaching and edification are spoken about. But how many speak about our need to be watered? We need to water the brothers, not merely edify them. The brothers need the watering. The dry plants need the watering. We need to change our terminology from edifying to watering. Brothers, I need your watering.</P><P>If you always come to a plant to edify and correct it, the plant will die. Instead, you should water it. In the same way, we should not try to correct the brothers. Instead, we should water them. In a sense, we should let them be wrong. Just water them. Do not say, "Brother, you shouldn't be like this. You are too much in your anger. You need some correction." If you do this, you will kill him. What he needs is not correction but watering. A brother's anger is like a germ. Sometimes the germ has to come out. If the germ is kept in, it kills. This brother needs to be watered. Christ is life, and life needs the planting and the watering. Christianity today has become a religion. A religion needs teaching and correcting, but Christ is the life. Paul said that he planted and Apollos watered. Following this, God came in to give the growth.</P><P>I am happy to see that many young ones among us are growing. Some came to me with a concern about the young men with long hair and beards who have come to our meetings, but we just need to water them. The more Christ grows within them, the more the long hair and beards will be gone. This is not by teaching but by growth, and the growth needs the watering. Just water people and be patient. Do not correct others in a quick way. That really kills. Water them so that they may grow.</P><P>In a sense, growth is not so fast. The mothers with children know this. Today is about the same as yesterday, and tomorrow will be about the same as today as far as the growth of their children is concerned. When we look at our children day by day, every day they seem to be the same. But praise the Lord, after one year and another year, they are not the same. After a certain period of time, the growth can be seen. Life grows. It seems quite slow, but actually it is really fast. A mother mainly feeds her children, and this is what causes the growth.</P><P>First Corinthians 3:9 says that the church is God's farm, God's cultivated land. The farm, the church, grows Christ. Over the years we have seen the growth of Christ in many dear ones. They have been transformed, not by teaching but by growing. We have to check with ourselves. When we say that we take in Christ as life, what is the issue? Of course, we cannot expect to be full-grown in a quick way, but after a period of time, we should be able to see some difference.</P><P>You have been calling on the Lord for a while, but has there been any growth? If you are still the same as you were six weeks ago, I am concerned for you. If you remain the same, that means there is the shortage of growth. If you eat properly, without any illness, be sure that after six weeks you will show forth your growth. We all need to grow. If we do mean business in calling on the name of the Lord, I am sure that there will be growth. If there is no growth, something is wrong. It is impossible for there to be no issue of growth if we are taking in Christ day by day.</P>
