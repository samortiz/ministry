   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONLY THOSE WHO KNOW GOD CAN TESTIFY FOR GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A testimony is a tremendous matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must realize that the central meaning of testimony is God's declaration of Himself; it declares that God is a God of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to testify of Himself, He came among men and declared what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This testimony is a spiritual fact; it is the ultimate reality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If anyone has not touched this ultimate reality, he has not touched the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Strictly speaking, no one can testify of God, because from eternity to eternity, only God can testify of Himself; God Himself declares who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The testifying that we are speaking of here is different from the testifying that we understand in ordinary terms.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is much that we can say about God; we can testify for God and speak of the kind of God that He is, but our words are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can recite one, ten, or a hundred speeches concerning God, but we must realize that the testimony is not given by man; the testimony is what God tells us about Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, if God does not speak, there will be no testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do you see the significance of this?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If God does not speak, there will be no testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If God does not tell men about Himself, no one can testify for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can talk and speak, but talking and speaking are useless because only we are talking and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If God does not speak, everything is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, I may try to defend someone in court by witnessing for him, and I may be very eloquent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the defendant, however, will not testify or say anything, what are my words worth?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's testimony is His declaration about Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If God does not speak, there is no testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, anyone who testifies for God must touch God and speak what God wants to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A man will not have anything to speak for God until he has known God, seen God, and received revelation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When he touches the ultimate reality, he will have something to say, and he will be able to testify for God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we have not touched this reality, we will have nothing to say, and we will have no testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can convey God's commandments, statutes, and ordinances to others, and we can preach the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But these are not the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The testimony is something else.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even though man can receive ordinances, statutes, and commandments, the testimony remains with God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are outward things, but the testimony, the ultimate reality, remains with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Consequently, Christ needed to come from God to testify for God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Similarly, only the Spirit which proceeds from Christ can testify for Christ, and only those who know this Christ and this Spirit can testify for God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This has nothing to do with what man can say; it is not a matter of his doctrines or his teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is a matter of Christ being released.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The testimony can become a doctrine, but a doctrine can never be the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The testimony can make demands on man, but a demand can never be the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The testimony is something entirely different; it is something absolutely different from what we ordinarily think of as a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We often say that we cannot testify because we do not have the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But even if we have experiences and personal encounters, these things are small in the context of the testimony; they do not fit into the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The testimony is not a matter of experiences and personal encounters, but a matter of touching the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From man's point of view, a testimony is an experience, but terms such as experience and personal encounters are too small; they are not great enough and cannot be compared with the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The testimony is man touching the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only God can testify for Himself, because no one is greater than God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only God can testify for God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The greatest problem in the church is that there are too many doctrines from man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man comes up with many doctrines and biblical teachings; he tells others what they should do, what is scriptural, and what is unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Man pays attention to all these matters, but a genuine testimony touches the ultimate reality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only that which touches God constitutes a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I do not wish to say too much concerning this point, yet I would like all of us to ponder this matter before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brothers and sisters, if we read the Pentateuch and Psalm 119 again, we will realize that God uses the term testimony differently than we do.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A testimony is too great a thing; it is something that our mind cannot fathom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The testimony is the speaking of God concerning Himself and His demands.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those who have touched God's testimony surely have touched God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>OFFENDING GOD BEING TO OFFEND THE TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What does it mean to offend the testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To offend the testimony is to offend God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Anything that touches God's attributes and ways touches God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God intends to express His absolute attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Anything that improperly expresses them or improperly represents them is an offense to God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God is very unforgiving about some things, because they touch His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whenever something touches His testimony, He will not bear with it lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is very uncompromising with anything that improperly expresses Him or that affects His attributes, position, or person.</S>
