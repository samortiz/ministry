   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO AN INTRODUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO THE BOOK OF REVELATION Scripture Reading: Rev 1:1-2, 9; 19:10; 1:12, 20; 21:23; 22:1; 1:14-15</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Revelation may be compared to a jigsaw puzzle which is difficult to put together.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to assemble this puzzle, we need to become familiar with every part of it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A BOOK OF CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to see the subject of Revelation, we must first realize that this book is the conclusion of all the foregoing books of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, it is the conclusion of the books written by the apostle John.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John wrote his Gospels, his three Epistles, and the concluding book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, in order to know the subject of Revelation, we must be very familiar with the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This may be compared to learning arithmetic; in order to understand subtraction, we must first understand addition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the same way, we have to understand the Gospel of John before we come to the last book of the same writer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nearly all the things found in the Gospel of John are consummated in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only so, almost all of the items mentioned in the twenty-one chapters of John s Gospel are found in the New Jerusalem at the end of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, if we do not know the Gospel of John, we cannot know what the New Jerusalem is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Revelation is also the conclusion of the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to understand this book, therefore, we must understand the foregoing twenty-six books.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not understand the first twenty-six books, we are not qualified to understand Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To know what the book of Matthew deals with helps in part to understand Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then to know what Mark deals with is a further help to understand Revelation, and so on with Luke and all the following books.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Third, Revelation is the conclusion of all the sixty-six books of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, in order to understand this book, we have to know all the books written by John, all the books of the New Testament, and all the books of the entire Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nearly every crucial term, clause, and phrase in Revelation is taken from either the Old Testament or the other New Testament books.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must become familiar with all the terms, the phraseology, the terminology, and the titles in the entire Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we have an adequate knowledge of all the Scriptures, we will be qualified to understand Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>CHRIST AS OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>AND THE CHURCH AS HIS EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to know the subject of this book, we must understand what the subject of the entire Scriptures is.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The subject of the entire Scriptures is Christ as our life and the church as His expression or, stated more briefly, Christ and the church Eph 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we have seen, the entire New Testament presents a picture of a universal man, having Christ as the Head and the church as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since the New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old Testament, the entire Scriptures are also a picture of this universal man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is the very life and content of this universal man, and the church is the very expression and manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Revelation as the conclusion of the entire Scriptures has the same subject.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It reveals to us that Christ is the center, the reality, the centrality, and the universality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is the life and the content of the new man, and the church is His expression and manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the beginning of this book there are seven lampstands 1:12, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The seven lampstands symbolize seven local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Each local church is a lampstand to hold a lamp and shine forth the light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Chapter twenty-one tells us that God is the light and Christ is the lamp v. 23 . At the beginning there are the local churches as the lampstands in each locality to hold Christ as the lamp with God as the light.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then at the end of this book there is the ultimate, universal, great lampstand, which is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The New Jerusalem is a city, and the city proper, which is a mountain, is of pure gold 21:2, 16, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the top of this golden mountain there is the throne of God and of the Lamb 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The One on the throne is Christ as the lamp and God as the light within the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the entire city proper is a golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we carefully read chapter twenty-one and the first part of twenty-two, we will realize that the New Jerusalem is a mountain, at the center and top of which is the throne of God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lamb is the lamp, and within Him is God as the light.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This indicates that the entire city of New Jerusalem is a golden lampstand holding Christ as the lamp with God as the light to shine forth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the beginning of Revelation there are local churches as the golden lampstands, and at the end of the book there is the universal, unique lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This shows us that Christ is the very center, the very reality, the life, and the content of the church, which is a composition of the redeemed ones of God as the expression of Christ.</S>
