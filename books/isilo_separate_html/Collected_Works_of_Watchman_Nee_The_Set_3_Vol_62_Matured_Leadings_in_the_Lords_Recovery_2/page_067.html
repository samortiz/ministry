You are the true vine, and we are the true branches of this true vine. We feel that we are not worthy to be joined to You, but thank and praise You that through Your redemption and the shedding of Your blood, we have been joined to You. Thank You! This is Your good will. Lord, lead us to learn to trust You, look up to You, and receive all the rich elements that come from this true vine. May we truly do nothing apart from this vine.</p><p>Lord, thank You for giving up Your most precious life. Today we can have You as our life. Thank You that during this past month You have supplied us with Your word and Your light and have enlightened us in the spiritual pathway through Your servants. Your grace has exceeded our prayer of a month ago. It has exceeded what we thought or hoped for. Indeed this is Your mercy. If it is according to Your will, may we continue to have times of peace together before You. Continue to speak clearer words to us. Grant our brothers stronger and richer words so that our consecration and service can be uplifted. Grant Your servants the light so that we can serve more absolutely. Although there were frustrations from Satan in the past, some of these frustrations are over. How we thank and praise You. You have destroyed all the works of Satan. We join You to oppose all the works of Satan. Thank and praise You! Satan cannot stop us from serving You. He cannot stop us from coming to You to receive grace. Grant us more of Your mercy and grace today. Your servant prays this in the name of Christ Jesus. Amen.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE OF VISITATION</h2><h2 class="head2">First Fellowshipping with the Lord</h2><p>Witness Lee: Visitation is a most spiritual work. It is more spiritual than preaching the gospel, serving in the deacon's office, or various preparation works. Visitation is a kind of fellowship; it is a kind of fellowship with the saints in the divine fellowship we have with the Lord. In visiting others, if we do not have fellowship with the Lord, it will be difficult to have fellowship with the brothers and sisters. In order to have fellowship with the brothers and sisters we visit, we first must establish fellowship with the Lord in our spirit. We fellowship with the brothers and sisters with our outer man, but our inner man remains in fellowship with the Lord. Through this fellowship we bring the ones we visit to the Lord in a good way. Hence, those who visit must live in the presence of the Lord themselves.</p><h2 class="head2">The Need for Definite and Practical Training</h2><p>Next, we need definite and practical training. For example, we have to learn what it means to have a thorough confession. If we have never learned to make a thorough confession, we will not be able to help others have this experience. We may not be lacking in other areas, but as long as we do not have a thorough confession, there is still a lack in us. If we have never thoroughly confessed our sins before the Lord, we cannot help the brothers and sisters whom we visit to experience this in a thorough and definite way. It is only as we have learned this in a definite way that we can render definite help to others. Suppose our English is very good. If we want to test another person's English, we only need to ask him some questions and speak a little in English. Then we will know his ability. But it is only after we have learned English properly that we can test others' standards and identify their problems. In the same way we need a thorough training in spiritual things before we can render help to others. Consider the matter of consecration. If we have a thorough consecration again and again, when we fellowship with others, we will know how strong their consecration is. The same is true with spiritual feelings, the renewing of the understanding, etc. In all these areas first we must learn spiritual experiences in a definite and practical way. Then when we visit the brothers and sisters we can render suitable help to them.</p><p>In Taipei, every Monday beginning at 8:30, I spend the whole morning with the serving brothers and sisters to discuss their visitation work. They present the results of their fellowship. I ask them how they feel about the ones they have visited. Many answer, "Not bad," "Very good," or "Not too good." I pursue the matter by asking, "What do you mean by `not bad'? What do you mean by `very good'? What do you mean by `not too good'? What is `not bad,' what is `very good,' and what is `not too good'?" If a person is zealous, comes to the meetings, prays, and reads the Bible, it does not necessarily mean that he is very good. We have to point out definitely in what way he is good or in what way he is not good. For example, in the matter of reading the Bible, we have to find out the way he reads. Many people have read Genesis. Others have read Romans 6&mdash;8 many times. But they skip over 1 and 2 Kings, 1 and 2 Chronicles, or the genealogy in Matthew 1:1-18. These are sloppy Christians. In visiting the brothers and sisters, we should not only look at their outward condition. We have to touch their real inward, spiritual condition. In order to do that, we must have spiritual learning and acquire spiritual reality first.</p><p>If we truly have had some spiritual experiences and learned some spiritual lessons through pain and sacrifice, we will not easily and carelessly tell others about these lessons. If we practice these things in a definite way, when we visit others we will not speak about prayer, confession, Bible reading, or consecration in a general way without at the same time giving them definite steps to practice. Of course, we have to pay a price for every spiritual lesson. But at the same time we have to learn to receive a supply from one another mutually. For this reason all the brothers and sisters should come together at least once a week. In addition to fellowshipping about the condition of the ones visited, they should also fellowship about various spiritual lessons. They should not allow anything to slip by easily. Everyone should say something definite. He must point out in which area a person is "not too good" and in which area he is "quite good." Everyone should fellowship about the condition of the saints in a definite way. Everyone should present the problems he faces and ask for opinions from the others. If a local church cannot solve a problem, it can write to elderly brothers and sisters in another locality or to another church to ask for help. We can see that this kind of visitation is very demanding. This is the reason I say that we learn the most spiritual lessons through visitation.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> </body></html>
