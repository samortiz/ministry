   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How did we repent?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we heard the preachers telling us of the evilness and loathsomeness of sin and the redemption of the Lord Jesus, we wanted to repent and believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We were not sitting in a corner, telling ourselves how corrupted we were or what sinners we were.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even if we were to repeat this over and over again, this speaking would not make us feel that we were sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Would you feel that you were wrong by merely speaking about it?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No one among us repented this way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we first heard the gospel, we opposed it and criticized it; we did not want to accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we chose to argue, we could have put forth many arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the day that we were saved, the gospel that was preached to us may not have been that prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But while we were there or after we had returned to work, or while we were walking on the street or reading a book, we were convicted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Spontaneously we repented, and then we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We ourselves repented; no one forced us, reminded us, or pressured us to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was God who gave us the repentance, and it was we who said, "I repent."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, this is God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is why the Bible says that repentance is given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Acts 11, after Peter preached the gospel in the house of Cornelius, the Jewish brothers rebuked him for going to the house of a Gentile.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Peter then related to them how he had preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 18 says, "And when they heard these things, they became silent and glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also God has given repentance unto life."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Please notice that God has given the Gentiles repentance unto life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, we see that repentance is a part of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is a part within God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is something done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second Timothy 2:25 says, "In meekness correcting those who oppose, if perhaps God may give them repentance unto the full knowledge of the truth."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many oppose the truth and will not accept God's truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can ask God to give them repentance so that they would come to the knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is also something that God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What then is repentance?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After reading all of these Scriptures, we must draw a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The question of repentance is not as clear-cut as other truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It seems to be quite ill-defined.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, a man is not saved through repentance but through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the truth shown to us by the Gospel of John, the book of Romans, and the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot make any mistake about this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But on the other hand, without repentance a man cannot believe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>So, in our preaching, many times we tell people to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It does not mean that repentance alone will save us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, it means that repentance will bring forth faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a man has not repented, he will not be able to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But repentance is not works.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible says that repentance is given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God tells us to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not sit in a corner thinking that we have to repent, that we have to hate our sins and judge ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to realize that no one can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am afraid no one in the entire world can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even if some are able to do this, it is not worth anything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Repentance is a gift from God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even in the Gospels, when the Lord Jesus came to preach the gospel, not only did He preach forgiveness but repentance as well.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is the One who enables us to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those who repent are the believing ones and the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If there are those here who have not yet been saved and who do not know how to receive God's grace, we must say that God desires to give you grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He desires to give you repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is leading you into salvation through repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Lastly there is another verse telling us that it is God's goodness and kindness that is leading us to repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The last clause of Romans 2:4 says that "God's kindness is leading you to repentance."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May God grant us a spirit of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May God be gracious to us and show us the meaning of repentance and make known to us whether we are saved through repentance or through the Lord Jesus.</S>
