   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If you study the cause of this trouble carefully, you would discover that it had nothing to do with their love for the Lord; every one of them loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The strange thing, however, was that every one of the three or five responsible brothers was narrow-hearted.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They argued over minute details in everything, whether big or small.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sometimes they would argue over the size of the opening for a door at the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, one would say that it should be three feet wide, and another would say that it should be four feet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They were unwilling to yield to each other, and they made themselves very unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Unfortunately, though I sensed a little of their difficulty, I was not yet able to speak a clear word due to my lack of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the same thing were to happen today, I could clearly tell them that it is unnecessary for them to choose the cross or to be broken; all they need is to enlarge their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brothers, there are difficulties in many local churches today because the elders do not have a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, I fully agree that the elders in the different localities should go to visit other places.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those in Taipei should visit Tainan, Kaoshiung, and Hualien.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those in other places should also go out to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once you visit another place, your heart will be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If circumstances allow, it would be even better to travel overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once a man goes out for a visit, his heart will be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is wrong to be proud, and it is wrong to be boastful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is also wrong to strive to be large, but you must learn to enlarge your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It does not mean that to have a large heart is to be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You must still be strict with yourself, yet your heart toward others must be large.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of course, the natural life can never learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Often a natural man will make a pretension of trying to enlarge his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to enlarge our own heart, we need the Lord's abundant grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Please remember that the ability to forgive others is a matter that has to do with the largeness of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The ability to bless the ones who curse us also has to do with a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Your heart must be so large that whenever others offend you, you can forgive them as soon as they confess to you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Though others may persecute you and inflict harm on you, you can still love them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be able to forgive others when they have offended you is something that has to do with a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Oh, the wisdom that comes from a large heart is immeasurable!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In everything we do, it is right for us to be disciplined, and it is wrong to be presumptuous.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the most important thing is that our heart has to be large.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the heart is not large enough, you must prepare yourselves to make mistakes in the future; you will surely eat the fruit of regret.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose a brother asks you to do something today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If your heart is not large enough and you deny his request, you will surely regret it later.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Or, if a brother asks for your forgiveness today, and you would not forgive him due to your narrowness in heart, you will surely regret it later.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, brothers, your heart must be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are narrow persons, but we must learn to enlarge our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you have an argument with a brother, eight or nine times out of ten it is because of the narrowness of your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In these years, I have not met many people with a large heart.</S>
