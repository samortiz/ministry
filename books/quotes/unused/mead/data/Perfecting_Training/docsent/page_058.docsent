   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUT OF THE TRAPS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When you turn to the Lord and begin to seek after Him for certain things, right away you become very active.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You would stay active for quite a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You would be doing things and would be so diligent and so active.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You would consider that other people cannot pray so much, but you can.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Other people cannot read the Bible so much, but you can.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You can finish the schedule; you can do so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yes, you can.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It s not bad.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Don t stop doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But gradually you will see that all your doings are traps.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then you may ask me why I wouldn t encourage you to stop the doings?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you stop the doings, you are in a deeper, bigger trap.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you do the things, you may get yourself into small traps, but if you don t do the things, you will remain in a bigger trap, so comparatively speaking, it is better to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Compared to the big traps these are much better, but compared to the proper and wonderful situation of living Christ, these are frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the traps are frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am not condemning prayer, and I am not condemning Bible study.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These are steps to get you out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the problem is that many Christians never get out of the steps.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are always in the steps and eventually they give up and jump into a big trap.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many of you did have this kind of experience in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>CONVERSING WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What shall you do?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You need to keep seeking after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Keep loving Him, keep contacting Him, but learn all the time not to give Him too many commands.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When you rise up in the morning tell the Lord: Lord, I am here: I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I surely would like to live a life that is one with You.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Lord, I would like to live You, but I am not giving You a command.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And I wouldn t do it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I like it, but I wouldn t do it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Lord, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Try to pray in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then you will see what will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many times the way to contact the Lord is not with a kind of prayer but just a kind of conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You need to converse with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may say that any kind of conversation to the Lord is a kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That is right, but prayer is somewhat different.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Learn to converse with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>See which way would give you more infusion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You may discover that this conversing way would give you a better infusion and more infusion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Learn to tell the Lord: Lord, I m not ambitious in anything except loving You.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I only want You, Lord; I only love You.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whatever You want, I want.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But, Lord, I must tell You regardless of how much I want it, I won t do it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I just won t do it, because I can never make it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I love You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This will be a big field where you can go every day.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You will find that a spontaneous living will come out of you, not by your determination and not by your kind of definite mind or strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE SONG OF SONGS</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When you are in this kind of situation, you will already be saved very much from yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You have to realize your strong seeking after the Lord hides your self.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Your self is subtly hidden in that kind of seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I hope that many of you would get the book, Life and Building in the Song of Songs, and reread it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In that book you can see that step after step the seeker of the Lord was gradually delivered from her own energy in seeking after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>She was very strong and energetic in loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When she first came to the Lord, He likened her to a company of horses in Pharaoh s chariots S. S. 1:9 . She was not seeking after Pharaoh, nor was she riding back to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>She was seeking after the Lord, and she was riding to the Lord, and she reached the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But when the Lord appraised her, He appraised her as a company of horses.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Horses at the time of the writing of that book mainly came from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>So the horse in the Bible, especially in the New Testament, signifies the natural strength that belongs to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Yes, you are seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even now you are seeking to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But in your seeking to live Christ, you are like a company of horses in Pharaoh s chariots.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The second picture of the seeking one in the Song of Songs is a dove 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But even the dove is not so satisfactory.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After the dove comes a lily 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A lily shows that you are living, but that you don t have that much personality.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A horse has an energetic and stubborn personality.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A dove is much better, but still a dove has a character and a living personality.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A lily, though, is living but with no personality.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Eventually, the seeker became a pillar 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This means the seeker becomes nearly nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But don t imitate.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you are a horse and imitate a dove, that is ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you are a dove, and you imitate a lily, that is not so good either.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you are a lily, but you pretend to be a pillar in the air, that doesn t look nice.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the Song of Songs there is a clear picture showing us that the more we grow, the more we lose our character.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>To lose our character means we don t give Him commands.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the first two chapters of Song of Songs, the seeking one always gave the Lord commands.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In other words her seeking after the Lord was under her command and her direction.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>At first the Lord gave in a little bit, but after chapter two the Lord stopped giving in, so she couldn t find the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord trained her and disciplined her to give up her commands and her direction and to pick up the Lord s direction.</S>
