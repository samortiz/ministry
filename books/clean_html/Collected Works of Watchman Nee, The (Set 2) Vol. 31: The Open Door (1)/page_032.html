<h2 class="head2">Two Letters from Sister Huang Ro-chen</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings to Brother Kaung and senior Sister Nee:</p><p>Thank the Lord. He answered your prayer and brought blessing to the work here. The brothers and sisters are going on. Some have only recently received the Lord. We need more of God's children to bear the burden of prayer for the work in Chungshan. Thank the Lord, Kuo Men-ping, a friend of Brother Wu Ai-huei and a shepherd by trade, was clearly saved. Brother X has a real testimony. He is now persuading others to believe in the Lord all the time, and he is bearing the fruit of repentance. Recently, several young people have been coming to the meetings with him every night. May the Lord gain these ones. Sister Jing-sheng and Miss X's four cousins also have a heart to pursue the Lord. Thank Him. Two of them are often scolded by their family. Please pray for them. May the Lord bind Satan and save our sisters from all evil. There are six children who want to receive the Lord, three boys and three girls. The oldest is about thirteen and the youngest about nine. They pray by themselves and come to the meetings often. Thank the Lord. There are five saved sisters in Sha-Yong. Every Tuesday and Friday we meet in Sister Kuo En's home. There is also a group of women who come to the meetings and listen to the gospel but have not been clearly saved. May the Lord save them and cause them to receive salvation soon. Last night we had a prayer meeting in which almost everyone who attended prayed. We also prayed that God would send Mr. Kaung to Chungshan again. We really hope that God would send you here to work again and to lead these brothers and sisters on in the spiritual way. Brothers Wu Ai-huei and Kuo Men-ping brought three friends tonight&mdash;Chen Sheng, Ma Chu-wei, and Kuo Shan-kun. These three have been to the meetings many times. It seems that Chen Sheng and Ma Chu-wei are saved. They also pray at home. Wu, Ma, and Kuo are waiting to be baptized. There are also other women and children who rejoiced when they heard about baptism. If God leads you to come again, please notify us one week in advance. The brothers and sisters greet Brother Kaung. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Huang Ro-chen<br />December 29</p><p>P.S. Miss Kuo greets you.</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Greetings in grace to Sister X, Sister X, and Sister X:</p><p>Thank the Lord for saving sinners in Chungshan. There are more than twenty people, including men, women, and children (many among them appear to be saved). God's provisions are always the best. Miss Kuo's younger brother has an empty three-story house, and she and I have been living in it recently. The meetings every evening and on the Lord's Day morning are in the living room. We have already read more than half of Bible Studies for Beginners. Although the brothers and sisters have produced the fruits of repentance, they do not seem to have dealt thoroughly with sin. May the Lord Himself give grace that they would touch God with us in a deep way. This area is really dark; almost every family worships idols. The brothers and sisters have to be very careful to avoid eating food that has been sacrificed to idols. Some young sisters have been continually scolded by their families. Their futures are difficult. Please remember them in prayer. I often think that God has really graced me richly. I am physically healthy and do not have any difficulty in my environment. Furthermore, there is so much opportunity for me to learn everything. However, I am too wicked and need God's mercy because many times my heart is not sincere before God. May God have mercy on me so that I would always live in the light. Please give me more help and petition for me: "Come, my Savior, and help me,/Comfort, strengthen, and keep me;/Thou each moment wilt save me, /Thou art saving me now." Sister Kuo Hai-jen greets you. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your little sister,<br />Ro-chen<br />January 8<br />[Address omitted]</p>
