[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Anaheim, California from February 21 to June 19, 1992.
[3]  In this series of messages, we want to fellowship concerning the Christian life.
[4]  Such a topic may seem common to us, but I must honestly tell you that to my impression it is very hard to find one believer that knows what the Christian life is.
[5]  To live out Christ, to live by Christ, to live through Christ, to live with Christ, and to live in Christ are not quite the same in meaning as to live Christ.
[6]  A. Christ Being the Center of the Divine Trinity
[7]  As the center of the Divine Trinity, Christ expresses the Father and is realized as the Spirit John 14:10-20 .
[8]  Christ is the eternal life, eternal in time, quality, perfection, and completion, indestructible and incorruptible John 3:36; Heb 7:16b; 2 Tim 1:10b .
[9]  Everyone who believes into the Son, Christ, has eternal life.
[10]  The Christian life is also the life in which the Christians live Christ and magnify Him corporately in their locality as a local church to be a local expression of Christ as a part of the universal Body of Christ.
[11]  The Christian life is not just to live an ethical life with the human virtues, as the salt of the earth and the light of the world, for the glory of God Matt 5:13-16 , but to live a life that is Christ Himself with His divine attributes expressed in His human virtues to be a part of His organic Body for the universal consummation of the eternal economy of God Eph 3:8-11 .
[12]  CHAPTER TWO THE CONTENTS Scripture Reading: John 14:6-20; Matt 28:19; 2 Cor 13:14; Acts 16:7; Phil 1:19b; Heb 9:26, 28; Rom 6:6; Gal 5:24; Heb 2:14; John 12:31; Eph 2:15; Col 1:20; John 12:24; Acts 13:33; 1 Pet 1:3; 1 Cor 15:45b; Eph 1:20-21; Exo 30:22-31; John 7:39; 2 Cor 3:17; Gal 3:14; Rev 2:7; 22:17
[13]  In the first message, we fellowshipped concerning the definition of the Christian life.
[14]  We saw that the Christian life is the life in which the believers of Christ live Christ and magnify Him Phil 1:20b-21a .
[15]  Many people move around in the course of their lifetime, but the Lord Jesus lived thirty-three and a half years altogether in the small area of Palestine.
[16]  In His all-inclusive death, He also accomplished a positive work.
[17]  This work was His releasing of the divine life within Him as the grain of wheat John 12:24 .
[18]  The divine life was concealed in His human shell.
[19]  The Triune God as the content of our Christian life comprises the divinity of God in His Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit Matt 28:19; 2 Cor 13:14 .
[20]  At that time in the Gospels, the Holy Spirit was there, the Spirit of God was there, but not the Spirit.
[21]  In the previous message, we saw the contents of the Christian life.
[22]  The contents of the Christian life are the Triune God who has been processed and consummated to be the all-inclusive Spirit of life through Christ's death and resurrection.
[23]  The Christian life actually is the composition of three all-inclusive things the all-inclusive Spirit of Christ, the all-inclusive death of Christ, and the all-inclusive resurrection of Christ.
[24]  In this message we want to see fifteen crucial aspects concerning the all-inclusive Spirit.
[25]  The first point concerning the Spirit is mentioned in John 4:24, which says that God is Spirit.
[26]  It seems that the Lord spoke in John 14 without caring whether the disciples understood Him or not.
[27]  I do not believe that any of the twelve understood what He was talking about.
[28]  The Lord said that when He spoke, the Father who abode in Him did His works v. 10 . The Lord went on to say, "I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever" v. 16 . Eventually, He said, "The Spirit of reality...abides with you and shall be in you....In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you" vv.
[29]  Before Christ's incarnation and resurrection, divinity and humanity were separate entities.
[30]  But humanity and divinity were mingled together in Christ.
[31]  The Spirit is Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God.
[32]  The Spirit of life is the reality of life, for this Spirit contains the element of the divine life.
[33]  The verses in the Scripture reading concerning the functions of the all-inclusive Spirit were selected from the entire New Testament.
[34]  The first item is that God is Spirit, and the last item is that the Spirit is the processed and consummated Triune God.
[35]  The first function of the all-inclusive Spirit is to convict sinners to repent and believe in Christ.
[36]  The Spirit also functions to transform the believers 2 Cor 3:18 .
[37]  The Spirit not only dwells within us but also indwells us.
[38]  The Spirit is the reality of Christ John 15:26; 1 John 5:6 .
[39]  The reality of everything that Christ is, everything that Christ has, and even everything that Christ has accomplished is the Spirit.
[40]  In Ephesians 3:16 Paul prayed that the Father would grant the saints "to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man."
[41]  The Spirit also distributes the gifts to the believers 1 Cor 12:4, 7-11 .
[42]  In Matthew 12:28 the Lord said that He cast out demons by the Spirit of God.
[43]  The Spirit reveals the depths of God to the believers 1 Cor 2:10 .
[44]  In 1 Corinthians 1, Paul taught that Christ is God's power and God's wisdom v. 24 . Christ is wisdom to us from God as our righteousness, as our sanctification, and as our redemption v. 30 . These aspects of Christ are the depths of God.
[45]  The Spirit is the aim of the believers' sowing Gal 6:8b .
[46]  To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with the desire and aim of the Spirit in view, to accomplish what the Spirit desires.
[47]  CHAPTER SIX THE ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Rom 5:12; 1 Cor 15:22a; Heb 9:27; Rom 5:10; 2 Cor 5:14-15; Heb 9:26; Rom 8:3b; Heb 9:28; 1 Cor 15:3; Matt 26:28; John 1:29; Heb 2:14; John 12:31; Gal 6:14; Col 2:15; Rom 6:6a; Gal 6:14-15; 2 Cor 4:10a, 11a, 12a, 16a; Gal 5:24; Rom 6:6b; Eph 2:15; Col 2:14; Eph 2:16; John 12:24; Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 10:17; John 19:34
[48]  In the Scripture reading for this message, we have listed thirty-two verses.
[49]  All these verses are like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle concerning the revelation of the all-inclusive death of Christ.
[50]  The death of Christ is different from the death of Adam.
[51]  B. The Death of Christ Coming to His Believers
[52]  The death of Christ comes to His believers through His redemption, and all His believers have been redeemed that they may enjoy the salvation of His life Rom 5:10; 2 Cor 5:14-15 .
[53]  Christ died on the cross to bear our sins Heb 9:28; 1 Cor 15:3; Matt 26:28 .
[54]  To Kill the Natural Life with Its Natural Ability
[55]  e. To Make the Body of Sin of No Effect
[56]  Through Christ's death on the cross, the body of sin was annulled, or made of no effect, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves Rom 6:6b .
[57]  Now we want to see two aspects on the positive side of Christ's death.
[58]  Life could be subdued by death, but resurrection conquers death; hence, resurrection is stronger than life.
[59]  Christ in His humanity was begotten by God in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29b .
[60]  The life-giving Spirit as the resurrected, pneumatic Christ is the reality of Christ's resurrection Rom 8:9-11 .
[61]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE COMPOUNDING OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gen 1:2b; Judg.
[62]  In this message we want to see the compounding of the Spirit.
[63]  After Andrew Murray, Jessie Penn-Lewis was raised up.
[64]  She received help from Andrew Murray and became very prevailing.
[65]  The first title of the Spirit in the Old Testament is the Spirit of God.
[66]  In His human living, He lived in Nazareth in a carpenter's home for thirty years, and He ministered for three and a half years.
[67]  He was a man who was altogether not glorious and even very lowly.
[68]  The Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7b , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19b , the Spirit of the Lord 2 Cor 3:17b , and the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:18b are new terms for the Spirit in the New Testament.
[69]  Before God's incarnation, there was only the divine element in the Spirit.
[70]  But through His incarnation, human living, and death, this One became a life-giving Spirit in resurrection 1 Cor 15:45b .
[71]  His divinity, humanity, human living, all-inclusive death, and wonderful resurrection are compounded in the Spirit.
[72]  When I was a young Christian among the Brethren, I heard them say that the compound ointment is a type of the Spirit, but they did not get into the details.
[73]  All of us need to be clear about the significance of the compound ointment as a type of the compound Spirit.
[74]  In order to have a clear revelation of the Spirit, we must be clear about this type.
[75]  The first item in the history of the universe is God; the second item is the created universe, and the third item is man.
[76]  The fourth item is the mingling of the first and the third items.
[77]  Jesus Christ is the mingling of God and man.
[78]  The seventh major item in the history of the universe is that in and through His resurrection, Christ became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .
[79]  We have seen in the previous message that the life-giving Spirit is a compound, as typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25.
[80]  The life-giving Spirit has been compounded with God as the base, typified by the one hin of olive oil, and with man, typified by the four spices.
[81]  This all-inclusive Spirit is also compounded with all the elements of the process through which God has passed.
[82]  The Spirit is the totality of God, of the Triune God, of the uplifted Man, of the death of Christ, of the effectiveness of this death, of the resurrection of Christ, and of the power of this resurrection.
[83]  This is why the New Testament charges us to live by the Spirit, to walk by the Spirit Gal 5:16, 25 , and to do everything according to the spirit Rom 8:4 .
[84]  The only way to exalt Christ, express Christ, manifest Christ, and live Christ is to live, to walk, and to do things according to the spirit.
[85]  To live by the Spirit, walk by the Spirit, and do things according to the spirit is to live Christ, to magnify Christ, to manifest Christ, to express Christ, to exalt Christ, and to glorify Christ.
[86]  Christ's death and its effectiveness, with which the Spirit has been compounded, become prevailing in the Spirit.
[87]  The putting to death of Jesus in our environment cooperates with the indwelling Spirit to kill our natural man our outer man , comprising our body and our soul.
[88]  Christ breathed the Spirit into the disciples John 20:22 , and He poured out the Spirit upon the disciples fifty days later Acts 2:1-4 .
[89]  Before His resurrection, there was no possibility of having the essential Spirit entering into our being, and no possibility of having the economical Spirit poured out upon us.
[90]  His entering into us as the essential Spirit is for life, and His being poured out upon us as the economical Spirit is for power; these two aspects of the Spirit are the parts of the reality of the resurrection of Christ.
[91]  The Christian life is a life in Christ's resurrection.
[92]  To know the Spirit, we have to know resurrection.
[93]  The Spirit is the reality of Christ's resurrection and its power, with which the Spirit has been compounded 1 John 5:6 .
[94]  Christ's resurrection with its power in the life-giving Spirit is the sufficient grace of the processed and consummated Triune God 2 Cor 12:9; 13:14; 1 Cor 15:10, 45b, 58 .
[95]  CHAPTER ELEVEN LIVING AND WALKING BY THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gal 5:25; 2:20a; Phil 1:19-21a; Gal 5:16a; Rom 6:4; 8:4; Gal 6:16; Phil 3:16
[96]  In this message we will consider the matter of living and walking by the Spirit.
[97]  Galatians 5:16 and 25 speak of both living by the Spirit and walking by the Spirit.
[98]  Verse 25 says, "If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit."
[99]  Thank the Lord that today both the divine Spirit and the human spirit are very definitely located.
[100]  As believers in Christ, we all have a spirit, and our spirit has been regenerated by the divine Spirit.
[101]  The matter of living by the Spirit is mentioned in Galatians 5:25.
[102]  To live by the Spirit is to take the Spirit the realization of the resurrected Christ as our person Gal 2:20a .
[103]  To live by the Spirit equals to have Christ living in us and equals taking the Spirit as our person.
[104]  The majority of Christians today do not have the church life.
[105]  Those who do not have the church life may stay home in the evening to watch television.
[106]  However, we who practice the church life have a rule, and that rule is to attend the church meetings.
[107]  To walk by the Spirit is to walk in Christ's resurrection, through His crucifixion, and by the compound Spirit Phil 3:10; 1:19b .
[108]  In the previous message, we saw that we need to be those who live and walk by the Spirit.
[109]  When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He was crucified in His flesh.
[110]  The flesh, to which the Triune God was joined, implies a lot.
[111]  Now we need to consider when humanity was brought into divinity.
[112]  God united Himself with us; then He caused us to be united with Him.
[113]  Now we need to ask where Christ is today.
[114]  We have to answer strongly, "Christ is in us!"
[115]  Before Christ became a man, He was merely the universal, omnipresent God.
[116]  In the book Born Crucified, the writer tells a story that occurred during the Civil War in the United States.
[117]  A man was chosen to go to the front to fight at the sacrifice of his life, yet he had a wife and six children.
[118]  The New Testament says in 1 Corinthians 15:45b that the last Adam, who came to be our Substitute, became a life-giving Spirit.
[119]  Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit for the purpose of indwelling us.
[120]  If Christ as the God-man had never become the Spirit, how could He be our life within us?
[121]  There would be no possibility of His dwelling in us if He were not the Spirit.
[122]  In Romans 8:9 Paul speaks of the Spirit of God dwelling in us and of our having the Spirit of Christ.
[123]  In the well-known book Imitation of Christ, the writer, considered by many to be Thomas Kempis, taught that the way to perfection was to suffer with Christ.
[124]  The teaching in that book is very close to the teaching of asceticism, which is taught strongly by Buddhism, by the Gnostics, and by the so-called Christian mystics, including Madame Guyon, Father Fenelon, and Brother Lawrence.
[125]  To bear the cross means, first, that Christ has brought us to the cross and, second, that we were crucified with Him on the cross Gal 2:20a .
[126]  Since Christ was crucified and we were crucified in Him, we should see and should not forget that from that time a cross has been on our shoulder.
[127]  We need to bear the cross of Christ as our cross in dealing with our soul-life, that is, our self Matt 16:24-26; Luke 9:23-25 .
[128]  If this matter is not clear to us, we may make many mistakes.
[129]  We need to see the basic principle and the basic factor of God's economy.
[130]  We need to realize that when we were baptized, we were all buried in our baptistry.
[131]  According to the fact in the Bible, although God has condemned sinful man and Satan has corrupted man, in God's economy, God has drawn a boundary around our spirit so that Satan cannot enter into our spirit.
[132]  Paul's word in Galatians 5:24 indicates that within our fallen flesh, which is the body of sin, there are two categories of things.
[133]  The first category is our desires, or our passions.
[134]  In message twelve we saw that we were regenerated crucified, born crucified John 3:5; Gal 2:20a , and that now we are dying to live 1 Cor 15:36 .
[135]  In message thirteen we saw that we need to bear the cross of Christ as our cross in dealing with our soul-life, our self Matt 16:24-26 , and that we need to crucify our flesh with its passions and lusts in dealing with our body of sin Gal 5:24; Rom 6:6; 8:13b .
[136]  We should not forget that His death is included in the all-inclusive, compound Spirit.
[137]  All of the full-time trainees are being killed every day.
[138]  To eat food and stay in dormitories against their choice is a killing.
[139]  We have to realize that our circumstances and our environment are altogether not up to us.
[140]  Whether it is raining or whether the sky is clear is up to God, the Creator.
[141]  In this message we want to conclude our fellowship on our need to live and walk under the crucifixion of Christ.
[142]  Brother Nee was absolutely right in saying that God does not care whether we are successful or whether we are mistaken.
[143]  God cares only for one thing for being worked into us.
[144]  God does not have any intention to make someone a great professor.
[145]  God puts us into the right position so that we can be broken.
[146]  Often God will not do anything for us according to our concept, and it may seem to us that God is not faithful.
[147]  We may pray day and night and put our trust in the Lord, but eventually nothing comes out according to our earnest prayer.
[148]  Later when the Lord was on the cross, He saw His mother and His disciple John standing by, and He said to His mother, "Woman, behold, your son" John 19:26 .
[149]  We should not forget that the Lord had the human nature and human feelings.
[150]  For Him to be hanging on the cross and tell His mother not to look at Him but to look at John as her son was a death to the natural life.
[151]  Only the Lord knows the heavenly, spiritual mathematics concerning what in our environment works the best for our good.
[152]  The Lord gave Job many children, but one day all of his sons and daughters were killed Job 1:18-19 .
[153]  After we have been under God's dealing for some time, we are so willing to be conformed to Christ's death in everything.
[154]  To us Christians there should be no thought of revenge or avenging ourselves.
[155]  As we are being conformed to the death of Christ, we are in the fellowship of His sufferings.
[156]  We are a real partner, a real companion, of the Lord in His sufferings.
[157]  During the Lord's life on this earth, He did not have any peace in His environment.
[158]  In this message I would like to help you to see another aspect of the Christian life, the aspect of being conformed to the death of Christ.
[159]  THE OLD MAN AND THE NEW MAN OF A BELIEVER
[160]  As believers we all have our old man and also the new man Rom 6:6; Eph 4:22, 24 .
[161]  We also can say that we believers of Christ are both the old man and the new man.
[162]  According to Romans 8:13, we are conformed to the death of Christ through our putting to death the practices of our body by the Spirit.
[163]  Christ's death did not take place only in the six hours of His crucifixion.
[164]  Christ's death began from His birth and continued to His last breath while He was on the cross.
[165]  The Christian life is a suffering life because we must do the will of God.
[166]  In John 4:34 the Lord Jesus said, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work."
[167]  The Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God becoming the Spirit of the resurrected Christ Rom 8:9 .
[168]  By the Spirit of Christ, we partake of His resurrection life, His resurrection power, His transcendency, and His reigning authority.
[169]  Hence, the Spirit to him was the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the Triune God.
[170]  Ultimately the Spirit of God is simply "the Spirit" John 7:38-39; Rev 22:1, 17a .
