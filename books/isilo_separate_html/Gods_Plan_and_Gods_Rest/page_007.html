The Lord Jesus quoted this verse in Matthew 21:16: "Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings You have perfected praise." These words mean that the enemy may do all he can, but it is not necessary for God Himself to deal with him. God will use babes and sucklings to deal with him. What can babes and sucklings do? It says, "Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings You have established strength." God's desire is to obtain men who are able to praise; those who can praise are those who can deal with the enemy.</P><P>In verses 3 through 8 the psalmist says:</P><blockquote>When I see Your heavens,<br>the works of Your fingers,<br>The moon and the stars,<br>which You have ordained,<br><br>What is man, that You<br>remember him,<br>And the son of man, that You<br>visit him?<br><br>You have made him somewhat<br>lower than angels<br>And have crowned him with<br>glory and honor.<br><br>For You have caused him to rule<br>over the works of Your hands;<br>You have put all things under<br>his feet:<br><br>All sheep and oxen,<br>As well as the beasts of the<br>field,<br><br>The birds of heaven and the fish<br>of the sea,<br>Whatever passes through the<br>paths of the seas.</blockquote><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
