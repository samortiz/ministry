To Touch the Lintel and the Two Side Posts<br />with the Blood Applied by a Bunch of Hyssop</h2><p>Exodus 12:22 says, &ldquo;And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and touch the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin&rdquo; (Heb.). Notice that the blood was put on the entrance of the house, not on the roof. The function of the entrance is to allow the proper persons and things to come into the house. Anyone or anything that is not proper is shut out by the entrance. The fact that the blood of the Passover lamb was put on the lintel and the two side posts of the door implies that the blood opens the way for us to get into Christ, who is typified by the house. The redeemed ones come into the house, not through the roof or through a window, but through the door that has been sprinkled with the redeeming blood. Hallelujah, our entry into Christ has been guaranteed by His redeeming blood! Coming into Christ through the door sprinkled with the blood, we receive a warm welcome.</p><p>Furthermore, the blood on the door protected the redeemed ones from God&rsquo;s judgment. As 12:13 says, the blood was to be &ldquo;a token upon the houses&rdquo; where the children of Israel were. Verse 23 goes on to say, &ldquo;For Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you&rdquo; (Heb.). The same blood opened the way for the redeemed ones to get into the house and closed the gates to the destroyer, thereby guarding God&rsquo;s redeemed ones from judgment. Praise the Lord that we have a gate that has been sprinkled with the redeeming blood! This gate opens to us God&rsquo;s grace with all that He is to us and all that He has for us. Furthermore, this gate shuts out every negative thing. Hallelujah, we are in the house whose gate has been sprinkled with the blood!</p><p>In the foregoing message we pointed out that both the lamb and the house typify Christ. This means that the lamb is the house and that the house is the lamb. The lamb is the means of redemption, and the house is the means of preservation. Whoever is redeemed by the lamb is preserved and kept by the house. This indicates that whatever Christ redeems, He keeps. As the redeeming One, He is the lamb, and as the keeping One, He is the house. Eventually, the blood of the lamb was on the door, and the meat of the lamb was in the house. The lamb, the house, and those who enjoyed the Passover thus became one. This is a picture of the identification of the redeemed ones with Christ.</p><p>A bunch of hyssop was used to put the blood of the lamb on the lintel and the doorposts. First Kings 4:33 says that, in his wisdom, Solomon &ldquo;spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall.&rdquo; Hyssop was among the smallest of the plants. According to the revelation in the New Testament, the thing that is the smallest in quantity is our faith (Matt. 17:20). Hence, hyssop signifies faith. God does not require that our faith be as the cedar tree, for none of us could meet such a requirement. God requires that we have just a little faith. Even if our faith is very small, we still can apply the Passover lamb. If a sinner prays, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, thank You for dying for me,&rdquo; he will be saved. Even such a small amount of faith will save him. Actually, one can be saved just by saying, &ldquo;Lord, thank You.&rdquo; This is faith that is like hyssop that springs out of the wall. It is by such little faith that the blood of Christ is applied.</p><p>According to 12:22, the blood of the Passover lamb was in a basin, not in a large vessel. Many can testify that in their experience of conversion the redeeming blood of Christ was made available to them in a way that was small and easy to apply. It was not necessary to have great faith. Even a very small amount of faith was sufficient for them to be saved. This is the significance of using a bunch of hyssop to apply the blood of the Passover lamb. Both the basin and the hyssop were small and could be handled easily by anyone. How easy it is to apply Christ!</p><p>Any unsaved person who is reading this message does not need to wait for something great to happen. As he is reading, he can say, &ldquo;Lord, I thank You.&rdquo; Even by the exercise of such a small amount of hyssop, the blood will be applied to him, and the entire Passover will be his. The blood of the Passover lamb is applied not by great faith, but by a small amount of faith. Praise the Lord that even a little faith is sufficient! By applying the blood in faith, we have an entrance into Christ, and we are immediately ushered into Him as the house, where the whole Passover becomes ours.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_079.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_081.html">Next</a> </body></html>
