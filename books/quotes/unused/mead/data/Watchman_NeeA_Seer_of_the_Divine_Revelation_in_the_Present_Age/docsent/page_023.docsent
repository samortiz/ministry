   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>APPLYING THE BLOOD OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to keep his fellowship with the Lord untarnished, Watchman Nee learned how to apply the blood of Christ to his situation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He told me that once his conscience was strongly condemning him before God concerning certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He could not get through, so he was compelled to seek out Miss Barber for help.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After relating his story to her, she said to him, "The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us" 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When he told her that he was still under condemnation she repeated to him several times, "The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, he received light that only the blood of the Lord can keep one's conscience from any kind of condemnation before God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By that fellowship with Miss Barber, he learned that through the cleansing of the Lord's blood it is possible to keep oneself always in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1940 while I was attending his training in Shanghai, I heard him confessing sin and applying the Lord's blood in his prayer at the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I was greatly impressed with his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicated that he relied upon the cleansing of the Lord's blood to maintain a continual practice of God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>ABIDING IN THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Watchman Nee also thoroughly learned the lesson of abiding in the Lord according to the inner anointing 1 John 2:27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To him this was vital for the practice of the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He realized that the inner anointing was the Lord's moving and working within him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To disobey the anointing was to disobey the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only by obeying the inner anointing could he have the closest and most intimate walk with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He realized that even a little negligence regarding the inner anointing would keep him away from the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By all the above practices, he kept himself continually in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No shadow whatsoever was allowed to come between him and God, and his fellowship with the Lord was constantly maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was in this kind of uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord that he continually received heavenly light and spiritual revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He greatly treasured God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To him God's presence was life, light, power, and victory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In His presence he enjoyed all the riches of God's provision.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is obvious that he received much help from the book The Practice of the Presence of God by Brother Lawrence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this matter he was also helped very much by the biography of Hudson Taylor.</S>
