        <h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH NEEDING PRIESTLY SERVICE</h2>
<p>In the past I did not see the relationship between the priesthood and the building, even though I bore a heavy burden for the building up of the church. It is only recently that the Lord has showed me from Zechariah 6:12-13 that building is a matter of coordination between the priesthood and the kingship. This light has become increasingly clearer and brighter. Thus, I have the assurance to say that we must recover the priestly service and give heed to the fellowship in spirit in order for the church to be built. Without priests, God&rsquo;s dwelling place cannot be built, because God&rsquo;s dwelling place is intrinsically a priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5).</p>
<p>The tabernacle was linked to the priesthood in the Old Testament; the priests could not be separated from the tabernacle, and the tabernacle could not be separated from the priests. The priests and the tabernacle implicitly reveal two aspects of one reality: The priests and the tabernacle speak of the service of God&rsquo;s people to God, on the one hand, and of the dwelling of God among His people, on the other hand. Furthermore, the New Testament explicitly states that God&rsquo;s dwelling place is a priesthood. Therefore, the building up of the church depends upon the priesthood.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 2:20 Paul says that the church, as the household of God, is &ldquo;being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets.&rdquo; <em>The foundation of the apostles and prophets</em> refers to the revelation that the apostles and prophets received for the building of the church. In 4:11 Paul also speaks of the Lord giving &ldquo;some as apostles and some as prophets.&rdquo; <em>Apostles</em> and <em>prophets</em> refer to the gifts that the Lord has given to the church, that is, to some but not all the believers. Paul speaks of the need to earnestly desire to prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14:1 because the church in Corinth was in a desolate condition; they were fully in the flesh and full of discord and chaos. They were interested only in outward gifts, but the inward matters of fellowshipping with God and being under God&rsquo;s authority were lacking. Due to this condition, the apostle brought up the matter of prophesying because prophesying was the most beneficial gift for the building of the church in Corinth. From Paul&rsquo;s viewpoint, it was necessary to speak of prophesying. However, if the function of the prophethood is stronger than that of the priesthood and the kingship in the church, our situation is not normal. Such a situation also shows that the church is lacking in the building and is not being manifested as a priesthood. In a normal situation the church should have a priestly atmosphere that is full of priestly service with authority. Even if there is an occasional need for strengthening from prophets, the service of the church should be carried out by a royal priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORK OF PRIESTS BEING TO FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>The work of priests, as recorded clearly in the Old Testament, involved not only offering sacrifices in the outer court but also burning incense before God and lighting lamps (Exo. 27:20-21; 30:6-8). Furthermore, the Bible clearly shows that there is a relationship between lighting the lamps and burning the incense. The priests burned incense when they dressed the lamps in the morning and when they set up the lamps at twilight. Lighting the lamps is a matter of light; hence, it denotes the reading of the Bible. Burning the incense is a matter of offering up fragrant incense before God; hence, it denotes prayer. These two aspects are related to the fellowship of the church. If the brothers and sisters have no light or sweet fragrance before God, it is due to a lack of fellowship. If we all are priests and are living in the fellowship, we will be full of light and full of the fragrance of Christ before God. This should be our constant condition before God.</p>
<p>We must admit that our work and our various meetings shine little light to people and offer little fragrance to God because of the lack of our priestly function. Although some can speak the word of God as prophets, there is an urgent need for priests who light the lamps and burn the incense. If our service involves lighting the lamps and burning the incense, the saints will receive a supply that is much greater than what comes through exhortation. If we can help a brother only with teachings and exhortation, we may not be able to shine the light of the Lord upon him or impart the fragrance of the Lord into him. In order to do this, we must be more than prophets; we must be priests. If we are under the authority of God and draw near to God, that is, if we are royal priests, who pray both for and with a brother, we will be able to bring him into fellowship with God so that his whole being is full of light and full of the fragrance of Christ.</p>
<p>We have a great lack related to this point. The apostles said, &ldquo;We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word&rdquo; (Acts 6:4). They placed prayer above ministering the word. The apostles were royal priests, who reigned and lived in fellowship to minister the word as priests. Moreover, their ministry of the word was mainly to unbelievers. After believing into the Lord, the new believers were brought into a priestly service. God wants us to fulfill a priestly service. We must go before the Lord and exercise our spirit to light the lamps and burn the incense. Our urgent need is not to give more messages but to pray more. We must rise up to be priests and enter into the Holy Place and into the Holy of Holies to fulfill our priestly service.</p>
<p>Although we have some aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s authority and speaking among us, we are lacking in our experience of His priestly function. We may be able to speak many words of exhortation to a brother based on the Bible, but he still may not be affected in a positive way. However, we should lead him to pray so that the water of life begins to flow in him. Then he can be enlightened with just a few words to see his corruption, worthlessness, and filth so that he repents in tears. Such a response can come only from the shining of light within him, not from mere teachings.</p>
<p>In summary, being a priest is a matter of exercising our spirit to pray before God and of fellowshipping with God. We need to personally enter into God&rsquo;s light, be enlightened by God, and touch the fragrance of Christ in order to be acceptable to God. Furthermore, we should pray with others to enter into God&rsquo;s light with them. This is much more profitable than merely teaching with words, and this will build the church.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem illustrates this point. The throne in the city signifies the Lord as King; the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne refers to the Lord as Priest bringing God&rsquo;s people into fellowship with God through the flow of the water of life. We should submit to the authority of God and allow the water of life to flow in our spirit. In this flow there will be light and the sweet fragrance of the supply of life. This is the greatest need of the church today.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
