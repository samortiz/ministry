   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Regardless of what people say, we love to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is really to drink the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are in darkness, the best way to get out of that darkness is to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are in trouble, the best way out is to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we would just call for three minutes, we would be in the third heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The best way for us to overcome our temper is not to try to overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more we try to overcome our temper, the more it will overcome us!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The best way to deal with our temper is to call, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, our temper is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not something superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The next time you have a problem try calling on the name of Plato: O Plato, O Plato!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nothing will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when you call on the name of Jesus, there is the real comforting, strengthening, and refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is because the name of Jesus is the Person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The name represents the Person, and the Lord Jesus is a real, living, nigh, present, and available Person!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we call on Him, He is right there to be our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>PRAYING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must also learn to eat the Lord in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that we must not simply read the Bible, but pray-read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is so nourishing to pray over the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some people have condemned us by saying that pray-reading is not in the Bible, but I do have a portion of the Word for them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The King James Version does not have the proper translation, but in the Greek, Ephesians 6:17-18 says, Take...the word of God by means of all prayer, praying at every time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These verses tell us clearly that we need to pray the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we simply read the Word, we only get the knowledge into our mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But when we pray the Word of God, we get the Spirit of the Word into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This gives us the nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Jesus said, The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life John 6:63 , They are not doctrine or knowledge, but spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As they are spirit and life, we must take them into our spirit, not into our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can we do this?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not by thinking, reading, or understanding; it can only be done by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we exercise our spirit to pray the Word, we receive the Spirit of the Word and we get the life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we will daily eat and drink Christ by pray-reading the Word and calling on the name of the Lord, we will have the growth in life and the transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we will not only be in the church, but be built into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is very difficult to take anything away that has been built in. The New Jerusalem is a building with precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not a piling up of stones, but a building up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This can only come through transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE PROPER SITE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to have a building, there is the need of the proper site.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we build a house on the wrong site, we will lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, the site or the ground upon which we build is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For the building up of the church, we need the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We know that there are some real Christians in the Catholic church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are our real brothers and sisters because they are also born of our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But could we go into the Catholic church to be built up with them?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This would be impossible, because they are on the wrong site.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The same principle is true with all the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are thousands of real Christians there, but can you go into their denomination to be built up with them?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No, for they are also on the wrong site.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then what about the free groups?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today, especially in this country, there are hundreds of free groups meeting in their homes and in many other places.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are real brothers in the Lord, but can we go and be built up with them?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Again, the site is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>People are always telling us that we are narrow because we take care of the ground of the church, the site for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But we must take care of it, because the building must be on the proper ground of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the Catholic church, there is no possibility of having the proper unity because the ground is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The same thing is true with the denominations and the free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In typology, the temple of God could only be built in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you were to build the same temple in Babylon, that would be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, we need the proper ground, the proper site for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We know that the proper ground is not in the Catholic church, the denominations, or the free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then where is the proper ground?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Again we must come back to the pure Word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The pure Word tells us that the church is one.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How many bodies does Christ have?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Universally speaking, the Body of Christ is one.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>And this one Body comprises all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But we know that all the saints are not in the same place at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some are scattered in this city, and some are scattered in another city.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But wherever we are, we must come together to be one and to be built up with the saints in the city where we live.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the local church, the church that, according to the pure Word, is built upon the ground of unity in the locality where we live.</S>
