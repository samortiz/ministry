<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The City of Jerusalem Having Become a Harlot</H2><P>In 1:21-23 we see that the city of Jerusalem had become a harlot. Justice and righteousness were absent, but she was full of murderers. Her silver had become dross, and her wine diluted with water. Her rulers were rebellious and were companions of thieves, all loving bribes and chasing after rewards, and not defending the orphan nor caring for the widow's plea. This reveals that Israel had become evil in every way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Jerusalem Stumbling and Judah Falling</H2><P>Jerusalem stumbled and Judah fell because their speech and actions were against Jehovah, to rebel against the eyes of His glory. The countenance of their faces witnessed against them, and they declared their sin like Sodom, not hiding it (3:8-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Elders and the Rulers of Jehovah's People<br>Having Consumed the Vineyard</H2><P>The elders and rulers of Jehovah's people consumed the vineyard, and the spoil of the poor was in their houses. They crushed Jehovah's people and ground the faces of the poor (3:14-15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. The Daughters of Zion Being Haughty</H2><P>The daughters of Zion, the young girls, were haughty, uplifting themselves. They walked around with outstretched necks and lusting eyes, adorning themselves with luxurious and costly items (3:16, 18-23). They had no thought of God but were interested only in indulging their lust.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Jehovah, Having Made Israel a Vineyard and<br>Having Done Everything That Is Needed for It,<br>Expecting Justice but Beholding Bloodshed</H2><P>Jehovah had made Israel a vineyard and had done everything that was needed for it. He looked for it to produce grapes, but it produced only wild grapes. He expected justice but beheld bloodshed. He expected righteousness but heard an outcry of distress. The distressed people cried out, and God heard them. Some of the people joined house to house and laid field to field, leaving no place for others and dwelling alone in the midst of the land (5:1-4, 7-8).</P>
