   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What is the significance of suffering?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This, that the devastation it brings to the old creation provides an opportunity for the God of resurrection to impart Himself to His creatures, so that they emerge from the death process with a divine element in their constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The primary purpose of suffering in this universe, particularly as it relates to the children of God, is that through it the very nature of God may be wrought into the nature of man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"If indeed our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is being renewed day by day."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through a process of outward decay an inward process is taking place that is adding a new constituent to our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Beloved brothers and sisters, through hardship and pressure a divine element is being wrought into the very fabric of our beings, so that we cease to be colorless Christians, but have a heavenly hue imparted to our lives that was lacking before.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whatever else suffering may effect in this universe is incidental; this is primary to bring those whom the living God has made possessors of created life into the uncreated life of the God of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is in the death experiences which come through suffering that the life of the creature is blended with the life of the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may know the living God without such drastic experiences, but only through death can we come to an experimental knowledge of the God of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suffering is the God-appointed lot of the Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Christian's happiness is not to be found in external things, but in learning to enjoy God Himself in the midst of trial.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul and Silas could rejoice and sing His praises while they were in prison, because their happiness did not come from outer circumstances, but from an inner enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Paul's short letter to the Philippians, written during his imprisonment, there are over a score of references to joy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In deep distress he could still be joyful because in his affliction he was learning to know Christ, to appropriate Him and to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His outward circumstances were all conducive to sorrow, but it was in sorrow that Christ was imparted to him as the source of his joy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Beloved brothers and sisters, do you want to be partakers of the new creation?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you want to know perennial newness?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then you must give your consent to God when He seeks to lead you through devastating processes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And you need have no fear, for God knows how to apportion suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is an expert at matching our suffering to our state.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He measures all things with unfailing accuracy and selects the peculiar trial suited to the peculiar need.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He invariably chooses the lot of each one with this goal in view an increase of the divine content in our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If He chastises us, it is always "for our profit that we might partake of His holiness."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"God causes all things to work together for good to those...who are called according to the purpose."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What good?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This, that we may be "conformed to the image of His Son."</S>
