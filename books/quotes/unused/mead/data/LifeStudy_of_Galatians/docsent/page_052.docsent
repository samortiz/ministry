   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. To Expose Man s Fallen Condition</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 3:19 Paul tells us that the law was added because of transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The law was not an original part of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It was added while God s economy was proceeding because of man s transgression, until the seed, Christ, should come, to whom God s promise was made.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since it was added because of man s transgressions, it should have been deducted when those transgressions were taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because Christ, the seed, has come, the law must be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Its function is to expose man s fallen condition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>C. To Keep Man in Its Custody for Christ</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 3:23 Paul says, But before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be guarded is to be kept in custody, kept in ward.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be guarded under law, by being shut up there, can be compared to sheep being enclosed in a fold John 10:1, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In God s economy, the law was used as a fold to keep God s chosen people until Christ came.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because Christ has come, God s people should no longer be kept under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Greek word rendered unto in 3:23 can also be translated with a view to.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that the shutting up has an objective or goal in view.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It should result in bringing the guarded people to the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In caring for their children, Christian parents need to preach the law to them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not first preach grace to the children.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we give them regulations according to the law, the law will keep them in custody for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, we should first give them the law in a strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The law will expose them, guard them, and keep them, serving as a custodian to keep them for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>D. To Conduct Man unto Christ</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 3:24 Paul continues, So the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Greek word for child-conductor can also be rendered escort, guardian, or custodian.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It denotes one who cares for a child who is under age and conducts him to the schoolmaster.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The law was used by God as a custodian, a guardian, a child-conductor, to watch over His chosen people before Christ came, and to escort and conduct them to Christ at the proper time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Galatians 3:25 says, But faith having come, we are no longer under a child-conductor.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since faith in Christ has come, we do not need to be under the guarding law any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a child-conductor, the law brings us unto Christ that we may be justified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When an Israelite came to the altar with a trespass offering, he was justified by faith in that offering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because of the trespass offering, God forgave him of his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Israelite was justified not by works of law, but by his faith in the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In typology, this is to be justified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The principle in the New Testament is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The law still condemns all those who have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those condemned under the law should come to Christ and exercise faith in Him as their trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way, sinners are justified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>E. Related to the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The law is related to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is indicated in Romans 7:5, where Paul says, For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sins, which were through the law, operated in our members to bear fruit to death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The works of the law are always related to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A believer s efforts to keep the law are not of the Spirit, but are of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even if someone has the intention to please God by fulfilling the requirements of the law, that intention will cause him to be involved with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Romans 7 Paul tells us that the law is good, even spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, we have no right to find fault with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead, we should blame our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whenever we try to keep the law, we exercise the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>F. The Works of Law Being under the Curse</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Galatians 3:10 Paul says, For as many as are of the works of law are under a curse; for it is written, Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all the things written in the book of the law to do them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we try to keep the law, we shall be in the flesh and automatically be under the curse, for the works of the law are under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Instead of trying to keep the law, we should thank the law for exposing us and condemning us and then bid it farewell.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not form a permanent relationship with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should leave the law and go to Christ and to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we stay in the flesh with the law, we shall remain under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if we go to Christ and the cross, we shall be justified by faith.</S>
