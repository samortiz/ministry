   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD BECOMING A MAN AND SHEDDING HIS BLOOD THROUGH DEATH TO BE OUR REDEEMER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the requirement of God s righteous law, man should perish.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to redeem man God Himself became a man to be our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He stood in the position of a sinner and died on the cross as our Substitute to suffer God s righteous judgment and be punished on our behalf by suffering the pain of death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This Word is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 14 says, And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 29 says, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From these three verses we can see that the Lord Jesus was God, yet He became a man to shed human blood for us; He was the Lamb of God to take away our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If He had not become a man, He could not shed human blood, nor could He have the created flesh to die for us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He needed to have a real body, not an abstract one but a created one, so that He could shed the blood of a created man for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way He could die for the created man, and the human blood which He shed could make redemption for man s sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Old Testament age, when the children of Israel slaughtered bulls and goats to offer as sacrifices, the blood which was shed was only a sign and could not take away sins Heb 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was because bulls and goats are not human beings and therefore could not die for men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Likewise, the blood of bulls and goats could not make propitiation for man s sins; only the human blood can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus was God, yet He became a created man with a created body and had the blood of a created man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, He could die on the cross for us and shed human blood to make redemption for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Matthew 20:28 says that the Son of Man came to give His life as a ransom for many.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man has sinned and is under God s condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the requirement of God s law, the world is under the condemnation of God s righteousness and therefore needs a Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus became the Son of Man by putting on the body of flesh and blood and gave His life as a ransom on the cross for many.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who do not believe that the Lord Jesus was a created man are the antichrists referred to in 1 John 4:3.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These antichrists were the Docetists, who denied that the Lord Jesus was God who became flesh to be a real man and who considered the body of the Lord Jesus to be not a real body of flesh and blood but a mere phantasm.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a great heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must confess that our Lord Jesus is God and the Creator, yet He became a creature with the body and the blood of a created man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, He could indeed be nailed on the cross and pierced in His side to flow out the genuine human blood, even the blood of a sinless man, to redeem us from sins and to clear our record of sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Based on the death of the Lord Jesus on the cross and the precious blood that He shed, God can declare forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As our Redeemer, the Lord Jesus was judged on our behalf according to God s righteousness and fully paid the debt of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why His blood is a declaration, announcing that God has forgiven all the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If anyone calls upon the name of the Lord Jesus, based on the Lord s name and the Lord s blood, God will forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This forgiveness is the issue of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus was crucified and suffered on the cross for six hours, from 9:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M. In the first three hours He was persecuted and humiliated by men for doing God s will; in the last three hours after the noon hour, He was judged and punished by God to accomplish our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was during this time that God counted Him as our Substitute to suffer God s punishment for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, darkness fell over all the land, and the sun was darkened because our sin, our sins, and all negative things were placed upon Him and judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It was in this time that He was also forsaken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, He cried out with a loud voice, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Matt 27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus had said that God never left Him but was with Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why then did God forsake Him at that time?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Isaiah 53:6 says, Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all / To fall on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, 2 Corinthians 5:21 says, Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He not only bore the sins of the world but was also made sin on behalf of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For us, He became a sinner in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, God judged and forsook Him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From God s point of view, He was the Substitute for all the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He suffered for us the judgment that we deserved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the last three hours on the cross the Lord Jesus bore the sins of the whole human race and suffered God s righteous judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Finally, the great work of redemption was accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The problem of the record of sins was solved, the question of the law was cleared, and all the barriers between God and man were removed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, He prayed with a loud voice, Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit Luke 23:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After He accomplished His redemptive work, He entered into rest.</S>
