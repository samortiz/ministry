<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE TRUTH OF THE MYSTERY IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h2 class=head1>THE COINHERENCE OF THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT</h2><p>On the surface John 14:16-20, 23, and 26 seem to be easy to understand, but actually these verses contain a very critical truth. These few verses give us a clear revelation concerning the three of the Divine Trinity—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, showing that the three coinhere and are inseparable.<p>In John 14:10 the Lord said, “I am in the Father and the Father is in Me,” indicating that He and the Father coinhere. However, in verse 16a He said, “And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter,” seeming to imply that He was one person and the Father was another person. This is difficult to understand. First He said that He was in the Father and the Father was in Him, and then He said that He would “ask the Father.” What did He mean? How would He ask the Father? Is it that He as the Son who is in the Father would ask the Father? Or is it that He as the Son would ask the Father who is in the Son? This is really difficult to explain and not so easy to understand. How can the Son ask someone a question if that One is in Him and He is in that One? Since the two—the Son and the Father—were already mingled as one, how could the Son ask the Father a question? From this we see that the Son and the Father are two yet one, one yet two.<h2 class=head2>“Another Comforter”</h2><p>In verse 16b the Lord went on to say, “And He will give you another Comforter.” Since there would be another Comforter, this means that the Lord Himself, who was with the disciples at that time, was the first Comforter. Are there then two Comforters? Verse 17 says that the other Comforter is “the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.” The “Him” referred to in this verse was “another Comforter,” while the Lord who spoke this word was the first Comforter, and the One who would abide with the disciples and would be in them was referred to as “Him”—another Comforter. But verse 18 then says, “I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.” Here I would ask, When the Lord said that He was coming to His disciples, what did He mean by “coming”? Was He referring to His second coming? If this was the case, then He would be leaving them as orphans. But if so, how could He say that He would not leave them as orphans and that He was coming to them? What does this “coming” refer to?<p>In the beginning of chapter fourteen the Lord Jesus told the disciples, “I go to prepare a place for you” (v. 2b). This going refers to the Lord’s going through death. This is why the disciples were sorrowful when they heard this. Due to their sorrow, the Lord spoke a word to comfort them. In verse 18 the Lord seemed to be saying, “Do not be sorrowful, because soon after I go, I will come back. If I went and did not come back, I would be leaving you as orphans. However, I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.” Many teachers in Christianity think that the “coming” in verse 18 refers to the second coming of the Lord. this would mean that at least two thousand years after His going away, He has still not come back and we are still waiting. According to this interpretation, the Lord Jesus has in fact left those who have believed into Him as orphans. This understanding does not match what the Lord meant in these verses.
