<p>According to the fact we know that Christ redeemed us 1900 years ago. Some teachers have stressed this very much. But we need to stress the experiential redemption as well as the factual redemption. We need the redemption in our daily experience. Every morning when we begin our day the first thing we need to do is to offer Christ as our sin offering. Don&rsquo;t think this is too repetitious. You have to realize that life is altogether the totality of repetition. I have been eating breakfast 365 days a year for seventy-seven years. But I shouldn&rsquo;t say that I am disgusted and bored with breakfast, so I won&rsquo;t eat it anymore. Life is the totality of repetition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OFFERING CHRIST AS THE SIN OFFERING<br />
EVERY MORNING</h2>
<p>Every day you have to repeat the offering of Christ for your sin. If you don&rsquo;t have a good breakfast in the morning you cannot have a good day. In like manner, in the morning you must have a proper offering of Christ as your sin offering. You need to offer Christ as a big bull for your sin offering. The way to have good health is to have a good breakfast. The way to be healthy spiritually is to begin by offering Christ as your sin offering. Don&rsquo;t say that you have no heart to offer Christ as a sin offering and that your spirit is dormant. This is your laziness. Some who do not eat a proper breakfast say they have no appetite. They have no appetite because they don&rsquo;t eat. The more you eat the more you have an appetite. Eating gives you an appetite and even enlarges the capacity of your appetite. Don&rsquo;t excuse yourself. It is your duty to take a good breakfast, and it is your duty to keep yourself healthy spiritually by offering Christ as a sin offering early in the morning to begin your day. Don&rsquo;t say that you don&rsquo;t have a heart and you don&rsquo;t have the spirit. This is your obligation. Try to do this and you will see that you will be healthy.</p>
<p>I hope to hear many prayers such as this: &ldquo;Lord, thank You that You have helped me to begin my day by offering You as a sin offering. Lord, thank You that You are such an offering to me for this day.&rdquo; But mostly when you pray, you pray in the ordinary, regular, and religious way. You don&rsquo;t have any prayer offered to the Lord according to the riches of the typology in His holy Word. The prayers you have offered are too common, too religious, and too natural. There is no revelation. There are no riches inherited from the rich word of God&rsquo;s Scripture. I hope that after reading these messages your prayer would be changed and transformed. Don&rsquo;t offer those old-fashioned prayers. Rather, offer something according to the rich typology of the Word, offering Christ as all the offerings to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS OUR TRESPASS OFFERING</h2>
<p>Now let us talk about the trespass offering. Suppose you began your day by offering Christ as your sin offering. But when you came to the breakfast table it was just a mess and breakfast was not ready. Right away the flame rose up within you. You were offended with your wife. Eventually you said something to let her know that you were not so happy. But once you got into the car and were driving on the highway you were condemned. You asked the Lord to forgive you because you were in your flesh! &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. Thank You, Lord, You are not only my sin offering but also my trespass offering.&rdquo; This means you offered the Lord Jesus as a trespass offering. We need Him to be our trespass offering many times a day.</p>
<p>At work you have many opportunities to be offended by your colleagues. This is another chance for you to trespass. But by confessing to the Lord you enjoy Him as your trespass offering. While you are driving home another driver may offend you, and you may blow the horn at him. Then right away you would realize that you have trespassed again. You would offer Christ once more as your trespass offering. &ldquo;Thank You, Lord, You are my unlimited trespass offering.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Experiencing Christ as the Offerings for the Church Meetings &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
