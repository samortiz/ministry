   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY THE SPIRIT OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>KNOWING THE THINGS OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE SPIRIT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>KNOWING THE THINGS OF GOD 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:9-12, 17-31; 2:1-16 NEGLECTING THE TWO SPIRITS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 2:11 Paul says, For who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So also the things of God no one has known except the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we would know the things of man and the things of God, we need the two spirits, the human spirit and the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because the Corinthian believers neglected these two spirits, they could know neither the things of man nor the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, in chapter two Paul seems to be saying to them, Corinthians, instead of relying on your philosophical mind, exercise your spirit, not your soul or your flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you exercise your spirit and rely on the Spirit of God, you will know your condition, situation, position, need, and destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No one knows these things of man except the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By failing to exercise the spirit and instead using your philosophical mind, you have missed the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You do not know the things of man, and you do not know yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You do not know your situation, and you do not realize how pitiful your condition is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I urge you to exercise your spirit just as I am exercising mine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because I exercise the spirit, I know the things concerning you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I know your position, condition, and situation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In dealing with the Corinthian believers Paul certainly was in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Something Paul says in 4:21 makes it very clear that Paul was in spirit as he wrote to the believers at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this verse Paul asks, What do you want?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul was a person fully in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He could come to Corinth either with a rod or with a spirit of meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because he was in the spirit, he could say, My spirit causes me to know the things concerning you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As I exercise my spirit, I realize that you have departed from your standing in Christ, that you are ignorant of your destiny, and that you are neglecting the blessings which you have in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead of exercising your spirit, you are exalting your philosophy and wisdom and are making choices according to your preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You, however, don t know these things about yourselves, because you don t exercise the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Forget your Greek mentality and use your regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then you will know the things of man, the things concerning yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul also realized that the Corinthian believers trusted more in their philosophical wisdom than in the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In chapter two he seems to be telling them, When I came to you, I did not trust in my wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although I had received an excellent education, when I was with you I determined not to know anything except Christ and Him crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I exercised my spirit, and I trusted in the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, when I was among you, I was a person in the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because I am in the spirit, I know your situation, and I know the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I know Christ, God s wisdom and God s power.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I even know that God s weakness is stronger than man s power and that God s foolishness is wiser than man s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I came to know the things of God in my spirit mingled with the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has even revealed the depths of God to me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I not only know the things God has done and is doing; I even know the depths of God Himself, the depths of God s being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What I am able to do, you cannot do, because you do not rely on the two spirits, your human spirit and the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many Christians today also neglect these two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The majority of believers hold to a doctrine of dichotomy the belief that man is composed of two main parts, the soul and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to this view, the spirit of man is identical to man s soul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some who teach dichotomy even claim that the spirit, the soul, the heart, and the mind are all synonymous.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They say that the spirit is the soul, that the soul is the heart, and that the heart is the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 1954 I had a conversation with an American missionary who believed in dichotomy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the end of a conference held in Hong Kong, he told me how much he appreciated the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, he could not agree with the teaching that the human spirit is different from the human soul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He claimed that the spirit and the soul are identical.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I referred him to Paul s word in 1 Thessalonians 5:23.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this verse Paul speaks of the spirit and the soul and the body, purposely using two conjunctions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I asked him how, on the basis of this verse, he could insist that the soul and the spirit are synonymous.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nevertheless, he still held to the view that the soul and the spirit are the same.</S>
