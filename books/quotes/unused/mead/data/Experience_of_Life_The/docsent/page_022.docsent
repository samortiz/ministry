   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>First, the object of our dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should go to whomever we have offended and deal with the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we have sinned only against God, we deal with God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we have sinned against God and man, we deal with both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We deal with sins according to the number of persons we have sinned against.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not necessary to deal with those against whom we have not sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Concerning the principle of dispelling a discordant condition, we are obliged to go to those against whom we have sinned, who already have a bad impression of us, and deal with the sin in order that the discordant condition existing between them and ourselves may be dispelled.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As for those against whom we have not sinned, the relationship is harmonious.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we go to them and deal with our sin, we thereby give them a bad impression about ourselves, thus violating the first principle of our dealing with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we confess our sin to those against whom we have not sinned or to those who do not know our sin, we not only give them a bad impression regarding us, but we may also arouse gossip, which would only do more harm to those against whom we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the past there have been those who have not dealt with sins in a careful way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They confessed their sins publicly, with the result that those against whom they had sinned were completely ruined, even to the extent that husband and wife were divorced, and brothers hated each other.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Irreparable damage was thus done.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we deal with sins, therefore, we should take the sphere of our sin as the sphere of our dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our dealing should not exceed the sphere of the sin which we have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the safe way to obtain peace within and not harm others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, the circumstance of our dealing with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In whatever circumstance we have sinned, we should deal with the sin accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we have sinned openly, we deal with it openly; if we have sinned secretly, we deal with it secretly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The sin we have committed in private does not require our dealing with it in public.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we have sinned against a person behind his back, we do not have to deal with him face to face; it is enough that we deal with it by ourselves secretly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Otherwise, we will increase the discordant condition and thus violate the principle of dispelling discord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, if some have been dishonest regarding money matters in an organization, unknown to the one in charge, they are not obliged to announce it publicly; they need only repay in private according to the amount they owe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we hate someone without his knowing it, we need only repent in heart, without going to him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, by not dealing with him regarding this sin, he will have no knowledge of it and will not receive any bad impression of us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we deal with him regarding this sin, we may leave an unhappy trace upon his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if we hate somebody and this has become known to him, we should go to him and deal with the sin so that the hindrance may be eradicated between him and us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Third, the responsibility of our dealing with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we deal with sins, we should only deal with that part for which we are responsible; never involve others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For instance: I and others have together committed the same sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In dealing with this sin, I must use wisdom in handling that portion for which I am responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I should not expose what others have done and cause them difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Otherwise, my dealing will not conform to the principle which we have mentioned of benefiting others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Fourth, the reimbursing of others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the sin we have committed involves material things or the gain of others, we should make restitution.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we restore what we have taken, we should pay according to the original value and add a little more to compensate for the loss.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Old Testament, in Leviticus 5, it is stated that one-fifth should be added.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the New Testament we have the example of Zacchaeus Luke 19 restoring fourfold to those whom he had cheated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These are not laws or regulations, but principles and examples to show us that whenever we make restitution, we should add something to the original value.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With regard to the amount to be added, we may be guided by our inner feeling and our financial situation at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, if we can afford it, we should see that the reimbursement fully repays the loss of those whom we owe, and that we also have peace within.</S>
