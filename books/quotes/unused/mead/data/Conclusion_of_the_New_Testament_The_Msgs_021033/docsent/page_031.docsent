   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Power</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to 1 Corinthians 1:24, Christ is God s power.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He Himself is the saving power.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To those called by God, the crucified Christ is God s power for carrying out, for accomplishing, what God has planned and purposed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In salvation Christ is the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We see God s power in the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It takes the power of God to defeat through the cross of Christ, Satan, the world, sin, fallen man, the flesh, the natural life, the old creation, and the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What other power is greater than Christ crucified as God s power?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What other power can destroy Satan or overcome the world?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only God has the power to accomplish these things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This power is not that of doing things by speaking, such as the power of God exercised in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, it is the power of crucifixion, the power of the wonderful death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that the crucifixion of Christ has become the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The death of Christ has become God s power to destroy Satan, to solve the problem of the world, to eliminate sin, and to terminate fallen man, the flesh, the natural life, and the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By this power God is able also to solve the problem of the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By one death, the death of Christ, all the problems in the universe have been cleared.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, Christ crucified is God s power to abolish all negative things and to carry out His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Wisdom</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is not only God s power, but also God s wisdom 1 Cor 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He has been made wisdom to us from God 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Wisdom is for planning and purposing, whereas power is for carrying out and accomplishing what is planned and purposed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In God s salvation Christ crucified is both God s power and His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need Christ as both power and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First Corinthians 1:30 says, Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Him refers to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What we believers, as the new creation, are and have in Christ is of God, not of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is God who put us in Christ, transferring us from Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is God who has made Christ wisdom to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God has put us into Christ, and now we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Formerly, we were in Adam, but we have been transferred out of Adam and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was not an outward transfer; it was an inward transfer of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In life we have been transferred from one realm into another, from Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are now in Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God, and Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 Paul does not say that Christ became our wisdom; he says that Christ became wisdom to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For Christ to become wisdom to us is different from His becoming our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Day by day, we need Christ to be wisdom to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ being our wisdom is rather general, not experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when Christ becomes wisdom to us, we experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 the phrases to us and from God are crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ became wisdom to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The expression to us from God indicates something present, practical, and experiential in the way of transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Continually Christ should become wisdom to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This indicates a living, ongoing transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 both the punctuation and the grammar are significant.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After the phrase from God there is a colon.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This indicates that wisdom includes the three items which follow the colon, that is, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to Greek grammar, the word both here is used with respect not to two items but to three.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although this is awkward in our language, the translation is accurate according to the Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this verse Paul definitely says that Christ became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This wisdom implies righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ was made wisdom to us from God as three vital things in God s salvation: righteousness for our past, by which we have been justified by God so that we may be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life Rom 5:18 ; sanctification for the present, by which we are being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will, with the divine life Rom 6:19, 22 ; and redemption for the future, that is, the redemption of our body Rom 8:23 , by which we shall be transfigured in our body with His divine life to have His glorious likeness Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For us to be fully saved, we must pass through these three steps: regeneration in the spirit, sanctification in the soul, and transfiguration, redemption, in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When this process is complete, we shall be the same as the Lord Jesus 1 John 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is of God that we participate in such a complete and perfect salvation, a salvation that makes our entire being spirit, soul, and body organically one with Christ and makes Christ everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is altogether of God, not of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Righteousness, sanctification, and redemption refer not only to three stages of God s salvation, stages related to our past, present, and future, but to three aspects of the nature of God s salvation that we need to experience daily.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every day we need Christ as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We continually need Christ as our righteousness so that we may be fully justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need Him as the sanctification of our soul, the sanctification of our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Furthermore, we need Him as the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Strictly speaking, the redemption of the body will take place in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Nevertheless, we need and can enjoy Him as this redemption today Rom 8:11 .</S>
