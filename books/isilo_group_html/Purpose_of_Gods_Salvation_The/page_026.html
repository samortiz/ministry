<p>Concerning coming together for morning revival, there are a few things that we need to pay attention to. First, we should not turn morning revival into a teaching or regulation by requiring everyone to attend. Only when we have a heart to seek the Lord can we meet Him in morning revival. Second, we should ask the saints to read the Bible and give them adequate time to pray-read in spirit. We should not repeat doctrine. The elderly saints do not need to show off their seniority by giving a message. This will disrupt the morning revival. Those who speak must have inspiration from the Lord. Third, we should not consider morning revival as a meeting and therefore arrange for people to pray or to speak a message in order to fill up the time. It is better not to fill the time with speaking. If no one speaks, the saints should quietly read the Bible and pray before the Lord. Morning revival is not a Sunday service in which someone must give a message. Rather, morning revival is our looking to the Lord and quietly seeking Him together so that He may speak to us and give us spiritual milk. We must learn to always pray with our spirit. If we receive a word or inspiration from the Lord, we should not be bound but should release it. If there is no word or inspiration, we should not fabricate something in order to fill up the time.</p>
<p>I studied at a Christian school that emphasized religious rituals. Classes started before eight, and the fourth period ended at eleven thirty. There was a period of thirty minutes, from eleven thirty to twelve o&rsquo;clock, for the whole school to attend a short service. The dean or the principal would host the ceremony, and a speaker would be asked to give a sermon. All the students were forced to attend the service. To the students, those thirty minutes felt like years. Every seat had a number so that the teachers could mark who was absent. Neither arriving late nor leaving early was allowed. It was hard to endure those thirty minutes. When the speaker did not stop after thirty minutes, the audience became very impatient. Eventually, the non-Christians and the Christians did not like to attend this service. The Westerners who established the school were very patient and persistent in holding the service daily, but because they did not know the right way, some students refused to believe in the Lord. The Christian school administrators thought that it was beneficial for the students to attend worship service every day but did not foresee that regulations have a negative effects&mdash;the students hated Christianity.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to our coming together to enjoy the Lord in the morning. We should not turn this time into a worship service or regulation. Five brothers should rise up early and come together to meet the Lord, not to suffer. If one of them likes to speak doctrine, the others will have to endure until he finishes. This disrupts the morning revival. Therefore, we should not arrange for someone to speak or to pray in order to fill up the time. Something is wrong if we must fill up the time in our morning revival. We would rather not hold this kind of morning revival. Those who come to the morning revival must have a heart, be willing to seek the Lord, and desire to fellowship with Him in spirit. We do not want doctrine or set prayers. Our only desire is that everyone would touch the Lord, hear Him, and receive inspiration. This is the way for the Lord to deal with our natural constitution so that we may grow unto maturity in life and be built up in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: How can we receive inspiration?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Inspiration comes when the Spirit inspires our human spirit. This depends on the condition of our heart. We will receive inspiration if our heart is strong for the Lord, but we will not receive inspiration if we do not have a heart for Him. In order to receive inspiration we also need to deal with our sins. If we sense that we have spoken too much, are wrong, have failed the Lord, or have offended someone, we should deal with it immediately. If we would deal with our sins in such a way, it will be easy to receive inspiration. Those who do not deal with their sins rarely receive inspiration, nor do they care to receive inspiration. If we do not deal with our sins in a proper way, our speaking and prayer in the meetings will be to fulfill a duty. Others will not have the way to touch the Spirit. If we have a heart for the Lord and are willing to deal with our sins, it will be easy to receive inspiration.</p>
<p><em>Question: How do we deal with sins?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We deal with sins according to our sense. When we sense that something is wrong inwardly, we should deal with it immediately. We should not reason. If we sense that we have offended the Lord but not man, we should deal with the offense before the Lord. If we have offended someone, we should deal with the offense before him. Not many Christians can deal with sins in such a way. Most Christians do not deal with sins thoroughly but would rather reason with the Lord. Dealing with sins involves paying a price. It is the Lord who asks us to deal with sins; hence, we need to pay the price and respond to Him without reasoning. If, instead of reasoning, we would do whatever the Lord says, it will be easy for us to deal with sins. The more we deal with sins in such a way, the keener our inner sense will be.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>The Purpose of God's Salvation &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
