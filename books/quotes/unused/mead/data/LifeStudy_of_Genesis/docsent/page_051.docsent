   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>d The Case of Israel with the Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following Moses, we have the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Israel was a people called to be a kingdom of priests Exo 19:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Israel was not called to be a kingdom of kings, but a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The priesthood is altogether related to God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The kingship is related to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In both the Old Testament and the New Testament we have these two posts, the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The priesthood is for us to contact God and to have the image of God; the kingship is for us to represent God and to exercise God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Later on we will see that Christians have been called to be priests and kings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The destiny of the people of Israel was to be a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They were to contact God until, like Moses, their faces shone with the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Don't look at the negative side of the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Look at the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With the ark of the tabernacle they were the priests that defeated Jericho Josh 6:1-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you read Joshua 6 again, you will see that the whole nation of Israel did not fight the battle with swords or spears.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Day by day, they bore the testimony and blew the rams' horns.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then they shouted, meaning that they praised God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Jericho fell.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They did not fight the battle like soldiers or warriors.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They fought the battle like priests.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As long as you are a priest, you are qualified to defeat the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Wives, why do you lose the war in your family life?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because you don't have a priest's face.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Perhaps you have the face of a scorpion or a turtle or a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you don't express the face of a priest, you have lost the war already.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Husbands, we are the head, but what kind of head are we the head of a scorpion?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The husband who has a scorpion's head can never be a proper head.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must have a head that bears the face of a priest, shining with God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we have a priest's face, we will gain the victory in our family life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I would even check with you brothers in the brothers' house.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What kind of face do you bear?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you bear the face of a priest reflecting the glory of the Lord or the face of a mouse?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we will subdue the whole environment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as you have the priest's face, you have authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jericho will be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>e The Case of Aaron with the Budding Rod</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The case of Aaron is very interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although God's intention was to make the whole nation of Israel a kingdom of priests, the nation failed God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>So, out of the entire nation, God called out one tribe, the Levites, to be a tribe of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The head of that tribe was the house of Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At a certain time, the people of Israel murmured and rebelled against Aaron, saying, "Is God only with you and not with us?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then God asked each of the twelve tribes to bring a rod with the name of the tribe written upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A rod means authority.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Aaron's rod was the only rod that budded Num 17:2-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It budded almonds.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Palestine, the first thing that blossoms in the springtime is the almonds.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In typology, the almond blossoms signify resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After the wintertime, the first thing that blossoms is almonds that is resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Aaron's rod was a piece of dead wood.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Overnight this piece of dead wood budded.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It became a budding rod, not budding with apples or grapefruit, but with almonds.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that it was surviving with the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Where there is life, there is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Where there is divine life, there is divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Where there is life, there is the image, and the image brings in dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, Aaron had the resurrection life to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>So, Aaron had authority to represent God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Elders in the local churches, leaders in all the service groups, leading sisters you all must be very clear that to be a leading one in the churches among God's people means that you must bud.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You must bud with the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are all simply pieces of dead wood.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whether or not this dead wood can be a rod of authority depends on whether or not this dead wood buds with resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you have the intention to be a leader in a certain service, we will wait to see whether or not the dead wood rots or buds.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If it buds with resurrection life, that is a sign authority is there.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is no more a piece of dead wood; it is a ruling rod.</S>
