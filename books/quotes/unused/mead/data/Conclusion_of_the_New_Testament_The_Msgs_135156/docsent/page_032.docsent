   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>m For Them to Be Delivered from Every Evil Work</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2 Timothy 4:18a Paul says, "The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto His heavenly kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here "every evil work" denotes persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul suffered many persecutions, and he regarded those persecutions as evil works.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, Paul had the assurance that the Lord Jesus would deliver him from every persecution, from every evil work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, Paul was assured that the Lord would save him "unto His heavenly kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The heavenly kingdom is the kingdom of our Father Matt 13:43 , the kingdom of the Father Matt 26:29 , the kingdom of Christ and of God Eph 5:5 , and the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ 2 Pet 1:11 , which will be a reward to the overcoming saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It equals the crown of righteousness in 2 Timothy 4:8, and it is an incentive to the believers to run the heavenly course.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul had the assurance to make the triumphant declaration that he would be saved into this heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since Paul was martyred and martyrdom is certainly an evil work, we may wonder whether the Lord actually delivered Paul from every evil work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yes, Paul was delivered from every evil work, including the evil work of martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Martyrdom ushered Paul into the heavenly kingdom, and this ushering into the heavenly kingdom was a deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The deliverance Paul enjoyed from his martyrdom was the entering into the heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, martyrdom for Paul was a deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Likewise, the sufferings through which we pass are also a deliverance in that suffering delivers us into something higher.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the one hand, Paul was assured that the Lord would deliver him from every evil work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the other hand, he was ready for martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is indicated by 2 Timothy 4:6: "I am already being poured out, and the time of my departure is at hand."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To Paul, his martyrdom was a deliverance, for it ushered him into the heavenly kingdom, and in his martyrdom he experienced the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At no other time does the Lord dispense Himself into His believers as much as when they are martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever a believer is being martyred out of love for the Lord, the Lord infuses, dispenses, all His riches into such a martyred one. n For Them to Enjoy His Sufficient Grace and His Power to Tabernacle over Them</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ lives in the believers for them to enjoy His sufficient grace and His power to tabernacle over them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was Paul's experience in 2 Corinthians 12.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul suffered from a "thorn in the flesh" v. 7 , and he entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from him v. 8 . However, the Lord said to him, "My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness" v. 9 . Accepting the Lord's word, Paul could say, "Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me" v. 9 . Instead of removing the thorn, the Lord supplied Paul with the sufficient grace to enable him to endure the suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then in Paul's experience this grace became the power that is made perfect in weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The grace mentioned in 2 Corinthians 12:9 is not something done by the Lord or given by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is the Lord Himself within us, supporting us, energizing us, and strengthening us to meet the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a living grace, a real grace, and it is nothing less than Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God dispensed into our being for our enjoyment in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, we need to learn not to expect to receive something outwardly or to have something done by the Lord for us, but expect simply to enjoy the Lord Himself as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Greek word translated "tabernacle" in 2 Corinthians 12:9 is episkenoo, a compound verb composed of epi and skenoo.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Skenoo, meaning to dwell in a tent, is used in John 1:14 and Revelation 21:3.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Episkenoo here means to fix a tent or a habitation upon.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It portrays how the power of Christ, even Christ Himself, dwells upon us as a tent spread over us, overshadowing us in our weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sufferings and trials are often the Lord's ordination for us so that, through the divine dispensing, we may experience Christ as grace and power.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In his experience Paul realized that the Lord's grace became power spread over him like a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, this grace-power became a dwelling place for Paul in his sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As Paul was suffering, he could dwell in the tabernacle spread over him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This tabernacle, this tent, sustained him, supported him, maintained him, and kept him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To show forth the perfectness of Christ's power, our weakness is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this reason, Paul would most gladly boast in his weaknesses, that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Grace is the supply, and power is the strength, the ability, of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Both are actually the resurrected Christ Himself, who is now the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us for our enjoyment.</S>
