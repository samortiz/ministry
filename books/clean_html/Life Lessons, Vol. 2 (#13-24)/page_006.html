<h2 class=head2>D. Meeting for Reading the Word</h2><p>1)“And having gathered the multitude together, they handed them the letter [written by the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem]. And when they read it, they rejoiced at the consolation” (Acts 15:30-31).<p>Here it says that when Paul and his companions arrived in Antioch, they gathered the saints together to read to them the letter written by the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem under the leading of the Holy Spirit. Hence, we may also need to meet together occasionally to read the word of God in the Bible.<h2 class=head2>E. Meeting to Listen to Messages</h2><p>1)“When we gathered together…Paul discoursed with them, about to go forth on the next day” (Acts 20:7).<p>On that day, the believers in Troas met together to listen to Paul discoursing with them concerning the spiritual things of God, that they might be edified and established. Therefore, sometimes we should also meet to listen to spiritual messages spoken for God by the Lord’s minister of the word that we may be edified and established.<h2 class=head1>V. HOW TO MEET</h2><p>1)“For where…are gathered together into My name, there I am in their midst” (Matt. 18:20).<p>The most crucial thing in the believers’ meeting is to be gathered into the Lord’s name. This means that we have to meet in the name of the Lord. Since we are the Lord’s and were saved by His name, we should gather only into that name and meet in that name. We must not gather into and meet in any other name, whether it is the name of an individual, of a corporate body, of a mission, or of a denomination.<p><B>2)“And [1] day by day, [2] continuing steadfastly [3] with one accord [4] in the temple and breaking bread [5] from house to house” (Acts 2:46).</B><p>This verse reveals to us that we should, first, meet daily; second, meet steadfastly and continually; third, meet with one accord; fourth, meet in a large place (such as the temple); and fifth, meet from house to house, that is, meet in every home.<p><B>3)“The whole church comes together in one place” (1 Cor. 14:23).</B><p>On the one hand, the church should meet continually in the homes of the believers; on the other hand, sometimes it is also necessary for the whole church to come together in one place. Separate home meetings, which should be regular, and meetings in one place, which should be held according to need, both have their own benefits and flavor. Thus, the church should have regular separate home meetings and should gather together in one place as the need arises.
