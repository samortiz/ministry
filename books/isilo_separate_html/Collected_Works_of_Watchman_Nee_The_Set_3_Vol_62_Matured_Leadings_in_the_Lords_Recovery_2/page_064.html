It is difficult to bring the gospel to a campus from outside. But it is easy if some preach the gospel within the campus. In Taichung, Taiwan, one state-run agricultural school had only a few brothers and sisters. In less than half a year, the number increased to twenty or thirty people. Outwardly, the brothers and sisters were studying in that school. Actually, they were there for the gospel. Like Paul, we must be persons who are full of gospel germs (Acts 24:5; 26:29). The gospel has to spread out through us and infect others. The same can be said about our occupation. Those who hold some kind of occupation must be clear that their real occupation is the preaching of the gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">AN ADDITIONAL WORD</h2><p>Watchman Nee: I have only a little to add to what was already said. Concerning all the services, the responsible brothers and sisters must start discussing, fellowshipping, and finalizing the steps to implement the various works.</p><p>The gospel work in the schools must not be done by one person on a campus alone. We should have at least two students on a campus.</p><p>The arrangement of the brothers' and sisters' occupations requires much fellowship. This is not a simple matter.</p><h2 class="head1">PRESENTING OUR ALL FOR THE GOSPEL</h2><p>In order to have the gospel spirit, not only must we offer up ourselves, but we need to accept the Lord's dealing. I can never forget what happened at 2:30 p.m. on February 13, 1922. Prior to that time I was seeking for the filling of the Holy Spirit. For a period of time I fasted and prayed in the park every Saturday in order that I would be equipped with the power of the gospel for preaching on Sunday morning. But the Lord was dealing with my entanglements. One day I yielded to the Lord's dealing. Brother Weigh knows that I cared very much for good clothing. I had a special fondness for silk gowns with red dots. But that day I took off my nice clothes, put on some old and simple clothes, went to the kitchen to prepare some paste, took a stack of gospel pamphlets, and pasted them on the walls of the streets. I also went around the city passing out gospel tracts. This was an unprecedented move in Foochow at that time. Because of this, many people were saved. In 1923, eleven of us young people organized ourselves into gospel teams. We put on gospel T-shirts with gospel slogans in front and behind and paraded through the city for the gospel. This became quite a sensation, and there was a revival in the city of Foochow.</p><p>The fire of the gospel should not go out in us. After a man is saved, the gospel fire begins to burn within him. But many people do not allow this fire to carry them on to spread the gospel. We all must repent for quenching the gospel fire in the past. We have pursued what we should not have pursued. We must not allow the Holy Spirit to be trapped and confined by us. What we have spoken of here is based on the gospel work that we have been doing for many years. It is based on our experience. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we would all rise up to preach the gospel and save sinners.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> </body></html>
