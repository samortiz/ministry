        <h2 class="head1">CHRIST AND THE CHURCH<br />
BEING ONE AND INSEPARABLE</h2>
<p>Finally, we must have a deep impression that Christ and the church are one; the only difference is that Christ is the Head, and the church is the Body. Nevertheless, the two are joined together as one. If we see this point, we will see the relationship between Christ and the church. We will see that these two are so intimately related that they are inseparable. The only way to distinguish between them is to speak of Christ as the Head and of the church as the Body.</p>
<p>When we say that Christ is the Head and the church is the Body, we do not mean that only the Head has the element of God and only the Body has the element of man. Instead, the element in the Head is the same element in the Body. Just as the Head is the mingling of God and man, the Body is constituted of the same mingling of God and man. The relationship between Christ and the church is so intimate that the two are completely one and can never be separated.</p>
<p>Based on the three points presented above, we can now speak of some basic principles regarding the building up of the church. In order to take part in the building up of the church, we must know these three principles and hold fast to them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN<br />
BEING THE FIRST PRINCIPLE<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The church is not just divine, and neither is it merely human. If the church were merely divine or merely human, it would lose its true nature. The mingling of God and man manifests the true nature of the church.</p>
<p>When I was young, I had curious thoughts related to spiritual matters. On the one hand, I wanted God to speak to me directly. I felt that if God spoke to me personally, I would surely prostrate myself and worship Him. On the other hand, I was not particularly enthusiastic about listening to brothers who would speak to me. I did not even feel very uplifted when I listened to a brother giving a message. I wanted only God to speak to me directly from heaven.</p>
<p>However, God does not speak directly to us in the church; rather, He speaks through man and from within man. When someone is speaking in the church, God is speaking. A direct speaking from God is not in the principle of the church. We must grasp the principle of the church&mdash;the church is God mingled with man. When God speaks to people today, He does so by being mingled with man.</p>
<p>The entire New Testament was written based on this principle. Although we speak of Paul&rsquo;s Epistles as being God&rsquo;s word, these words were written by Paul, a man. He even said that what he wrote was only his opinion; nevertheless, he also said, &ldquo;But I think that I also have the Spirit of God&rdquo; (1 Cor. 7:40). Paul&rsquo;s writing was according to the Lord, and his speaking was also the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. This is the principle of the church. The church is the mingling of God and man. When the church speaks on God&rsquo;s behalf, it means that some have allowed God to be mingled with them in their speaking. If only God is speaking, the church is not involved, and if only man is speaking, the church is not involved either because the Holy Spirit has no outlet and God has no ground. If man is independent from God and separated from God, speaking only from himself, then the church will not be manifested. God without man is not the church. God and man must be mingled in order for the church to be manifested. This is a great principle. God has no desire for our humanity to be annulled in order for us to be spiritual.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man&rsquo;s Humanity Not Being Annulled<br />
in the Church</h2>
<p>When I was young, I also had the strange thought that those who are spiritual would act more like a spirit than a man. However, even if this were possible, the church would not be manifested. According to the principle of the church, no matter how spiritual a person is, he is still a man. God&rsquo;s desire is for a spiritual man, not a spiritual spirit. God will never annul our humanity. If our humanity is annulled, the church will not be manifested. However, if only our humanity is manifested, this is not the church either. A church that completely annuls humanity is not the church, but a church that has only humanity is also not the church. Only the mingling of God and man, the mingling of humanity with divinity, results in the church.</p>
<p>Some teachings in the Bible seem to indicate that we should shun many things that are regarded as human. On the one hand, the Bible says that God&rsquo;s children should not love the world (1 John 2:15), should not love their parents, wife, or children above the Lord (Matt. 10:37; Luke 14:26), and should not love outward adornments (1 Tim. 2:9). These teachings are quite good, but on the other hand, this does not mean that God has no regard for our humanity. The Bible never speaks of dressing sloppily or of forgetting about our parents, wife, or children. God wants us to be human and even to uplift our humanity. It is not easy for us to be balanced; we tend to veer from one extreme to another.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are often bizarre and strange. A brother once asked, &ldquo;Brother Lee, do you love your children?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;How can I not love my children?&rdquo; He responded, &ldquo;I thought that people who are serving the Lord would be very cold and indifferent toward their children.&rdquo; Then I said to him, &ldquo;If that were the case, I would not have a heart, and I would not be a human being.&rdquo; When another brother saw that I was dressed neatly, he said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I am rather amazed that you dress so neatly.&rdquo; I responded by asking, &ldquo;Must I dress sloppily in order to be spiritual?&rdquo; Another brother once sat next to me and said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I am amazed that your shoes are always polished and shining.&rdquo; I then asked him, &ldquo;According to your thought, what should be the condition of my shoes?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;I thought that you would not have the time to polish your shoes since you are very busy working for the Lord.&rdquo; Then I asked him, &ldquo;If I only polished my shoes once a year, would I be a proper human being?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are two sides to every matter. Being fashionable and adorning ourselves are one thing, whereas conducting ourselves properly and dressing neatly are another thing. Loving our children above the Lord is one thing, whereas loving our children before God is another thing. God does not annul our humanity. A church should not be so spiritual that it forsakes what is properly human in order to be like angels. Such a church is not the church. A church should be filled with humanity as well as divinity. The church is both divine and human, human and divine. If we do not grasp this basic principle, there will be problems in the building up of the church.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
