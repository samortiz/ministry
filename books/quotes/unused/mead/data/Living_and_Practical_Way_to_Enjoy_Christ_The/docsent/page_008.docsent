   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ is the treasure, and He is the hope of glory 2 Cor 4:7; Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the time you have to treasure Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whenever you think about Him, mention Him, or call on Him, you have a sweet sense within you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This inner sweetness makes us "crazy" with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Regardless of whether you are young or old, if you have never been crazy with Jesus, you are not that qualified to be a good Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The best qualification for you to be a Christian is to be crazy with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some in the older generation may say that this is good only for the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But we older ones also need to be crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I hope that the church meetings will be carried away by the shouting and praising of the older generation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all should declare, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jesus is Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is Victor!"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This kind of praising should be a part of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are not actors and actresses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to live this way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to be crazy with Jesus in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you have no human being to speak to about Jesus, you can speak to your dog.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You can say, "Little dog, I am much better than you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have a spirit that you don't have.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am the container of Jesus and Jesus is within me."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am not joking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are too religious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we Christians would be so crazy with Jesus, many people would be brought to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we are crazy with Jesus, we are being filled up with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I was young, I was taught how to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After reading some books on how to be holy, I tried to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I was told that in order to be holy I had to be slow in doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I did my best to try to be slow, but I was a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Later I read some more spiritual books which told me that two thousand years ago I was crucified with Christ on the cross, resurrected, and seated in the third heaven with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then I was told that I have to believe what the holy Word says.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It says that I have been crucified, so I have to believe that I have been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It says that I have been raised up and have been seated in the third heaven with Christ, so I have to believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But this did not work for me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I tried all kinds of practices taught by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, I found out that the Christian life is not a matter of being taught or a matter of certain practices.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is a matter of being filled with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you are crazy with Jesus in your daily life, you will really be in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you are crazy in your home with Jesus, you will find that you are really resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be crazy means to be filled up with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The last time the Lord Jesus entered Jerusalem while He was on this earth, the people around Him were crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They spread their garments on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Luke 19:37 says, "All the multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some of the Pharisees, the "reasonable" ones, the "logical" ones, the "uncrazy" ones, came to Jesus and told Him to rebuke His disciples v. 39 . Jesus said, "If these shall be silent, the stones will cry out" v. 40 . Matthew 21 tells us that when the children were crying out and praising the Lord, the chief priests and scribes were indignant.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then Jesus said to them, "Have you never read, Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings You have perfected praise'?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are the containers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to be crazy to praise Him because He is the hope of glory and the heavenly treasure as our content.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is worthy to be praised.</S>
