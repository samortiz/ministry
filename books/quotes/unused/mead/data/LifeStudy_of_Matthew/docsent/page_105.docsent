   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. FASTING WITHOUT THE BRIDEGROOM A. The Disciples of John and the Pharisees</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As a book of doctrine, Matthew presents us another case in 9:14-17: the case of fasting without the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 14 says, Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 10 through 13 record the Lord s dealing with the question of the Pharisees, who were in the old religion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now in verses 14 through 17 the Lord deals with the problem of John s disciples who were in the new religion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John the Baptist dropped the old religion and began his ministry in the wilderness outside of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, after a short time, his disciples formed a new religion to frustrate men from enjoying Christ, just as the Pharisees in the old religion did.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John the Baptist s ministry was to introduce men to Christ that Christ might become their Redeemer, their life, and their all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, some of his disciples drifted away from his goal, Christ, to some of John s practices and turned those practices into a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be religious means to do something for God without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To do anything without the presence of Christ, even though it is scriptural and fundamental, is religious.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both the disciples of John, the new-timers of religion, and the Pharisees, the old-timers of religion, fasted much, yet without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They did not own Christ as the Bridegroom, but made fasting a matter of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Meanwhile, they condemned the disciples of Christ who did not fast, but had Christ with them and lived in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John the Baptist was born a priest, but later he fully abandoned everything religious.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, less than three years after he had been put into prison, his disciples formed a new religion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To have a religion is to worship God, to serve God, and to do certain things to please God, yet without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A religion is anything you do for God without the Spirit, without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Pharisees did a great many things for God, but Christ was not in them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They did many things to serve God, but they did them without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now the disciples of John the Baptist were fasting without Christ, without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nevertheless, this fasting was for God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, they formed another religion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, in verse 14 we have the old religion, the religion of the Pharisees, and the new religion, the religion of the disciples of John.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How easy it is to have a religion!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not think that you can be free from religion by simply dropping an old way and picking up another way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No matter whether the way is old or new, it is a religion as long as it does not have Christ and the Spirit in it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Your new way may simply be your new religion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Remember what religion is: it is doing things to please God apart from Christ and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The self-righteous Pharisees, the old-timers of religion, were bothered by the fact that Christ made Himself a companion of tax collectors and sinners, who were condemned by them v. 11 . They condemned Him for feasting with the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The fasting disciples of John, the new-timers of religion, were troubled by the feasting of Christ and His disciples v. 10 and condemned them for not fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The situation is similar today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On every hand the religionists condemn us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What then should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should stay with the Physician.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>B. Not Fasting with the Bridegroom</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the case of the new religion, the Lord is not only the Physician, but also the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 15 the Lord Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both the Physician and the Bridegroom are pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I appreciate the Lord s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the case concerning the Pharisees, He likened Himself to a Physician.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now in the case with the disciples of John, He likens Himself to a bridegroom at a wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord asked if the sons of the bridechamber can mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a joyful time with the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But when the Bridegroom is taken away, they may fast.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The phrase sons of the bridechamber refers to the disciples of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the transitory period of the Lord s ministry on earth, His disciples were sons of the bridechamber.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Later they will become the Bride John 3:29; Rev 19:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bridegroom was taken away from the sons of the bridechamber when the kingly Savior was taken up from the disciples into heaven Acts 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After that, they fasted Acts 13:2-3; 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In dealing with the self-righteous and dissenting Pharisees of the old religion, the kingly Savior indicated that He was a Physician to heal the sick v. 12 . In dealing with the fasting and dissenting disciples of John who had formed the new religion, He revealed Himself as a Bridegroom to take the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>John the Baptist told his disciples that Christ was the Bridegroom to take the Bride John 3:25-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now Christ, the kingly Savior, reminded some of them of this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The kingly Savior firstly healed His followers, then made them the sons of the bridechamber.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Eventually He will make them His Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They should appropriate Him not only as their Physician for the recovery of their life, but also as their Bridegroom for a living of enjoyment in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They were at a joyful wedding with Him, not at a sorrowful funeral without Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How then could they fast and not feast before Him?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This dissenting question indicates that some of John s disciples had fallen into a new religion and also had rejected the kingly Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The question of John s disciples seemed to be one of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But the Lord did not answer with a doctrine, but with a Person, the most pleasant Person, the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The religious people always care for their doctrine with their doctrinal reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But Christ cares only for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The living and walk of His followers should be regulated and directed only by His Person and His presence, not by any doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It would be ridiculous for someone to fast at a wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Moreover, to fast while others are enjoying the wedding feast would be an insult to the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Here we see the Lord s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He did not argue with them, but He certainly condemned the religious ones.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord seemed to be saying, You religious people have missed the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Don t you realize that I am the Bridegroom and that all My disciples around Me are the sons of the bridechamber?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They shouldn t be fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They must feast with Me. Without these two cases, the Lord Jesus could never have been revealed as the Physician and as the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should thank the Lord for the Pharisees and for the disciples of John.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should even thank the Lord for all the religions, for without the occasions afforded by religion the Lord could not be revealed in so many different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is the same today.</S>
