   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MIRACLES AND WORKS OF WONDERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I believe in miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe that the Lord Jesus healed the sick and cast out demons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is the Son of God, and it is a natural thing for Him to perform miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is the Creator of heaven and earth; healing and casting out demons are small things to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in the Bible, when men tempted the Lord and asked Him for a miracle, He would not grant their request Matt 16:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord did not want people to believe in Him because of miracles John 4:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After He healed someone on earth, He would charge him not to publicize it and not to speak about it Matt 8:4; Mark 5:43; 7:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our Lord Jesus does not want men to follow Him out of curiosity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even when many believed in Him because of the miracles, He would not commit Himself to them John 2:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In John 6 five thousand ate of the loaves and the fishes that the Lord gave, yet in the end they forsook Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Real knowledge of the Lord is not based on outward miracles and works of wonders but on the word of God and the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We believe that the seventy disciples were able to subdue the demons Luke 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We also believe that Peter, John, Stephen, and Paul all performed miracles, healed the sick, and cast out demons Acts 3:2-8; 6:8; 9:36-41; 14:8-18; 16:16-18; 28:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We believe the words of Mark 16:17, which says, "And these signs will accompany those who believe: in My name..."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the Bible shows us that we should not rally men around us or attract them by miracles, works of wonders, healings, and the casting out of demons, because these things are not the center of salvation; they cannot occupy too great of a place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The only thing we should exalt is the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not scriptural for anyone to exclusively seek after miracles and works of wonders or for anyone to exclusively speak about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who do can be easily deceived and obsessed by Satan because the false prophet and Antichrist can also perform great miracles and wonders Matt 24:24; Mark 13:22; 2 Thes 2:9-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, brothers and sisters, we should have a proper understanding of the power of God and not be curious about miracles and works of wonders.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>VISIONS AND DREAMS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is true that in the Old Testament God taught His people by means of visions and dreams at times.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But instances of this nature were not very frequent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the New Testament, particularly after the coming of the Holy Spirit, there were even less occurrences.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although there are still cases of visions and dreams, this only happens for a special reason because in the New Testament age, the Holy Spirit is in us and God is teaching us all things through the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God wants us to know His heart according to the Bible on one hand, and according to the sense of life on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The New Testament mentions a few cases of visions and dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, at the house of Simon the tanner, Peter saw the great sheet with all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of heaven in it Acts 10:9-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why did the Lord give Peter such a vision?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was because Peter had a deep prejudice against the Gentiles at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord used the vision to remove his prejudice and open the way for the gospel to go to the Gentiles at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul also saw a few visions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Twice when he was in peril, God comforted and strengthened him through visions 18:9; 27:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Another time Paul saw a Macedonian standing and entreating him in a vision, saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help us."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After Paul saw the vision, he was ready to go.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the writer of the Bible added, "...concluding that God had called us to announce the gospel to them" 16:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The use of the word "concluding" means that Paul did not consider the vision as the only means of guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Visions and dreams have their place in the Bible, but they cannot be our only guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even after one has received a vision or a dream, the guidance must still conform to the Scriptures, the teaching of the anointing within, and circumstantial arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After Peter saw the vision at Joppa, there was an immediate confirmation in the environment Cornelius sent men to him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, a vision or a dream is reliable only if it matches the words of the Scriptures, the teaching of the anointing, and the confirmation of the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, visions and dreams must also be meaningful and purposeful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the New Testament age, visions and dreams are not God's usual means of giving guidance to men.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even when a person has a vision or a dream, this does not mean that he must tell others about it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul had the experience of the third heaven, yet he spoke only reluctantly about it after fourteen years 2 Cor 12:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a man always claims that he is seeing visions and dreams, there must be some problem with his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must realize that many sudden thoughts are injected into our mind by evil spirits from outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some believers experience flashes of thoughts in their mind which supposedly give them understanding, realization, and revelation of some special things or suggestions to do this or that.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These thoughts should be rejected because they are not from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The evil spirits not only inject thoughts into the believers' mind, but they display all kinds of images in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some are wonderful images that the believers love, while others are filthy ones that their conscience abhors.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But whether they are beautiful or ugly, good or bad, as long as a believer does not have the strength to stop these images from coming into his mind, it means that he is already deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are natural dreams and supernatural dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some of them are from God, and some of them are from the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Except the dreams that are produced as a result of man's physiological and psychological activities, all other dreams are supernatural.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some believers are mentally unstable as a result of shock or illness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They open their mind to evil spirits because they do not know the Bible, and as a result, they are filled with dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must realize that dreams from God make a person normal, peaceful, stable, sensible, and conscious, while dreams from evil spirits are always strange, vain, absurd, foolish, and irrational.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Brothers and sisters, do not think that all visions and dreams are good.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must remember that many visions and dreams are not from God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must not receive them; rather, we must reject them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only then will we not be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some people are psychologically ill or deceived by evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They may even be possessed by evil spirits or demons.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In their mind they have some kind of illusion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They are often proud and subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They often think that they are great prophets or apostles raised up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must realize that a man who is deceived by evil spirits is one who is very self-confident; he does not easily take the advice of others, and he does not easily believe in the feeling of other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>These visions and dreams attract ignorant, immature, and curious believers because they have a supernatural element.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They think that they are great prophets and apostles raised up by God, and other immature believers also think that they are great prophets and apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some even go to them and inquire of them as if they were God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is absolutely unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Bible shows us in the New Testament that there are only prophets in the church; God does not allow any of His children to be a prophet to an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the New Testament, God's law is not written in outward tablets of stone but in our heart Heb 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Everyone who has the life of God has this innate ability to know God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the New Testament, God does not allow anyone to be a prophet to an individual or to substitute for a believer's knowing of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must ask the Lord to deliver us from curiosity so that we do not fall into deception.</S>
