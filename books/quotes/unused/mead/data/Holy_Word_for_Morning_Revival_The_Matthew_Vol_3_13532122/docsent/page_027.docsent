   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 19:3-5, 7-12</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>3 And some Pharisees came to Him, testing Him and saying, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>4 And He answered and said, Have you not read that 1 He who created them from the beginning made them male and female,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>5 And said, "For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh"?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>7 They said to Him, Why then did Moses 1 command us to give her a certificate of divorce and divorce her?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>8 He said to them, Moses, because of your hardness of heart, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the 1 beginning it has not been so.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>9 But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for 1 fornication, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her who has been divorced commits adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>10 His disciples said to Him, If the case of the man with his wife is like this, it is not profitable to marry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>11 And He said to them, 1 Not all men can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>12 For there are eunuchs who were born so from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs 1 who made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He who can accept it, let him accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>4 1 From here to the end of v. 6, the Lord's word not only acknowledged God's creation of man but also confirmed God's ordination regarding man's marriage, that is, that one male and one female are to be joined and yoked together as one flesh and are not to be separated by man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>7 1 This commandment was not a part of the basic law but was a supplement to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was given by Moses not according to God's ordination from the beginning but as something temporary, because of the hardness of man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>8 1 The commandment given by Moses concerning divorce was a deviation from God's original ordination concerning marriage, but for the kingdom of the heavens Christ as the heavenly King recovered marriage back to the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that the kingdom of the heavens, which corresponds with God's ordination from the beginning, does not allow divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>9 1 Lit. harlotry, whoredom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is worse than adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord's word here indicates definitely that nothing but fornication breaks the marriage tie.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Of course, death breaks it spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, except for fornication there is no excuse for divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>11 1 Not all men, but only those to whom God has given the gift, are able to refrain from marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without God's gift, anyone who attempts to remain unmarried will meet with temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>12 1 These are the ones to whom God has given the gift to remain unmarried for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul was such a one 1 Cor 7:7-8; 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A eunuch is one who deals thoroughly with lust.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to be such a spiritual eunuch, we need grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By grace it is possible to deal with the subtle, evil "scorpion" of lust that damages our life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The religionists' temptation here in verse 3 afforded the Lord an opportunity to reveal a further matter concerning the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Chapter eighteen reveals how we must deal with the brothers so that we can enter into the kingdom of the heavens, whereas this chapter reveals that marriage life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>3-12 and our attitude toward riches vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>16-30 are related to the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Marriage life touches the matter of lust, and our attitude toward riches touches the matter of covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The kingdom of the heavens rules out every trace of our lust and covetousness.</S>
