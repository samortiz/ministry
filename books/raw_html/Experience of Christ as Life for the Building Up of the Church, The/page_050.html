<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Ability to Bear Responsibility</H2><P>With the compound ointment, there is also the number five. The four spices plus the one hin of olive oil are five ingredients. In the Bible the number five signifies responsibility and the ability for bearing responsibility. Five is composed of four plus one. We may use the human hand as an illustration. On our hand we have four fingers and a thumb. Because of this our hand can do many things and bear responsibility.</P><P>In the Bible there are clear illustrations of the fact that five is the number of responsibility. The Ten Commandments were written on two tablets, five on each tablet. These five commandments on each tablet signify responsibility. Also, there are the ten virgins in Matthew 25. They are divided into two groups: five wise ones and five foolish ones. This shows that all the believers bear the responsibility of being filled with the Spirit.</P><P>We creatures are signified by the number four, and God is signified by the number one. When God is added to us, we have the ability to bear responsibility. Once we were the number four, but we have had the unique God added to us. Now we are the number five. Being without God is like having four fingers without a thumb. Just as it is awkward not to have a thumb, it is more than awkward not to have God.</P><P>As we have seen, there are three units of five hundred shekels of the spices. Thus, there is three times five hundred, and five hundred is one hundred times five. This signifies that in this compound ointment there is the fullness of ability for bearing responsibility.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Compound Ointment for God's Building</H2><P>Five and three are the basic numbers in the compound ointment. As we have seen, three is the number of the Godhead, and there are three units of five hundred shekels in the ointment. The second unit of five hundred shekels is split in half, indicating that the Second of the Divine Trinity was split on the cross. In the compound ointment, there are four spices added to one hin of olive oil. Five is four plus one&#151;the creature plus the Creator to be the ability to bear responsibility.</P><P>I would like us to read a few portions from the Bible to see more of the significance of the numbers five and three.</P><P>Let us first consider the dimensions of the ark, which Noah built, in Genesis 6. After God created everything, He intended to build up something. The first item of God's building was the ark of Noah. The ark is the seed of God's building, and the New Jerusalem is the harvest of God's building. From this seed the New Jerusalem grows out and grows up.</P><P>The numbers three and five are prevalent in the dimensions of the ark, the first item of God's building. Genesis 6:15 says, "And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits." Verse 16 says that the ark was to be made with "lower, second, and third stories." Here with the dimensions of the ark, we have multiples of the numbers three and five. Three, the number of the Triune God, and five, the number of responsibility, the number of God added to man, are the numbers of God's building.</P>
