   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was used by God to lead the children of Israel out of Pharaoh s usurpation and Egypt s tyranny; he further led them to Mount Sinai to serve and to offer sacrifices to God, to build the tabernacle, and to go through the trials in the wilderness.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He predicted that the children of Israel would forsake God and be cast by God into all the nations, but that when they would repent and turn to God, He would gather them from the nations Deut 29:25-28; 30:1, 3 .</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Formerly, the priests occupied an important position, because the people needed to go through the priests when they served and drew near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But from the time that God established Samuel as the prophet, and after the death of the priest Eli, the priests no longer occupied the position of importance.</S>
