   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At various times, Gregory of Nyssa A.D.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>330-395 was attacked both for being modalistic and also for being tritheistic, depending upon what Scriptures he used in expounding the incomprehensible mystery of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>39 In On the Holy Trinity Gregory of Nyssa says:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They charge us with preaching three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then truth fights on our side, for we show both publicly to all men, and privately to those who converse with us, that we anathematize any man who says that there are three Gods, and hold him to be not even a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then, as soon as they hear this, they find Sabellius a handy weapon against us, and the plague that he spread is the subject of continual attacks upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>40</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Marcellus of Ancyra A.D. 320-374 is a notable example of one who was misunderstood and misrepresented.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As he wrote against Arius and tritheism, he sounded like a modalist and was accused of teaching a refined form of Sabellianism and was, thereby, condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But his followers presented a statement of belief which clearly anathematized Sabellius and modalism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Thus the problem of misunderstanding and even outright misrepresentation had again surrounded the struggle to be able to utter the mystery of the Triune God without being placed in a false position by the opposers."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>41</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jonathan Edwards, a highly respected servant of the Lord, was accused of both tritheism and modalism.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He wrote a book entitled Observations Concerning the Scripture Economy of the Trinity and Covenant of Redemption, for which he came under attack by one writer who said:</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The writer is informed on unquestionable authority that there is, or was, in existence a manuscript of Edwards, in which his views appear to have undergone a great change in the direction of Arianism or of Sabellianism.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>42</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is well to give here other examples of church Fathers who were accused of modalism, tritheism, or both.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Tertullian A.D. 160-220 , who was a leader in the fight against modalism and who is regarded as orthodox and fundamental, was accused of Arianism by one who said, "Tertullian, prior to his falling into the heresy of Montanus, entertained the same opinions as those of Arius, concerning the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit." 43</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Dionysius of Alexandria A.D. 190-265 is another example of the misunderstanding concerning the discussions of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was strong to oppose Sabellius, but in doing so he appeared to lean to the other extreme and was charged with teaching tritheism.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was accused by some of treason against the faith before the Bishop of Rome and was asked by a synod of bishops to declare his views.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In his reply, Dionysius denied that he had separated the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, since each necessarily implied the others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>44 His reason for not using the term homoousios meaning "of one substance" was that he did not find it in Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was fully vindicated by his writing, and Athanasius, a defender of the Nicene Creed, informs us that Dionysius held right views concerning the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, some who had not read his replies to the Bishop of Rome or Athanasius's vindications of him still persisted in accusing him of tritheism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>45</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Augustine A.D. 354-430 , one of the most important writers on the orthodox view of the Trinity, was accused of being a modalist.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His emphasis on the oneness of God laid him open to the charge of modalism.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In stressing the unity of operation of the Three, Augustine differed considerably from those Fathers who spoke as if each Person had a distinct role in external activities.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>46 Adolf Harnack, a renowned authority in the history of dogma, said, "We can see that Augustine only gets beyond Modalism by the mere assertion that he does not wish to be a Modalist, and by the aid of ingenious distinctions between different ideas."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>47</S>
