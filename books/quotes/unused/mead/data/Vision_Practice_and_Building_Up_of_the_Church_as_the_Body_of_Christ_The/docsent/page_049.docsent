   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN FIVE PRACTICAL MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: Eph 4:1-3</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Bible students agree that the book of Ephesians may be divided into two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first section of three chapters gives us a revelation, a definition, of the church, showing us what the church is, from where it comes, and where it stands.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then the second section of three chapters shows us how to realize the church life in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the opening of the section concerning the practice of the church life Paul says, I beseech you therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing one another in love, being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace 4:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many of us are very familiar with verses 24 and 25 of chapter 5, which are a charge to husbands and wives.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In addition, many Christians who talk about the church life pay attention to the seven ones in 4:4-6: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, not many Christians pay adequate attention to verses 1 through 3.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul was a prisoner not merely in a physical prison, and he was not only imprisoned for the Lord; he was a prisoner in the Lord v. 1 . He had lost his liberty in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As such a one he besought the Ephesians to live a life worthy of the calling with which they were called.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a young Christian I thought that God s calling was for us to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the whole book of Ephesians, though, our calling is to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ephesians is not a book about the heavens nor even about salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is a book on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This book tells us that God has called us for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s election of us includes two ends.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At one end is His choosing, and at the other end there is His calling.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His choosing was in eternity, but His calling is in time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to 1:4-5 God predestinated us, He marked us out beforehand for His eternal purpose concerning the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Likewise, His calling in time is also for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to have a walk, to live a life, worthy of our calling for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT, WHICH IS CHRIST HIMSELF AS THE SPIRIT WITHIN US</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first item of the Christian walk that is worthy of God s calling is that we must be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the Greek text, to be diligent includes the meaning of striving and struggling.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To keep the oneness is not an easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This oneness is already within us, so there is no need to attain, gain, or receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What we need today is to keep, preserve, and maintain what we already have gained.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For this purpose we need to be diligent, and strive, struggle, and even fight to keep, maintain, and preserve the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just as the current of electricity is the electricity itself, the oneness of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the time we believed in the Lord Jesus, this wonderful, inexhaustible Spirit came into us as the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We know this in a practical way because we have loved the brothers and have wanted to contact them since the day we believed in the Lord Jesus and He came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before I was saved, I saw many Christian preachers and ministers, and I was raised under them, but I hated them and all Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I used to say, Look at those poor Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I would rather follow Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The followers of Confucius are much better than the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This was my slogan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, on the day that I was saved, the whole universe changed for me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christians became so dear to me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I loved everyone who said that he was a Christian, and I wanted to be with the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes when people ask me how they can know if they are saved, I reply, Do you now love the believers?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If anyone says that he still hates Christians, I do not believe that he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At first I thought this was my own concept, but then I read 1 John 3:14-15, which indicates that the love for the brothers is a proof that we have eternal life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, the genuine oneness is the very Spirit who is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every real Christian has this oneness, which is nothing less than the living Lord Himself as the wonderful, all-inclusive life-giving Spirit who is within us 2 Cor 3:17; 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now what we need today is not to receive or gain this oneness but to endeavor, strive, and struggle to keep, maintain, and preserve the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>FIVE PRACTICAL MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Five phrases in Ephesians 4:1-3 give us the practical way to keep the oneness: lowliness, meekness, long-suffering, bearing one another in love, and the uniting bond of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not quickly think that we know what all these terms mean.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may know the meaning of these phrases from the dictionary, but we may not know their reality.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can know mainly from our experience what these matters are.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to my experience and learning in the past, these five items are a test to us in the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By this test we can see whether or not we are practically in the church life.</S>
