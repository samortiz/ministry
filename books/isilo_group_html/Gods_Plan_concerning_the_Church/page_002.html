<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>We will consider God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church from Ephesians 1 and 3. Verse 9 of chapter 3 says, &ldquo;To enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things.&rdquo; This verse says that a mystery was hidden in God, who created all things. Therefore, this mystery depends on God and is related to all things. In Greek <em>throughout the ages</em> can also be rendered &ldquo;from eternity.&rdquo; Hence, this mystery has been hidden in God from eternity. The word <em>economy</em> means &ldquo;management,&rdquo; &ldquo;administration,&rdquo; and &ldquo;arrangement.&rdquo; The mystery in verse 9 is managed by God and has been arranged by God.</p>
<p>Verse 10 says, &ldquo;In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church.&rdquo; This indicates that the economy of God&rsquo;s mystery is to have a church to express His wisdom. In the Bible wisdom includes everything related to God. God has arranged for the church to be the expression of His wisdom, that is, the expression of everything related to Him.</p>
<p>This expression is seen and made known to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies. Several verses in Ephesians are related to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies. Verse 21 of chapter 1 says, &ldquo;All rule and authority and power and lordship&rdquo;; verse 2 of chapter 2 says, &ldquo;The ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit which is now operating in the sons of disobedience&rdquo;; and verse 12 of chapter 6 says, &ldquo;Our wrestling is not against blood and flesh but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies.&rdquo; These verses reveal that the rulers and authorities are Satan and the angels under him. Therefore, the economy of God&rsquo;s mystery is to express His wisdom, which is everything related to Him, through the church so that the rebellious angels may be put to shame.</p>
<p>The economy of God&rsquo;s mystery, His arrangement, concerning the church is according to the plan that He made in Christ. Hence, 3:11 says, &ldquo;According to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; <em>Purpose</em> can also be rendered &ldquo;plan.&rdquo; This plan is eternal; hence, it is called the eternal purpose, or the eternal plan.</p>
<p>Verses 4 and 5 of chapter 1 say, &ldquo;He chose us in Him [Christ] before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love, predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.&rdquo; These verses reveal that God chose and predestinated us to be holy unto sonship, to be His sons.</p>
<p>According to verses 8 through 11, He caused grace to &ldquo;abound to us in all wisdom and prudence, making known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself, unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him; in whom also we were designated as an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One who works all things according to the counsel of His will.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>economy</em> in verse 10 is the same word used in 3:9 and means &ldquo;management,&rdquo; &ldquo;administration,&rdquo; and &ldquo;arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The above verses from chapters 1 and 3 reveal that the church was planned by God in eternity. The church is not an accident, nor did God improvise to have the church. The church was planned by God in eternity long before the foundation of the world. Most people have a natural concept concerning the church; they lack revelation. They think that the church is the gathering of a group of fallen and redeemed sinners to worship and serve God. This human concept is altogether according to time; it is not from eternity. Regardless of whether we are fallen or sinful, God in eternity past planned to have the church. Everything related to the church is out of God&rsquo;s eternal plan and is the issue of His arrangement.</p>
<p>Careful and enlightened readers of the Bible see that God&rsquo;s central purpose in creating the universe was to gain the church. Therefore, the church is the center of the universe and the goal of all things. If not for gaining the church, God would not have needed to create the universe and all things. The universe and all things were created for the church. God&rsquo;s plan, His desire, is to gain the church.</p>
<p>At the end of the Bible God&rsquo;s work will be completed. The ultimate manifestation of God&rsquo;s work takes the New Jerusalem as its center, the new creation as its means, and the new heaven and new earth as its realm (Rev. 21&mdash;22). The New Jerusalem is the ultimate and fullest manifestation of the church. Therefore, God created the universe and all things in order to gain the church. This is the purpose that God planned in eternity. We will now consider several points related to God&rsquo;s plan.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>God's Plan concerning the Church &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
