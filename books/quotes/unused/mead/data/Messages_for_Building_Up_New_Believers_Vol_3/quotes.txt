[1]  Messages for Building Up New Believers, Vol. 3 CONTENTS
[2]  The matter of recreation is never a problem to a consecrated person.
[3]  Anyone who is not absolute in his consecration has a problem with recreation.
[4]  Among God s children, the matter of recreation does not exist to those who are consecrated.
[5]  A man who has not settled the matter of consecration may approve what God disapproves.
[6]  There are many games, such as chess, ball games, and horse-riding, which can be considered proper activities, even though they contain the element of winning and losing.
[7]  Sixth, all recreation must match a person s fitness.
[8]  Seventh, recreation has to do not only with physical fitness but also with one s disposition.
[9]  When a person is doing what he likes to do, he tends to be more mentally relaxed and psychologically happy.
[10]  Doing something that you do not enjoy doing is a labor; it is not a recreation.
[11]  Ninth, we should not take up any recreation that is improper in the eyes of the Gentiles.
[12]  This does not mean that we can do anything that the Gentiles consider to be proper.
[13]  We may not necessarily do what they approve of, but we certainly will not do anything that they do not approve of.
[14]  NOT AFFECTING SPIRITUALITY A. Hopkins s Rabbits and Small Prints
[15]  CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX WORDS I. WORDS REVEALING A PERSON S HEART
[16]  Speaking occupies a great part of a person s life.
[17]  It is, in fact, a very crucial part of his life.
[18]  The Lord Jesus said that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks Matt 12:34 .
[19]  A person s words express his heart; they reveal the things in his heart.
[20]  A person s conduct may often give others the wrong impression, view, and judgment of him, but it is very easy to know a person through his words because no one can easily restrain or control his own words.
[21]  Once a person is saved and becomes God s child, the first lesson he needs to learn is to deal with his words before God.
[22]  A person is lying when he first says one thing and then turns around and says something else, when he first says yes and then no, when he first says that something is good and then says that it is bad, or when he first agrees that something is right and then says that it is wrong.
[23]  There is another type of lie which is very prevalent in the church exaggeration.
[24]  Please bear in mind that inaccurate numbers and inaccurate words, as well as the love of big words, strong words, or exaggerated words, are different forms of lies because there is falsehood in all of them.
[25]  Today if you want to know where a saint s heart is before the Lord, all you have to do is tell him something and ask him to tell others about it.
[26]  Another type of words which should never come out of our mouth is idle words.
[27]  Matthew 12:35-37 says, The good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things.
[28]  And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment.
[29]  Before the Lord Jesus said this, He said, Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for by the fruit the tree is known v. 33 . According to the context, the fruit does not refer to one s conduct, but to one s word.
[30]  This means that a person s words are good if that person is good, and a person s words are evil if that person is evil.
[31]  First Peter 3:9-12 says, Not rendering evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing one another, because you were called to this, that you might inherit blessing.
[32]  For he who desires to love life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips to speak no guile.
[33]  And let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it; for the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears incline to their petition; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
[34]  Verse 3 takes a bridle for an illustration, while verse 4 takes a rudder for an illustration.
[35]  Psalm 38:13-14 says, But I, like a deaf man, do not hear; / And I am like a dumb man, who does not open his mouth.
[36]  / Indeed I am like a man who does not hear / And in whose mouth there are no reproofs.
[37]  Many people indeed need to be as a deaf man who does not hear.
[38]  When others speak unbecoming things, you should act like a deaf man who does not hear anything.
[39]  We will now talk about clothing and food as they pertain to Christians.
[40]  When God instituted the law at Mount Sinai in Exodus, He commanded the Israelites to build an altar with no steps because He did not want their bodies to be exposed when they went up the steps to offer sacrifices.
[41]  The modern trend of exposing one s body is a violation of God s original principle.
[42]  First Peter 3:3-5 says, Let your adorning not be the outward plaiting of hair and putting on of gold or clothing with garments, but the hidden man of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of a meek and quiet spirit, which is very costly in the sight of God.
[43]  For in this manner formerly the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves.
[44]  The Seal of the Holy Spirit upon One s Clothing
[45]  Leviticus 8:30 says that, according to the command of God, Moses took some of the anointing oil...and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, on his sons and on the garments of his sons with him; and he sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons and the garments of his sons with him.
[46]  Let us come next to the matter of food.
[47]  In Genesis 2 God gave man food to sustain his life.
[48]  James, Peter, Paul, Barnabas, and other apostles of the Lord decided that God s children should be free from the law, but at the same time that they should abstain from sacrifices offered to idols, from fornication, and from blood.
[49]  Men of the past did not understand this, but one day God s Son came to the world and pronounced that He was the bread from heaven and that He came to be man s food.
[50]  In Leviticus 17, as well as in other portions of the Old Testament, there is also an ordinance against eating strangled animals.
[51]  This is the reason that God s children should reject all other blood; they should not eat it at all.
[52]  He said to the Lord, By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common and unclean v. 14 . Then a voice came to him the second time, saying, The things that God has cleansed, do not make common v. 15 . This occurred three times.
[53]  After the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, God told Peter to rise up, slay, and eat.
[54]  From that time forward, God s grace came upon the unclean Gentiles.
[55]  What God considered as unclean in the Old Testament is considered clean in the New Testament.
[56]  If we refrain from eating some things, we are saying that the Jews are God s people but that we are not.
[57]  Although a person may live in sin, he still cherishes certain lofty ideals.
[58]  Paul continues in verse 20: If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances?
[59]  If you have died, and death is a fact, you should no longer be as those living in the world.
[60]  Colossians 2:22 says, According to the commandments and teachings of men.
[61]  Men think that they cannot eat this, and that they must not touch that, but these are all teachings and commandments of men, not of God.
[62]  Paul criticized such ones for practicing self-imposed worship v. 23 . What are these ones like? They are, in reality, engaged in self-imposed worship.
[63]  The expression self-imposed worship can be translated as worship of the will.
[64]  God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit John 4:24 .
[65]  Colossians 3:1-3 says, If therefore you were raised together with Christ, seek the things which are above....Set your mind on the things which are above, not on the things which are on the earth.
[66]  For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
[67]  If we pay attention to what we should not touch, taste, or handle, we are setting our mind on the things of the earth.
[68]  Sex is right, and food is right, but both can turn into lust.
[69]  nor a Matter of Not Eating and Not Drinking
[70]  It is like little children sitting in the market places, who call to the others and say, We have played the flute to you, and you did not dance; we have sung a dirge, and you did not mourn.
[71]  Concerning illness, there are a few things we need to consider before God.
[72]  We absolutely believe that there are natural causes for sickness.
[73]  There are enough reasons and scientific proof to keep us from disputing the natural causes of sickness, but at the same time, we must acknowledge that many illnesses come upon God s children because of their sins.
[74]  It is sin against God, as described in chapter eleven of 1 Corinthians, that brings about illnesses.
[75]  Often when a person becomes sick, he can quickly discover how he has sinned against the Lord, in what matter he has been disobedient, and where he has turned against His word.
[76]  God s forgiveness of our sins is basically different from His healing of our diseases.
[77]  God s work is absolute; the work of the cross is so complete that sin has been absolutely taken away John 1:29 .
[78]  A BELIEVER S ATTITUDE TOWARD ILLNESS A. Discovering the Cause of an Illness
[79]  A believer should first go before the Lord to discover the cause of his illness.
[80]  Often our offense against natural laws is an offense against God, because these laws were created and ordained by God; God rules the universe through these natural laws.
[81]  When a person is sick, the first thing he should do is to discover the cause of his illness.
[82]  When a person is sick, and he has dealt with the Lord about his sickness, one of the things that he can do is to call for the elders of the church to anoint him.
[83]  ILLNESS AND GOD S DISCIPLINE A. God s Disciplining Hand
[84]  It is interesting to note that unbelievers often are easily healed, while Christians are not healed so easily.
[85]  The knife is not in just anyone s hand.
[86]  If the one who shaves my hair is my brother, I would not be scared even if he used a big knife.
[87]  However, they acknowledged that their illnesses were there to help them in their work; they learned to look after themselves and to be restricted for the sake of God s glory upon them.
[88]  It is true that God can heal us, but how do we know that He will heal us?
[89]  Suppose the Lord is not willing to heal us.
[90]  There are at least four different kinds of forgiveness in the Bible.
[91]  We will give a different name to each of them: First, there is eternal forgiveness.
[92]  If a believer desires to run a straight course in his spiritual pursuit, he must learn the meaning of God s governmental forgiveness.
[93]  The moment we believe in the Lord Jesus, we are forgiven of all our sins; the Lord removes all of our sins, and we are left with no trace of sin before God.
[94]  First John 1:7-9 says, If we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.
[95]  If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
[96]  After we have believed in the Lord and are saved, our fellowship with God and with other children of God can be interrupted if we offend Him.
[97]  A child of God does not lose his status as a child after he has sinned.
[98]  We call it forgiveness in fellowship because only when one turns back to God and confesses his sins can his fellowship with God be restored.
[99]  Otherwise, he has no way to fellowship with God.
[100]  He may not even be able to pray to God or say amen when others pray.
[101]  The father s hand has come in. When we sin against God, God will forgive us when we confess our sins to Him.
[102]  Many portions in the Bible point out similar things.
[103]  For example, Galatians 6:7 says, Whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.
[104]  To understand the significance of governmental forgiveness, we must consider the example of David in the Old Testament.
[105]  No portion of the Bible speaks of God s governmental forgiveness as clearly as the story of David with Uriah s wife.
[106]  His adultery was a sin against Uriah s wife, and his murder was a sin against Uriah himself.
[107]  He said, Nevertheless, because you have given the enemies of Jehovah much occasion to blaspheme Him because of this thing, the son who is born to you shall also surely die v. 14 . He also said, Now therefore the sword will not depart from your house forever because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife v. 10 . Finally, He said, I will now raise up trouble against you from within your house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and will give them to your companion, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
[108]  After Moses smote the rock in Meribah Num 20:10-12 , both he and Aaron fell under God s governmental hand.
[109]  After Aaron failed, God still allowed him to remain a priest and restored his fellowship with God.
[110]  Even though he wore the priestly robe, God nevertheless told him that he would not be able to live.
[111]  Brothers, the very day that you begin your Christian life, you should set a hope before you that you will stay on the course that God has measured to you, all the way to the end. Do not live loosely.
[112]  If God s governmental hand is already upon us and we are already sick or in the midst of some dire experiences or difficulties, we must remember to not resist God s government with our fleshly hand.
[113]  Two other portions of the Word speak about God s governmental hand: Matthew 6:15 and 18:23-35.
[114]  One very important thing can be found in these verses do not condemn others easily.
[115]  The Lord said that if you do not forgive others of their sins, God will also not forgive you of your sins.
[116]  If a brother offends such a one, and that one does not forgive his brother, God will not forgive him either.
[117]  If you keep complaining about the conduct of others and continue to count the ill treatment you receive from them, please bear in mind that this will bring you into God s governmental hand and it will not be easy to come out!
[118]  There is only one principle we can act upon when we fall into God s hand; that is, to humble ourselves under God s mighty hand.
[119]  CHAPTER FORTY-ONE THE DISCIPLINE OF GOD Scripture Reading: Heb 12:4-13 I. THE PROPER ATTITUDE
[120]  Verse 6 says, For whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives.
[121]  But once you have accepted the Lord Jesus as your Savior, once you are born of God and have become His child, you have to prepare yourself for His discipline.
[122]  C. Discipline Not Being a Punishment but a Glory
[123]  What we are receiving is discipline; it is not punishment.
[124]  Punishment is for the retribution of one s mistakes, while discipline is for the purpose of education.
[125]  Now we must be prepared to allow God to make us vessels of glory to Him.
[126]  I can say with much confidence that God wants every one of His children to glorify Him in certain areas.
[127]  The question today is: What kind of response do we have when others give us an ugly look?
[128]  If their look is God s discipline, how should we react?
[129]  If our business fails because others have forgotten to do something for us, how should we react?
[130]  If the poor memory of another person is God s discipline to us, what should we do?
[131]  If things do not go our way because God s discipline is behind them, what should we say?
[132]  If any child of God is foolish enough to think that there can be smooth sailing in his living and work and that he can be spared God s discipline, he is saying that he is illegitimate, that is, one who is adopted.
[133]  Verse 9 says, Furthermore we have had the fathers of our flesh as discipliners and we respected them; shall we not much more be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?
[134]  We must obey God in two matters: One is to obey God s commandments, and the other is to obey His discipline.
[135]  It is to make us partakers of His holiness.
[136]  It is for this that God uses many ways to discipline His children.
[137]  From the time we believed in the Lord, God has been disciplining us.
[138]  Verse 11 says, Now no discipline at the present time seems to be a matter of joy, but of grief; but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it.
[139]  Do not think that suffering is wrong when you experience God s discipline.
[140]  Here are some sobering words: His taste remains in him, / And his scent is not changed.
[141]  Because Moab was not emptied from vat to vat, from pot to pot, and from vessel to vessel, and because he was never disciplined and dealt with by God, his taste remained in him and his scent never changed!
[142]  Brothers, this is why God has to work on you.
[143]  God does not want your own taste and scent.
[144]  CHAPTER FORTY-TWO THE DISCIPLINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:28; Matt 10:29-31; Jer 48:11; Gen 47:7-10
[145]  We have believed in the Lord and have received a new life.
[146]  But there are many habits which we acquired before we believed in the Lord.
[147]  Many character traits and aspects of our disposition were part of us before we believed in the Lord.
[148]  This is the reason many people do not touch the new life or experience the Lord when they meet us.
[149]  God arranges the necessary environment for us, and unconsciously, we are broken and the Holy Spirit is constituted into us so that we acquire a character and disposition that resembles God.
[150]  The kinds of discipline that God arranges are as varied as the number of people there are.
[151]  Romans 8:28 says, And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.
[152]  If a man claims that he has no choice of his own, that he asks nothing for himself, and that he only wants everything that God gives to him, he should have only one desire in his heart to love God.
[153]  If we remember the Lord Jesus word, that not one of them will fall to the earth apart from your Father Matt 10:29 , and if we realize that everything is of God, we will humble ourselves under His hand and receive the good.
[154]  The Lord causes many things to come our way, few of which are according to our preference.
[155]  This is why the Bible charges, Rejoice in the Lord always Phil 4:4 .
[156]  CHAPTER FORTY-THREE WITHSTANDING THE DEVIL Scripture Reading: James 4:7; 1 Pet 5:8-9; 2 Cor 2:11
[157]  The devil is known also as Satan Rev 12:9 .
[158]  Later, he rebelled against God by uplifting himself to be equal to God.
[159]  Second Corinthians 10:4-5 says, For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful before God for the overthrowing of strongholds, as we overthrow reasonings and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ.
[160]  God has given us our mind; it is ours, not Satan s. We are the only ones who have the right to use our mind; Satan has no authority over our mind.
[161]  The Bible shows us clearly that many physical diseases are the result of Satan s attack.
[162]  The fever of Peter s mother-in-law was an attack from Satan, and the Lord Jesus rebuked the fever Luke 4:39 .
[163]  Something must have a personality before the Lord can rebuke it.
[164]  What is the difference between Satan s accusation and the Holy Spirit s reproach?
[165]  We must never add to the burden of the conscience of those under Satan s accusation.
[166]  Second, where there is the clear work of the Holy Spirit, we should raise the standard a little, for with the clear operation of the Spirit of the Lord and the spirit of revival, the Lord s word has the ability to uplift the capacity of a person.
[167]  If we raise the standard very high when the Spirit of the Lord has not done anything, we are not helping these accused ones to go on; rather, we are giving Satan opportunities to accuse them even more.
[168]  God s Word shows us clearly that the way to withstand Satan is by faith.
[169]  This is why He said, But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you Matt 12:28 .
[170]  Second, we must believe that through death the Lord Jesus has destroyed him who has the might of death, the devil Heb 2:14 .
[171]  The Lord s death pronounces the greatest defeat for the devil because the Lord s death is not only a punishment but also a way of salvation.
[172]  In Genesis 2:17 God spoke of death: For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
[173]  Third, we must believe that the Lord s resurrection has put Satan to shame.
[174]  Colossians 2:12 says, Buried together with Him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead.
[175]  Verse 13 tells us how we died and resurrected; verse 14 tells us what the Lord did at the time of His death; and verse 15 says that the Lord Jesus stripped off the rulers and the authorities and made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
[176]  Ephesians 1:20-22 says, Raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all...not only in this age but also in that which is to come; and He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.
[177]  This means that the Lord Jesus is already seated in the heavenlies and is far above all the power of Satan.
[178]  CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR HEAD COVERING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 11:2-16
[179]  First Corinthians 11:2-16 does not speak of believers as brothers and sisters; rather, it speaks of them as men and women.
[180]  It does not speak about our status in Christ, but rather of God s order in His creation.
[181]  It is not a relationship between God the Father and God the Son in the Trinity of the Godhead, but a relationship between God and the One whom He sent to earth and anointed to be the Christ.
[182]  In the garden of Eden, man was given fruit for food.
[183]  On the other hand, God s desire is for the Lord Jesus to establish His authority and heavenly kingdom through the work of the cross, with the result that heaven s reign will be brought to the earth.
[184]  LEARNING TO ACKNOWLEDGE GOD S GOVERNMENT A. Adam Being Cast Out of the Garden of Eden
[185]  After God prepared the garden of Eden, He created Adam and Eve and charged them to guard the garden.
[186]  God s grace allowed him to see the boundary of the land, but God s government forbade him from entering the land.
[187]  I cannot persuade you to cover your head if you do not know anything about God s government.
[188]  If you do not know the meaning of God s government, you will not know the significance of head covering!
[189]  Once you see God s government and see that such a system of divine government is revealed in the Word, you will realize that head covering has much to do with this government.
[190]  First Corinthians 11:2-3 says, But I praise you because in all things you have remembered me and hold fast the things that I have handed down even as I handed them down to you.
[191]  First Corinthians 11:4-5 says, Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraces his head.
[192]  But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head; for it is one and the same as she who is shaved.
[193]  The significance of head covering is that one puts himself under God s government; he acknowledges this position.
[194]  He would never annul God s government just because he has received His grace.
[195]  Just as Christ accepted God as His Head, so also every man should accept Christ as his Head.
[196]  In reality, Christ s head is covered before God, and every man s head is covered before Christ.
[197]  Sometimes I feel that I do not have the liberty to speak to some saints about the matter of head covering because they have no idea about God s government.
[198]  The woman s covering before God is equal to Christ s covering before God.
[199]  First Corinthians 11:6 says, For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off; but if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered.
[200]  In other words, God is telling the sisters that they should be absolute in everything that they do.
[201]  Verse 7 says, For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is God s image and glory.
[202]  They may think that since the man is the head, the woman should subject herself to him in everything.
[203]  Here Paul seems to ask the sisters in particular, After hearing this word and realizing that in God s government God is the Head of Christ, Christ is the Head of every man, man is the head of the woman, and God has appointed the woman to be a representative of Christ before God, do you still think that it is fitting for a woman to pray with her head uncovered?
[204]  I would like to point out two things to you: Since God gave women long hair for a covering, Paul indicated that the woman should add a head covering to this covering, because God wants her to be covered.
[205]  Verse 16 says, But if anyone seems to be contentious, we do not have such a custom of being so, neither the churches of God.
[206]  This is the same as saying that God s headship over Christ is a Corinthian matter, not a universal matter; this is the same as saying that Christ s headship over man is a Corinthian matter, not a universal matter; and this is the same as saying that man s headship over the woman is a Corinthian matter, not a universal matter.
[207]  Thus, for man not to cover his head and for woman to cover her head was a commandment uniquely given by God s apostles and a custom unique to the churches of God.
[208]  The Bible contains a very important principle the principle of representation.
[209]  I have spoken of this before, and I would like to reiterate it here.
[210]  One is that we walk as individuals before God, and the other is that we walk in the capacity of a representative before God.
[211]  In the eyes of God we not only live the Christian life individually, but representatively.
[212]  If I am not deceived, I believe that in the coming judgment we will be judged not only individually but also according to what we do as representatives.
[213]  If I am not deceived, I believe that we will be judged for our own sins and for the sin of misrepresenting the Lord in the coming judgment before God.
[214]  CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE THE PATHWAY OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Rev 2 3 I. THE REVELATION OF THE PATHWAY OF THE CHURCH
[215]  There are seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3.
[216]  These churches were seven actual churches in Asia Minor at the time John wrote the book of Revelation.
[217]  At that time there were many churches in Asia Minor, but God chose only seven for prophetic representation.
[218]  Therefore, God chose these seven churches as a prophecy to foretell the pathway the church takes on the earth.
[219]  They also show us what kind of church God condemns and what kind of church He approves.
[220]  Only through the study of these two chapters can we understand the pathway of the church, the kind of church we should be in, and the kind of person we should be to please the Lord.
[221]  Sardis is the recovered church or the church that remains.
[222]  Become watchful and establish the things which remain, which were about to die; for I have found none of your works completed before My God....But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments 3:1-2, 4 .
[223]  In the beginning of the Reformation, many of God s people came out of Catholicism because they wanted to be freed from its fornication and idolatry.
[224]  If the believers who left the Roman Catholic Church had turned back to the New Testament, they would have seen that the church is God s people and that it is a society that does not derive its support from anyone.
[225]  At the beginning, when these dissenting ones separated themselves from the state churches, they were branded as divisive.
[226]  Because they held different opinions, they were labeled divisive ones.
[227]  In order for God s children to follow Him, they had no choice but to separate themselves from these state churches.
[228]  If God s children are careless in judging sin, they may have a oneness among themselves, but they have certainly lost their oneness with the Lord.
[229]  The Lord said, You...have not denied My name v. 8 . This is another characteristic of Philadelphia.
[230]  In the long history of the church throughout the ages, the name of the Lord Jesus has always been last in importance.
[231]  One did not receive a rebuke, and one received only praise.
[232]  Brothers and sisters, if you want to continue in the way of Philadelphia, remember to humble yourselves before God.
[233]  Sometimes I hear some brothers say, God s blessing is with us.
[234]  God s blessing is with us, but we must be careful when we say this.
[235]  APPENDIX: THE HERESY OF CONFUSION Scripture Reading: Matt 13:31-33; Rev 17 18
[236]  In this appendix to the section on Thyatira, we bring up a subject which we call the heresy of confusion.
[237]  Every reader of prophesy knows that Roman Catholicism will become more and more powerful, while Protestantism will become weaker and weaker.
[238]  Therefore, all genuine children of God must fully prepare themselves for this crisis in the last days.
[239]  However, the Lord prophesied that something unexpected would happen.
[240]  When the Lord planted the mustard seed in the field, it was the smallest of all the seeds, but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree v. 32 . The Lord had no intention that the church would become a tree and be rooted deeply in the earth.
[241]  The God-ordained way for the church is one that is according to the footsteps of Jesus of Nazareth, the One who was hidden, lonely, and humble.
[242]  The birds in the second parable signify the principalities in the air.
[243]  In the first parable, the Lord Jesus said that the seeds were snatched away by birds, and then He explained that it was the evil one who came to snatch away the seeds that were sown.
[244]  The Roman Catholic Church tells men that the Bible is God s Word, yet it also says that the church can speak for God.
[245]  It is quite clear that the fine flour in Leviticus 2:1 refers to the food of God s people.
[246]  The Word of God shows us that the Lord Jesus is the fine flour, which is the food God gave to His people.
[247]  The word of the Lord here is quite serious.
[248]  Revelation 17:18 says, The woman whom you saw is the great city, which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.
[249]  Verse 9 says, Here is the mind which has wisdom.
[250]  God shows us through John that this woman is the great city which rules over the kings of the earth.
[251]  It is hard to find another place on earth that has as much gold and as many precious stones and pearls.
[252]  Every student of history knows about the persecutions in Spain, the Spanish Inquisition.
[253]  Believers were branded as heretics and 10,220 were burned to death within twelve months.
[254]  As soon as a person confessed his faith in the Lord, he was put to death.
[255]  In 1901 Pope Leo XIII published an article in Rome which said, The church, that is, the Roman Catholic Church, has authority from God to confiscate all properties of heretics and imprison and burn them.
[256]  Please bear in mind that Roman Catholicism has been persecuting God s children down through the ages.
[257]  CHAPTER FORTY-SIX ONENESS I. THE HEAD, THE BODY,
[258]  In this chapter we will cover the subject of oneness among Christians.
[259]  We have seen that the Body of Christ is something that can be seen on earth.
[260]  He said, That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. If we put this phrase even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us within parentheses, it is clear that the Lord is praying for the church to be one so that the world may believe.
[261]  NOT BEING GREATER THAN THE BODY A. The Oneness of the Church Being Limited
[262]  They think that as long as a man is a Christian in name, they can be one with him, whether or not he belongs to God, has life, and is a member of the Body.
[263]  When John Wesley drafted the constitution of the Methodist Church, he wrote, Whoever wishes to escape the coming wrath can be a member of the Methodist Church.
[264]  We admit that we are behind John Wesley in many things; he was a great vessel used by the Lord.
[265]  Verse 16 continues, Even as God said, I will dwell among them and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.
[266]  God s commandment is, Therefore come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you v. 17 . Here we see that we must come out of any Christian group which receives both believers and unbelievers.
[267]  I would like you to take note of something: God s intention is not just for His children to be one but for them to be one in the Holy Spirit.
[268]  God did not say that we could have any kind or style of oneness.
[269]  But one day God opens his eyes to see that though these are genuine children of God, the group as a whole is not the church: It only accepts and meets with those baptized by immersion, and anyone who is not baptized by immersion is not accepted, even though he may be a child of God.
[270]  Some were saying, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ 1 Cor 1:12 .
[271]  The Need to Come out of the Smaller Oneness
[272]  When you ask certain ones, May a Christian commit fornication?
[273]  They will answer with a definitive no. If you ask them, May a Christian worship idols? They will give you a definitive no as well.
[274]  Many people feel that sectarianism and division are wrong, that they should fellowship with all of God s children, and that this fellowship should be as broad as the Body.
[275]  If you try to divide the Body into denominations and then unite them again, you no longer have the Body!
[276]  You should not think that you will have the same person after cutting him into pieces and then putting the pieces together again.
[277]  Never boast and say, I have a home already.
[278]  I do not care whether other brothers are wandering outside.
[279]  Something is wrong with our family if we do not feel this loss in our family.
[280]  The boundary of oneness can only be maintained with a price.
[281]  Do not think that you can be one by having more love and forbearance.
[282]  Today when God opens a person s eyes to see the Body, the boundary of the church, and the oneness among Christians, and when this person disentangles himself from all human affection and tolerance, he will spontaneously take a step forward in his pursuit of the Lord.
[283]  CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN LOVING THE BROTHERS Scripture Reading: John 5:24; 1 John 3:14
[284]  The Gospel of John was the last Gospel written, and the Epistles of John were the last Epistles written.
[285]  Before the Gospel of John there are three Gospels, the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, which cover many acts and teachings of the Lord Jesus.
[286]  The Gospel of John shows us the highest and most spiritual things concerning the coming of the Son of God to earth.
[287]  While the other Epistles pay much attention to a man s faith in God, John emphasizes one aspect of practical conduct before God.
[288]  If we ask someone, How do you know that you have eternal life? he may answer, God s Word says so.
[289]  John gave us a way to differentiate between true brothers and false brothers, between those who are born of God and those who are not born of God.
[290]  First John 3:11 says, For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
[291]  Verse 23 says, And this is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, even as He gave a commandment to us.
[292]  God commands us to do two things: to believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and to love one another.
[293]  First John 4:7-8 says, Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and everyone who loves has been begotten of God and knows God.
[294]  First John 4:20-21 says, If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.
[295]  He said, How does the love of God abide in him? because the love of God is the love of the brothers, and the love of the brothers is the love of God.
[296]  First John 3:16 says, In this we know love, that He laid down His life on our behalf.
[297]  We do not know what love is until we see how the Lord laid down His life for us.
[298]  First John 4:10-12 says, Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins.
[299]  First John 4:16 says, God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God and God abides in him.
[300]  The Bible speaks of the ministry of the priesthood.
[301]  This ministry consists of a group of people wholly separated from the world to serve God.
[302]  They have no other occupation or duty other than to serve God.
[303]  Beginning from the book of Genesis, we find God calling men to be priests.
[304]  In Abraham s time, Melchisedec separated himself and gave himself solely to God s service.
[305]  The Bible shows us that even the Lord Jesus became a priest before God after His ascension to the heavens.
[306]  While Moses was up on the mountain, the people at the foot of the mountain wondered about his delay.
[307]  They said to Aaron, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us 32:1 .
[308]  From that day forward, the kingdom of priests became a tribe of priests.
[309]  God s people and God s priests were one and the same in the tribe of Levi; that is, His people were His priests.
[310]  Right then a promise which had been set aside for fifteen hundred years was recovered by God.
[311]  The same word can be found in Revelation 1:6, which says, And made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father.
[312]  It means that everyone who has tasted God s grace has only one occupation left, that of serving God.
[313]  I have said this before to the young people: If a person is a doctor before he believes in the Lord, his occupation is medicine; if he is a nurse, his occupation is nursing; if he is a teacher, his occupation is teaching; if he is a farmer, his occupation is farming; if he is a businessman, his occupation is business.
[314]  A. God Honoring Us by Calling Us to the Priesthood
[315]  Those who offered strange fire in the Old Testament were burned to death.
[316]  Others died when they tried to offer sacrifices to God.
[317]  In God s eyes the priesthood is a trust He has placed upon man.
[318]  In order for us to abolish this class, we all have to become part of it.
[319]  If all the brothers realize that their sole occupation is to serve God and if all of them will serve God in coordination, the intermediary class will disappear!
[320]  Originally, the Lord s charge was, Render then the things that are Caesar s to Caesar and the things that are God s to God Matt 22:21 .
[321]  The church witnessed a drastic change in the fourth century.
[322]  During that period, many who joined the church were either unbelievers or half believers.
[323]  If one day all the brothers and sisters in all the churches rise up to serve, the kingdom of God will come among us.
[324]  CHAPTER FORTY-NINE THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23; 4:11-13; 5:29-30; Gen 2:21-24; 1 Cor 10:16-17; 12:12-30; Rom 12:4-8 I. THE CHURCH BEING OF CHRIST
[325]  Genesis 2 shows us that God took a rib from Adam and made Eve out of it.
[326]  This typifies the relationship between Christ and the church.
[327]  Just as Eve came out of Adam, the church comes out of Christ.
[328]  God gave us not only the grace, power, and nature of Christ, but He also gave us the Body of Christ.
[329]  God has given us His bones, His flesh, and Himself, even as He gave Adam s rib to Eve.
[330]  First Corinthians 12:12-13 says, For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.
[331]  For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.
[332]  Ephesians 4:11-13 says, He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[333]  God s intention in giving the church these ministers of the word is for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[334]  For the building up of the Body of Christ, we should ask God for more ministers of the word.
[335]  Every Lord s Day we come to the Lord to acknowledge that His body was broken for us and that all of God s children are one.
[336]  In this chapter we will consider the matter of the authority of the church.
[337]  When God created the universe, He ordained authority as the governing principle for His rule over it.
[338]  Satan said that in the day they ate thereof, they would be as God, and that God had forbidden them to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so that they would not become as Him.
[339]  If a man refuses to learn from God s appointed deputy authority and if he never presents things to God but cultivates his own independent thought, considering only what is pleasant to the eyes, what is good for food, and what is desirous to make one wise, he is rebelling not only against God but also against His appointed authority on the earth.
[340]  The story in the garden of Eden was a repetition of Satan s history.
[341]  Satan wanted to uplift himself to be equal with God.
[342]  Romans 5 says that through one offense, condemnation came to all men v. 18 , and through the disobedience of one man, the many were constituted sinners v. 19 . Please bear in mind that in God s eyes, what happened in the garden of Eden was not only an offense but an act of disobedience.
[343]  God would not tolerate men s sinning against Himself, and He would not tolerate men s sinning against His servants.
[344]  Not only did God forbid men to sin against Himself, but He also forbade men to sin against His priests and prophets.
[345]  God appointed authority among the children of Israel, and when they offended His authority, judgments and punishments would come upon them.
[346]  Yet He did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself fully under God s authority.
[347]  After His death on the cross, God raised Him from among the dead and highly exalted Him to be the Lord and Christ and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord Phil 2:5-11 .
[348]  History throughout the ages shows that the whole world is in rebellion.
[349]  The underlying principle of the world is an overthrow of either God s direct authority or His appointed authority.
[350]  Today is the age when the Body of the Lord, that is, the church, is built on earth.
[351]  God puts a high demand on the church; He wants to secure what He originally planned to secure in the world.
[352]  Today in the church God puts a high stake on the woman; she must submit to the man.
[353]  But if you are in the church, you must uphold one basic need and principle before the Lord you must insist that God s authority be carried out in the church today.
[354]  For this reason, all the brothers and sisters in the church must learn submission.
[355]  Please bear in mind that no sin is more serious than the sin of rebellion.
[356]  This is something altogether contrary to the very existence of the church.
[357]  When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was not just good; He was submissive.
[358]  There is one law among us which we must all observe: We have to see what the Body sees, reject what the Body rejects, and accept what the Body accepts.
[359]  We may say that nothing is more living, more one, and more vital than our body.
[360]  After we believe in the Lord, the first spiritual principle we should bear in mind is that the Body is God s ordained authority on earth.
[361]  Sometimes there is the need for the testimony of two or three.
[362]  When one brother comes to me, I may not see the light.
[363]  That brother may invite one or two other brothers to come along, brothers who are clear before the Lord and who love the Lord wholeheartedly.
[364]  God s authority in the church is represented not only by one or two or three persons.
[365]  Very often it takes the whole church to represent His authority.
[366]  God shows us through the Bible that the brothers who are bearing responsibility before the Lord, who are called overseers, and who serve as the elders, are the ones who represent His authority in the church.
[367]  Peter said that the younger men should be subject to the elderly ones, who are patterns to others before the Lord v. 3 . If a young person finds someone taking care of him according to God s will, he should learn to subject himself to such a one before God.
[368]  Hebrews 13:17 says, Obey the ones leading you and submit to them.
[369]  If you only listen to one brother s word and refuse another s word, this is not real submission.
[370]  APPENDIX ONE A FLEXIBLE LIFE Scripture Reading: Matt 11:16-19; 1 Cor 7:29-31; 9:19-22; 2 Cor 6:4-10; Phil 4:11-13
[371]  Since God has prepared many things in man s environment that are pleasing to him and which match his many needs, man should do his best to enjoy all these things in life.
[372]  First Corinthians 7:29-31 says, But this I say, brothers, the time is shortened.
[373]  Henceforth both those who have wives should be as though they had none, and those who weep as though they did not weep, and those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, and those who buy as though they did not possess, and those who use the world as though they did not abuse it; for the fashion of this world is passing away.
[374]  APPENDIX TWO EXPECTING THE LORD S RETURN Scripture Reading: 2 Pet 3:11; 1 Cor 1:7; 1 Thes 1:9-10; Phil 3:20; Titus 2:11-13
[375]  Bible students have counted the number of times that the New Testament speaks of this subject and have told us that one out of every twenty verses in the New Testament speaks of the Lord s return.
[376]  Christ has two comings, and these two comings are different.
[377]  Through this, sinners are reconciled to God; they can draw near to God and partake of His life.
[378]  Today many people say that animals are suffering and abused and are even near the point of extinction.
[379]  They say that we should do something to protect them.
[380]  WHAT CHRIST WILL SETTLE WHEN HE COMES A. Injustice
[381]  When the Lord comes back, the first thing He will settle is injustice.
[382]  APPENDIX THREE SELLING ALL Scripture Reading: Luke 18:18-30; 19:1-10; Acts 2:44-45; 4:32-35; Matt 6:19-24
[383]  The following message was given by Watchman Nee in Kuling in 1948 as part of the New Believers series.
[384]  It was published by the Kuling Book Room as the third message in a 1949 edition but was later excluded from the final published version of the series.
[385]  In order to understand this message in the proper light and in the context of Watchman Nee s ministry during this period, the reader should also refer to Volume 57 of The Collected Works, The Resumption of Watchman Nee s Ministry.
[386]  The first thing we should realize concerning a new believer selling all to take the Lord s way is that the church must first take the lead to do this.
[387]  B. In Order to Follow the Lord One Must Sell All
[388]  Hence, no one can follow the Lord who will not sell all his possessions.
[389]  If one does not sell his all, he cannot follow the Lord; he cannot go on in this way.
[390]  If we want to enter God s kingdom, we must remember that it is impossible for a rich man to enter in. If we want to be saved, the Lord will save us.
[391]  He thought, If the inheriting of eternal life is related to one s work, and if one cannot enter God s kingdom if he is rich, but instead must sell his all before going in, this must mean that the entrance no longer depends on faith.
[392]  F. The Central Issue of Selling One s All
[393]  This word is the central subject of this story.
[394]  He said, The things that are impossible with men are possible with God Luke 18:27 .
[395]  A new believer must realize that it is impossible to first give up everything and then enter God s kingdom.
[396]  The Lord answered Peter saying, Truly I say to you that there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God, who shall not by all means receive back many times as much in this time, and in the coming age, eternal life vv.
[397]  A young person must see that in order to serve God, he has to set aside, sell, or give up everything before he can follow the Lord.
[398]  When the Lord called the twelve apostles, they happily and instantly followed Him.
[399]  Yet if there are men who, like the young ruler, find it difficult to respond to the Lord or to give up everything to follow Him, thank the Lord, there is still a way.
[400]  Please remember that as long as we take a firm stand and the church also takes a firm stand before God, we do not have to worry whether there are too many young rulers.
[401]  When God s word is released, and the place is right and the audience proper, it is rare to find one who will not follow the Lord in an absolute way.
[402]  The Lord did not preach to him at all.
[403]  He simply said, Hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house.
[404]  One must not presume that God is able for no reason at all.
[405]  As for properties, houses, and valuables, they have to be sold.
[406]  Yet you must have the attitude that all of God s children can share all of these things with you.
[407]  G. Not Holding On to Anything, Always Letting Go
[408]  Many times when I read Acts 2 and 4, I get the impression that our so-called real assets such as properties and houses must somehow be sold.
[409]  God s children should always let go of what they have when it comes to supplying other children of God.
[410]  APPENDIX FOUR IDENTIFYING HERESIES Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 11:13-15; 1 Tim 6:20-21; 2 Tim 4:3-4; 2 Pet 2:1; Jude 3; Isa 8:20
[411]  It was later excluded from the final published version of the series.
[412]  The first kind of heresy relates to the authority of the Bible.
[413]  Second Timothy 3:16 says, All Scripture is God-breathed.
[414]  If anyone says that God first created a Word, that the Word was God s first creation, after which the Word created the heaven and earth and all the living creatures, he is preaching heresy.
[415]  First John 3 says that the Son of God was manifested to destroy the works of the devil v. 8 . If a man does not recognize that Jesus the Son of God has come in the flesh, it means that he does not recognize the Lord s work in destroying the devil.
[416]  Some heresies try to deny the matter of sin altogether.
[417]  The Bible clearly tells us that man has sinned.
[418]  The Bible records many miracles and works of wonders.
[419]  There is nothing wrong for a man who has faith, who has a word from God, and who believes in such a word to pray and anoint sick ones in the name of the Lord.
[420]  According to Deuteronomy 18:9-14 and Leviticus 20:6, God strictly forbids the living to communicate with the dead.
