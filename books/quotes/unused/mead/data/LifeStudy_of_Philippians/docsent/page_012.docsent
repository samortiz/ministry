   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FOUR THE DIFFERENT PREACHINGS OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Phil 1:15-21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1:7-11 Paul uses a number of important terms.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He speaks of the defense of the gospel, the confirmation of the gospel, full knowledge, all discernment, proving by testing, and the fruit of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 8 he even refers to the inward parts of Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The key to understanding these verses and all the terms and expressions they contain is the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The experience of Christ is the master key which opens the door to the book of Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is proper to say that the defense of the gospel, the confirmation of the gospel, knowledge, discernment, proving by testing, purity, and the fruit of righteousness are all Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yes, even the defense of the gospel is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do not have Christ, there is no way for us to defend the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can defend it only by Christ, not by eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is possible to preach the gospel and even to mention Christ quite often without having the reality of Christ in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In such a preaching of the gospel, there is no ministry of Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The way to defend the gospel is to minister Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is also the genuine confirmation of the gospel, for He is the centrality, the focal point, of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Apart from Him, there is no confirmation of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>True knowledge and discernment are also Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we experience Christ day by day, we shall be filled with knowledge and discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We shall discern matters not by our natural cleverness, but by the Christ who lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our experience of Christ will make us wise and tactful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The indwelling Christ is our perceptive power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although I was a true seeker after the Lord when I was young, I did not know that Christ could be my discernment, my tact, and my perception.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But through the years I have come to see that He is the very ability by which I can see into the nature of things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The indwelling Christ is my perception.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In reading the book of Philippians, we need to remember that the experience of Christ is the subject and main emphasis of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The controlling factor enabling us to understand Philippians is the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every aspect of the book is governed by this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the reason we say that the experience of Christ is the master key which opens the book of Philippians to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we apply this key to every verse and phrase in the book, we shall see that Paul s concern here is nothing other than the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, in suffering for the gospel we may enjoy grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To enjoy grace is to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Philippians 3 Paul speaks not of grace, but of the power of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the power of resurrection in chapter three is the very grace in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, to enter into the fellowship of Christ s sufferings is to suffer for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that even in suffering for the sake of the gospel, we need to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although Paul uses many different terms in this book, his subject is one the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, if we wish to understand Philippians, we need to read it in light of the fact that its subject is the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this message we shall consider the different ways of preaching Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to 1:15-17, some preach Christ out of envy and strife, announcing Him out of rivalry, whereas others preach Christ out of love, with a pure motive.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this matter, today s situation is the same as that faced by Paul in the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When Paul wrote to the Philippians, there were different ways of preaching Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The same is true today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I. PREACHING CHRIST OUT OF AN IMPURE MOTIVE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 1:15 Paul says, Some indeed preach Christ even because of envy and strife.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The word some here refers to those Christians who were opposing Paul and his ministry 2 Cor 10:7; 11:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even at Paul s time there were some who preached the gospel from envy of Paul s influence and in strife with him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As the Greek word rendered strife indicates, they preached Christ because of faction and partisanship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 1:17 Paul goes on to say that these announce Christ out of rivalry, not purely, thinking to raise up affliction in my bonds.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Greek word for rivalry denotes self-seeking, selfish ambition, faction.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Greek the word affliction means pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who announced Christ out of rivalry endeavored to make Paul s bonds press him more heavily by depreciating him and his ministry while he was laid aside outwardly from his preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul s affliction in bonds was not mainly due to his preaching of the gospel, but to his defense of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Judaizers mixed the gospel with the law and circumcision, but Paul defended the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This caused the riot which put him into bonds Acts 21:27-36 .</S>
