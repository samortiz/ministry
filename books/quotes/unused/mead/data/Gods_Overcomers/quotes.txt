[1]  The first conference was held in February 1928 on the subject: God s Eternal Purpose and the Victory of Christ.
[2]  The second conference was held in October 1931 on the subject: The Covenant of God and the Wisdom of God.
[3]  They shall come near to Me to minister to Me; and
[4]  they shall stand before Me to present to Me
[5]  The blood is there for the forgiveness of sins; it satisfies God s righteousness and holiness, and it enables us to come to God.
[6]  Song of Songs 4:12; Hosea 14:5-7; Mark 4:5-6, 16-17 A Shallow Life
[7]  Mark 4 speaks of the condition of man s heart and how it receives the word.
[8]  It does not apply only to sinners hearing the gospel, but also to believers receiving the word of edification.
[9]  What is the kind of life that pleases the Lord and lasts long?
[10]  If you have never been dealt with by the Lord or have not fully consecrated yourself, the day will come when the Lord will take you to a place where you do not want to go, and you will reject His choice.
[11]  2 Kings 4:1-6; Matthew 5:6; Luke 1:53 The Reason for Not Growing
[12]  The only reasons for the believers failures and lack of growth before God are 1 not knowing themselves and 2 not knowing the fullness of the Lord.
[13]  At a Keswick Convention, one anonymous Christian said that all the failures of believers are from these two reasons.
[14]  The only condition for God s blessing, spiritual growth, or the experience of the fullness of the Lord is to be empty.
[15]  All God s spiritual grace is only for the hungry ones.
[16]  God works along certain lines and according to certain principles.
[17]  He would rather not work than have work that is done contrary to His principle.
[18]  If we want to receive His blessings, we have to fulfill the conditions for Him to bless.
[19]  Through the Holy Spirit, God puts this desire in the hearts of His children so that they will know what is His heart s desire.
[20]  Therefore, the more thorough our prayers are, the more the will of God will be accomplished, and Satan s deceptions will not be able to come in. We should cast a net of prayer by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time Eph 6:18 , so that God s will can prevail in all areas, and Satan will not find one crack through which to come in. In our prayer we should pay attention to three things: 1 to whom we are praying, 2 for whom we are praying, and 3 against whom we are praying.
[21]  If we do not see God s center, our work will not have any goal.
[22]  When the Lord was born, an angel told Mary that He is the Son of God Luke 1:35 , but the angels told the shepherds that He is Christ the Lord Luke 2:11 .
[23]  God s goal has two aspects: 1 that all things would express the glory of Christ and 2 that man would be like Christ, having the life of Christ and the glory of Christ.
[24]  The First Group: Concerning God s Plan: Ephesians 3:9-11 purpose can be translated as plan ; 1:8-11 will can be translated as plan ; Revelation 4:11 will can be translated as pleasure ; 1 Corinthians 8:6; Romans 11:36
[25]  The Third Group: Concerning Christ Creating All Things: Hebrews 1:2b, 3b; John 1:1-3, 10; Colossians 1:16-17; 1 Corinthians 8:6b
[26]  The Fourth Group: Concerning Christ Creating Man: 1 Corinthians 11:3; Galatians 4:4-7; Romans 8:28b-30 purpose can be translated as plan ; 1 Peter 1:2a; 1 Corinthians 1:9; Hebrews 2:5-10; 1 Corinthians 3:21-23
[27]  The Sixth Group: Concerning God s Ordination before the Foundation of the World: John 17:24; Ephesians 1:4-5; Titus 1:2; 2 Timothy 1:9-10; 1 Peter 1:20
[28]  This is why after His resurrection, He said, Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God John 20:17 .
[29]  God wants us not only to have His Son s life, but His Son s glory as well Rom 8:29-30 .
[30]  God wants to dispense His Son s life to many people, making them God s many sons so that His Son may become the Firstborn among many sons, having the first place in all things.
[31]  After the Lord s death and resurrection, God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father Phil 2:9-11 .
[32]  CHRIST IN REDEMPTION Christ Having the First Place in Redemption
[33]  A few days ago we saw that Christ is all and in all.
[34]  What God planned before the foundation of the world is that He Himself might have the first place in all things.
[35]  Today we want to see how Christ s redemption accomplishes God s plan.
[36]  God s plan has one goal with two aspects: 1 to have all things expressing Christ s glory, so that Christ may have the first place in all things, and 2 to have man conformed to Christ, having His life and His glory.
[37]  Colossians 1 tells us these two things: 1 Christ has the first place in all things, and 2 Christ is the Head of the church.
[38]  Ephesians 1 also tells us these two things: 1 Christ is heading up all things in the heavens and on earth, and 2 the church becomes His inheritance.
[39]  As a result, Christ s redemption must 1 reconcile all things to God, and 2 redeem fallen mankind and impart His life to them.
[40]  To solve God s problems, Christ s redemption must also 3 deal with the rebellious Satan, and 4 take care of man s sin.
[41]  Christ s redemption not only reconciles all things to God, but also causes man to have life and to be like Him.
[42]  The goals of Christ s redemption are that we be His particular people Titus 2:14 and living sacrifice Rom 12:1 , that we would live to Him and die to Him Rom 14:7-9 , that we would be the temple of the Holy Spirit glorifying God 1 Cor 6:19-20 , that we would live to Him 2 Cor 5:15 , and that whether through life or through death, Christ would be magnified in our body, so that for us to live is Christ Phil 1:20-21 .
[43]  God works through the cross, which in turn works through the environment to dig into us deeply, causing us to know Christ and be filled with Him, so that Christ may have the first place in us.
[44]  CHRIST IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE AND EXPERIENCE Christ Having the First Place
[45]  The life of a Christian is Christ Col 3:4 .
[46]  Christ being our life and Christ being our power are two different things.
[47]  5 Some know that power is with the Lord, that our flesh has been crucified on the cross, and that by faith, we should claim the Lord s power to overcome and be holy.
[48]  To be short of patience is to be short of Christ, because God wants Christ to have the first place in all things.
[49]  If God were to cause us to have power, it would only make us powerful persons; Christ would not have the first place in us.
[50]  I live because of the life of Christ and also because of the faith in the Son of God v. 20b . When we believed and received the Son of God, not only did His life enter into us, but His faith also entered into us.
[51]  The experience of a Christian has two sides: one is sweet, the other, painful.
[52]  God causes us to experience a sweet and suffering life in order that Christ may have the first place in all things.
[53]  The goal of prayer to let Christ have the first place in all things must be reached, before it will be answered.
[54]  Seek first God s kingdom and God s righteousness, then God will add to us all that we need.
[55]  To ask in the Lord s name is to ask the Father on behalf of the Lord that the Lord may gain something.
[56]  God will listen both to the prayers that we utter the prayers we pray that are for God s business as well as the prayers that we do not utter the prayers we pray that are for our own affairs .
[57]  But God s purpose in answering our prayers is that Christ may have the first place in all things.
[58]  It is not how much biblical knowledge we have, but how much consecration we have, how much we have put in God s hand, and how much we have allowed Christ to have the first place.
[59]  God allows sickness and weakness to come to our body in order that we may learn to 1 pray at night, 2 be watchful as sparrows on the rooftop, 3 know that the Lord makes our bed for us, 4 deal with sin, 5 wait quietly, 6 touch the hem of the Lord s garment, 7 know that the Lord sent His word to heal us, 8 know that through sickness God causes us to become useful persons, 9 know that holiness is healing, and 10 know that the Lord s resurrection power removes our weakness, sickness, and death.
[60]  God deprives us of our possessions, relatives, health, and goodness in order that we would take Christ as our satisfaction, be filled with Christ, and allow Him to have the first place in all things.
[61]  CHRIST IN CHRISTIAN WORK AND MESSAGES Christ Having the First Place
[62]  Whether it be inward matters or outward matters, we should allow Christ to have the first place in all things.
[63]  The goal of God s work is Christ, and we should walk in this work.
[64]  All believers, no matter what profession they hold, are doing the work of God and should walk in God s good works.
[65]  In doing God s work, although there is suffering, there is also joy; although there is difficulty, there is also comfort.
[66]  We ourselves must be the first to be broken by God and allow Christ to have the first place in us, before we can lead others to receive Christ as Lord and allow Christ to have the first place in them.
[67]  the fullness of the One who fills all in all.
[68]  God had an eternal plan before the foundation of the world.
[69]  The first is to make all things express Christ, and the second is to make man like Christ, that man would have His life and glory.
[70]  While God desires to accomplish these two goals, He encounters two problems: Satan s rebellion and man s fall.
[71]  He wanted to raise himself to the same position as God s Son.
[72]  God created man in order that first he would have the life and glory of Christ, and He intended to put all things under man s subjection so that man would bring everything back to God.
[73]  In order to carry out God s two goals and solve His two problems, the Lord Jesus became a man and accomplished redemption.
[74]  All victories should take the victory of Christ as a pattern: As I also overcame.
[75]  The Bible tells us that we have three different enemies: 1 the flesh, within us, 2 the world, outside of us, and 3 Satan, above and below us.
[76]  This is like Satan trying to persuade the Lord to declare that He was the Son of God after God had already declared this.
[77]  Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21 The Failure of the Church
[78]  The reason that the church is on the earth is to maintain the victory of Christ on the cross and bind Satan in each locality as the Lord bound him on Calvary.
[79]  On the cross the Lord has condemned Satan according to the law.
[80]  Now God desires that the church execute this judgment on the earth.
[81]  Joshua 3:6, 8, 13, 15-17; 4:10-11, 15-18;
[82]  In considering the overcomers, we need to pay attention to two things: 1 God chose a few persons to take the place of all the people who failed.
[83]  God chose the Israelites to be a kingdom of priests among all people Exo 19:5-6 , but they failed because they worshipped the golden calf at Mount Sinai.
[84]  God then chose the sons of Levi, who had done His command, to be His overcomers to replace the Israelites as the priests Exo 32:15-29 .
[85]  The overcomers are the ones who allow their self to remain in the place of death in order that others might have the life.
[86]  These ones are like the priests who bore the ark through the Jordan, who themselves stood in the place of death in order that the people of God could pass through.
[87]  Therefore, God must first deal with you through matters; you first must be dealt with in the matter of faith and allow God s faith to be constituted in you before you can convey to others what is constituted in you.
[88]  Judges 6:1-6, 11-35; 7:1-8, 19-25; 8:1-4
[89]  Now we come to the matter of selecting the overcomers, of how to separate the overcomers from the non-overcomers.
[90]  Numbers says that every male of the Israelites from twenty years old and upward had to be a soldier to go forth to war for the Lord.
[91]  In order for God to deliver them all, He had to select three hundred men who would fight the battle which the others should but did not fight.
[92]  It is easy to be humble before God, but it is very difficult to be humble before man in comparison with others.
[93]  All living sacrifices that are according to God s will are acceptable to God.
[94]  Only after one has seen the Angel of God will he realize that the wooden image is not God.
[95]  To be God s overcomer, one has to learn to pray with authority by exercising Christ s authority.
[96]  God s overcomer must first be faithful to deny the self, the world, and Satan.
[97]  We should first allow God to defeat us by the cross, that is we should allow ourselves to be defeated before God.
[98]  Christ s death and resurrection solved God s four big problems.
[99]  The two passages we read today correspond with each other.
[100]  One is in the beginning of the Bible while the other is at the end. In Genesis 3 we have 1 the serpent, 2 the woman, and 3 the seed.
[101]  Genesis 3 covers God s pronouncement on man and on the serpent after the fall.
[102]  Upon thy belly shalt thou go means God restricted Satan s work to the earth; he can no longer work throughout the universe.
[103]  Christ is the Son of God, and the new man is also the son of God.
[104]  Before we look into these matters using the Word with the shining of God s light, I want the brothers and sisters to know what are our responsibilities and what is God s continual focus in the church in this age.
[105]  They shall slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them....But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of My sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from Me, they shall come near to Me to minister to Me; and they shall stand before Me to present to Me the fat and the blood, declares the Lord Jehovah, It is they who will enter into My sanctuary, and it is they who will come near to My table to minister to Me, and they will keep My charge.
[106]  We must see clearly that outwardly there may not be much difference between ministering to the house and ministering to the Lord.
[107]  You may try your best to render help to the brothers, to diligently save the sinners, and to labor much in the service to manage the church.
[108]  I can tell you frankly that he is not doing this for the Lord because many times he is not able to do the things he does not like, even though the Lord really wants him to.
[109]  God has only one goal: to have men belong absolutely to Me. In other words, He wants us to be before My presence and minister to Me. God s unique goal is not in so many things.
[110]  For this reason, we must pray to God to grace us that we may know what it is to minister to God and to the house.
[111]  Many like to exercise their muscles outside because by killing cattle and sheep, they can exercise their strength and fleshly energy.
[112]  However, if you ask them to go to a quiet, solitary place where no one can see them, they are not able to do this.
[113]  Brothers, we cannot find a genuine servant of God or true minister to the Lord who does not minister in this way.
[114]  We have only two positions here: one is that we are dead and have dropped everything of the old creation; the other is that we are resurrected and are serving God, learning to stand before Him, listening to His order, and waiting in His presence to minister to Him.
[115]  Those who ministered to God before Him had to be clothed with linen garments, linen bonnets on their heads, and linen breeches on their loins.
[116]  Before God, no one could ever put on woolen garments.
[117]  All work that produces sweat is not pleasing to God and is rejected by Him.
[118]  Genesis 3 tells us that, due to Adam s sin, God punished him by saying, By the sweat of your face / You will eat bread.
[119]  Due to God s curse, the ground ceased to yield its fruit; due to the absence of God s blessing, human effort is necessary, and this causes sweat.
[120]  you also have been made dead to the law
[121]  through the body of Christ so that you might be
[122]  Romans 7 is a great chapter, and we cannot cover all of it today.
[123]  In this verse, the first thing mentioned is: So then, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law.
[124]  If I say that we should be delivered from the world, everyone also understands because the world has crucified our Lord and is indeed evil.
[125]  In brief, the law is all the demands that God places on those who are in Adam and all the commands that God gives to those who are in Adam, commands that tell them what they should or should not do.
[126]  Not only can God put us under the law, but we, who are in Adam, can also put ourselves under the law, hoping that we can please God.
[127]  We have seen that, first, we need to be delivered from the law.
[128]  But how can we be delivered from the law?
[129]  Death can deliver us from the law because as long as we live, the law will have a demand on us.
[130]  For now, I will not speak of how God s law puts its demand on us; I will only speak of how we make demands on ourselves by our own enacted law.
[131]  Rather, when we see Christ s accomplished fact on the cross and realize that God has included us in this death of Christ, we are led to the inevitable conclusion that we have died.
[132]  We see what God has ordained for us, we see how we have become one with Christ, and we see how, in Him, we can receive all that He has accomplished.
[133]  The purpose of this parable is to show us the four kinds of conditions under which man receives God s word.
[134]  This passage only tells us the condition of man s receiving or refusing God s word.
[135]  I know that all of us desire before the Lord that we become believers who please God.
[136]  But when the Lord s will is different from your will, when the Lord s arrangement is different from your expectation, and when you see a great mountain blocking your way and consider it too high to climb over, you will not say before the Lord, I will obey You at all costs.
[137]  In the beginning, when you see the importance of God s eternal will and the seriousness of His will with respect to Christ, you make up your mind, saying, God, I will obey at all costs.
[138]  But when God s ordained way becomes different from your way, and your expectation different from God s, you drop the necessary yoke, go around the cross that is set before you, and lose your heart to follow the Lord all the way.
[139]  When you see that God s speaking is different from yours, that His work is different from yours, and that the places He wants to go are different from the places you want to go, you will be dissatisfied with His arrangements and begin to argue with Him, asking why He is doing these things.
[140]  Brothers and sisters, if you are in the middle of a dispute with God and the matter is not yet settled, if there is an unresolved problem between you and God, and if you are still not clear concerning the will of God, I can frankly say that this is very dangerous.
[141]  Therefore, if you have not counted the cost and are not ready to be broken by Him, you will find yourselves dissatisfied with God, and God will be dissatisfied with you.
[142]  But if you realize that it is right to obey the Lord and do not want your life to dry up, wanting instead to have a strong and vigorous life, you will have to allow God to test the reality of the word you received with affliction and persecution.
[143]  He said that the first reason is that there is not enough earth.
[144]  This means that the earth is not deep; there is not much depth to the earth.
[145]  A person in this condition has just a small amount; everything about him is shallow.
[146]  If you do not have a secret or hidden life before God and if you do not have any secret prayer, reading, or obedience, I can say very frankly that you do not have any roots.
[147]  Those with shallow earth may still have a desire for deep roots, but there are rocks that block the way.
[148]  They may outwardly look the same as other soil; just like others, they are filled with dust and mud.
[149]  If we allow God to break our hardened heart, if we do not live by our feelings or the environment, and if we ask God to give us more of a hidden life, we will see forward progress.
[150]  that we may give an answer to those who sent us?
[151]  Following this we come to the period from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century.
[152]  In 1524 the Anabaptists, a group of believers who proposed re-baptism after infant-sprinkling, were raised up in Germany.
[153]  In God s will, the church should not be under man s control; it should be directed only by the Holy Spirit.
[154]  Now there were in Antioch, in the local church,
[155]  How do we recognize whether or not a person is a worker?
[156]  What is the relationship between the younger workers and the older workers in the work?
[157]  According to the Bible, the workers who come afterward should submit to the workers who were there before them.
[158]  Now we come to the need of the workers.
[159]  The first thing we have to mention is the offering of money by the believers.
[160]  The offerings of the believers are not merely for the support of the workers; they are to supply those who work for the Lord.
[161]  In other words, one does not offer to a certain person simply because he is a worker; he offers to that person because he works for the Lord.
[162]  It is impossible for a person s heart to be touched by God without his possessions also being touched by God.
[163]  Today, God desires that we walk according to the principle of manna.
[164]  The principle of manna is: He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack 2 Cor 8:15 .
[165]  This is not just the record in the Old Testament.
