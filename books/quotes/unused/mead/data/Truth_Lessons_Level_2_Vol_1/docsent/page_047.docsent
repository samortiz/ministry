   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this dispensation, righteousness will reign as king; hence, this dispensation is also called the dispensation of righteousness.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I. REWARDING, ACCORDING TO RIGHTEOUSNESS,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE JUST MEN PERFECTED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the first two dispensations, the dispensation of the patriarchs and the dispensation of law, God obtained a group of perfected just men, the overcomers in the Old Testament, who are able to enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens to participate in Christ s kingship and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the dispensation of the patriarchs, all those who took God s ordained way by faith according to God s promise were perfected to become the overcomers in their times.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They were the fathers, such as Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moreover, in the dispensation of law, the devout and just men, who absolutely kept the law by the offerings and the tabernacle, both of which typify Christ, were also perfected to become the overcomers in their times.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such men were Moses, Joshua, Caleb, and others who were perfected by God in the Old Testament, as mentioned in Hebrews 11.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They all will receive the Lord s reward and enter into the heavenly part of the millennial kingdom to enjoy the kingdom feast Matt 8:11 and to be co-kings with Christ Rev 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>REWARDING, ACCORDING TO RIGHTEOUSNESS,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE OVERCOMING BELIEVERS IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the dispensation of grace God is also gaining the overcoming believers in Christ, who will enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, becoming its main part, to be co-kings with Christ, ruling over the nations on the earth in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Testament clearly indicates that before God the believers must not only deal with the matter of salvation but also with the matter of reward and punishment Luke 19:22-26; Matt 24:45-51; 25:1-30; Luke 12:42-48; 2 Cor 5:9-10; 1 Cor 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the dispensation of the kingdom comes, all believers must face this issue.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to solemnly take the Lord s word concerning the reward and punishment of the kingdom that we may be warned, encouraged, and attracted to press on toward Christ and to be the overcomers that we may receive a prize in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A. The Significance of Receiving a Reward</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the Scriptures, the significance of receiving a reward includes at least five aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First, to receive a reward is to receive a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are different crowns: the crown of righteousness 2 Tim 4:8 , the crown of life Rev 2:10 , the crown of glory 1 Pet 5:4 , the incorruptible crown 1 Cor 9:25 , and the crown of joy 1 Thes 2:19; Phil 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The crown of righteousness will be awarded to those who faithfully follow the Lord and who love His appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is called the crown of righteousness because it will be given by the Lord, the righteous Judge, to His faithful lovers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The crown of life will be awarded to those who suffer martyrdom for the Lord, caring not for their own lives and being faithful unto death, so that they may manifest forever the Lord s powerful life, which is incorruptible 2 Tim 1:10 , which cannot be held by death, and which has passed through death and resurrection, proving that they have overcome death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The crown of glory will be awarded to those who willingly shepherd the Lord s flock today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since they care for the Lord s intention and look after God s flock, the Lord will give them the crown of glory that they may eternally express the glory of God, which is God Himself, in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The incorruptible crown will be awarded to those who forsake the earthly joys to run the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to run the Lord s way, they forsake all the temporary things of this world, things which are corruptible and which will pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, the Lord will give them an incorruptible crown, declaring eternally that what they choose today is a glorious blessing which will last forever and which will never pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The crown of joy will be a reward to those who care for the Lord s believers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since they care for people s souls and for people s condition before the Lord, the Lord will make those whom they have cared for their crown of joy, testifying eternally in the universe to all their labor on others for the Lord s sake.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Second, the significance of receiving a reward is to sit on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the prize that the Lord, when He sits on the throne of His glory to exercise His authority, will give to the twelve disciples who forsook everything to follow Him Matt 19:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is also the prize that the Lord will give to all overcoming believers Rev 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every overcoming believer in this age will receive from the Lord the reward of sitting with Him on His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Third, the significance of receiving a reward is to receive authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the prize that the Lord will award to the believers who overcome and who keep His commandments until the end Rev 2:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They steadfastly keep the Lord s commandments to be the overcomers in the present age, when the church is in desolation and the world is in opposition to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, when the Lord rules over the world, He will give them authority over the nations, and they will reign over them with Him Rev 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is also the reward that the Lord will give to those who work faithfully for Him; some will have authority over ten cities, and others will have authority over five cities Luke 19:17, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Fourth, the significance of receiving a reward is to be a king.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we can endure sufferings and difficulties for the Lord in this age, we will also reign with Him in the coming age 2 Tim 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Throughout the generations all those who faithfully bear the testimony for the Lord, even suffering martyrdom for Him, will be co-kings with Him to reign over the world.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This will be in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, kingship is also a prize which the Lord will give to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Fifth, the significance of receiving a reward is to be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who faithfully bear the testimony for the Lord today, even giving up their lives for Him, will not only reign with Him but also be priests of God and of Christ Rev 20:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the millennium the Lord will give them a twofold status and qualification of honor.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the one hand, they will be kings, and on the other hand, they will be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As kings they will represent God before man, bringing God s authority to man; as priests they will represent man before God, bringing man s service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As kings they will participate in God s reign to carry out God s administration; as priests they will partake of God s life to obtain God Himself, thus enjoying the topmost blessing in the universe, which is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Both of these blessings of honor are included in the reward which the Lord will give to the overcomers.</S>
