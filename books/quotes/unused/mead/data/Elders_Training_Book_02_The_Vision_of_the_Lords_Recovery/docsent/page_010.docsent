   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Essential and Economical Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in Christ s Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the essential Trinity, the Three are all there without anything that we might call a succession or a progression.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit were all there at the same time in eternity, and They are here; They continue to exist simultaneously for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is in the essential Trinity, the Divine Trinity according to His essence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, in the economical Trinity, initially, the Father planned, He made His choice, His selection, and He predestinated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Following this planning of the Father, the Son came to accomplish what the Father had planned.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then, after the Son s accomplishment, the Spirit came to apply what the Son had accomplished according to what the Father had planned.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here in this economy there is a succession, and there is a progression.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, according to the essence of the Trinity, the Three are equal, and there is no succession or progression.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, in the economy of God, there is what we might call a succession, a progression.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are the three steps.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to realize that Christ s redemption involves both God s essence and God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For the Redeemer to be qualified He needs two essences the essence of man and the essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, when He accomplished redemption, economically speaking, there were some matters regarding the functioning Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While the Redeemer was standing there after His baptism, the Holy Spirit came down upon Him economically.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That descending of the Spirit was the functioning Spirit, the Spirit in function, or the Spirit in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, when He was conceived and born of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit there was the Holy Spirit in essence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These distinctions are important for our understanding, but they may not be easy for us to grasp.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Redeemer was crucified on the cross, God left Him, not essentially, but economically.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God was essentially in the man Jesus from His conception, through His birth, through His human living, through His death, through His resurrection, and through eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, after He was baptized to begin to minister, God came down upon Him to anoint Him economically.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This economical Spirit was with Him all the time for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then, according to Hebrews 9:14, He offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the last period of time on the cross, when He became sin in the eyes of God, this Spirit left Him economically, not essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that God left Him economically, not essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is by this way, essentially and economically, that He was qualified to redeem man and all creatures and also entitled to have the eternal efficacy for His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, He is qualified to accomplish our redemption, and the eternal and everlasting effectiveness of His redemption is insured.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is our vision concerning Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At this point, may I say a brief word concerning the reason we have no trust in the traditional teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have a vision with much deeper truth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because the Lord has shown us something in a much deeper way, we simply cannot follow the teachings that are superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>CONCERNING GOD S FULL SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not easy to speak concerning our vision of redemption, nor is it easy to speak concerning the vision of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, once you are enlightened to see this vision, you would be beside yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Compared to the full salvation revealed in the Word of God, our speaking may be somewhat like the speaking of an uneducated person about a highly technical subject if we are short of enlightenment and short of vision in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Assurance of Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the first stage of our vision concerning God s full salvation, we were enlightened to see the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We were beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Wherever we went, we would ask people, Have you been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you know that you have been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We especially liked to ask the pastors, elders, preachers, deacons, or deaconesses these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At that time I was somewhat like a young tiger, afraid of nothing and not knowing much.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We offended many people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I was a young man, about twenty-five years old, and I was questioning a pastor about sixty-five years old, Do you know you have been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No doubt he was offended and wondered how such a young person dared to ask him such a question.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Actually, he did not know that he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We met a number of cases like this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On one occasion in 1933, I was invited to preach to the students at a Presbyterian Hospital nursing school with nearly one hundred students and nurses.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The pastor, the only older one present, sat at the back of the chapel behind all the students, while I was standing in the front preaching the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was offended quite a few times while I was speaking and shook his head in disagreement.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The students, however, were happy to hear what I had to say, and they nodded their heads in agreement.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As I said, at that time I was young and very bold, but I did not know much.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today, if I were preaching the assurance of salvation, I would not ask people, Have you been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In fact, if you were to ask me whether I have been saved, today I would ask you what you mean, because I have come to realize that God s salvation is not a simple matter.</S>
