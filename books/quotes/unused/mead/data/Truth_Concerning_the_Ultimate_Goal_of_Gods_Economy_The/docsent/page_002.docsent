   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>From Life-study of Job,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Message Twenty-four, p.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>129</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Athanasius, one of the early church fathers, said concerning Christ, He was made man that we might be made God, and The Word was made flesh...that we, partaking of His Spirit, might be deified.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the principle of God s move on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God s move is in man and through man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s move is to deify man, making man God in life and in nature but not, of course, in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From The Move of God in Man,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Message Two, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>20-21 TO MAKE GOD MAN</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THAT MAN MAY BECOME GOD</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>IN LIFE AND NATURE BUT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>NOT IN THE GODHEAD</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God in eternity past was God only, but in incarnation He was made man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He made Himself man that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may be able to say that we become like God in life and nature, but do we have the boldness to say that we become God in life and nature?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to see that we have been born of God, and we are the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Have you not been born of man?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then are you not man?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are not man, then what are you?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same way, since we are born of God and are the sons of God, are we not God?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You are whatever you have been born of.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you have been born of Chinese, you are Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you have been born of Caucasians, you are Caucasian.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since we are born of God, we may say and even we should say that we are God in life and nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church fathers taught the truth concerning deification in the first four centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They pointed out clearly that deification means that the believers in Christ have been made God in His life and in His nature but not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is the unique God for people to worship in His Godhead, but we are God only in life and in nature, not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all have to be clear that today we are God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Others should be able to sense that we are men plus something else.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They may not be able to pin down what we are, but they can sense that we have something more.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, when we speak something concerning Christ, they all will realize that what we have as something more is Christ Himself, that is, God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the testimony of a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From The Issue of the Dispensing</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>of the Processed Trinity and the Transmitting</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>of the Transcending Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Chapter Two, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>25-26</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The sanctifying Spirit in God s sanctification first sought us out and then regenerated us, making us sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a cat begets kittens, those kittens are baby cats.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the same way, God begot us to make us the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To make us the sons of God is to make us baby gods, having God s life and nature but not His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In life, in nature, and in expression we are the same as He is, because we are born of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, we are not only the children of God, we are not only the sons of God, we are not only the heirs of God, but we are also the baby gods.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The kittens, the baby cats, are surely cats because they are according to the cats kind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God created everything according to its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Man, however, was created according to God s kind because he was created in God s image Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Later, we men were born of God, not only bearing God s image but also having God s life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, we become God in life and in nature, but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is what the sonship means.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From Life-study of 1 and 2 Samuel,</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Message Twenty-five, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>166-167 DEIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>BECOMING GOD IN LIFE AND IN NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>BUT NOT IN THE GODHEAD</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This brings us to the matter of deification God s intention to make the believers God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Athanasius referred to deification when at the Council of Nicea in A.D. 325 he said, He Christ was made man that we might be made God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although the term deification is familiar to many theologians and Christian teachers, during the past sixteen centuries only a small number have dared to teach regarding the deification of the believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I have not been influenced by any teaching about deification, but I have learned from my study of the Bible that God does intend to make the believers God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For instance, 1 John 3:2 says, Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not yet been manifested what we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We know that if He is manifested, we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This verse clearly reveals that we will be like God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God makes us like Him by imparting His life and nature into us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Second Peter 1:4 says that we have become partakers of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>John 1:12-13 says that we were born, regenerated, by God with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As God s children we are baby gods, having God s life and nature but not His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Godhead is unique; He is the only One who should be worshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have been born of God and today, having God s life and nature, we are partially like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>One day, when He comes, we will be wholly and entirely like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It was wonderful for David to be a man according to God s heart, but it was not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God wants those who can say, I am not just a person according to God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I am God in life and in nature but not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>On the one hand, the New Testament reveals that the Godhead is unique and that only God, who alone has the Godhead, should be worshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>On the other hand, the New Testament reveals that we, the believers in Christ, have God s life and nature and that we are becoming God in life and in nature but will never have His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>From The Practical Points</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>concerning Blending, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>45-46</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Revelation 4 tells us that God looks like jasper v. 3 . Then Revelation 21 says that the entire New Jerusalem has the appearance of jasper v. 11 . Thus, God s redeemed people have become absolutely the very God in life, in nature, and in appearance, but not in His Godhead....All of God s redeemed people will eventually become gods as the very God in life, in nature, and in appearance but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The New Jerusalem is the God-men who have been transformed, glorified, and mingled with the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>From Living a Life according to the High Peak</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>of God s Revelation, Chapter Five, p.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>40</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Our practice is not to live the life of any kind of natural man, good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Our practice is to live the life of a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>A God-man is a man who is regenerated and transformed to be one with God, taking God as his life, his person, and his everything.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Eventually, this one becomes God in His life and His nature, but not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the recovery today we should practice to live the life of such a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This life is a life of crucifixion by and in and with resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is a life in which I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live but He who lives in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Yet when He lives in me, He lives with me, with the result that I live with Him John 14:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He lives with me, and I live with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We two live together in the way of mingling, a mingling of God and man.</S>
