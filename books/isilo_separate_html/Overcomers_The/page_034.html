To Open Ourselves to the Lord, Who Is Shut outside the Door of the Church</h2><p>In order to overcome lukewarmness, we need to open ourselves to the Lord, who is shut outside the door of the lukewarm church. Revelation 3:20 reveals that the Lord is outside the door of the church in Laodicea. Thus, He is not within the church in Laodicea but is outside knocking at the door. The door is the door of the church, but the door is opened by individual believers. To the one who opens the door, the Lord will enter into him to feast with him. We should have the assurance that every morning our door is wide open to the Lord so that He can come in to dine with us, to feast with us.<h2 class=head2>E. The Reward</h2><h2 class=head3>1. To Feast with the Lord, Signifying the Rich and Full Enjoyment of the Unsearchable Riches of Christ</h2><p>The overcomers will be rewarded by Christ. They will feast with the Lord, signifying the rich and full enjoyment of the unsearchable riches of Christ (Rev. 3:20b; Eph. 3:8). When we open to the Lord, He and we will enjoy each other. Then His presence becomes our feast, and our presence becomes His feast. Thus, we dine with each other, feasting together. This is the practical and full enjoyment of Christ in our daily life. Every day we should have such a feast.<h2 class=head3>2. To Participate in Sitting with Christ on His Throne for the Fellowship in His Kingship in Authority</h2><p>Eventually, the overcomers will participate in sitting with Christ as the King on His throne for the fellowship, the participation, in His kingship as His co-kings in authority to rule over all the nations (Rev. 3:21; 20:4, 6).<p>We can see from this fellowship that we all need to aspire to be the overcomers. We have to overcome big things like the three deformed religions and small things like our attitude and the way that we dress. When a husband loses his temper with his wife, at that moment he is no longer an overcomer but a failure in his daily life. Day by day we have to overcome in all the small things.<p>We should not say &#8220;no&#8221; to the Lord and &#8220;yes&#8221; to Satan. We should always practice to say &#8220;yes&#8221; to the Lord and &#8220;no&#8221; to Satan. We should say &#8220;no&#8221; to all of the &#8220;isms.&#8221; We should say &#8220;no&#8221; to the denominations, to the exalting of all the names other than the unique name of Christ. For a Christian to take another name besides the name of Christ is a shame and an insult to Him. We must make a definite decision to take the Lord&#8217;s way, the way of being an overcomer. We must overcome the trend of not keeping the Lord&#8217;s word, the tide of denying the Lord&#8217;s name, and the lukewarmness in the Lord&#8217;s testimony.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> </body></html>
