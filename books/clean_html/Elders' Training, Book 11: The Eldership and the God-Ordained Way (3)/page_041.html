<P>The first priest of the New Testament was John the Baptist. The Old Testament priesthood ended with John. John was born of Zachariah, a leading one in the line of Old Testament priests. John, however, did not stay in the line of the Old Testament priesthood. He did not eat the priest's food or wear the priestly garments. Rather, he lived in the wild, ate wild food, and wore wild clothing. He preached the gospel, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near" (Matt. 3:2). John's ministry was to usher in Christ. Eventually, whoever he gained through his preaching was offered to God. After this, the Lord Jesus continued the priesthood of the gospel and raised up more priests. He sent firstly twelve and then seventy to preach the gospel. This preaching of the gospel was to get sinners saved to become the followers of Jesus, and the followers of Jesus were to become the members of Christ that the Body of Christ might be built up to fulfill God's New Testament economy. As New Testament believers, we must fulfill our priesthood to get sinners regenerated to become the members of the Body of Christ. This is the primary responsibility of the elders in the church.</P><P>The primary thing that every co-worker, elder, and serving one in the church must do is to bring forth fruit. A fruit tree does not bear fruit once every five years. According to Revelation 22:2, the tree of life yields its fruit twelve times a year. The tree of life in Revelation 22 is the vine in John 15. The Lord Jesus said that we believers are the branches of this vine, and the branches of this vine are for bearing fruit (John 15:5). If we do not bear fruit, we are wrong. We should bear at least one fruit a year.</P><P>God firstly created one man, but He desired to have many men for His purpose. Therefore, God said, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth" (Gen. 1:28). According to this verse, the primary responsibility Adam bore was to reproduce. Likewise, we Christians are charged to bear fruit. All other matters in the Christian life are for this. We read the Bible because we must bear fruit, we pray because we must bear fruit, and we are victorious and overcoming because we must bear fruit. Fruit-bearing is not for the Bible or for prayer. Rather, everything is for fruit-bearing. We have many things today, including Bible reading, Bible study, and prayers, but the one thing we lack is fruit-bearing. An orchard is for fruit-bearing, not for making a show. It is meaningless to keep an orchard clean and in order but not have fruit. It is better to have a messy orchard that is full of fruit. If we do not have fruit-bearing, we cannot have the increase, and if we do not have the increase, we cannot build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12).</P>
