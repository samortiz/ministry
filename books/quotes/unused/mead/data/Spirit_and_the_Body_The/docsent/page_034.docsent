   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT OF SONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is even more difficult to say what the Spirit of sonship is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sonship refers both to the life of the son and to the position of the son.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, sonship is not only a matter of life, but also a matter of position.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A boy who is the son of a certain man has the sonship of that man because he has obtained that man's life and has the position of that man's son.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, he has the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all have been born sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that we have the life of a son of God and also the position of a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both the life and the position are related to the Spirit and are included in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you have the Spirit, you have the life of a son of God and the position of a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, if you do not have the Spirit, you have neither the life nor the position.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A MATTER OF EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not merely a matter of doctrine, but a matter of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You may claim to be a son of God, and indeed you are.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But whenever you are not one with the Spirit, the life and position of a son of God are no longer evident.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, are you a son of God when you quarrel with your wife?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is difficult to say.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, because you have been regenerated, you are certainly a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, as you are quarreling with your wife, as far as your experience is concerned, you are like an unsaved person, because at that time you are not one with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I am one with the Spirit, I have the life of a son of God and the position of a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when I am not one with the Spirit, the picture is altogether different.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By this we see that if we would experience the sonship, the life, and the holiness, we must be one with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because the Spirit is in our spirit, the only way to be one with the Spirit is to exercise our spirit and to focus our whole being on our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here in our spirit we touch the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We touch the Spirit of holiness, the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we do this, we are immediately living by the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By doing this, we are designated, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and even glorified to be the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because some of you still hold on to the natural concepts, you may be troubled when you hear these things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I realize that such a message differs from some of the teachings you heard in the past, especially the ethical teachings regarding the improvement of your behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, if you are a husband, you have probably been admonished to love your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But I doubt that even one husband has succeeded in doing this fully.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The matter of husbands loving their wives is a religious, ethical teaching; it is not the basic revelation of the Bible.</S>
