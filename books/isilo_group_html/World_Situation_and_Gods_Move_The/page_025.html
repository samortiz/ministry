They said that the United States was following the pattern of the Roman Empire, becoming corrupt and bankrupt. I argued against them. The United States was established on a different foundation. It is the only great power in history that has not robbed other countries. It is built upon its own resources and its own people. Because of its vast riches, it has no need to rob others. After my visit here in 1958, I went on to Europe. I found that in England, Denmark, and the other northern European countries there was the expectation that Communism would take over. Again I boldly argued that this would not be the case.<p>The oil crisis did not occur till 1973, but in 1962 I told the brothers that in the Mideast the problems would be the oil. I told them that the nations would not be able to resolve this problem and that God would do something about it. This was not a prophecy; it was just a talk I had with the brothers over twenty years ago.<h2 class=head1>THE LAST COUNTRY FOR THE LAST MOVE</h2><p>Almost every part of the globe is being used, and natural resources are close to an end. Can humankind last another few centuries? Is there time for the Lord to raise up another world power after the United States? I do not believe so. It seems that the United States is the last power raised up by the Lord to match His recovery.<p>As this ultimate move of the Lord goes forward from here, there is the need for such a powerful country to keep the world at peace and to keep the way open. Now that we have planes like the 747s, we no longer need the Roman roads that were used in the early centuries for the spread of the gospel. But these 747s need a peaceful situation for the word of the Lord&#8217;s recovery to go out. If the peace is broken, the spread will be stopped. The Lord needs a country for this. The United States, instead of robbing other countries, has been a giver. Since the end of the war in 1945, the United States has given away billions of dollars to other countries. You may be concerned that the deficit is getting bigger; however, the money the government owes is mostly to its own people. This is like a father owing money to his sons. The account shows red; but the money being spent is in the family.<p>If your eyes are open, you will realize what an age and what a country you live in, what the Lord&#8217;s recovery is, and how the world situation is going on. The state of things today is for one thing-the Lord&#8217;s recovery. The world is going on for the spreading of the recovery, for the preparing of the bride, for the lampstands to be raised up and shining in many countries. In this ultimate recovery what the Lord is regaining is not small teachings but big items, especially from the viewpoint of the central vision. This is the Lord&#8217;s ultimate recovery, and He has such a country to maintain the world situation that His recovery may be spread.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The World Situation and God's Move &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
