   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The time required for a believer to progress from the state of being fleshly to the state of being spiritual is not so long as some imagine today.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although not many years had passed since the Corinthian believers had become Christians, the apostle already considered them to have been babes for too long, to have been of the flesh for too long.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He expected them to have long since become spiritual!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The purpose of Christ's redemption is to remove all hindrances that the Holy Spirit may take full control of one's entire being and make him spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such redemption can never fail, nor is the power of the Holy Spirit ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a fleshly sinner can become a regenerated believer, so can a regenerated believer who is still fleshly become spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is most pitiful is that among the present-day believers there are some who have remained as babes not merely for several years but have continued to remain in their old selves for decades without any progress whatever.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, even though there are some who are able to progress into a spiritual life in a few years, they are very surprised, thinking that this is unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Little do they know that this is normal nothing more than normal regular growth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Readers, how many years have you believed in the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And have you become spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not become aged babes, thereby causing grief to the Holy Spirit and bringing loss to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As regenerated believers we should yearn for a completely spiritual life, and in everything we should let the Holy Spirit be the Lord and Master so that He may in the least possible time lead us into what God has prepared for us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On no account should we waste our time, making no progress at all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can trace the reasons that a person remains a babe so long without any growth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Generally speaking, there are two reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One reason is that those who watch over the believers only pay attention to the grace of God and the position of the believers in Christ without encouraging them to pursue spiritual experience, or these overseers, not knowing the life in the Holy Spirit, are unable to lead those whom they watch over into a more abundant life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The other reason is that the believers themselves show little interest in the things of the Spirit, thinking that it is good enough merely to be saved; or they do not hunger and thirst after the things of the Spirit; or, after knowing the prerequisites, they are unwilling to pay the price because it is too high.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Due to these causes, there are many such old babes in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What are the characteristics of a fleshly person?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first is remaining as a babe for a long time Heb 5:11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The period of babyhood should not exceed a few years at the very most.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A person is regenerated because he believes in the redemption accomplished for him by the Son of God on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When he so believes, he should also believe that he has been crucified with the Savior and thus allow the Holy Spirit to release and deliver him from the power of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ignorant of this principle, he will inevitably remain fleshly for many years.</S>
