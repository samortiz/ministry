   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LUMINARIES IN THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Philippians 2:15 reveals that the believers are luminaries in the world: "That you may become blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Literally the Greek word translated "lights" here is luminaries, which reflect the light of the sun, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As children of God with the divine life and nature, we have a special function the function of shining.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because we have the divine life and nature, we have become luminaries reflecting Christ as the real sun.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever we cooperate with God's inward operation Phil 2:13 according to the divine life and nature, we shine with the light of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Children of God, Blameless and Guileless, without Blemish in the Midst of a Crooked and Perverted Generation</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 2:15 Paul speaks of the believers as children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This implies regeneration, the new birth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be a child of God means that we have been born of God, that God has been conceived within us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we became children of God, God was conceived in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that when we were born of God in our spirit, we were mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God has been conceived within us, and we have been born of Him to become His children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The expression "children of God" in 2:15 is very rich in its implications.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It implies that God has actually been born into us and that we possess His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes we may say, "I am just a sinner saved by grace."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although this, of course, is true, it is very shallow compared with the revelation in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we know the truth of the Word, we shall not say that we are merely sinners saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We shall have the boldness to declare, "I am a child of God born of the Spirit!"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No doubt, we are sinners who have been saved by God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But because we have been born of God, we are now His children.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can be children of God only by having the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How wonderful it is to have God's life!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just as a child has the life of his parents, so as children of God we have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All those who are truly children of God need to realize that they have the divine life within them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is this life that makes us luminaries.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As children of God we should be blameless and guileless.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Greek word rendered "guileless" also means simple, artless, innocent; hence, harmless Matt 10:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Greek root of this word means unmixed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Blameless describes our outward behavior, and guileless, our inward character.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are blameless and guileless, we shall be without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be without blemish is the total quality of being blameless and guileless.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Philippians 2:15 goes on to tell us that as children of God who are blameless and guileless, we are without blemish "in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Greek word rendered "perverted" literally means warped, twisted.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The generation in which we live is crooked, warped, and twisted.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, as children of God we must be different.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because we are God's children, we should be both blameless and guileless, without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Shining among the Sinful Generation by Reflecting the Light of the Sun, Christ</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As lights, or luminaries, the believers shine among the sinful generation by reflecting the light of the sun, Christ Mal 4:2; Luke 1:78 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, we have no light in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our shining is simply the reflection of light which we receive from another source.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is the light, the real sun, and we reflect Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, our shining is our reflection of Christ as the source of our light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Ultimately, the New Jerusalem as the aggregate of all the redeemed and perfected saints, will be a great luminary, shining the glory of God in Christ over all the nations Rev 21:11, 24a .</S>
