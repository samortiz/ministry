   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DAVID AND MEPHIBOSHETH Issue No. 32 Scripture Reading: 2 Sam 4:4; 9:1-13; 16:1-4; 19:24-30; 21:7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today I want to look at a wonderful story from the Old Testament about a lame boy sitting at a king's table.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Bible there are many wonderful stories: one tells us about a prostitute who was saved, one about a robber who was saved, one about a tax collector who was saved, and even one about a bad Pharisee who was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today we will talk about a lame boy who was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Most of the people sitting here have read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we talk about friendship in the Bible, we often mention David and Jonathan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some secular writers also use the story of David and Jonathan as an example of love between friends.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But today I want to speak about how David graciously treated Jonathan's son, Mephibosheth, and about Mephibosheth's gratitude to David.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>MEPHIBOSHETH BEING LAME</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2 SAMUEL 4:4</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second Samuel 4:4 says, "And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And his name was Mephibosheth."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Please pay special attention to the fact that Mephibosheth's grandfather, Saul, was David's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many times he persecuted David and wanted to put him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was a great enemy of David.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Saul and Jonathan were killed, Mephibosheth's nurse took him and fled quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She thought that since both his grandfather and father were dead, David might come to avenge and kill Mephibosheth if they did not flee fast.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The boy fell on the ground and became lame because she was running too fast.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Consider for a moment: does this not look like the picture of a sinner before God?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man has misunderstood God!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I say again: man has misunderstood our God!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because man has devious thoughts about God, he thinks that God also has devious thoughts about him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because man hates God, he thinks that God also hates him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man knows that he has sinned, and he thinks that God hates him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Mephibosheth thought, "My grandfather was David's enemy; therefore, David must hate me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have no love for David; therefore, David must have no love for me."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the way we also think.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We think that God has no love for us because we have no love for God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We think that God cannot love us because we hate God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But God is not the same as we.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Mephibosheth had no ground to receive grace, yet he received it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The same is true with regard to us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>DAVID SHOWING MEPHIBOSHETH KINDNESS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>2 SAMUEL 9:1-13</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?" v. 1 . God is also asking, "Is there yet any that is left of Adam, that I may show him grace?" David showed Mephibosheth kindness for the sake of Jonathan; God graced the sinners because of His Son Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>People make a great mistake in thinking that God hates man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They think that man has to do a great deal of good before God's face will be turned to them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet they are not sure how much good should be done before God will stop His wrath, consider them, and be pleased with them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But Mephibosheth had no position at all before David.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>David did not know Mephibosheth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>David only knew Mephibosheth's father, Jonathan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was gracious to Mephibosheth for Jonathan's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Mephibosheth did not have to do anything good before he could receive David's favor.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Mephibosheth had no position at all before David.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He received kindness not because of himself but because of another person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is true for a sinner before God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many people think, "I must do something good before I can please God."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But the Bible tells us that God loves us without a reason.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We did not have any position before God, and we should not have obtained His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But we have our Jonathan, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God has graced us because of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are saved because we have the Lord Jesus before God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>With the Lord, we can come before God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The universities in the old times required two years of pre-university studies.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some medical schools required three years of preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But to obtain salvation, there is no need to enter any pre-university.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many people think that they have to prepare themselves before they can win back God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But I can tell you that there is no need to do anything to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is no place in the Bible that says that God wants to be reconciled to us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Bible only says that we need to be reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God is reconciled to us already!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God gave His Son to us because He loved us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He did not love us only after He gave His Son to us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Someone said, "It is fortunate the Lord Jesus died so that God could love us."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But there is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He gave His Son to us because He loved us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>And the king said unto him, Where is he?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Lodebar is a Hebrew word which means "a place without grass."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The world today is a "Lodebar"; it can never fill up man's hunger or quench man's thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>"Lodebar" can never satisfy our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Brothers and sisters, do you know that we are created for God and not for ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All those who have not turned back to God will never be satisfied.</S>
