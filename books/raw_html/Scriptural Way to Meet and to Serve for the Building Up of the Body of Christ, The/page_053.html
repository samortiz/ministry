 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">EXERCISING TO SPEAK<br />
THE WORD OF THE LORD WITH THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 6:63; 7:38-39; Rom. 10:8; Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16</h1>
<p>For us to meet and to serve in the scriptural way, we must exercise to speak the word of the Lord with the Spirit. Our speaking of the living word of the Lord will issue in the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BEING THE EMBODIMENT<br />
OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Most Christians know that the Bible is the Word of God. But many do not know the very essence of the holy word in the Bible. Anything that is solid always has an element and an essence. We need to consider what the essence of the word of the Lord is. The holy word that has been spoken by God through the generations is the very embodiment of the Triune God. This is based on John 1:1 and 14. Verse 1 tells us definitely that the Word, the holy Word, is God. The word that has been spoken through the generations is God Himself essentially. The Word is God Himself, not in person but in essence. This simply means that God is altogether embodied in the Word. God is Spirit, and a spirit is mysterious and invisible. But the Word is something in black and white. It is visible and solid. Thus, the Word is the embodiment of the mysterious and invisible God. Although God is invisible and mysterious, the Word is not. The solid and visible Word embodies God. The Word defines, explains, and expresses God. When I am speaking word after word, I express myself. God is invisible, yet God is fully defined and explained in the Word.</p>
<p>Thank the Lord that we have God and we have the Bible. Where would the human race be if there had been no Bible for the past four thousand years? It would be in darkness. Today we have the privilege of being in the light and not in darkness. We are even shining over others as lights in the world (Phil. 2:15; Matt. 5:14, 16). The publications that we print are also a shining to spread the explanation and the definition of the invisible God. I recently found out the standing orders in Spanish for the publications of Living Stream Ministry are almost the same as the standing orders in English. This means that God is spreading through the publications to shine over Latin America.</p>
<p>Most of Latin America is under the influence of Catholicism. Nearly all of the truths in Catholicism have been leavened and corrupted. Hardly any of the truths in Catholicism are pure. In Matthew 13, there is a parable of a woman who took leaven and mixed it with the fine flour to leaven its entire contents (vv. 33-35). The unleavened fine flour signifies Christ as our food, and the woman signifies the Catholic Church who took many pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters and mixed them with the teachings concerning this pure Christ. Some in Catholicism use the excuse that it is hard for people to understand the divine and spiritual things, so there is the need to make these things easy to take in. Leavened bread is much easier to eat than unleavened bread, but leaven in the Scriptures is a corrupting and evil element (1 Cor. 5:6, 8; Matt. 16:6, 11-12). Because of Catholicism, Latin America has not been under the shining of the pure truth. Our publications have touched the hungry hearts there and are shining to spread the word as the embodiment of the Triune God.</p>
<p>John 1:14 tells us that the Word, which is the embodiment of the Triune God, became flesh, and this Word become flesh is Jesus, a man. This Man lived on this earth in Nazareth in the poor home of a carpenter for about thirty years. When He was thirty years old, He came out to minister Himself as the Word. Whatever He spoke was the coming out of His divine essence. The word spoken by the Lord Jesus was the very essence of the Triune God. He was the sower sowing the word (Luke 8:5, 11), and the word that He sowed was Himself. He Himself was the word. The gospel is the embodiment of Jesus Christ. The gospel is not merely in doctrine but it is a Person, and that Person is Jesus Christ. When we preach the word, define the word, and explain the word, what we speak is not merely the word but a Person.</p>
<p>To believe in the gospel is not to believe in teachings or doctrines but to believe in a living Person. When you believe in the gospel, immediately a living Person, Jesus Christ, enters into you, and this Person, Jesus Christ, is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). The word is altogether wrapped up with the Triune God. The holy word is the embodiment of the Triune God. When we exercise our spirit to speak the word, we speak God, we speak Christ, we speak the Triune God consummated as the Spirit. There is much speaking in today&rsquo;s Christianity that is not the speaking of the Triune God. This speaking is merely vain words, but our speaking should be the word that is the embodiment of the Triune God.</p>
