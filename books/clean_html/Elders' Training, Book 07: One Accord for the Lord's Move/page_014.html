<h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF THE LORD TO ONE CHURCH<br />
BEING THE WORD SPOKEN BY THE SPIRIT<br />
TO ALL THE CHURCHES</h2>
<p>The word of the Lord to one church is the word spoken by the Spirit to all the churches (Rev. 2:1, 7). &ldquo;The word of the Lord&rdquo; is the word spoken by Him in Revelation 2 and 3. At the very beginning of His epistle to each church the Lord tells us His status. After declaring what He is, He speaks; but at the end of His speaking the Word says: &ldquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches&rdquo; (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). This word has been repeated seven times. The fact that the word of the Lord to one church is the word spoken by the Spirit not only indicates that He and the Spirit are one, but also that His word spoken to one church is the word spoken by the Spirit to all the churches.</p>
<p>Suppose that the Lord spoke something to the church in Ephesus, but the church in Laodicea felt that their situation was different from Ephesus. They felt that they should pray to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading as to whether they should take the fellowship to Ephesus entirely or only take it partially to fit into their situation. Of course, there was not such a thing in Revelation 2 and 3, but I heard such a thing among us in today&rsquo;s recovery. This is dissension with a nice cloak. Some say, &ldquo;We receive the ministry, yet we would consider and pray to see how much the Lord will lead us to take of the ministry and how much it will fit in with our local situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wife could say to her husband, &ldquo;I love you and I take you as my husband, but whatever you say I have to bring to the Lord to see if it is really His leading for me. I need to pray to find out whether I should take your word wholly or in part and whether it fits in with my situation.&rdquo; If a wife had this attitude, how would her husband feel? Her attitude is a kind of subtle dissension, and her husband would not be able to tolerate it forever. I have been tolerating such an attitude from some, though, for the past fifteen years, but my toleration has ended.</p>
<p>We must see, I say again, that the word of the Lord to one church is the word spoken by the Spirit to all the churches. The best church was Philadelphia, but even Philadelphia did not consider that she had to pray to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading as to whether she should take the Lord&rsquo;s word to the other churches wholly or partially and as to whether it fit into her local situation. There was not such a thing. We all need to stand in front of the mirror to see our face. As we look we may also see something of Christianity. Can the Lord&rsquo;s recovery be like this? Can the poor history of degraded Christianity be repeated in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? Should we not all throw the stone on any kind of subtle divorce?</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SOLUTION MADE AT JERUSALEM BEING<br />
THE DECREE FOR ALL THE CHURCHES TO KEEP</h2>
<p>The solution made at Jerusalem was the decree for all the churches to keep (Acts 15:1-2, 13, 19-21, 22-23, 25-31; 16:4-5). &ldquo;Decree&rdquo; is a strong word. The text in Acts 16:4 uses the word &ldquo;decrees.&rdquo; A decree is something more than a solution, instruction, teaching, or direction. Acts 15:1-2 shows us that there was a big problem, a big disturbance involving the Judaic practice of circumcision. This stirred up trouble among the churches, especially between the churches in the Gentile world and the churches in Judea. Even though the Apostle Paul was so much for the truth concerning the Gentiles, he still considered that the problem should not be settled in Antioch but with the church in Jerusalem. He did not make the decision to forget about Jerusalem or for the Gentile churches to put aside the Judaic practices regardless of the way the church in Jerusalem felt. If Paul would have practiced this way, he would have been sectarian. This would have meant that he practiced two Bodies of Christ on this earth&mdash;one Body in the Gentile world and another Body in Judea which he did not care for. Paul, however, realized that this was not the right way, so he, Barnabas, and certain others went to Jerusalem. It was not because Jerusalem was the headquarters of God&rsquo;s move nor because Jerusalem was the head church controlling other churches, that Paul, Barnabas, and certain others went to Jerusalem. It was because Jerusalem was the source from which the heretical teaching concerning circumcision came.</p>
<p>The conference held in Jerusalem was not merely a conference of the apostles and the elders. Acts 15:22 says, &ldquo;Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders with the whole church...&rdquo; Not only were the apostles and elders there, but also the whole church. It was not a conference of the so-called top ones but it was &ldquo;with the whole church.&rdquo; Paul practiced the principle of the Body. This problem was not a matter of a certain region but a matter of the entire Body of Christ. Therefore, Paul went to Jerusalem to have a conference with all the concerned parties&mdash;the apostles, the elders, and the church in Jerusalem. Paul was practicing a Body principle. He was not sectarian to say that the churches in the Gentile world have nothing to do with those in Judea. He did not say, &ldquo;Let them take their way, and let us take our way.&rdquo; He went to Jerusalem to keep the Body principle and then a solution was made.</p>
<p>In the Life-study of Acts, I pointed out that the solution to Paul was not so satisfactory, but in order to keep the principle of the Body he took it. My basis for saying that the solution was not an absolutely satisfactory one is the content of James&rsquo; concluding word in Acts 15:19-21&mdash;&ldquo;Wherefore I judge that we do not harass those from the Gentiles who turn to God. But that we write to them to abstain from the pollutions of idols and fornication and what is strangled and blood. For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who proclaim him in the synagogues, being read every Sabbath.&rdquo; In James&rsquo; concluding word he took care of three main items of Judaism&mdash;the law of Moses, the synagogue, and the Sabbath. By these verses in Acts 15, we can understand why James in Acts 21 was compromising with Judaism (vv. 18-26). Paul realized that in the new man there cannot be any room for Jews, for Greeks, or for any natural person, yet James gave a final word which included one point that is absolutely against the principle of the new man (15:20). Paul tolerated the decision, and this toleration somewhat issued in the situation in Acts 21. By that time the Lord would not tolerate any longer. Just at the time when the Nazarite vows of Paul and four others were to be concluded, God allowed an uproar to rise up against him, and what they intended to accomplish was blown away (21:27).</p>
<p>The decision in Acts 15 was written in a way of a decree, charging all the churches to take it. Fairly speaking, I would like to have such a conference with all of those who are somewhat dissenting. We all need to have a conference in the way that Paul and Barnabas did with those in Jerusalem. Then we have to make a decision and write something to all the churches on the globe. Let all the churches keep our decree. This decree is up to the discernment of the saints according to what God says. Someone in one place did say something last year that has caused people to realize that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there are two lines today and has caused them to be very much concerned about this.</p>
<p>I said already that I do not like to cut anyone off. My ministry is to serve people, to minister Christ to people, to minister the Word to you. Many of you know how much love and patience I have been exercising over you to help you, to preserve you, and to lead you to the right way. The negative things I heard caused me to call the elders&rsquo; training in February of 1984, in September of 1985, and also caused me to call this third one. Although I feel that my toleration has to be terminated, I want to do it in the Body principle. Let us arrive at a solution and pass on the solution to all the churches on the globe.</p>
<p>It is altogether not right to have a different practice in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, to have different lines for the saints to go on. If there were two lines in the recovery, which line should the saints follow? If you marry one daughter to two husbands, it will be hard for the daughter to practice her human life. You may train the saints in your locality with two lines, but are you sure they will remain in your locality forever? If they go to other places, they may become a factor of trouble. The churches in the United States and Taiwan do not like to have two lines and cannot take two lines.</p>
<p>Paul and Barnabas went to Jerusalem and had a good conference with the brothers. Then James gave the final word. James agreed that it was not right for those Judaizers to promote their way of circumcision. That had to be terminated. In this point James was right, but in his decision he took care of Moses, the synagogue, and the Sabbath. This was a compromising, but the main factor of the trouble got solved. After this decree was passed on to the churches, Acts 16:5 says, &ldquo;So the churches were strengthened in the faith and were increasing in number daily.&rdquo; Those churches were strengthened in their faith. We should realize and see that the different kinds of practices really weakened the saints. But after such a decree the believers were strengthened in the faith. The practice of circumcision weakened the believers&rsquo; faith in Christ. They probably doubted and wondered whether circumcision or the faith in Christ were right or whether they should have faith in two things&mdash;in the law of Moses and in the salvation of Christ. After this decree the saints were strengthened.</p>
<p>Acts 15:31 tells us that when the decree was read by the church in Antioch, &ldquo;they rejoiced at the consolation.&rdquo; The saints in Antioch were bothered by this kind of different practice in the Lord&rsquo;s church. They lost their joy and were suffering so there are the two words &ldquo;rejoiced&rdquo; and &ldquo;consolation.&rdquo; I want to let the brothers who are involved in this kind of trouble relating to another line, another practice, know that some saints got bothered and troubled and were much concerned that people would wonder which line they should take. We need to make a decision as a solution to be passed on to all the churches. Let the saints be strengthened. Let them rejoice. Let them be consoled. I cannot tolerate the disease that has been spreading to weaken the Body. We need to make a solution to this problem.</p>
<p>The ones who are involved in the problems, whom I love to the uttermost, know I have done my best. The Lord is going to have a new start, and I do not want to see any different practices brought into the new start. This is why I am so strong to say that if you do not agree with the fellowship in this book, please do not copy anything of what I am doing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLE&rsquo;S EPISTLE TO THE COLOSSIANS<br />
TO BE READ BY THE LAODICEANS AND<br />
THE EPISTLE TO THE LAODICEANS TO BE READ<br />
BY THE COLOSSIANS</h2>
<p>The apostle&rsquo;s epistle to the Colossians was charged to be read by the Laodiceans, and the epistle to the Laodiceans to be read by the Colossians (Col. 4:16). The local situations and conditions of these two places might have been different in some aspects. But the apostle said that the Colossians needed to pass the epistle to them on to the Laodiceans and that the letter to the Laodiceans needed to be read by the Colossians. The Laodiceans could have said to Paul that the letter to the Colossians applied to the condition and situation in Colosse but not to their condition. They could have felt not to read Paul&rsquo;s letter to Colosse but could have been happy to receive Paul&rsquo;s letter to them. The Colossians could have said the same thing, that is, that they appreciated Paul&rsquo;s writing to them but that they did not think his writing to the Laodiceans would fit into their local situation and condition.</p>
<p>To say that we do not like to reject the ministry, but we will have to pray to see how the Lord leads us sounds very spiritual, but this is the best cloak to cover the subtle dissension. With Paul&rsquo;s charge to Colosse and Laodicea, however, there were no conditions or terms. Whatever Paul wrote was not only for a certain church or for two churches but for all the churches. We cannot tolerate anything contrary to this principle any longer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GENTILE CHURCHES BECOMING<br />
IMITATORS OF THE CHURCHES IN JUDEA</h2>
<p>The Gentile churches became imitators of the churches in Judea (1 Thes. 2:14a). To say that the church where you are should be different from the other churches is dissenting. To follow a Jewish church is not a glory in New Testament terms. It is not a glory to be Jewish, but Paul was so happy and encouraged that the church in Thessalonica took the lead to become an imitator of the churches in Judea. Suppose the churches in Brazil would imitate and follow the churches in the United States. Some may feel that this is wrong. They may feel that the churches in Brazil should remain different from the churches in the United States. In today&rsquo;s blinded situation they may think that this is spiritual. Every local church is free to take the leading of the Spirit. This sounds very good, but it is actually subtly dissenting and a real poison.</p>
<p>I must declare that in the recovery of the Lord I know what I have been doing and teaching. I do not have any regrets and I have never changed my tone. The only thing I have been practicing is toleration upon toleration and patience upon patience. From all the verses we have covered in this chapter, there is no hint left in the Bible that anyone can find to justify the erroneous teaching that the local churches could be different from one another. This teaching and practice is something subtle and does not have any base at all in the New Testament. The need in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today is for all the churches to be identical.</p>
