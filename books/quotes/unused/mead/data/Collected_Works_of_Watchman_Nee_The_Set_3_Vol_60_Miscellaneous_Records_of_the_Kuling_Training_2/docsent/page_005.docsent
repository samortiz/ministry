   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Order to Have Light, One Must First</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Be a Person Who Has a Capacity for Light</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to give others light, we must first be those who have met the light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this reason, we must not only learn to dispense light, but receive light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must be like light-receptacles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As soon as God's light shines, we capture it; there is no need for any intermediary means.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we try to find the sun with a lantern, we will find the sun hiding behind the clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As soon as we meet the light, we should fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All we need to do is to let the light kill.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let it sterilize us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no need to seek help from other lights.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once light comes, our problems will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As soon as light shines, we become foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We will no longer be so "experienced" and polished.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Light will confuse us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may be wise at other times, but when light comes, we will become foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who are short of light will be very conscious of the shining when they receive some light, but those who are truly under a great shining will be thrown into total confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No one knows what will happen when light falls on him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's word is like a sword.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This sword is God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is a two-edged sword.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It lays all things naked and bare before it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After Paul saw the great light, he became confused.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A man who has seen the great light is like a bucket whose bottom has fallen out of it; it is no longer able to hold any water of its own.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who have seen great light are only too eager to confess their total inability.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Light always humbles; it always confuses.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One sister had been working for the Lord for over twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One day God shined on her, and she began to wonder if she even was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Her experience with the light was actually a real salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is how light comes, and this is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we touch the light on the negative side, the things that God disapproves of are burned away, but on the positive side we are spontaneously uplifted to a higher plane.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is easy for some people to receive the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With others it is hard.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must always position ourselves in such a way that we will easily receive the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some people are aware of what is happening as soon as God touches them a little.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Other people are in the dark even when God hits them with a hammer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everyone who criticizes, who finds fault, or who is clogged up in his spirit will not easily find the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is a serious thing to live before the Lord and to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we want to be a minister of light yet cannot receive any shining, we have a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A man who digs deep in life easily finds light, but a man who is shallow in life does not easily find light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When a minister of the word opens his mouth, we should receive some help.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do not, it means that something is hardened within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are a person who is inwardly open, we receive help even when we listen to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If any man thinks that he understands everything, he probably only has mental knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In reality he is far from knowing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are proper persons and we sit in a place where the gospel is preached properly, surely we will be impressed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is what happens when a man's spirit is open.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some people have a spirit that is harder than a wall.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is hard for them to see any light or to receive any shining.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One little leaf can block off the view of a whole star.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to stand in the right position, and we have to have the right attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If our attitude is wrong, the light will be blocked from us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to learn to be a man of light, receiving and taking in light.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>IN ORDER TO EXERCISE THE SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>THE OUTER MAN MUST BE BROKEN</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Question: How can we exercise our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Answer: In order to exercise the spirit, the outer man must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Otherwise we will be like a coalition government with different parties vying within a legislature.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Before a law can be passed, it has to fight through layers of opposition and compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If the inner man is mixed up with the outer man, it will be difficult to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In order to push out our spirit in a strong way, we have to learn to deal with the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If the outer man, that is, the mind, emotion, and will, are mixed up with the inner man, we cannot exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If a minister of God's word cannot use his spirit, it is because his mind, emotion, and will are all mixed up with his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our spirit must be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Otherwise it may be like a flask of ointment that is spoiled by one fly.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Those who are not pure in their spirit cannot exercise their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How can our spirit be pure?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The inner man can only be pure when the outer man is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Anything that is contaminated, anything that is corrupted, is impure.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If a man has an impure spirit, his speaking will close up the spirit of those who have been taught by God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Even if he carefully disguises himself and shuts up his mouth, his pretension will still expose him to those who have been taught by God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As soon as a man speaks, his spirit is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He cannot hide; the kind of person he is will always come out.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the reason our outer man must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As soon as our outer man is broken, the contamination will be gone, and the impure elements will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The outer man must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A worker must open his eyes wide; he must observe everything before he can render others proper help.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The outer man must be totally crushed before the inner spirit can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We are not here to improve and mend the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The outer man is useless no matter how we look at it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The only way is for it to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We have to be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You have been holding a tight rein on yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You need to relax.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Soberness that comes as a result of holding a tight rein on oneself is not true soberness.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Once tiredness and weariness set in, the true self will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Those who have passed through severe chastisements will display a more genuine kind of soberness.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Those who are lame by birth do not have to pretend that they are lame; the awkwardness in their legs reminds them of this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Those who pretend to be lame forget this "lameness" as soon as they must fight to get on a bus.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>A person who has just been rebuked by his father will shut up without the need of much conscious reminding.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He is careful, but he is not tense.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He is cautious in a very spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>There is a difference between artificial tension and tension that arises out of chastisement.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Artificial tension is a kind of pretension, while the tension that arises out of chastisement is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If we are indeed chastised, we should live under the influence of such chastisement.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In order to serve the Lord effectively, the outer man must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Otherwise, he will remain proud and hard.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is a very basic problem.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>THE MEANING OF REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Question: What is revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Answer: Concerning this point, we have to see three examples in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>In Matthew 16 Peter received revelation from the Father in heaven to see the person and work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In Galatians 1 Paul received revelation to see the truth of the gospel and the inward unveiling of God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In Revelation 1 John received revelation of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Revelation is basically precipitated by God's special moves.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>A man may be an eloquent speaker, but he does not necessarily have revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Revelation results from God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>God has to move to reveal Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Genuine revelation always hinges on God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>All revelations are special moves of God.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>What we hear in a sermon is not revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Revelation is not an ordinary move; it is a special move.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If God does not move in a special way, we will not have any genuine revelation even if we say that we have seen something.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>There is revelation only as God moves in a special way and our spirit sees something.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Hence, revelation is a very definite move of God.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>One can say that he "sees" something in a general sense, but he cannot say that he has received a revelation in that sense.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Revelation is something much more profound.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The revelation spoken of in 1 Corinthians 14:26 refers to what God opens up to a person specifically at that very instant.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Those who prophesy speak on what they see and know all along, but when someone beside him receives a "revelation," that is, when he receives something specific from God at that instant, the one who is prophesying should be quiet and allow the one who has received a revelation to speak vv.</S>
