God cannot grant grace at the expense of righteousness, nor can He save man without punishing sin. God wants to save man, yet God also wants to punish sin. Therefore, He Himself became a man to bear the penalty of sin on man's behalf. Consequently, sin could be judged and man saved. If God had not become a man, this could never have been accomplished. Since sins are committed by man, the penalty should also be borne by man. God cannot die. But even if God could die for man, it would be an injustice because man committed sins, not God. This is why God had to become a man. Man, collectively speaking, has sinned. The "man Christ Jesus," the unique Man in whom the whole human race is included, has borne the penalty of sin; this is in compliance with the law. Man, the world, has sinned, and the Man, the Lord Jesus, has borne the penalty; this is exceedingly just. If the Lord Jesus is separated from man, then the death of the Lord Jesus cannot be counted as man having borne the penalty of sin. Although the Lord Jesus is God, He is truly a man, having been joined completely with the human race. Therefore, His death is man's death. He should not have died; therefore, His death is a substitutional death. This is what incarnation has accomplished.</P><P>Nevertheless, Christ must be God; otherwise, redemption is unjust. Because Christ is God, He is the One whom the world has offended; He has the right to accept the offense of the world and forgive them. If He is not God, then He is not the one being offended; rather, He is an innocent third party. When an innocent one dies for an offender, even though it may be gracious, it is an injustice to the innocent one. However, Christ is not the third party. He is directly involved. He is the one who is harmed; therefore, He has the power to forgive and endure the consequence of being harmed. He is God.</P><P>Incarnation does not constitute all of salvation. The accomplishment of salvation is due to crucifixion. Incarnation is the first step of salvation. If the Savior had never emptied Himself to become a man, He could never have died to save men. Bethlehem is the antecedent of Golgotha. Without Bethlehem, there can never be Golgotha. What wonderful grace that the Son of God would forsake Himself to become a man! What a great mystery that the Son of God would become flesh!</P><P>II.The work on the second day signifies the death of the Lord Jesus. In His work on the second day, God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. This firmament is our heaven. Originally, all the waters were gathered together in one place, and there was no distinction. Then the atmospheric heaven came and divided the waters under the heaven from the waters above the heaven. This atmospheric heaven is a clear type of the cross of the Lord Jesus. In the work of the second day, separation is a big item. This separation consists of two parts. In the first part, the firmament within the waters divided the waters. In the second part, the waters under the firmament were separated from the waters above the firmament. Is it not true that the cross is also composed of these two parts? When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He cried, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Matt. 27:46). This was His separation from God. But the Bible also says that He was cut off from the land of the living. This speaks of His separation from man. The work on the second day is the most crucial part in the redemptive work. Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins. The world does not need just a shining example. Although light is good, it only exposes man's corruption and the real condition of his fall. The more light there is, the more a person is condemned. If Christ's birth had not been followed by redemption, His birth would have been the strongest basis for man's condemnation. If One was able to live a holy and righteous life, everyone else should be able to live the same way. If One could do it, everyone else should be able also. If One was able, yet the others were not, then the others would be without an excuse. If the birth of the Lord Jesus was all the work, His life would have condemned the whole world of their sins. If He had not died for man, and if the purpose of His birth had not been for redemption, it would have been better for Him never to have been born at all. His thoughts, words, behavior, and living were far beyond anyone's reach. Every aspect of His being was enough to condemn man of his sin. He was a man, and you are a man. If He could do it, why not you? The veil in the Holy Place may be beautiful and glorious, yet this same veil separates the Holy Place and keeps man from the Holy of Holies and God. Only a rent veil can offer man a way to come before God. A living Jesus would have driven everyone away from the presence of God, while a dead Jesus can bring all the sinners to the Holy of Holies. "Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree"; "Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God" (1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18). As long as He was alive, no one could be joined to God.</P><P>Now we want to consider how the cross of the Lord Jesus matches the work of the second day. God did not make the firmament all at once. First God decided, then He carried it out. Verse 6 says, "Let there be a firmament." This speaks of God's decision ahead of time. Then in verse 7, we see that "God made the firmament." This was God's carrying out His decision. Before the cross was ever erected on Golgotha, God had foreordained the matter. The cross is very similar to the firmament here. The death of the Lord Jesus was not a misadventure; it was no accident; it was foreordained. "Who was foreknown before the foundation of the world but has been manifested in the last of times for your sake" (1 Pet. 1:20). He was "the Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world" (Rev. 13:8). The death of the Lord Jesus, like the work of the second day, was carried out first through a decision, then an execution.</P><P>The firmament was put in the midst of the waters. In the Bible water represents the world. We can see this clearly when we study Revelation 17:15. Water represents the world and the kingdoms of the world. In the same way the cross was lifted up in the midst of man and for man. "Where they crucified Him, and with Him two others, on this side and that, and Jesus in the middle" (John 19:18). Strictly speaking, Golgotha can be considered the center of the world. The Lord Jesus died in the midst of humanity for the purpose of saving men.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 03, The Christian (1) &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
