<h1 class="title">COMING TO THE FULL KNOWLEDGE<br />
OF THE TRUTH</h1>
<p>In this chapter I would like to consider some verses from 1 Timothy. Verse 4 of chapter two says that God &ldquo;desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth.&rdquo; Then 1 Timothy 3:2 says that an elder must be apt to teach. Verse 9 of the same chapter says that a deacon must be holding the mystery of the faith, that is of what we believe, in a pure conscience. In verses 15 and 16 of chapter three are four main things: the church as the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, the great mystery of godliness, and the manifestation of God in the flesh. These four things are wrapped up with the truth. Actually, the truth is the very element of this portion of the Word. First Timothy 5:17 says, &ldquo;Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.&rdquo; To labor is to toil. An elder should be such a one who labors in word and teaching. In 1 Timothy 6:3 Paul tells us that we have to restrict ourselves to the healthy words, especially the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching which is according to godliness, that is, God expressed through us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE WORD IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>I hope that you would study all of the crucial verses in the New Testament concerning the divine Word. A number of these crucial verses concerning the Word are listed on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/EldrsTrng5/elders-trng5-pg36.html">page 36</a>. In these verses, first, the Word of God is actually God Himself. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word&rdquo; (John 1:1). In John 1:14 this Word became flesh. God&rsquo;s incarnation is the embodiment of the divine Word. God as the Word needs an embodiment, and this embodiment is a living Person, Jesus Christ our Lord. He is not only the embodiment of God, but also the embodiment of God as the divine Word.</p>
<p>In John 6 the Lord tells us that the words spoken by Him are spirit (v. 63). The Word was God, the Word became embodied, and the words spoken out of the mouth of this embodiment are spirit. Then this word is life. &ldquo;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (John 6:63). The divine Word is God as the Spirit and as life. The Word is also the seed of life sown into a certain kind of soil (Mark 4:14; Matt. 13:19). Peter said we were regenerated through this word (1 Pet. 1:23). The word is the seed of life and this life regenerated us. In Matthew 4:4, the Lord said that &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&rdquo; This was spoken by the Lord as a quotation of the Old Testament (Deut. 8:3), telling us that man&rsquo;s real food is the word of God. The New Testament tells us further that this word is the implanted word (James 1:21). This also denotes something of life. Second Thessalonians 3:1 says the word of God can run and can be glorified. The Word is a living Person. Paul also asks the Colossians to pray for him &ldquo;that God may open to us a door for the word&rdquo; (4:3). The word needs a door, and much prayer is needed to have the door opened for the word. Eventually the word is a sword, a weapon, for fighting (Eph. 6:17). Lastly, the book of Revelation mentions several times the word of God and the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 1:2, 9; 6:9; 20:4). John was exiled on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. Even the martyrs were martyred because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.</p>
<p>In Acts we are told three times that the word grew and that the word multiplied (Acts 6:7; 12:24; 19:20). A lifeless thing can never grow but the word grows. Actually, the multiplication of the disciples depends upon the growth of the word. However, many who read Acts would mostly pay their attention to the Spirit. No doubt, the Spirit is stressed in Acts. But those who received the Spirit did not go out and preach the Spirit. Rather, they preached the word. Many verses in Acts tell us that what was preached and taught by the first group of believers was the word. The scattered ones in Acts 8 went out to bring the good news of the word (v. 1). People believed in the word, received the word, and the word became so prevailing in that it grew and multiplied. In Acts 12 is a very meaningful contrast. King Herod was persecuting the church and especially Peter, but eventually Herod died (v. 23). Right after his death Acts 12:24 says, &ldquo;But the word of God grew and multiplied.&rdquo; The persecutor died but the word grew.</p>
<p>I want to impress you that the divine Word is what we really need and we should be one with the Word, full of the Word, saturated with the Word, and constituted with the Word. Then when we minister, we minister the Word by the Spirit. We do not minister the Spirit by the Word, but we minister the Word by the Spirit. In chapter four of Acts, while the disciples and the apostles were praying, they were filled with the Spirit and began to speak the word with boldness (Acts 4:31). They did not teach or preach the Spirit; the Spirit was only the power for them to preach the word.</p>
<p>Hebrews 6:4 tells us that the believers are partakers of the Holy Spirit. Then the next verse says they taste two things, the good word of God and the works of power of the coming age. Here are two kinds of tasting. The first class of tasting is of the good word of God. What is the good word of God? Hebrews 6:1 speaks of &ldquo;the word of the beginning of the Christ.&rdquo; In Hebrews 5:13-14 is the word of righteousness, which is not milk but solid food. This indicates that the good word of God in chapter six is the milk which is for the babes in chapter five. This corresponds with Peter&rsquo;s word in 1 Peter 2:2: &ldquo;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word.&rdquo; The good word of God is milk, liquid food. But there is still another higher category of the word of God, the word of righteousness.</p>
<p>In the Life-study of Hebrews we have covered this thoroughly. The good word of God mainly refers to the gospel concerning the Lord&rsquo;s earthly ministry from His incarnation up to His resurrection. This first part of the gospel concerning Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry is considered as the good word of God. The Hebrews, the receivers of this book, had the good word of God, but they were short of a further taste, the taste of the word of righteousness referring to the heavenly ministry of Christ. The book of Hebrews conveys to us the heavenly ministry of Christ. It talks about Christ passing through the heavens (4:14) and entering into the heavenly tabernacle to be the heavenly minister and the heavenly High Priest (8:1-2) to minister heaven into us that we might be a heavenly people answering the heavenly call (3:1). The ministry of Christ has two parts. From His incarnation to His resurrection is His earthly ministry. After He ascended to the heavens, He began His heavenly ministry. Today&rsquo;s preaching in Christianity very rarely touches this heavenly ministry. What is preached is at most just the good word of God, but not the word of righteousness. The word of righteousness is the solid food referring not to the Christ on this earth, but to the Christ in the heavens. The taste of the works of power of the coming age does not go with the word of righteousness, but with the good word of God, referring to the beginning of the gospel. Try to study all these verses in the New Testament concerning the word.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
