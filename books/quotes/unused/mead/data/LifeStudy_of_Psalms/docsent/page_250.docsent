   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. A SECRET REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING THE ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE INCARNATED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have pointed out that in Psalm 84 there is a secret revelation concerning our enjoyment of the incarnated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although many Christians talk about and even debate regarding the Trinity, not many enjoy the incarnated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We thank the Lord that in the recovery, in the church life, the Christ we enjoy is the incarnated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to see that Christ is not only the embodiment of God but also that Christ is the incarnated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this Christ we have God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist and also coinhere, that is, they dwell in one another.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Father and the Son are in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in the Father and in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way the three of the Triune God coinhere.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, in Christ the Triune God has passed through a long process to become the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is Christ as our enjoyment and as our portion allotted to us by God Col 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A. The Center of This Secret Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>the House of God</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The center of this secret revelation is the house of God Psa 84:4, 10a , typified by the tabernacle Exo 40:2-8 and by the temple 1 Kings 6:1-3; 8:3-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Both of these types have been fulfilled in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>B. A Diagram of the Layout of the House of God</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At this point, I would ask you to consider the diagram of the layout of the house of God printed on the next page.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this diagram we see the main items of our enjoyment of Christ as the incarnated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The diagram shows us that in the outer court there are two items: the first altar, the bronze altar, for the offering of the sacrifices, and the laver, a large basin containing water for washing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the first altar, all of our problems before God are solved through the sacrifices, and we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why, then, do we still need the laver?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To answer this question we need to see that God's goal is not to solve our problems; God's goal is to make us, the old creation, the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to become the new creation, we need to be washed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our old creation was made of the dust of the earth, and this dust needs to be washed away in the laver.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, Titus 3:5 says that God has saved us "through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After we have experienced the altar and the laver, we are qualified to enter into the incarnated God, signified by the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Old Testament no one could enter into God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But in His incarnation God has become enterable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, many of today's Christians, not realizing that God is enterable, do not proceed from the first altar to the laver, and they do not enter into God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They may speak of fearing God, of exalting God, and of loving God but not of entering into God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Have you entered into God?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all need to pass through the first altar, come to the laver, and then enter into God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do you know who the enterable God is?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our enterable God is Christ, the God-man, the incarnated Triune God and the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we enter into Him, we have the showbread table for the life supply and the lampstand for the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This enables us to live and walk in the incarnated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I can testify that in these days I have been living and walking in the incarnated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the incarnated Triune God we have not only the showbread table and the lampstand but also the second altar, the incense altar, for the offering of the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The incense signifies Christ as our acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the first altar our problems before God are solved through Christ as the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At the second altar Christ is the incense for us to be accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The diagram of the layout of the house of God indicates that, according to the Old Testament, the incense altar was in front of the ark of the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But there was a veil separating the incense altar in the Holy Place from the ark of the testimony in the Holy of Holies Exo 26:31-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, through the death of Christ this veil has been rent Matt 27:51; Heb 10:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now there is no longer a separation between the incense altar and the ark of the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This indicates that when we are accepted by God in Christ as our acceptance, we become God's testimony to express, to manifest, God.</S>
