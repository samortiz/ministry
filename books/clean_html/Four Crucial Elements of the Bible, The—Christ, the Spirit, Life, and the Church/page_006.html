Rather, we must have the subjective experience in life. In Christianity, there is the bad habit, the bad influence, of considering everything in the Bible to be merely a doctrine. When preaching God, many merely preach a doctrine, and when preaching Christ, many also merely preach a doctrine. In today’s Christianity nearly all the truths concerning God and Christ have become theology and are presented altogether in the way of doctrine and theory, and very few people stress experience. However, the purpose of the biblical revelation is not to give us doctrines. The ultimate purpose of the Bible in speaking about God and Christ is for our experience. We may speak about God thoroughly and speak about Christ fully, but if we do not have the experience, both God and Christ have nothing to do with us.<p>Both in the Far East and in the West, there are some, including even former “co-workers” among us, who say that we teach heresy. What is the point of their deviation? It is in their paying attention only to doctrines. They say that in our teachings we neglect doctrines and only care for experiences, which are entirely dependent upon and according to feelings. Therefore, some have even published books to slander us, saying that our teachings are “sensuous” and are altogether not according to proper doctrines. What we stress, however, is that doctrines are for our experience. Some have argued, saying, “It is not logical for you to say that Christ lives in you. Consider how big Christ is and how small man is. How can Christ abide in man who is so small? Furthermore, Christ is the great sovereign Master sitting on the throne in heaven. How can man who is so small let Him come into him to abide in him? This is impossible.” In their consideration, Christ, who is sitting high above in the heavens, has only a representative on earth, who is the Holy Spirit.<p>Nevertheless, the New Testament tells us clearly that the Lord Jesus definitely abides in us. In the Gospels, John 14:23 says, “Jesus answered and said to him, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.” In 15:4 the Lord Jesus goes on to say, “Abide in Me and I in you.” Then in the Epistles, Christ’s indwelling us is a very great and important truth. Colossians 1:27 says, “Christ in you, the hope of glory.” Romans 8:9 says, “The Spirit of God dwells in you. Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.” Here the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ are used interchangeably; both refer to Christ in verse 10. Ephesians 3:17 goes on further to say, “That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.” In these verses abide, dwells, and make...home are different words in Greek. The word abide in the Gospel of John denotes something ordinary. In Romans, the word dwells is the verb form of house; it means to reside and is more than to abide. Make...home in Ephesians means more than dwell in Romans. The prefix of this word is a preposition of emphasis, kata. The whole word denotes “to be deeply rooted down.” Hence, it is not merely to reside but even more to settle down in a home, to deeply make home. A couple may stay in the home of their relatives or friends, but that is a temporary residing not a settling down. It is not until they move into their own house that they settle down and deeply make their home there without having to move again.<p>In Ephesians 3 Paul prayed that the Father would grant us to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith (vv. 16-17a). Christ’s making His home in our hearts means that He settles down deeply in our hearts and will never leave. During conferences people come from different places and stay with us only for a while without making their home here. I have been in the Lord’s ministry for fifty years and have always been traveling. During all this time, I do not know how many people’s homes I have stayed in, yet I never made my home in any of their homes. It is only when I come back to my own dwelling place that I can make my home there. The Lord Jesus not only dwells in us but also makes His home in our hearts—in our mind, emotion, and will. From this we can see where the mistake of today’s Christianity is. They preach God only as an objective God; they do not preach Him as the subjective God who dwells in us.
