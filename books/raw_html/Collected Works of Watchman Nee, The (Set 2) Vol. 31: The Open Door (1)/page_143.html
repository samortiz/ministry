<h2 class="head2">Singapore</h2><p>Brother Nee has left. The X dollars that Brother X offered for the brothers and sisters in Hankow who are escaping the war were sent the day before yesterday to Brother Lan in Hankow. After returning from Malaga, I had three small Bible studies with the brothers. I combined the X dollars and X cents that I received there with another X dollars and sent it to Hankow. Although it is not very much and cannot solve the problem, I ask my Lord to bless these five loaves and two fishes. I hope you can go to Hong Kong to wait for a boat to Southeast Asia after you finish your work in Chungking, Ch'eng-tu, Kuei-yang, and K'un-ming. You can go to Manila and then come to Singapore. I sent a letter inviting Brother Meek to place this matter in prayer. The Normal Christian Church Life gave me much light. Although the work is of the apostles, we must exhort the brothers and sisters in each locality to be "always abounding in the work of the Lord." Do you agree? (Indeed.) Brother and Sister Leland Wang will go to Surabaya soon for one month. The church there was started through a few brothers from Shing-Hwa and Brother Lin Wei-zhe. They rented a hall and began meeting. Brother Wei-zhe has since returned to China on business. They hope that Brother Leland and I can continue the work there. One of the toes on my right foot has been in pain for years. I went into the national hospital yesterday because they had to pull the toenail off. I will be in the hospital for approximately two weeks. After I get out, I plan to go to Penang to do some work.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Faithful Luk<br />April 26<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Hankow</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>There was a baptism here yesterday. It was held in Dong-Hu, Luo-Jia-Shan. Eight brothers and seven sisters were baptized. The work in the Hanyang Refugee Center has ended. Praise the Lord, He saved some. Brother Kuo and Brother Shang conducted a Bible study and a beginners' edification work there. There will be a week or ten days of edification meetings at the Gospel Court starting May 2.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi<br />May 2</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>The Lord Himself led the conference through the first nine days. Today is the last day. Praise the Lord! He is Lord! He is responsible for His own work. He will gain the glory.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi<br />May 11<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Brother Chen Ke-san Arrives in Sien-You</h2><p>Sister Bao Hsu-min sent a letter from Sien-You saying that Brother Chen Ke-san was led by God to come to Sien-You. Presently, there is a meeting to edify the brothers and the sisters every afternoon.</p><p>[Address omitted]</p>
