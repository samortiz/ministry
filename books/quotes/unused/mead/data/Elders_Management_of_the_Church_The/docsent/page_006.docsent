   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD'S GOVERNMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every elder should realize in a sober and profound way that the eldership is a matter of government in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all know that another name for the elders is the overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word "elder" refers to the person, and the word "overseer" refers to the office.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As far as the person is concerned, these ones are the older and more mature ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As far as their office is concerned, they work as overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The office of overseership is a part of God's government in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this reason, the elders must know about God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the New Testament, there are a few ministers of the word, each with his own characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The center of Paul's ministry is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The center of John's ministry is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It deals with God as the Father, and the saved ones as the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although Peter's epistles are not as numerous as those of Paul or as the writings of John, he is nevertheless a great minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Peter's ministry deals exclusively with God's government, which is God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Among the Lord's children today, many know that Paul's ministry is concerning the church, and many others know that John's ministry is about the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But there are very few people who know that Peter's ministry is on God's government or administration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because the church has been degraded, whenever the word government or administration is mentioned, some begin to wonder immediately if this is Roman Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this reason, among most Protestant Christians, and particularly among the more spiritual ones, there is a common concept that it is better to have no government and no administration than to have one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To them, as long as you understand that the church is the Body of Christ and the house of God, it is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All that is needed is to help others love the Lord and be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as others are helped to have the life of God and to walk before the Lord, everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To them, there is no need to have anything like government.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But, brothers and sisters, we are not more wise than God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the universe, there is such a thing as the government of God and the administration of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is something ordained by God, and we cannot neglect it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Bible, the kingdom is a matter of government.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The kingdom of God is the government of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is also the administration of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today the universe is in disorder because God's government has not been honored.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The elders should not only see that in the universe there is God's salvation, God's church, and God's house; they must further see that in the universe there is God's government and God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is not a God of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is not a God without principle and rule.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God is a God with principles, rules, order, and discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason, God must establish His administration and government in the universe.</S>
