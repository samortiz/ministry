   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN WHAT THE KINGDOM IS TO THE BELIEVERS 7 SUBMITTING TO THE AUTHORITY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO DEAL WITH SATAN Scripture Reading: Matt 25:14-30; 1 Cor 3:10-15; 4:4-5; 2 Cor 5:9-11a; 1 Pet 4:17a; Rev 1:13-17a; 22:12 MAN STANDING IN THE POSITION OF A CREATURE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO DEAL WITH SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous chapters we saw that God desires that His Son gain a kingdom on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reason God desires that His Son gain a kingdom is that God may exercise His authority and express His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, what Satan does in the universe is to frustrate this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Satan s activity on earth is to insult God and damage God s work; hence, God needs to deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, if God were to deal with Satan directly, it would not be a shame to Satan, nor would it be a glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Satan might say to God, There is no creature who would submit to Your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, God keeps a principle of not dealing with Satan directly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is the Creator; He will not deal with His creatures in His status of Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, He created another creature man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His desire is that man would stand in the position of a creature to deal with Satan, another creature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God s intention is to show Satan that there is a creature who is subject to God s authority and who chooses to stand on God s side.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although Satan as a creature rebels against God, there is another creature who submits to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE EXAMPLE OF JOB S SUBMITTING</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>TO GOD S AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God desires not only to deal with Satan but also to shame him and shut his mouth in His dealing with him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God wants to prevent Satan from being able to say, God, because You are the Creator, You force man to submit to Your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am not willing to submit to Your authority, and other creatures also are not willing to submit to Your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If God were to allow Satan to have this kind of mentality, this would be an insult to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How do we know that Satan has this kind of mentality?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can see this from the book of Job One day Satan came before God, and God gave him a specific chance to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He asked Satan, Where have you come from?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Satan answered, From roving the earth and going about in it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then God asked him, Have you considered My servant Job?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil 1:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that there was no one who submitted to God s authority like Job To fear God is to submit to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God showed Satan that there was at least one person on earth who was ruled by God, who feared God, and who was subject to God s authority; this person was Job</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God asked Satan if he had observed Job Satan immediately answered, Does Job fear God without cause?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Have You not set a hedge around him and his household and all that he has?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his possessions are spread throughout the land vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This word was a great insult to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What Satan s word meant was that God had bribed Job with blessings so that he would fear God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Satan meant that since God treated Job well and bestowed on him much blessing, Job could not but fear God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Satan implied that if God had not blessed Job, Job would not have feared God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was Satan s thought and his insult toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God answered, All right.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I will remove the hedge around him and will not protect him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I allow you to ill-treat him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I intend to prove to you that this creature on earth fears Me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Satan received God s word and came out to stir up trouble for Job; he sent the Sabeans, the Chaldeans, the fire, and the wind to destroy Job s possessions and kill his sons and daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should all be familiar with this story.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, there was plundering, there was burning by fire, there was the blowing of a great wind, and there was crushing to death by falling houses vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>13-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At that time Job was in exceeding pain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He saw that all his blessings were gone, all his protection vanished, and he was completely in a situation of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But what did Job say?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Job still feared God and did not say anything against God; he still submitted to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Moreover, he submitted to God s authority to the extent that he said, Jehovah gives and Jehovah takes away; / Blessed be the name of Jehovah v. 21b . This shows that Job praised God not only when God gave him blessings; he still praised God even when God took away his blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because He was the Lord, Job was subject to His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Job was not rebellious before God; he had nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then some time later Satan came before God again 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We may think that since Satan is so evil, God should simply move His finger so that Satan will be terminated and will be in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, our God still preserves Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He not only preserves Satan, but He also allows him to go to the habitation of God in heaven and to express his opinion in God s habitation in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our God is truly great.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although Satan rebels against God and opposes Him, God is so great that He still allows Satan to come before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He asked Satan again, Where have you come from?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Satan answered, From roving the earth and going about in it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God asked him again, Have you considered My servant Job? vv.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>2-3a .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God was asking Satan to consider how Job reacted after Satan had asked God to remove the hedge around Job and God had permitted Satan to ill-treat Job Although he passed through much suffering, Job not only kept his integrity, but this servant of God still submitted to God s authority and did not rebel against Him v. 3b .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Satan is truly evil.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He knows that the most difficult thing for man to take is the suffering in his own skin and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The pain of losing his possessions outside of him is only temporary; a man s possessions do not mean as much to him as his own body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Thus, Satan answered God immediately, Skin for skin!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Indeed all that a man has he will give for the sake of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But stretch forth Your hand, and touch his bone and his flesh; and he will surely curse You to Your face.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then God said to Satan, Here he is, in your hand; only spare his life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then Satan went forth from Jehovah s presence and struck Job</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We know what happened to Job after Satan struck him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He had severe boils all over his body, which is an unbearable suffering for man v. 7 . Nevertheless, Job did not offend God but still submitted to God s authority and ruling and confessed that God is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>From this point on in the book of Job, we no longer see Satan coming out to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He had nothing to say because his mouth was shut by Job On that day, when Job had severe boils and was in terrible pain, if Job had murmured, saying, O God, how can You treat me like this?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I will not submit to Your authority, nor will I fear You anymore, Satan would have applauded and shouted for joy.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He would have immediately come before God and said, You see, it is not only I who rebel against You and dislike You; Job also rebels against You and dislikes You.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is not only I who dislike You; man also dislikes You and rebels against You.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You, Lord, are not lovable or worthy to be feared by man.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Satan s mouth would not have been shut.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, no matter how much Job suffered or how much he was troubled and afflicted, he still knew that God was his Lord, his King.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He submitted to God s authority and ruling without any resistance, rebellion, or murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He was entirely subject to God s authority, thus shutting Satan s mouth and silencing him.</S>
