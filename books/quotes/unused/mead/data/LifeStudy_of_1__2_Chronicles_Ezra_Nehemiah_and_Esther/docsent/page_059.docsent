   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEHEMIAH GOING TO EZRA FOR HELP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN RECONSTITUTING THE NATION OF GOD S ELECT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nehemiah was a head, a ruler, of a nation, but he was altogether not ambitious.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is indicated by the fact that he recognized his need of Ezra In reconstituting the nation, Nehemiah realized that he did not know God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But Ezra, who was famous for his knowledge of the Word of God, was still alive, and Nehemiah was willing to go to Ezra for help.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many of today s leaders would not seek help in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead, being ambitious, they would hold on to their position and not bring in an Ezra to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But because Nehemiah was not ambitious, he brought in Ezra Nehemiah knew that without Ezra he could not reconstitute the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>RE-EDUCATION FOR RECONSTITUTION</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to reconstitute the people of God, there is the need to educate them with the word that comes out of the mouth of God, which expresses God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that to reconstitute the people of God is to educate them by putting them into the Word of God that they may be saturated with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Israelites had been in Egypt for at least four hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During those years they must have been constituted with Egyptian learning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then they were brought to Babylon for seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah were all born and raised among the Babylonians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After the people of Israel returned from Babylon, they mixed themselves with the Canaanites.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, the Israelites were constituted with the Egyptian, Babylonian, and Canaanite culture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, they returned to be the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But how could a people with a constitution of Egyptian, Babylonian, and Canaanite culture be God s testimony, the expression of the God-man?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such a people were not the God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How could they express God?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to be the testimony of God, His expression, they needed to be re-educated in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE RETURNED ISRAELITES</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>BECOMING GOD S TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In addition to being re-educated, the people of Israel needed to be raised up in much the same way as parents raise their children.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Parents not only educate their children but spontaneously and unconsciously impart themselves, nearly their whole being, into their children.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Parents transfuse what they are and what they think into their children.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually, this constitutes their children to be the same as they are.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is what the children of Israel needed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before Nehemiah came back, the nation of Israel was a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The duties of the priests were not certain, and no one was taking care of the Levites and the serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The singers were there, but no one had opened the way for them to sing and to be formed into companies.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nehemiah, with the help of Ezra, totally reconstituted the nation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then Israel became a particular nation, a nation sanctified and separated unto God, expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They were transfused with the thought of God, with the considerations of God, and with all that God is, making them God s reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everyone became God in life and in nature by this kind of divine constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a result, they became a divine nation on earth expressing the divine character.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They were reconstituted personally and corporately to be God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The returned captives became God s testimony through the reconstitution which took place under the leadership of Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The central and crucial point of the recovery books, which end with Nehemiah, is the matter of proper, adequate leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whereas the record of the leadership in Judges, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, and 1 and 2 Chronicles is dark, the record in Ezra and Nehemiah is bright.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Ezra and Nehemiah three leaders are mentioned: Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They were all excellent leaders, but the best and the highest was Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nehemiah was the perfect leader, the best leader in human history.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only under the leadership of such persons as Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah could Israel be reconstituted to be the testimony of God, the expression of God on earth, a people absolutely different from the Gentile nations.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a type of what God wants the church to be today.</S>
