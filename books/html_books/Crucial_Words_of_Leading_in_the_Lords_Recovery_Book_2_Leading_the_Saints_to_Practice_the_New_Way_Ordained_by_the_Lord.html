<p>This book is a translation of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei to the elders and co-workers from Taiwan from March through May 1986. This book is the second in a series entitled <em>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery.</em></p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ELDERS<br />
IN GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:9-11; Matt. 16:18; 1 Tim. 3:15-16; Acts 15:2, 6, 22-23, 28; 1 Tim. 3:1-7; 5:17; Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:1-3</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that in this dark age You are bringing us into the light. While people are busy toiling in the world, You have separated us, even rescued us, from the world and put us into Your name. Lord, although our gathering is on earth, we sense that we are in the heavens, because the heavens are open to us and are even with us. Lord, You are with us in the heavens. We believe that You will speak to us. We ask You to unveil us to see Your mystery, which has been hidden throughout the ages and is still hidden to many today. Unveil us that we may see Your heart&rsquo;s desire and know Your eternal will. O Lord, we also ask You to reveal to us in detail the plan, the economy, that You have had from eternity. We also ask that You would operate in our hearts accordingly. O Lord, may You cause each one of us to gain You, to gain Your good pleasure, and to gain the desire of Your heart so that we may be one spirit with You and even one heart and one entity with You.</p>
<p>Lord, we are Your many members, and You are our Head. We know that You have an intention for gathering us together. We treasure this time and know that You will fulfill Your desire and accomplish Your eternal purpose. Lord, give us Your word, light, and life supply. Shine on us and expose our true condition so that we may see You and see ourselves. Make our heart firm and do not let us go. Remove all our wickedness and all our shadows so that our inner being may be single and pure toward You. May our sky be clear, and may our mind and intention be upright and be a straight way through which You may freely pass. Lord, may we gain Your praise as those who are sincere, without any crookedness or guile.</p>
<p>In these few days make clear to us the words in Your heart and infuse us with Your intention, feeling, thought, and even utterance so that we may be one spirit with You. Fellowship with us in our fellowship, and speak to us in our speaking. Confirm the fact that You are one spirit with us, vindicate Your way, and in every aspect put Your enemy to shame on the earth. O Lord, may Your riches and preservation be with Your church so that You may gain the glory.</p>
<p>We pray for the tens of thousands of brothers and sisters on the island of Taiwan; we entrust them to You, commit them into Your hands, and ask You to visit them. May every saint be revived and strengthened inwardly, live an overcoming life, bear a good testimony for You, manifest his function in Your Body, and be building material in the church. We pray for them and also for ourselves. Lord, You are the One who walks in our midst. Our trust is in You; You are our hope. Furthermore, You are our blessing. All that we are depends on You. May You be everything in our midst and be the preeminent One in all things. May You gain the desire of Your heart, and may we obtain satisfaction in You. Amen.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we have been speaking concerning the new way for over three and a half years. In this period of time we have carried out many studies and experiments. Through these, we believe that we have arrived at a conclusion. We have experimented in every stage and step related to the practice of the new way, the way that is ordained by the Lord. We feel that now is the time for us to fellowship with all the churches regarding our various experiments. We hope that, by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, through our discussion and review all the churches will accept the results that we have obtained.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF ELDERS<br />
IN GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>All those serving the Lord, whether full-timers, elders, or co-workers, need to be clear regarding one matter: According to the revelation of the New Testament, there is a very crucial group of people. These people are the elders within a locality. In the New Testament the elders, as a group, are crucial in regard to the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy. Those who read the Bible usually pay much attention to the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Similarly, in Christianity most people realize that there is a need for apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, but few are aware of the importance of the elders. Before we were saved and even after we were saved and entered into the church life, we may have never dreamed that in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy there is still a need for elders.</p>
<p>The carrying out of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy in a particular place depends entirely upon the elders. This can be likened to the carrying out of the decree of a government. Whether such a decree can be carried out without hindrance depends almost entirely upon the local administration. If the local administration does not cooperate or has problems and difficulties in regard to the carrying out of the government&rsquo;s decree, the government will surely fail. Regardless of how strong, good, capable, righteous, and proper the government is, if the decrees of that government cannot be carried out at the level of the local administration, all its efforts will be annulled and made void. Even if the failure to carry out the decree is unintentional and is due to the incapability and incompetence of the local administration, the result of the decree will still equal zero. Similarly, the position of the elders in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is exceedingly important.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that the elders as a group are indispensable in the church life, and our experience also confirms this. When the elders are weak, the church is weak, and when the elders are strong, the church is also strong. Likewise, if the elders are spiritually rich, the church is spiritually rich; and if they are spiritually poor, the church is also spiritually poor. Hence, whether the &ldquo;tide&rdquo; of the church is high or low depends solely upon the elders. If the condition of the elders is high, the church will be high; if the condition of the elders is low, the church will be low. The condition of the elders is reflected in the church. This principle is ironclad.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TITLE <em>ELDER</em> AND THE ELDERSHIP<br />
ORIGINATING FROM EXODUS</h2>
<p>Let us consider the title <em>elder</em> and the eldership. These two matters were first spoken of in the Old Testament. In Genesis, the first book of the Old Testament, the record is mainly regarding individuals. Genesis speaks of eight great figures&mdash;Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Their history, however, does not reveal much regarding the corporate aspect of God&rsquo;s people. Although this aspect is briefly touched upon in the record of the age of Noah, it is addressed in a superficial way. Noah was then followed by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Beginning with Jacob, the corporate aspect began to come into view more clearly. After Jacob, the record in Genesis no longer speaks of individuals; rather, it speaks of the twelve sons of Jacob becoming the twelve tribes of Israel and these twelve tribes becoming a nation. At this point, the corporate aspect appears.</p>
<p>In Exodus, the second book of the Old Testament, the age of individuals becomes the age of a corporate body. Exodus speaks of the kingdom. Exodus 19:6 says, &ldquo;You shall be to Me a kingdom of priests.&rdquo; A kingdom surely refers to something corporate. Since a kingdom is a corporate body, it must have an administration. It cannot avoid the issue. Exodus not only says that God decreed the law but also speaks of a corporate body, a kingdom. Without a corporate body, a kingdom, there would be no need for the law. Hence, the law is necessary because a nation, a kingdom, is a corporate body that needs a government. The basis of this government is the law.</p>
<p>Throughout the six thousand years of human history, regardless of man&rsquo;s experiences, changes, and studies, law has always been the foremost matter. Hence, in a kingdom there is a great need for law. In Exodus there is a kingdom involving the matters of law and administration. In human government there is often a legislative and executive branch. According to Exodus, the administration in the Old Testament depended upon a group of elders. The title <em>elder</em> first appears in Exodus 3:16. Chapter 24 later speaks of &ldquo;seventy of the elders of Israel&rdquo; (vv. 1, 9). Hence, a corporate body of elders, or an eldership, was formed in Exodus. Both the title <em>elder</em> and the eldership, a corporate body of elders, are first spoken of in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Although elders are spoken of in the Old Testament, this does not mean that they cease to exist in the New Testament. Some teach that everything in the Old Testament comes to an end in the New Testament. Those who say this must be very careful; God is in the Old Testament, and God is also in the New Testament. Likewise, the heavens and the earth are in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. Knowing the Bible is not an easy matter; one should not simply repeat what others say but must study the Bible carefully. The heavens, the earth, God, the promise of the gospel, and many other items are found in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. In Galatians 3:8 Paul clearly says that, even as far back as at Abraham&rsquo;s time, God announced the gospel to Abraham. God announced the gospel to Abraham in Genesis 12:3, saying that in Abraham all the families of the earth would be blessed. This gospel did not cease to exist in the New Testament simply because it was preached in the Old Testament; on the contrary, this gospel is greatly developed and enriched in the New Testament. The promise God gave Abraham in the Old Testament is the basis of the gospel in the New Testament. Hence, the New Testament gospel did not begin with John the Baptist; rather, it began long ago in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, we must learn to know the principles and the facts and to see that God&rsquo;s intention is consistent. From Genesis to Revelation, from eternity past to eternity future, God&rsquo;s intention has been consistent and has never changed. Nevertheless, there are some particular considerations and needs that are reflected in the various procedures, dispensations, and ages. For this reason, a door was opened for the law that was neither the front door nor the back door but a door added alongside (Rom. 5:20); this means that the law was not the starting point of God&rsquo;s economy. Galatians 3:19 says that the law was added by God because of the transgressions of man. Nevertheless, God&rsquo;s intention, from Adam to the New Jerusalem, has always been the same. I hope that those who read the Bible are able to see this point.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT<br />
BEING THE ADMINISTRATORS AMONG GOD&rsquo;S PEOPLE</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament God originally ordained for elders, not kings, to be the administrators. God&rsquo;s desire was not that kings would take care of the administration among His people. Hence, the elders need to be careful. None of us should think that if we become an elder, we become a king. Once a person becomes a king, he is through; this is not what God desires. God is not seeking to have kings; rather, He desires to have elders. Among God&rsquo;s people, the elders must represent God to carry out His administration. God&rsquo;s administration cannot be carried out according to the elders&rsquo; view; rather, it must be carried out according to the perpetual law of God, represented by the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament, which are firm and unalterable. In addition, God&rsquo;s administrators must follow His instant, living revelation. Hence, there is not only the perpetual, written law but also living revelation.</p>
<p>The first thing spoken of in the Old Testament in regard to God&rsquo;s administrative arrangement among His people is God&rsquo;s kingdom. As soon as the kingdom and the people of God came into being, there were elders among them. These elders were not appointed in the same way as kings are appointed in a monarchy. The principle for the appointment of elders in the church is that elders must be &ldquo;grown-up and older&rdquo;; hence, it is a matter of life, growth, and maturity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRIESTS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT<br />
BEING THOSE WHO BORE GOD&rsquo;S PEOPLE</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s Old Testament economy God did not arrange for the elders to come directly into God&rsquo;s presence in the Holy of Holies; rather, He wonderfully arranged for there to be another group of people&mdash;the priesthood. In the priesthood there was a high priest who, according to God&rsquo;s Old Testament economy, entered into the Holy of Holies once a year to draw near to God. When the high priest entered the Holy of Holies, he wore two kinds of plates. One kind was the shoulder plates upon which were two onyx stones engraved with the names of the sons of Israel; six names were engraved on the one stone and six names were engraved on the other stone (Exo. 28:9-10). This indicates that the high priest should bear God&rsquo;s people on his shoulders.</p>
<p>The high priest also wore another kind of plate, the breastplate, which hung upon the high priest&rsquo;s garment. The garments of the high priest were very special. The most important garment was the ephod, which was similar to a vest. Bible translators have found it difficult to express this word with an equivalent in their own language; as a result, they simply transliterate the Hebrew word (v. 4). The ephod was a long vest worn over the robe of the priests. The ephod was attached to the breastplate, on which were twelve precious stones, each representing a tribe of Israel. The names of the twelve tribes of Israel were engraved on the twelve precious stones. These names contained only eighteen of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Thus, according to the Hebrew alphabet, there was still a shortage of four letters. Hence, God instructed Moses to add another object&mdash;the Thummim, which means &ldquo;perfecters, completers&rdquo; (v. 30).</p>
<p>When this object was added, the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet were complete. The breastplate was similar to a typewriter. An English typewriter contains keys for the twenty-six letters of the English alphabet, and the combination of these letters is unlimited. They can be combined to form words, sentences, and even a composition. The breastplate was a spiritual typewriter worn on the breast of the high priest. Its being worn on the breast signifies care. The high priest cared for God&rsquo;s people and carried them with him. The high priest needed to put the Urim and the Thummim in the breastplate (v. 30; Lev. 8:8). Some versions indicate that the Urim was a kind of illuminator and that the Thummim was an object upon which were inscribed four letters of the Hebrew alphabet.</p>
<p>When a problem arose among the children of Israel that could not be solved according to the Ten Commandments, the high priest would bring the breastplate before God to inquire of Him. In the process of inquiring, one of the letters or one of the names of the tribes would suddenly become dark. This can be likened to the telegraph, in which a message is sent letter by letter until eventually the entire sentence can be read. The breastplate along with the Urim and the Thummim were the Old Testament &ldquo;telegraph.&rdquo; Hence, the breastplate of the high priest was called the breastplate of judgment (Exo. 28:29). When there was a problem among God&rsquo;s people, the high priest would receive a judgment from God by means of the breastplate and the Urim and the Thummim.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT<br />
ALSO BEING PRIESTS</h2>
<p>The elders carried out the administration among the children of Israel not only according to the set law but also by means of God&rsquo;s instant revelation through the breastplate, the Urim, and the Thummim. The priests received the Ten Commandments and taught them to God&rsquo;s people. They also brought the Urim and the Thummim into God&rsquo;s presence to receive God&rsquo;s instant revelation. These two kinds of ministry were both carried out by the priests. In the Old Testament there was an eldership related to carrying out God&rsquo;s administration and a priesthood related to ministering God&rsquo;s word. In the New Testament, however, these two bodies have become one. Every saved person in the New Testament is a priest (1 Pet. 2:5; Rev. 1:6), and the elders are simply the more mature and experienced ones among the saints. They are both elders and priests.</p>
<p>An elder must be one who has rich experiences of life in regard to spiritual matters and must also be mature in life. Moreover, he must be a priest who draws near to God and has contact with God. Just as the high priest in the Old Testament was able to read the condition of the twelve tribes of Israel through the breastplate, an elder must know not only the law of God but also have the breastplate and be able to receive God&rsquo;s instant revelation. This indicates that an elder must constantly draw near to God, bearing God&rsquo;s people on his shoulders and embracing them on his breast in order to bring them into God&rsquo;s light and read them like the letters of the alphabet. Sometimes a certain one may become dark, and later another one may become dark. In this way, he can read God&rsquo;s will for God&rsquo;s people. This means that an elder must be one who is experienced in life and able to bear responsibility for God&rsquo;s people. At the same time, he must have a heart that cares for God&rsquo;s people and be a person who draws near to God, fellowships with God, is in the light of His countenance, and is able to read every member in the church according to God&rsquo;s view. This will enable him to receive God&rsquo;s instant revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONDITIONS FOR BEING AN ELDER</h2>
<p>The principle is the same today. We have the set law, the New Testament, which is composed of twenty-seven books containing over two hundred chapters. The New Testament is quite comprehensive in its contents. Although it is so complete, some matters are still not spoken of in detail. They may be referred to in principle but not in detail. Hence, an elder must first read the New Testament carefully and understand the law of God. Moreover, an elder must be a New Testament priest. In the Old Testament, elders and priests were separate; in the New Testament, these two groups of people have become one. Today an elder must also be a priest, one who draws near to God. He not only needs to know the law of God, the entire New Testament; he also needs to bear God&rsquo;s people on his shoulders, hold them in his bosom, draw near to God, and read the genuine condition of every saint by means of God&rsquo;s light. Through this kind of reading, he will receive the revelation of God. This is what it means to be an elder. The principle seen in the Old Testament still applies in the New Testament.</p>
<p>Elders must first have experiences in life and be those who draw near to God. They need to not only understand the law of God but also see the revelation of God; moreover, they need to have a definite way to seek God for His instant revelation. The way is to bear all the saints on their shoulders and to embrace all the saints in their bosom. Sometimes when an elder encounters a great difficulty, he thinks that it would be better for him to quit and discontinue his service. This indicates that he has God&rsquo;s people on his shoulders but not in his bosom. Such an elder will be unable to read God&rsquo;s will. This is because the twenty-two letters are on the breast, not on the shoulders. To wear the letters on the breast is to love and care for the brothers and sisters and to remember them in one&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>Often a mother gives others the feeling that she is more loving than the father, whereas the father usually gives others the feeling that he is stern and is often involved in discipline. Hence, when children face great matters in life, they usually listen to the mother, not the father. This is because only the mother bears the children on her shoulders and holds them in her bosom; a mother wears both the shoulder plates and the breastplate. I still remember when I first graduated from college and found a job that required proficiency in English, which was exactly what I had studied. Since the job was on an island some distance from my hometown, I had to prepare myself to leave home. At that time, I was already an adult of more than twenty years, and I knew how to take the boat and find my way there. Nevertheless, my elderly mother still worried about me and hired a rickshaw in order to follow me to the pier. The boat could not be anchored along the shore because the water was too shallow; thus, a sampan carried the passengers to the boat. After my mother saw that both my luggage and I were properly taken care of, she stood on the bank and said to me, &ldquo;A mother is anxious when her son goes on a journey, but a son does not worry when his mother goes on a journey.&rdquo; Her words left me with a deep impression. She wanted me to know that her heart would follow me while I was far away. Mothers make wonderful priests because they not only bear their children on their shoulders but also hold them in their bosoms. When mothers enter into the presence of God to read the condition of their children, they become very clear about their children. The elders also should be like this.</p>
<p>Some elders are not like mothers. It seems that they are forced to be elders, and they feel deeply that it would be best if they could break away from being an elder. Sometimes not only they have such a thought, but even those around them pour cold water on them, telling them that there is nothing good about being an elder and that it is full of troubles. Such elders serve under compulsion. Although they bear the saints on their shoulders, they do not have them in their hearts. Whether or not an elder is able to sleep peacefully when the church or a certain brother or sister is experiencing problems tests the manner in which he bears the saints. If he is able to sleep peacefully, there is no breastplate. If the breastplate is present, he will be unable to sleep peacefully. If we are bearing and holding the brothers and sisters, we will be wonderful priests, and in God&rsquo;s light we will be able to read God&rsquo;s leading concerning the brothers and sisters whom we hold in our heart. This is how God takes care of the administration of His people throughout the entire Bible.</p>
<p>In this administration priests expound the law and use the breastplate to receive God&rsquo;s instant leading. However, the priests in the Old Testament did not have the eldership and thus could not administrate. In the same way, today not every saint can bear the responsibility of the administration. There were many priests in the Old Testament age, but there were not as many elders. This means that among the saints everyone is a priest, but only a few are elders. Therefore, brothers who are elders must see that in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy the elders are a unique group of people. Every saved one should be a priest. Elders, on the contrary, are a minority. Only those who are mature in the experiences of life are qualified to be elders. Their maturity is not in regard to their physical life but in regard to their spiritual life. We must know that, spiritually speaking, not everyone is mature; only a small number are relatively mature. This is not an absolute matter but a relative matter. Even though it is a relative matter, only a small number of people are mature. For example, out of a hundred people, only a dozen may be relatively mature in life. Because others have not yet grown to the same extent, these ones begin to take the lead and serve. These are the elders.</p>
<p>Being a priest is not a matter of being young or mature; as long as a person is born into a priestly family, he is a priest. However, being an elder depends on how much one has grown in life. For instance, in the Old Testament, all those of the family of Aaron were born priests. However, not all were elders. In the entire tribe of Aaron, only a few were elders. Out of two or three million men, plus women and children, only seventy elders are spoken of in Exodus 24. Hence, in terms of the administration in God&rsquo;s economy, the elders are the most important group. We can say this because there were more priests than elders in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>The condition is the same today. Every saved one in all the churches is a priest, yet there is a lack of elders. There is no requirement in regard to the life and age of a priest, but an elder must be mature and experienced in life.</p>
<p>Everyone is able to come before God to pray. For example, yesterday a brother was saved. As soon as he came out from the baptistery, he immediately prayed to God. As soon as he began praying, he began to function as a priest; nevertheless, he is not able to be an elder. To be an elder is a matter of growth in life within the local church. We may use another illustration. There may be twenty newly saved brothers and sisters in a newly established local church. Several months later there may be a need to appoint elders among them. At that time it will be necessary to see who among them has grown the most and who are the most mature. As far as the priesthood is concerned, everyone can be a priest, but as far as the eldership is concerned, only the most mature in life are qualified to be elders.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY<br />
BEING FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We need to be clear that the elders&rsquo; administration of the church is not merely organizational. In fact, it does not contain much element of organization; rather, the emphasis is on building. Moreover, this is not the building of a physical house but the building of the church, which is not an organization but an organic Body. If it were the building of an organization, it would be organizational, but the building of the Body is organic. The elders must see that they are not building an organization in their respective localities; rather, they are building an organic Body, which is altogether a matter of life. Wherever the elders of the churches are, whether in a church as big as Taipei or in a church as small as Tong-shi, they must see that the churches which they are building are not merely an organization but an organism, a part of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The building of an organization is organizational, whereas the building of the Body is organic. For instance, when a carpenter makes a table, he uses many pieces of wood. He cuts, polishes, and then nails them together to make a table. To be a carpenter is easy. An apprentice can learn to do it well in three to five years. However, the study of the human body is not like this, because the human body is not easy to understand. Medical doctors are aware of how complicated and troublesome the human body is. Hence, some medical doctors focus their studies on the ear, nose, and throat; some focus on the blood; and some, on the eyes. These people spend their whole life studying yet still cannot thoroughly understand the human body.</p>
<p>Recently I needed eye surgery for a cataract. Soon after the surgery, I began to experience a retinal detachment. My doctor became worried and immediately called another specialist for advice. Puzzled, I asked my doctor, &ldquo;Are you not an ophthalmologist?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but there are different kinds of specialists in ophthalmology. Some ophthalmologists specialize in treating retinal detachments.&rdquo; Since my doctor was a surgeon who specialized in cataracts, he was not able to handle the problem of a retinal detachment. This shows that organic matters are complicated and difficult.</p>
<p>In the church life we always complain about the elders, saying that this one does not do something well and that another one does not lead well. As time goes by, however, we murmur less because we develop sympathy for them. Today people of all ages go to see doctors. Those who are younger nitpick and more easily blame the doctor for being ignorant in regard to a particular matter. When older people visit their doctors, however, they are not as likely to become angry because they know that their bodies are truly difficult to manage and cannot easily be understood.</p>
<p>A person may go to see a doctor because a tumor has developed in his body or a certain part has developed in a wrong way, but the doctor may not be able to tell him exactly what to do. In regard to an organism such as the human body, doctors may spend their entire life studying yet never fully understand it. Likewise, it is difficult for the elders to administrate the church, because the church is an organism, not an organization.</p>
<p>Let us turn again to the example of the table. If a table is missing a corner, the carpenter will have to consider how to patch the missing corner. If he does not patch the missing corner, the table may have a missing corner until the world comes to an end. Our human body, however, is quite different. If a certain part of our body is injured or hurt, within a week it may grow and be healed naturally. A corner of a table that has been cut off will never grow back no matter how long we wait. This is because it is something organized. In contrast, our human body can grow and naturally heal itself after a period of time because it is organic. Therefore, we must believe in the organic nature and functions of our body.</p>
<p>The condition of the church is also organic. When we lead the brothers and sisters, we need to rely on the organic capability within them. A brother or sister may fall, but we should not be too worried. He or she may rise up again next year. An experienced elder will surely say Amen to this word. In the church life we sometimes see brothers who are in a healthy condition and have a bright spiritual future; however, two years later such a brother may fall quite terribly. At the same time there may be another brother in whom people have little hope, but after two years he may make the most progress and became the most promising one. Therefore, when we serve the saints, it is difficult to know them accurately according to their behavior; rather, we need to pay attention to the development of the organic capability within them.</p>
<p>In the matter of leading people to salvation, it may be difficult for us to know whether a person has touched the Spirit. We know a person must touch the Spirit in order to be saved. Once he touches the Spirit, he is enlivened. However, we may not know the signs that indicate that salvation has occurred. We may only know to preach the Lord Jesus to people and to baptize them after they believe into the Lord, receive Him, and pray to Him, but we may not know if they have touched the Spirit. Sometimes we have seen a person who seems to experience a dynamic salvation; once he is saved, he removes all the idols from his house. It is really wonderful. Who would have thought that after half a year, he would buy another idol and bring it into his home! We may then ask him to remove it, but he may be stubbornly unwilling and insist on keeping it. At such a time we may become totally disappointed. However, three years later he may burn the idol and have an even stronger dealing than the previous one. There have been cases like this.</p>
<p>When we serve the church, we need to realize that the church is an organism. In serving, the greatest need is to avoid interrogating people. For example, after a brother is baptized, we should not constantly try to find out whether he has been regenerated. In Matthew 13:24-30, the Lord Jesus spoke a parable regarding the sowing of seed in a field. A man sowed good seed, wheat, in his field, but in the end tares were manifested, apparently without reason. When the seed was sown, it was pure, genuine seed, yet tares appeared after the sowing. Some may have thought that birds brought in the tares, and others may have said that the wind blew tares from one field into another field. However, these considerations are not reasonable. In His reply to the disciples, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;An enemy has done this&rdquo; (v. 28). Experts say that there is absolutely no way to distinguish wheat from tares at the time of sowing. The two look exactly the same. Once they grow and produce fruit, they are the same height and have the same form, but the fruit of the wheat is golden yellow and that of the tares is black. Only at the time of the harvest are people able to distinguish between the two; nevertheless, it is too late.</p>
<p>In the same way, at the time of baptism we have absolutely no way to know who among the newly saved ones may be tares. It is difficult to discern. Hence, we should not hastily jump to a conclusion; rather, we should pray. When we preach the gospel, we need to have the Spirit, power, and the life supply. As to whether or not people have actually been regenerated, we can only give the matter to the Lord. If we think that someone has not been saved, we can give him a nutritious &ldquo;shot&rdquo; by ministering life to him the following day. Even if he is a false one, after receiving our ministering several times, he will become a genuine one.</p>
<p>We need to see that the church is an organism and that everyone in the church is directly a part of this organism. Hence, when we serve the church, we need to deal with people as part of an organism. If we see that a certain brother or sister is not comely, we should not be disappointed. Perhaps a year later he or she will grow a little more and there will be more hope. Some people, after being baptized, do not exercise spiritually or come to the meeting. Yet one day, for an unknown reason, they begin to be zealous and attend all the meetings. Some people, on the contrary, meet regularly after they are first saved, but one day, because of an offense from an elder, they stop coming. We probably have encountered all these cases. The church is truly an organism that requires us to deal with it in an organic way. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to build up an organism, that is, the Body of Christ (Eph. 3:3-11; Matt. 16:18).</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH AS THE PILLAR AND BASE<br />
OF THE TRUTH BEING<br />
GOD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH</h2>
<p>The church is God manifested in the flesh. Regardless of whether a church is strong or weak, in principle it is still God manifested in the flesh. This unique entity by which God is manifested in the flesh is composed of a pillar and a base, that is, the pillar and base of the truth (1 Tim. 3:15-16). In other words, this unique entity upholds the truth in the universe. The only thing in the universe that real is God Himself. This is to say that only the things pertaining to God and belonging to God, such as God&rsquo;s redemption and God&rsquo;s plan, are the reality, the truth, of the universe.</p>
<p>The truth is recorded in the Bible and upheld by the church. Even if a church is the weakest church, she is still a manifestation of God in the flesh. As such an entity, she upholds the truth in the universe, for the church is the pillar and base of the truth. Strictly speaking, elders must spend much time to study and know the Bible, thereby allowing the truth to enter into them. They must do so because they are elders in local churches, and every local church is a unit that upholds the truth of God. Thus, the elders must apprehend, understand, and know the truth. Only by all of us practicing this can we match God&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ELDERS<br />
IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LOCAL CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Cooperating with the Apostles</h2>
<p>Acts 15 reveals the importance of elders in the administration of a local church (vv. 2, 6, 22-23). At that time nearly every church on earth encountered great turmoil because of those who were zealous for Judaism. Although these ones believed in the Lord, they continued to teach people to keep the law and to be circumcised. They were very strong in promoting these teachings; thus, they became a problem in churches throughout Jewish and Gentile lands (v. 1). At that time Paul, Barnabas, and some others were sent to Jerusalem (v. 2), which was the source of the problem, that is, the place where the problem began. The Bible says that when they arrived in Jerusalem, out of the tens of thousands of Christians, they discussed the matter with the apostles and elders (v. 2). This clearly demonstrates the importance of the elders. Indeed, the elders are as important as the apostles. Just as the apostles are important, the elders are equally important; elders function in cooperation with the apostles.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Following the Leading of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Those serving as elders should learn to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. Acts 15 presents such a picture. Although the elders should cooperate with the apostles, both the apostles and the elders need to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit (v. 28) in their mutual cooperation. The elders need to see the importance of their position. On one hand, they must learn to cooperate with the apostles. If they refuse to cooperate with the apostles, their administration will disintegrate. On the other hand, if the apostles and elders do not follow the Holy Spirit, their administration will be paralyzed. Hence, the elders must always cooperate with the apostles, and both of them must follow the Holy Spirit. Only in such a situation can the administration be complete and whole, being neither disintegrated nor paralyzed.</p>
<p>If the elders do not cooperate with the apostles, the administration of the church will disintegrate, and if the elders do not follow the leading of the Holy Spirit, the administration of the church will become paralyzed. Hence, the elders occupy an important position in the church. Moreover, the importance of their position is mainly in regard to two aspects&mdash;they must cooperate with the apostles, and they must follow the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Some elders would neither cooperate with the apostles nor follow the Holy Spirit; instead, they try to do things according to their own views and ideas. This is dangerous. When they do this, the importance of the eldership is lost. We have already seen that the importance of the eldership lies in their cooperation with the apostles and in their walking with the Holy Spirit and following the leading of the Holy Spirit. When they function in this way, their administration is worthwhile. This is because the apostles bring in the apostles&rsquo; teaching, and the Holy Spirit carries out the apostles&rsquo; teaching through the elders among the local churches. Hence, the elders must cooperate with the apostles and follow the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS BEING THOSE WHO CARE FOR THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Good Testimony in Their Living</h2>
<p>The elders are those who care for the church (1 Tim. 3:5). An elder must have a good testimony in his living (vv. 2-3, 7) and be watchful. It is not good if he is careless or if he makes mistakes. These affect his testimony. Since he cares for and takes the lead in the local church, he is one on whom every eye gazes and at whom every finger points. This means that as soon as he makes a mistake, people will see it and know it. If you are an ordinary brother, people will not pay much attention to you; however, if you become a leading one or a serving one in the church, people will begin to notice you. Thus, the elders must be watchful in regard to their living and have a good testimony before men.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Taking the Lead Well</h2>
<p>An elder, as a head sheep, leads the saints by walking in front. Hence, 1 Timothy 5:17 says that a proper elder should &ldquo;take the lead well.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Apt to Teach</h2>
<p>An elder should be apt to teach (3:2b). According to the testimony of the churches in various localities, I am afraid that we are inadequate in this matter. With such an inadequacy, the churches will not only become paralyzed but will fail to bear rich fruit. The growth of a local church and its rich fruit depends entirely on the elders&rsquo; ability to teach. An elder is like someone who teaches in a family. If a mother merely sends her children to school and does not have the ability to teach them at home, her children will be lacking in their education. The education of a child does not depend merely on the instruction received from the teachers at school; even more, it depends upon the guidance received at home, especially from the mother. If a mother knows how to teach her children, one can be sure that their education will be carried out in a good way. Therefore, elders should be apt to teach.</p>
<p>Regarding this aspect, the elders need to read more, especially the Bible and the Life-studies. There is a great need to read the Life-studies. Within the Life-studies there are over twelve hundred messages, each message containing an average of ten pages. Therefore, the twelve hundred messages have a total of approximately twelve thousand pages. The elders need to enter into the Life-studies. If they take the lead to read, the brothers and sisters will follow. It is not appropriate for the elders to ask the brothers and sisters to read if they themselves do not read. If this is the case, the elders will not be able to answer the saints properly when they have questions in regard to their reading. However, if the elders read the Life-studies, they will be able to find a way to teach and instruct the saints. This is similar to mothers who tutor their children at home. In order for a mother to tutor her children in mathematics, she must know mathematics herself. Moreover, the Life-studies can truly supply the brothers and sisters, give them light, and provide them with the life supply.</p>
<p>I am concerned that though there are many spiritual publications among us, not many brothers and sisters dive into them. It seems that in their living, there is only one book&mdash;the Bible&mdash;which they may read when they have time and set aside when they run out of time. When they have enough time, they also attend the meetings of the church. If this is the case, the church cannot be strong, and it will not bear rich fruit. We all know that fruit is produced out of the riches of life. If a life has no richness, it cannot bear rich fruit. Hence, the elders need to take the lead to learn the truth. They need to read the Bible more, especially the New Testament.</p>
<p>There is one more matter that needs our attention; that is, when we begin to read the Life-studies, we should not expect to read eight or ten messages per day. This will cause spiritual indigestion. It is best to read half a message per day. At this pace it will take only six to seven years to finish the twelve hundred messages. Although this way may seem slow, we must remember that it is better to be afraid of standing still than of being slow. If all the elders spend the next six years to read the Life-studies, I believe that they will begin to reap the benefit within half a year, and their gain over the long term will be tremendous. May we redeem the time and enter into all these riches.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if all the churches read the Life-studies, the churches will become &ldquo;scholarly spiritual families.&rdquo; The newly saved ones among us will then be influenced and edified by this practice and enter into the Life-studies with us. In this way the church will surely become strong. The rulers of nations know that for a nation to be strong, there must be a strong system of education. The reason that Taiwan is so strong and promising is due to its fundamental education. If the government in Taiwan had not promoted a strong system of education for the past forty years, Taiwan would be incapable and incompetent in everything. The reason that Taiwan can accomplish so much and reach such a high standard is due to its high level of education. On the contrary, if Taiwan did not have such a high standard of education, it would never be able to accomplish anything.</p>
<p>If the church wants to be strong, it should not expect to have a Pentecostal-style revival. Such revivals can be likened to rain showers. There may be a rain shower in the morning, but the roads dry up by the afternoon. There have been revivals in the church in the past, but they came quickly and left quickly. We do not want this kind of revival. It is like a rain shower that has no lasting benefit. Neither should we rely on chance, thinking that since we have now taken the new way and have changed the system, all things will be revived. If we do not see results for several years, we may assume that the new way does not work and does not bear results. In fact, it is not that the new way does not yield results but that everything has its timing. We know that a farmer does not sow today and reap tomorrow. It is not that fast. To grow a fruit tree, a farmer needs to spend a few years cultivating it in a proper way; then in due time it will bear fruit. However, if the tree is not cultivated properly, it will never bear fruit.</p>
<p>We should not think that once we change the system, we will have an immediate success. The purpose of changing the system is simply to find a way. For instance, Chinese males used to have long plaited hair and wear Chinese-style clothing. Now, because of the influence of the West, they feel that it is not so convenient to wear that kind of hairstyle and have that style of clothing; thus, they keep their hair short and wear Western-style clothing. This has become part of their daily living. In the same way, our hope in regard to changing the system is not that our numbers will immediately be doubled, from ten thousand to twenty thousand and then from twenty thousand to forty thousand; rather, our hope is to bring in a way that we can all enter into and that will eventually become our living.</p>
<p>In this kind of living, the first and foremost emphasis is that the elders need to take the lead to learn and speak the truth in the churches. In other words, every elder needs to learn to speak in the church according to the truth. This is different from speaking in a home. To speak in a meeting, we must speak loudly and with the proper cadence so that people can understand us; this is related to teaching. Of course, in prophesying, it is not merely a matter of the voice. We also need to have the mind of a prophet; that is, we need to receive more light, revelation, and supply from the Life-studies. In addition, we need to learn to develop the proper utterance so that we may freely apply what is spoken of in the Life-studies and be able to minister words of supply. This will change our atmosphere. In this way the church will surely become strong and rich.</p>
<p>We always hope that there will be a church in every town and village; however, we do not have enough full-time serving ones to work in every place. Hence, there is a need for the brothers in the different localities, that is, the elders in the local churches, to do this themselves. For this reason, they bear a great and extremely important responsibility to learn the truth and to be apt to teach.</p><h2 class="head2">Laboring in Word and Teaching</h2>
<p>The elders should not only be apt to teach; they must also labor in word and teaching (1 Tim. 5:17b). There are two aspects in regard to laboring in the word: on one hand, you need to learn; on the other hand, you need to teach. A person who teaches at school, whether as a university professor or as an elementary school teacher, knows that when he was a student, his learning was limited because he did not need to teach others. Since becoming a teacher, he needs to study, learn thoroughly, and be well prepared. For instance, if he needs to teach a class tomorrow, he will need to review and study today. He will also have to decide what to teach first and what to teach later. As a result, his teaching will be systematic and effective; otherwise, his teaching will be disorderly. Hence, teaching requires labor.</p>
<p>A person who has not labored should not expect to know anything concerning the truth, let alone teach others. One who knows the truth and can teach others must have labored in word and teaching. Many who work for the Lord can testify that the most painful thing in the service is to release a message. One who speaks for the Lord often needs to rest for two hours after speaking a message in order to recover. This is because speaking is strenuous, consuming both mind and energy; it is most laborious but most effective.</p>
<p>If the parents do not know how to teach their children, the children will certainly suffer in their education. When they make mistakes, the parents should not immediately become angry at them; rather, the parents need to explain the matter and instruct their children unceasingly. This way of teaching is certainly beneficial. This is the same in the church. As long as the elders take the lead well, are apt to teach, and labor in word and teaching, the church will surely be strong and rich, and the result will also be rich.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Taking Heed to Shepherd</h2>
<p>The elders need to not only teach but also shepherd people. To shepherd people is to nourish people, to render some supply, to cherish them, and to help them and teach them to solve their problems (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:2).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Lording It over Others<br />
but Becoming Patterns to Them</h2>
<p>As elders, we should not lord it over others and give them the feeling that because we are elders, they must obey what we say as if we were kings. This is absolutely not acceptable. First Peter 5:3 says that an elder should be a pattern. In the church there are some who may not want to read the Bible. The elders should not blame them; rather, they should first ask whether they themselves read the Bible. If the elders read and enter into the Bible, the saints will be able to tell and will follow the elders in reading and entering into it. Hence, it is a matter of being a pattern. We should not lord it over others; instead, we should be the head sheep, the patterns, among the flock. Only this way is proper.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THOSE WHO ASPIRE TO THE OVERSEERSHIP<br />
DESIRING A GOOD WORK</h2>
<p>The last point is an encouragement to all the elders, which is that those who aspire to the overseership desire a good work. In this regard, there is a need for some explanation. Everyone within any group has ambition and the desire to have a position to take the lead. If this is the case among us, it is not right. If some, however, desire to serve as elders for the building up of the local churches and for the benefit of God&rsquo;s children and desire to truly have this kind of function and capacity, then their desire is not merely a matter of position but of function. Those who desire this function are approved and praiseworthy. Paul says that they desire a good work (1 Tim. 3:1).</p>
<p>I hope that the Lord will speak to each one of us so that we may see that the most necessary and crucial persons in God&rsquo;s economy on the earth today are the elders. This is not just a matter of position or reputation but of bearing an important responsibility. Such a responsibility requires that the elders bear all the brothers and sisters on their shoulders, embrace them with their hearts, and bring them before God in order to &ldquo;read&rdquo; them and seek God&rsquo;s leading for them. They then need to be the head sheep, the leading ones, the patterns among saints. Moreover, they need to teach the saints, spend much time learning and teaching the truth of God, and labor in teaching. In this way, all the churches will be strong and rich over the long term.</p>
<p>The church can hardly become rich and strong if there is no teaching or leading from the elders and if the church relies only on special fellowships or conferences given by a few full-time serving ones every few months. This may be compared to opening a school. A school can be successful if it formally divides up the classes and hires teachers to teach systematically day after day. The school may at times invite some renowned person to give a speech, but such activities, though helpful, are not the main reason for a school&rsquo;s success. If a school has a good curriculum and the teachers are serious in their teaching, the school will still be strong and successful, even if no one of renown ever gives a speech to the students.</p>
<p>We do not need much help from the outside because we have the Bible, a Bible that has been opened to us, and many spiritual publications. As long as we spend the time, we will be able to enter into all these riches. Furthermore, we can practice and learn to speak for the Lord. As long as we practice and continue to labor in teaching and leading, the church will surely grow.</p>
<p>In regard to the number of those attending the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting, we have not experienced much increase for the past twenty years. On one hand, we thank the Lord for His preservation, yet on the other hand, we should not be satisfied. Twenty years is not a short period of time, yet we have not had much progress or propagation. This is our responsibility, and we are all accountable.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PROPER PURSUIT OF THE ELDERS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 5:17; 3:2b; 1 Cor. 14:1, 4-5, 12, 31, 39a; 3:10, 12; Psa. 119:147-148; Lam. 3:22-24; 1 John 1:9; Acts 13:52; Rom. 8:4; Phil. 1:20-21a; 1 Thes. 5:17; 2 Tim. 4:2; Heb. 10:25; Phil. 1:19; 4:13</h1>
<p>Prayer: Father, be gracious to us that we may treasure Your holy ministry and touch Your throne of grace with our spirit. Enable us not only to enter into the Holy of Holies but to remain and live in it in order to be able to pray for Your church and for the saints, to pray that we would take Your way, and to pray that we would be revived inwardly and gradually be enabled to live an overcoming life. Lord, grant us Your visitation so that we may not waste our time or squander Your grace but may become priests and living stones. O Lord, we want to enjoy You and to actively produce building materials for the building of Your church. In these days may You fulfill Your heart&rsquo;s desire, which is also our heart&rsquo;s desire. May You be glorified, may we be perfected, and may all of us be built up. Amen.</p>
<p>We all know that the elders in the church are crucial in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. In any place, as long as two brothers know how to be elders, even if there is not a single saved one in that place, within two years a church of twenty-five will surely be raised up. If several hundred brothers on the island of Taiwan are perfected and are truly able to fulfill the responsibility of elders, churches will be raised up wherever they go, regardless of whether believers are already there. As long as they stay in a locality for a period of time, a church will surely be raised up. Our past experience tells us that the workers are very useful for the raising up of churches, but it is difficult for them to stay in various places for the perfecting of the churches. Hence, there is a need for elders in a locality for the perfecting of the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE LEAD,<br />
TO TEACH, TO RENDER CARE,<br />
TO TAKE HEED, AND TO SHEPHERD</h2>
<p>In the New Testament the first requirement for the elders is that they take the lead (1 Thes. 5:12; 1 Tim. 5:17). Many people can preach the gospel, preach the word, and edify others, but in regard to taking the lead, they are helpless. Taking the lead is not an easy matter. Many people know how to get to their destination, but they may not be able to tell others how to get there. For example, we may ask someone for directions to a certain place, and he may know the way to get there himself; nevertheless, when he points out the way to us, it is quite possible that he will point in another direction and provide an indirect route. We might even get lost. Therefore, it is not a small matter for someone to take the lead in a locality where saints have been raised up to meet as the church.</p>
<p>The second requirement for elders is to be apt to teach. Teaching is not easy; it requires labor in word and teaching (v. 17). The teaching required of the elders is not general but specialized; otherwise, there would not be the need for labor. For example, a person can easily speak a message for an hour without much need to labor; however, if he truly wants to release a burden and speak the truth into the saints, helping them to enter into the truth, there is the need for much labor.</p>
<p>When school teachers and college professors begin to teach others, even though they have previously taken many courses while in school, they must labor and study even more in order to collect the items that they have studied over the years and compile them into a set of teaching materials. In this way the teaching materials cover the main points and follow a definite sequence so that what is taught is presented clearly and logically. Such teachers are good teachers and are well liked by the students. If a teacher speaks aimlessly in the classroom, it is difficult for the students to follow. This teaching method does not last because it becomes unbearable for the students.</p>
<p>If the elders in the church want to teach the brothers and sisters, they must spend time and effort to labor in God&rsquo;s word. Those who do not labor in the word are not able to teach, because they have nothing to teach. Hence, in the matter of teaching, the elders need to study teaching materials and teaching methods. They need to learn how to teach properly so that what they teach can be imparted into others.</p>
<p>When the elders actually teach the saints, they need to labor even more. The elders&rsquo; teaching of the saints is different from the brothers&rsquo; speaking from the podium. Those who speak from the podium need a certain degree of labor, but the elders&rsquo; teaching of the saints requires even more labor. A mother who teaches her children must labor abundantly. This is because it is not easy to teach the children in a manner that will cause them to listen, receive, understand, and endure to be educated. Though most mothers do not have this ability, some mothers are truly able to subdue their children without angering them but rather causing them to happily receive their teaching. We urgently need this kind of teaching.</p>
<p>The elders must realize that most of the saints in the church are a &ldquo;hodgepodge.&rdquo; They cannot be divided into different grades, such as first and second grade, as is done in an educational system. In the church it is impossible to divide the saints into different classes. Even in the training center this is not possible. The reason is that there are all kinds of people in the church. If we were to divide them into different classes, we would probably need several hundred different classes. This is impossible. The elders&rsquo; teaching of the saints is truly laborious.</p>
<p>In addition to knowing how to take the lead and teach, the third requirement for the elders is that they need to know how to &ldquo;care for the church&rdquo; (3:5). <em>Care for</em> is an excellent translation; the elders should not merely <em>manage</em> but <em>care for</em> the church. To manage is easy, but to care for a matter is not so easy. It may be quite easy for a brother to manage a brothers&rsquo; house, but it is not easy for him to care for the brothers&rsquo; house. To manage the brothers&rsquo; house, he needs only to ask the brothers to wake up at 5:30 A.M., have morning watch at 6:00 A.M., and go to bed at 10:30 P.M. This is to manage the brothers&rsquo; house; however, to care for the brothers is more troublesome. To do so properly, he may need to wait at the door for the brothers to come home in order to find out why they have come home so late at night. This requires both time and energy. To care for someone is to look after him, to serve him, be concerned for him, teach him what to do, and give him what he does not have. This depicts how the elders should care for the church.</p>
<p>The fourth requirement for the elders is that they need to take heed. Acts 20:28 says, &ldquo;Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock.&rdquo; One is able to walk and move freely in an empty meeting hall; he can also jump, run, or even roll around. However, if the meeting hall is well furnished with tables, desks, and chairs, it is not that easy for people to walk around. If they are not careful, they will stumble, cause others to stumble, or even break the windows. Thus, Paul says that the elders need to take heed to themselves and to all the flock. This shows that the responsibility of the elders is not simple; it encompasses many aspects.</p>
<p>The fifth requirement for an elder is to know how to shepherd (John 21:16; Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:2). Shepherding includes teaching (Eph. 4:11). Shepherding may seem to be relatively easy and involve merely feeding children milk; in reality, it is not easy because shepherding is not merely to feed people. It also includes providing them with warmth. In other words, the shepherding one must provide tender care so that the one being cared for has a feeling of warmth. A brother may be discouraged to the uttermost, but when we talk to him and supply him with life, his heart is comforted and his inner being is warmed up. This is shepherding.</p>
<p>A brother may have a problem with another person, and he may have been wronged. In this situation he needs our shepherding very much. If we are able to speak something appropriate to him and minister life to him, our shepherding will calm him down. This is not easy. Sometimes we genuinely desire to comfort others and we may think that we are comforting them, but the outcome may be exactly the opposite. If we accuse them, we will make them feel even worse. We must know that the saints have a certain kind of respect toward the elders. Hence, if an elder is not able to speak something appropriate and give people a feeling of warmth but rather speaks something inappropriate, the saints will feel even more that they have been wronged. A brother once told an elder that if he were to be wronged by a brother or sister, he would be able to bear it, but if he were to be wronged by an elder, it would be difficult for him to bear. Shepherding the saints is not an easy matter.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT LORDING IT OVER THE SAINTS<br />
BUT BEING PATTERNS TO THEM</h2>
<p>On the negative side, an elder must not lord it over the saints (1 Pet. 5:3). In Greek, <em>to lord over</em> is to be someone&rsquo;s master. If an elder thinks that he is a kind of master, puts on airs, and lets people know that he is an elder and that everyone must listen to him, his eldership is utterly annulled. In the Bible the Lord taught that among us we have no masters except One (Matt. 20:26-27). This means that none can be a master over others. Among us, we are slaves to one another. Even the elders should be slaves to the brothers and sisters. We may be familiar with the saying that every ruler is a servant of the people. Even a president calls himself a servant of the people. When he meets with the common people, he should not put on the airs of a president. If he puts on the airs of a president, he is not a good president. A good president always feels that he is lower than the common people and that the common people are the true masters of the nation; he is but a public servant to these masters. This concept is undoubtedly influenced by the Bible.</p>
<p>In the church life, however, there are always some who misunderstand the meaning of the word <em>elder.</em> Consequently, they overly revere the elders. This is not proper. All of the elders must remember that they are not higher than the brothers and sisters; among us there is no such thing as the &ldquo;airs&rdquo; of an elder. It is said that in a certain locality, the brothers and sisters tremble when they knock on the door of the elders&rsquo; room; this is wrong. We should not create such an atmosphere for the elders. If there is such an atmosphere, even if the church has increased into many districts, it cannot be built up. Moreover, even if it is built up, the building up will not last. We all need to pay attention to this matter. </p>
<p>The elders, moreover, must be patterns to all the saints. First Peter 5:3b speaks of &ldquo;becoming patterns of the flock.&rdquo; For the elders to become patterns of the flock implies that elders are also sheep, except that they are the head sheep. As such, they need to be patterns. In New Zealand many flocks of sheep can be seen, and the wonderful thing about those sheep is that they all follow the sheep at the front, proceeding in two lines. The first two sheep are the head sheep. When the head sheep stop, the rest of the sheep also stop, when the head sheep turn right, all the sheep turn right, and when the head sheep turn left, all the sheep turn left. They do not need any command. The flock single-heartedly follows the head sheep. It is the same in the church life. The brothers and sisters simply follow the elders. If the head sheep, representing the elders, do not move forward but instead try to drive the sheep from the rear, the sheep will not know where to go. It is unreasonable and illogical for the head sheep to lead in this way.</p>
<p>If the elders would practice these points in taking the lead, teaching, rendering care, taking heed, shepherding the saints, and not lording it over them or putting on airs, the church will surely be strong and rich. If the elders take the lead in all things, whether visiting people, knocking on doors, preaching the gospel, having home meetings, having small group meetings, or having morning revival, sooner or later their pattern will spread and become a help to all the churches.</p>
<p>The living of the elders is a pattern. If the elders do not practice certain things, it will be difficult for the saints to practice them. For example, if the elders are not punctual in attending the meetings, it will not be easy for them to encourage the brothers and sisters to come to the meetings on time. In fact, this may leave the saints with the impression that the elders exercise special privileges to come to the meetings whenever they want, while expecting the saints to come early. This will cause resentment in the saints&rsquo; spirits. Hence, all the elders must set an example by their own actions. This kind of leading is the best. When the saints recognize the elders as the head sheep, they will simply follow the elders however the elders lead them.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO VISIT PEOPLE<br />
AND ENDEAVORING TO SPREAD THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>If some elders are willing to practice and learn in this way, even if there are only two such brothers, they will be able to raise up churches wherever they go. The new way given to us by the Lord is simple and easy. The Lord may lead some of us to go out two by two. To do so, we do not need to serve full time. One of us may be a teacher, and another may be an office employee. If we are not occupied by our jobs and do not seek many possessions, desiring to lead a proper life, we will be able to use our evenings, weekends, and holidays to visit people by door-knocking. We can begin from where we live. We can tell our neighbors that we live nearby and would like to visit them, get to know them, and speak with them about the gospel. If we do this, I believe that we will be able to quickly bring someone to salvation, perhaps in two hours. This is not difficult.</p>
<p>If we all go out in this way and gain one person a week, we will be able to gain fifty-two people in a year. These fifty-two people have friends and relatives, and soon these fifty-two may bring in another fifty-two. At the end of the year, there may be as many as one hundred people. Those saved in this way will naturally do the same thing that we do, because they will see this pattern from the time they are saved. Furthermore, every time we meet with them, we should let them know that we are neither pastors nor preachers. We are no different from them. We are simply teachers and employees who come together to meet. We can choose a hymn to sing, and they also can choose a hymn to sing. We can then introduce our hymnal to them and select a portion to read from the Bible. Whatever we do, they can do, and they can even do it more than us. We must bring people to take the new way from the time they are saved; nevertheless, we do not need to emphasize to them that it is a new way, because this may stir up unnecessary debates. We should simply tell them that this is the Lord&rsquo;s way in which we should all walk.</p>
<p>Today if we read the Bible to people, they will sense that the truth in it is solid and logical, that it contains neither myths nor strange legends but rather the most proper and most orthodox truths. When we read these high truths to people, they will see what the Bible says concerning God&rsquo;s will, honoring one&rsquo;s parents, and the true God. This will open people&rsquo;s eyes. In Taiwan everyone is seeking the philosophy of human life. If we spread forth the truths that are in our hands, some people will surely receive them.</p>
<p>When we contact people, we do not need to speak regarding any profound doctrine; we only need to speak the &ldquo;straight&rdquo; truth, that is, to speak the truth by cutting it straight. When we open the Bible, we may read a portion from Proverbs, Psalms, or the Gospels, all of which are good and profitable to people. After reading with them, we need to ask them how they feel about what we have read and let them share what they have gained.</p>
<p>We often have an erroneous concept that what we speak is too deep and that people cannot understand it when they first hear it. Of course, it is relatively easy to give people &ldquo;candy,&rdquo; but if we speak &ldquo;candied&rdquo; truths to those who are educated and have some position in society, we insult them. When we go out, we should properly present the philosophy of human life to people. In this way, they will feel respected and be interested in what we say. This is easy for us to do.</p>
<p>If there is no spread or multiplication in a church, this indicates that there must be a reason; hence, we must have a problem. The problem is that we are too influenced by our background and our old ways and are thus unable to &ldquo;jump&rdquo; out of them. From now on, we must leave our old ways. For example, there are many different ways to preach the gospel and even to speak to the newly saved ones. In short, all these responsibilities rest on the elders. The elders must be the first to change their concepts and come out of the old ways.</p>
<p>Although not every one of us is an elder, the principle is the same. We must realize that we cannot serve according to the old ways. Especially those who have joined the full-time training need not consider too much but should simply advance step by step. Even in the world, as long as a proper person takes the proper way, he will surely have a bright future. In high school he needs to study properly. Then when he goes on to college, he needs to continue to study properly and endeavor to finish his education. Afterward, when he takes a job, he needs to work diligently. Whoever takes such a proper way will surely have a promising future.</p>
<p>Some may think that if they take the Lord&rsquo;s way to serve Him full time, they will surely starve because no one will take care of their daily necessities. In fact, when they have only a little need, the supply is not evident; nevertheless, when they truly have needs, the supply will come from different directions. They may even have a surplus to share with others. Hence, we can all be at peace. The Lord is responsible for our needs.</p>
<p>Now we will see the proper pursuit of the elders.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO ADVANCE AND<br />
ABOUND IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">First Having the Knowledge<br />
of the Truth Themselves</h2>
<p>The elders need to advance and abound in the knowledge of the truth (1 Tim. 5:17b). If we want to pursue the truth today, the simple way is to properly study the Life-studies. Many have dropped their jobs, forsaken the world, and joined the full-time training. In the training, during a twenty-four hour day, apart from eating, resting, and sleeping, the trainees spend all their time pursuing the truth. Although there are teachers in the training center who teach courses, they cannot read the Life-studies for the trainees; the trainees must study and enter into the Life-studies for themselves.</p>
<p>Let me use myself as an example. I did not graduate from a university or receive any kind of diploma, but, may the Lord&rsquo;s blood cover me, I have been able to take charge of the translation work of the Recovery Version of the New Testament. At times I found that a word was not according to the original language, and my helpers would then verify whether it was so. In such cases they would find that it was truly so. I came to know all these things because I have many dictionaries from which I have learned many things. It can be said that I have acquired much knowledge without being taught. Today all the full-time trainees have the best opportunity in the training. In a twenty-four hour day, other than doing some community work in the evening, they can take advantage of the rest of their time. If they can read six hours a day, they can read through the Life-studies in a little more than a year. This is real pursuing.</p>
<p>Through the literature work in the Western world, not including the Far East, over six hundred churches have been raised up in the past twenty years. These approximately six hundred churches were first established in North America, then in Mexico, Central America, South America, Africa, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. I have never been to some of these places, and others I have visited only once; nevertheless, these churches have been raised up mainly through the literature. The literature work began in Taipei. At that time my family lived in a Japanese-style flat that was less than 300 square feet: the front section was about 150 square feet and the rear section was about 100 square feet, and the corridor was another 40 square feet. I asked someone to build a small kitchen and bathroom in the backyard using wooden boards. It was in this kind of environment that I began the literature work. I began by working on the sixty topics of <em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures.</em></p>
<p>Today the scale of the literature work is quite large. There are two stations in the United States: one in Anaheim, California, and the other in Irving, Texas. Books are currently published in over ten languages, including French, German, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Portuguese. These books are distributed to the six continents, supplying over one thousand churches. In 1973, because of the increasing number of attendants at the conferences held in Los Angeles, at times exceeding three thousand, we decided to begin to have trainings in 1974. Everyone who registers for the training is required to give a donation. This serves the purpose of providing a better estimation of our budget for the arrangement of various aspects of the work.</p>
<p>Concerning this point, I learned the lesson from Brother Nee&rsquo;s practice. At the beginning, when he published <em>The Present Testimony,</em> he did it by faith; that is, the number of issues he published depended on the offerings he received. If there were not many offerings, he would wait. Hence, sometimes nothing was put out for two years, and at other times two issues were put out in a single year. When the offerings came, he would put out an issue, and when the offerings did not come, he waited. This made it difficult to work and to spread. For instance, if persons are hired for the publication work, but later no offering comes, do those who are hired stay or leave? This is a problem in the service. Hence, when he published <em>The Christian,</em> Brother Nee had the subscribers pay a dollar per year, which was to be used by the work. Our trainings are carried out according to this same principle. This is a little fellowship related to the spread of the literature work.</p><h2 class="head2">Then Teaching Others</h2>
<p>In pursuing the knowledge of the truth, no one should say that there is no opportunity; in particular, the trainees should not feel that there are not enough teachers. Everyone can enter into the Life-study messages. Even if there are some portions that you do not understand, you can all come together to discuss and learn from one another. Thus, you will be able to find a way. If you become well versed in all of the twelve hundred plus Life-study messages, you will be an outstanding person in regard to the knowledge of the Bible. On the other hand, we need to see that everywhere there is the urgent need of the ministry of the word. Therefore, we need to all be filled and equipped with the truth contained in the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. Not only so, one by one we need to practice to speak the truth. We now have an excellent opportunity. In Taipei alone, there are several dozen districts. Every district provides the opportunity to speak and is waiting for the ministry of the word. There are currently several hundred people in the training, and they can all go to different districts to minister life according to what they have learned. There is no need to give lengthy messages. To speak for five to ten minutes is sufficient. If we do this, the meetings in these districts will be immediately enriched.</p>
<p>This is the reason that we needed to change the system. The old way kept us in death for too long. Many among us have been elders for years, yet I wonder what we have been doing. The present condition of the brothers and sisters is more or less the same as it was five years ago. In the old way we did not render the proper leading to the brothers and sisters. As a result, not much progress was made. Should we now give the elders an examination? Those who are qualified will remain, and we will have to consider what to do with those who are not qualified. Whatever the case, there must also be a way for the elders to make progress.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s work we must be right toward God, toward others, and toward ourselves. If I meet with the brothers and sisters for seven years and they remain the same, I am not right toward myself. Hence, we must all rise up to enter into the truth. If we would pay attention to the aspect of truth as well as to the aspect of life, we will be very useful. From now on, regardless of where we are and who we are, whether working saints or housewives, whether students or business people, whether full-time serving ones, elders, or co-workers, we must all pursue the truth.</p>
<p>First, we need to pursue the Life-studies. There are over twelve hundred Life-study messages. No matter how busy the elders may be, they need to spend at least ten minutes each day to read the Life-studies. In this way they can finish a message in three days. In one year they will have read at least one hundred and twenty messages, which is one-tenth of the twelve hundred messages. If they read in this way for ten consecutive years, they will be able to finish all of the Life-studies. If we enter into the Life-studies in such a way, the elders will definitely be different. Every one of them will be able to speak for the Lord and minister life.</p>
<p>Some of the elders&rsquo; children may already be serving full time, while their fathers, the elders, are still not able to stand up to speak for the Lord. This is not acceptable. If this is the case, I must condemn my work because it has not helped them. I know that they love the Lord, but they have not received the proper help in the matter of taking the lead. Much of my fellowship may offend them, but my intention is to give them the proper leading, hoping that from now on, if they continue to be elders, they will begin to read the Life-studies for at least ten minutes a day. In this way they will be able to stand up to speak and minister to the saints in the small groups and district meetings.</p>
<p>Every aspect of Taiwan is improving; only the church has not made progress and has not undergone any change. We need to wake up and pray to the Lord: &ldquo;O Lord, I am willing to change. I do not want to take the old way. I want to take the new way. Lord, although I do not know how to change, I pray that You would have mercy on me; I want to change.&rdquo; The elders need to wake up; otherwise, why should they bother to continue being elders? This does not mean that I am urging the elders to resign; rather, I am asking them to improve and make progress. They need to pray: &ldquo;Lord, I have been an elder in this meeting hall for ten years, but what have I actually accomplished?&rdquo; Of course, the elders in every locality have the accomplishment of standing for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony by maintaining a certain situation. We need to worship the Lord for this. Nevertheless, when we speak of engaging in warfare and going forward, they are utterly helpless. There are two reasons for this: a shortage in truth and an inadequacy in life. If the elders are rich in truth and have an adequate measure of life, they will be useful and be a blessing to the church.</p>
<p>My heart aches whenever I speak regarding this matter. If there were no church in this place, I would knock on the doors of my relatives. After saving one, I would take him with me to go out to knock on more doors. In this way I am sure that a church would be raised up within a few weeks. Not only so, at the end of the year there would be at least sixty, if not one hundred, saints in this church. I am sure of this. As long as we are willing to move, we will be able to accomplish something, but if we are not willing to move, we will not have any assurance of accomplishing anything. The attitude of &ldquo;not moving&rdquo; is fatal.</p>
<p>We have reached the stage where we should sit down and speak a frank word as to what we should do from now on. If we feel that the new way is right, we should put our whole being into it; if we do not feel that it is right, the old way is still there and we can easily return to it. However, if we want to take the new way, we must have a change in our attitude, intention, concept, and motive. Our inner being must completely change. If we do not change, we will not be able to take the new way. The first thing we need to change is our pursuit of the truth. I surely sympathize with the brothers because they all have jobs and are very busy; however, no matter how busy they are, they need to set aside at least ten minutes a day to pursue the truth.</p>
<p>Second, we all need to have a daily revival before the Lord. According to the principle of God&rsquo;s creation, when the day dawns, it does not stay bright forever; it remains bright for twelve hours at most. There are twelve hours in the night to provide us time for respite, consideration, and reflection so that we can consider whether the day was a success or a failure and hope that tomorrow morning will be a new day, a new beginning. The Bible says that God&rsquo;s lovingkindness and compassions are new every morning (Lam. 3:22-24). Every morning Jehovah God is our new portion that rises with the sun. His compassions are always new. We should all have a new beginning before God every morning, a beginning that is different from the past. We should forget yesterday and have a new beginning today. Today is a new revival, and every morning we need to have a revived living.</p>
<p>We should not excuse ourselves by saying that we are weak. We may be weak, but the Lord is not weak. First John 4:4 says, &ldquo;Greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.&rdquo; In addition, Paul says, &ldquo;I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me&rdquo; (Phil. 4:13). In Philippians 1:19 he also speaks of &ldquo;the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The promises are available, the Spirit of Jesus Christ is within us, and the One who empowers us is with us; these are all for us to apply.</p>
<p>Every morning when we come to the Lord&rsquo;s word, we need to tell the Lord, &ldquo;Amen, Lord. This is Your word. I read Your word not only in the morning but also in the evening. Lord, I do not have to wait until the morning to be revived; I want to be revived in the evening.&rdquo; We should have this kind of attitude and have such a transaction with the Lord; we should not remain in our old way. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p><h2 class="head3">Earnestly Desiring<br />
and Practicing to Prophesy</h2>
<p>The elders should also earnestly desire and practice to prophesy (1 Cor. 14:1, 31, 39). If we desire earnestly to prophesy and speak for God, there will be an outward manifestation. Prophesying requires our continual practice. Take myself as an example; I have neither attended a seminary nor passed through the training, as some of us have; nevertheless, I learned my speaking posture and gestures by practicing in front of a large mirror on my mother&rsquo;s dresser. Every day I practiced my articulation, my bearing, and other aspects related to prophesying. Sometimes I went to the seashore to exercise my spirit. I always endeavored to practice. Every one of us, especially the young people, should have the attitude and spirit that although we do not know how to speak for the Lord today, we will learn to do so in a month, and that in two months we will be able to speak even better. We should not remain as elders and co-workers yet be unable to speak year after year. We must learn to speak in a way that is both appealing and weighty. This requires that we exercise to touch the Lord in spirit and continually enter into the Holy of Holies to touch God&rsquo;s throne of grace. This should not be an empty saying; it should be our living.</p>
<p>Some elders are relatively young; it is not appropriate for them to continue to serve as elders according to the old way. If they truly desire to be elders, they must endeavor to change. History shows that Christianity has propagated the most within the past four to five hundred years. Today in Taiwan, however, Buddhism is greatly propagated; their books can be found everywhere, in big streets and in small alleys. Yet look at ourselves. It seems that we can sleep and eat peacefully while letting the days pass by. Few among us care for the gospel and even for the truth. All the aggressive activities of other religions should be a warning to us that we are losing out to them on the island of Taiwan. I hope that we can all receive this word. Today whether we are elders or co-workers, we must realize that this is our common obligation.</p>
<p>We should not remain in the old way; rather, we should endeavor to advance and not try to find an excuse for ourselves. We must rise up, whether willingly, reluctantly, or under compulsion. Perhaps some will say that this involves too much of man&rsquo;s endeavor and is too much out of the flesh, but we should ask, &ldquo;Do you mean to say that remaining quiet, unmoved, and unchanged is to be spiritual and not fleshly?&rdquo; Spirituality always leads to a result. In Matthew 12:33 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for by the fruit the tree is known.&rdquo; At present, we do not have much fruit; what can we say?</p>
<p>Inwardly, I have a painful and heavy burden. Those who need to confess their sins should rise up to confess them, those who need to repent should rise up to repent, those who are still asleep should wake up, and those who still want to take the old way should no longer think about it. We must all rise up and endeavor to take the new way. We have been damaged by the old way for long enough. The elders and co-workers must be on the alert, rise up, pursue the truth earnestly, and bear fruit so that their function can be manifested. Moreover, they need to desire earnestly that they may prophesy and exercise to practice prophesying.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Excelling in the Exercise of Gifts</h2>
<p>To practice prophesying is to excel in the exercise of gifts (1 Cor. 14:12). Since we earnestly desire to be spiritual, we must seek that we may excel in the gifts for the building up of the church. In doing so, we must not seek the inferior gifts, such as speaking in tongues, which are not profitable for the building of the church; rather, we must seek earnestly the gifts that build up the church. This is to excel. In order to excel in such a way, we must steep ourselves in the truth and delve deeper into the truth.</p>
<p>We need to read the Life-studies every day for ten minutes. When we read, we need to be prepared to minister something for three to five minutes in the district meeting on the coming Lord&rsquo;s Day. We should not speak aimlessly; rather, we should share what we have enjoyed in our reading of the Life-studies over the past six days. In this way the meetings will surely be different from in the past. The purpose of the change in system is so that everyone would rise up and stop sleeping peacefully when they sense that there is a need. Many have slept peacefully year after year, behaving as if there is no difference between the old system and the new system. We all need to rise up to encourage one another and not blame one another. The responsibility lies with us. We have no reason to blame others; we need to be responsible before the Lord. We all need to ask the Lord how we can function properly.</p><h2 class="head3">Speaking for the Lord<br />
and Speaking forth the Lord</h2>
<p>When we practice prophesying, we must bear in mind that to prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Prophesying for the Building Up<br />
of the Church&mdash;the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>We all need to see that prophesying is for the building up of the church, the building up of the Body of Christ (vv. 4-5).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GROWING IN LIFE UNTO MATURITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Having the Experiences of Life Themselves</h2>
<p>The first thing the elders need to pursue is that they may advance and abound in the knowledge of the truth. The second thing they need to pursue is the growth in life unto maturity; they must first have the experiences of life themselves.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ministering to Others</h2>
<p>The elders not only need to pursue the growth in life; they also need to be able to minister to others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">For the Building Up of the Church<br />
and the Producing of<br />
Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones as Materials</h2>
<p>Our former condition was that not much gold, silver, and precious stones were produced. If all the churches in every locality want to produce gold, silver, and precious stones, the elders must be the first in whom gold, silver, and precious stones are produced. These materials will be produced from the knowledge of the truth and the growth in life; these are the basic factors. Only these two factors&mdash;the knowledge of the truth and the growth in life&mdash;are able to produce gold, silver, and precious stones (3:10, 12). Both are indispensable. In order to produce gold, silver, and precious stones, both truth and life are needed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO BE REVIVED EVERY MORNING<br />
AND TO LIVE AN OVERCOMING LIFE EVERY DAY</h2>
<p>Throughout history, the revivals brought in by the Pentecostal movement were all short-lived because of the shortage of life. Fifty years ago we too promoted this kind of revival, but because of the experience we have gained in the past fifty years, in addition to seeing the lack of influence left from those revivals, we now have a greater realization of the importance of life. We truly need a revival, but this revival must be lasting. If a person lives on the earth for only twenty years, his existence is not that significant, but if a person lives up to eighty years, his existence is more significant. In other words, only something that lasts is significant. What we ask of God is a lasting revival, that is, one that follows God&rsquo;s law of creation, in which there is a new beginning every morning like that of the dawning of the day. Only this kind of revival is meaningful. We need to be revived every morning.</p>
<p>Moreover, we need to confess our sins every day, not only once but many times. This may be compared to washing our hands. We wash our hands every day, not once but many times. A brother who is a medical doctor said that he washes his hands over twenty times a day because he contacts at least ten patients a day. He washes his hands before and after he contacts each patient. If a doctor does not want to get sick, he needs to wash his hands frequently.</p>
<p>No matter how perfect a person may think himself to be, if he does not confess his sins, his living is a failure. If he lives an overcoming life, there will be the confession of sins every day. We have failures, shortcomings, and are negligent throughout the day; we are not that upright and righteous. There are many sins that we need to confess. Experience tells us that after our hands have been washed, they become contaminated within five minutes. This contamination is not from without but secreted from within. This contamination requires our cleansing. For example, when someone picks up a clean cup, he will find that after a while the handle of the cup becomes oily; this is due to the oil secreted from his hand. We need to realize that we are filthy. When we live for an hour, there is an hour of filth. Our source is unclean. As long as we live, we are unclean. Hence, we need to confess and constantly ask for the Lord&rsquo;s cleansing. The degree to which we confess our sins is the degree to which we are forgiven, cleansed, and able to receive the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">After Morning Revival,<br />
Calling on the Lord and Enjoying the Lord<br />
as the New Portion in His Word</h2>
<p>Psalm 119:147-148 speaks of a seeker of the Lord rising up, seeking Him, and having fellowship with the Lord in His word before the night watches. Lamentations 3 also says that God&rsquo;s grace, compassions, lovingkindness, and presence are new every morning and that we should enjoy Him as our portion (vv. 22-24).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Confessing to the Lord and<br />
Receiving the Infilling of the Spirit</h2>
<p>In our living, we need to confess our sins to the Lord and receive the infilling of the Spirit (1 John 1:9; Acts 13:52).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Walking according to the Spirit<br />
to Live Christ</h2>
<p>Moreover, in our daily life we need to walk according to the spirit in order to magnify Christ and live Christ (Rom. 8:4; Phil. 1:20-21a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Praying Unceasingly&mdash;<br />
Calling on the Lord Unceasingly</h2>
<p>Christians often ask, &ldquo;How can we pray unceasingly?&rdquo; To pray unceasingly is to call on the Lord without ceasing. We can pray unceasingly by calling on the Lord unceasingly, regardless of time, place, or what person or matter we are facing (1 Thes. 5:17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching Christ<br />
in Season and out of Season</h2>
<p>We should not be so spiritual as to think that when we preach Christ, we need to consider whether or not it is the opportune time; this is not right. Paul says, &ldquo;Proclaim the word; be ready in season and out of season&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:2). This means that regardless of what time it is, we can speak of the Lord and preach Him to others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Diligent to Meet Together</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:25 says, &ldquo;Not abandoning our own assembling together...but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Relying on the Bountiful Supply of the Spirit<br />
and the Empowering of the Lord</h2>
<p>If we desire to fulfill the aforementioned points, we cannot do so by ourselves. We can do so only by the bountiful supply of the Spirit and the empowering of the Lord (Phil. 1:19; 4:13).</p>
<p>The purpose of this fellowship is to pour out my concern; I hope that all of us will realize that this is a critical moment. May the Lord be merciful to us and cause us to have a reconsideration and a new beginning. We truly do not desire to be the same as before but seek to advance according to the new way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1; Acts 2:46; 4:31; 5:42; Matt. 28:18-19</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, our heart does not hope that we would be great or successful in this age; rather, our wish is to humbly serve You today so that we may gain Your praise in that day. Lord, give us such a heart and such a spirit. This prayer comes from our heart. This is our desire and supplication, and it is the way we desire to take. Lord, may You have a way to continually flow out from within us. Lord, visit us. Be with us. Speak to us. Remind us, and show us what we need to see. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE WAY ORDAINED BY THE LORD</h2>
<p>We now come to a practical point; that is, the elders need to lead the saints to practice the way ordained by the Lord. After several years of investigating, we have found that in order to practice the way ordained by the Lord, we need to pay attention to four main points: first, to visit people and preach the gospel to gain new ones; second, to lead the new ones to establish home meetings; third, to lead the new ones to join the small group meetings; and fourth, to participate in the district meetings. We must spend time and effort to fellowship and study these four points thoroughly so that we can carry out the new way practically. The elders in every locality should gather the saints together to fellowship and pray specifically regarding every item and every point. According to our observation, the main points in the practice of the new way have not yet become our habit. If they become our habit, it will be easy for us to go on in the new way. To build up this habit, we need to continue promoting this way.</p>
<p>The elders should take the lead not only to knock on doors and preach the gospel but also to gather the saints together to provide them with some fellowship and explanation, encouraging them to visit people and preach the gospel. To carry out the new way, at least one-fourth to one-third of the brothers and sisters need to exercise to visit people and lead them into the home meetings. In regard to home meetings, the percentage of those who participate in the new way needs to be higher. This means that at least forty percent of the saints in a locality should participate in some aspect of the new way. In other words, if one hundred saints are meeting as the church, at least forty, preferably fifty, would be involved in the new way. Perhaps twenty-five to thirty would knock on doors, while ten or more would take care of the home meetings. Of course, our greatest hope is that more than half the saints would be involved in visiting people in their homes. They would not only deliver the gospel to people and lead them to salvation but would also bring the meeting to them in order to help them grow and be perfected so that they might be brought into the practical church life. For this reason, we need to gather all the saints together in order to fellowship and to pray much regarding taking this way. Going out to visit people in order to preach the gospel and lead home meetings for the perfecting of the saints requires us to pay a price.</p>
<p>According to our study, in the past we have been truly lacking in our gospel preaching. In other words, after we baptized people, we did not have a proper way to keep them. For instance, a great number of people were baptized every year in the church in Taipei, yet very few have remained. The situation in other churches is probably the same. It is not easy for us to invite people to listen to the gospel, and it can be said that we have exerted a great deal of effort to help people to believe and be baptized; however, after several months only a few remain. Hence, all the churches must study how to improve and keep people in the church life.</p>
<p>Concerning the district meetings, we have changed the big meetings from the way that they were in the past. Now the brothers and sisters are learning the way of all speaking and all listening. However, as far as the practical situation is concerned, it will be a great loss if the church meetings continue to lack in the ministry of the word. If we do not try to make up for this lack, soon it will be difficult to maintain the meetings. This requires us to spend time to seek the Lord. In any case, the future of the church is promising; however, the question is whether we are all willing to be in one accord.</p>
<p>Few professionals in Taiwan work only according to office hours. The system of nine-to-five office hours is no longer adequate to meet the need. Often the important personnel in prominent, large-scale firms and factories need to work beyond the scheduled time. They cannot leave the office until they finish the urgent matters at hand. If the bosses and employees worked for only eight hours, their companies would surely lose money. This is the situation both in Southeast Asia and in the United States. Take the Japanese as an example. A world-renowned Japanese automobile factory has a branch in Los Angeles. Most employees in the company are Americans, who work according to office hours. When it is time to be off, they leave. However, behind the office, some are still working in a small room; they are Japanese, and they work until midnight. This is the spirit of the Japanese people.</p>
<p>The Jews are another example. If you go to New York, people will tell you that the Jews work constantly. No one knows what time they go to work in the morning and what time they go home at night. Besides working diligently, they are also very frugal. They value every cent they earn; this is why they are so successful. The elders should be like this in regard to administrating the church; they should not consider it merely as going to work and keeping regular office hours. If we keep regular hours in our service, the church under our care is finished. We must serve twenty-four hours a day.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO VISIT PEOPLE<br />
FOR GOSPEL PREACHING TO GAIN NEW ONES</h2>
<p>In the past few years of experimenting, we have discovered several factors that are important and effective in regard to preaching the gospel. The first factor is door-knocking. Compared to the traditional way of preaching the gospel, door-knocking requires us to pay a higher price. In the past, when we preached the gospel, all we needed to do was make a few phone calls to invite people. Now we need to go out personally to knock on people&rsquo;s doors. The experienced ones know that it is difficult to knock on the doors of strangers. Even if a stranger welcomes us into his home, it is not easy to begin a conversation. This requires that we pay a price; nevertheless, paying the price to knock on doors is guaranteed to be effective.</p>
<p>A team of three saints may visit people by knocking on doors. On average, out of twenty homes, they will be able to baptize at least one person. This is certain. Suppose that there is a church with one hundred saints meeting regularly. If twenty-five of them are divided into eight teams that consistently visit people for two hours every other week, they will be able to spend twenty-six weeks per year visiting people. If every team gains an average of one person each time they preach the gospel, they will gain two hundred eight people within one year. This would be wonderful! When a person engages in business, teaching, or a profession, he cannot succeed if his labor is inconsistent and intermittent. To be successful one must be regular, consistent, and continual.</p>
<p>In the process of door-knocking, we should not aim at being fast. Sometimes the Lord may be merciful to us and give us a son of peace, one who has a very good response, at the first door we knock on. In this case, we should not leave too quickly but should talk with him for as long as two hours. We can talk with him about heaven, earth, God, the Spirit, the Savior, or any other matter. As long as we do not annoy him, we should talk with him earnestly. According to the saying, we should &ldquo;strike while the iron is hot.&rdquo; We must grasp the opportunity to work. Our experiments have produced fruit; this is why we have the assurance to endeavor to go on.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO HELP THE NEW ONES<br />
BY ESTABLISHING MEETINGS IN THEIR HOMES</h2>
<p>If a team of three gains one new one every week, the team should take care of these new ones. It is easy for three people to take care of a home meeting. After a second week, they may gain another one. Then there will be two new ones. A week later they may gain another one, and thus there will be three new ones. As they gain more and more people, there will be a need for them to bring other brothers and sisters with them, who can begin to take care of the home meetings. In a church of one hundred people, twenty-five may knock on doors, and another fifteen to twenty-five may go with the door-knocking ones to take care of the home meetings. This should be easy for the saints to do because the price is relatively small. Moreover, since a home meeting has a fixed time and place, the saints simply need to join themselves to those who have been door-knocking.</p>
<p>After those who knock on doors have gained a good number of people, they should then bring some brothers and sisters who can take care of the home meetings. In this way they can have face-to-face fellowship with the new ones who need the care. The door-knocking saints can introduce their brothers and sisters to the new ones by saying, &ldquo;These are our brothers and sisters in the church. We three have gained many people through door-knocking, and we cannot take care of everyone. As a result, we have asked these brothers and sisters to help us. We want to introduce you to them. They will take care of you from now on.&rdquo; In this way, those under their care will be handed over to others. This is truly feasible.</p>
<p>One matter we need to pay attention to is that the first home meeting should be longer. If possible, within the first month we should have ten home meetings with the new ones; we may visit them every three days for ten times. These ten visits will be truly effective. After the first month, we may be able to reduce our visits to once a week; then after approximately three months, they will be brought into the church life. If three months are not enough, half a year may be sufficient. The new ones should first be brought into the home meetings; then through the small group meetings, they may be brought to the district meetings. This can be done within half a year.</p>
<p>We need to realize that if we are able to bring a person into the church life within half a year, this will have a very positive impact on the church life. In this way we will save much manpower so that many can continue to knock on doors and gain many more people. Based on these figures, if we are consistent, we will reap a hundredfold increase; that is, we will double our number within one year. Even if we do not double our number, a thirtyfold increase would be very good.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>After much study and discussion, we can say that we have come to the definite conclusion that preaching the gospel by visiting people and knocking on doors is the proper way. The result of preaching the gospel in this way depends upon how we labor; this way definitely works and is by comparison the most effective way. After people have been visited and baptized, there is no other way that will cause them to grow in life as steadily as the home meetings. Consequently, we need further study in this matter. Human beings are living; they are not pieces of wood. If this way does not work, we will step back and find another way. Whatever the case, we will gradually find a way. All of us need to practice in our localities according to what has been fellowshipped. Regardless of the way we use, we need to be flexible; that is, we cannot be rigid and unchangeable. For instance, if what we practice this week does not work well, we will need to adjust our way the following week. Even after we have adjusted to the right way, we still need to observe it over a period of time.</p>
<p>In short, the responsible brothers in all the churches need to promote this matter; however, they should not force the brothers and sisters but should exhort, lead, and encourage them. Not everyone in the church needs to be involved in visiting people. It is good if twenty, thirty, or even forty are able to go out, while the rest bear the responsibility to pray much for the saints visiting the new ones. In this way they can give themselves in prayer to the way that God has ordained. We need to let the saints know that if they do not go out to visit people, they can still participate; we are in one corporate move. Those who stay behind to pray need those who visit the new ones, and those who visit the new ones need those who stay behind to pray. This can be likened to the time of David in the Old Testament when some went out to fight on the battlefield, while others stayed home for defense; both aspects are necessary. In this way the whole church will be brought into one practice, which will gradually become the &ldquo;family tradition&rdquo; of preaching the gospel among the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>This does not mean that this is the only way to preach the gospel. There are many ways to preach the gospel, but in comparison, this way is the most effective. As long as we are willing to pay the price and spend time and energy, we will surely gain people. While we are not sure if any other way is effective in gaining people, this way is definitely effective in gaining people; however, this way also demands paying the greatest price. Other ways to preach the gospel do not require as high of a price; this way surely requires paying a high price.</p>
<p>I hope that when the elders fellowship with the saints regarding this matter, they would fellowship with them in a thorough manner, and at the same time they would work out a definite way for the saints. At the beginning they should explain to the brothers and sisters that their going out to visit people and preach the gospel is to consecrate themselves not only to the church but also to the Lord and that the responsible brothers in the church will assist them, help them, and perfect them. In this way everyone will gradually be on the right track, and the way that God has ordained will become the atmosphere among us. If all the churches work hard in this endeavor, this practice will certainly become our &ldquo;family tradition&rdquo; within a year.</p>
<p>The churches in the different localities can set the time for the prayer meeting and home meetings according to their particular need. These matters can be determined in accordance with the particular situation of a locality. The important thing is that there must be a group of saints who knock on doors. This group of saints is a crucial link without which hardly anyone will be added to the church. If we want the church to have an increase in number, there must be this link, and among those who are brought in by this group, at least one-third will remain. If one hundred people are gained in this term, at least thirty will remain in the church life. If we are more diligent, even more people will remain; the percentage of people who remain altogether depends upon our diligence.</p>
<p>If we visit and take care of people continually, it will be rare for people to make excuses and withdraw. This way is certain and workable, and it guarantees an increase and multiplication. This way must be built up among us. I hope that we will constantly pray for the churches in Taiwan to practice and promote this matter. We desire to see that the number of people in the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will have a significant increase from 1988 onward and that this matter will build up a kind of atmosphere, a &ldquo;family tradition,&rdquo; in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ELDERS NEEDING TO LEAD THE SAINTS<br />
TO PRACTICE THE WAY ORDAINED BY THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW TESTAMENT PAYING ATTENTION<br />
TO THREE MATTERS&mdash;<br />
TRUTH, LIFE, AND THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>If we read the New Testament carefully, we will see that what the New Testament reveals and pays attention to is summed up in three matters: truth, life, and the gospel. Truth is for life, and life is for the gospel. Truth comes first, then life, and then the gospel. However, in our concept and even in our practice of the church life, we unconsciously place the gospel in a low position. We may think that expounding mysterious truths is something high and profound, whereas we often regard the gospel as something ordinary and low. For example, when a church decides to preach the gospel, the elders may say, &ldquo;Let the young people do it.&rdquo; This demonstrates that they do not consider the gospel to be an important matter.</p>
<p>If someone can minister life to us in a rich way, we regard him highly, yet I am afraid that for the past several decades few among us have been desirous of producing results in the gospel. We would rather pursue truth or life. Both are considered to be of nearly equal importance among us. Some may regard life more than truth, and others may regard truth more than life, but very few regard the gospel more than life or truth.</p>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; record in the Gospels places an equal importance on truth, life, and the gospel. Although the gospel is listed last, it is neither for life nor for truth; rather, truth and life are for the gospel. Without truth, there is no life; without life, there is no gospel because the gospel is a matter of fruit-bearing. The gospel depends not only on preaching and teaching but also on a fruit-bearing life as seen in John 15. Among the four Gospels the Gospel of John is the only book that does not conclude with the Lord Jesus saying that we need to preach the gospel to the nations or that we need to proclaim to the nations repentance for the forgiveness of sins. Rather, in chapter 15 the Lord said, &ldquo;I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit&rdquo; (v. 16). Here the Lord Jesus does not exhort us to preach the gospel but to bear fruit. Actually, fruit-bearing is the genuine gospel preaching. Without fruit-bearing, our gospel preaching equals zero.</p>
<p>The experience of the saints and the church in the past two thousand years proves that since the passing of the apostles, there has never been a similar group of people who twined together the three cords of truth, life, and the gospel. The Bible says that when three cords are twined together, they are strong and reliable (Eccl. 4:12). Regrettably, within the past two thousand years we cannot find a single group of people, apart from the apostles, that blended together truth, life, and the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SOME DEVELOPMENTS IN CHURCH HISTORY</h2>
<p>The ten centuries, between A.D. 500 and 1500, that preceded the Reformation, which was initiated by Martin Luther, are known as the Dark Ages. This was the time when the Roman Catholic Church flourished. By A.D. 600 the papal system was fully recognized by the churches in both the West and the East. Then for nearly ten centuries the Roman Catholic Church dominated the Western church. This lasted until the Reformation.</p>
<p>During these ten centuries, some pursued the Lord, but for the most part, they remained hidden and unknown in history. Eventually E. H. Broadbent, a historian among the Brethren, discovered them and researched their hidden history, finding that there were hidden overcomers throughout these ten centuries. He said that there are two lines in church history: an outward history and a hidden history. The hidden Christians, however, are small in number. Even if we try to more fully investigate their history, we will not be able to find out much; however, we can see that the flow of the Holy Spirit was with a small number of hidden overcomers. They were not visible on the surface of history. Only the activities of the Catholic Church are visible. After the Reformation many groups were raised up. They were released from the Catholic Church and were no longer restricted, bound, or controlled by her. As a result, they began to develop on their own.</p>
<p>In preaching the truth of justification by faith, Luther was truly a hero; he testified of this truth and did not fear death. However, when he faced the matter of the church, he was weak and powerless; eventually, he was protected by a German prince. Out of his weakness the so-called state churches were born. The first Protestant state church was the Lutheran Church in Germany. It is still the principal state church of Germany. German citizens are required to pay a church tax. To be exempted from paying the church tax, one has to obtain permission by filing a special application, stating the reasons. Since Germany has a state church, German citizens are members and must pay a church tax.</p>
<p>Following Germany, England established a state church. Today the Queen of England is the head of the Church of England. Every British citizen, even if he is not of British descent, can become a member of the Anglican Church upon obtaining British citizenship. One after another the state churches continued to appear in many northern European countries. Today Denmark and Sweden both have state churches. This is certainly not according to the Bible. During the period of time following the Reformation, there have been two principal state churches: the Lutheran Church and the Anglican Church, or the Church of England, both of which are very similar in practice to the Roman Catholic Church. Like the Roman Catholic Church, many of their practices are not in accordance with the Bible.</p>
<p>Gradually, a number of Christian groups were raised up. One of the first among these groups was the Baptist denomination, a group very much inclined toward the truth. Although Luther had recovered the truth of justification by faith, the brothers in the Baptist Church felt that this was merely a beginning and were not satisfied; therefore, they advanced further to recover the truth of baptism by immersion. They then established the Baptist Church, claiming that baptism by immersion was an exceedingly great truth. This is the origin of the Baptist Church. Furthermore, another group of brothers realized that the church must be administrated by a presbytery, a group of elders, appointed by God. These brothers founded the Presbyterian Church under the administration of a presbytery. Later, the Holiness Church came into existence; this group preceded a group led by John Wesley. First there was the establishment of state churches and then the formation of private churches. This situation is similar to people establishing schools, some being public and some being private.</p>
<p>After the private churches, a number of brothers appeared and grew in number until the appearance of the Moravian Brethren. This was their most flourishing time. These brothers had all been under persecution from the state churches. Germany, in particular, persecuted those in the private churches and prevented them from gaining a foothold in northern Europe. In Saxony, in the south of Germany, a brother named Zinzendorf opened up his estate and took in many believers. These brothers brought in a revival. Together, they made progress in the practice of the church life but did not fully recover the practice of the church life. This great revival occurred in approximately 1730. Later most of the Moravian Brethren immigrated to North America, the newly discovered continent, and spread the Lord&rsquo;s testimony there.</p>
<p>A century later, the Brethren, a well-known group that included brothers such as John Nelson Darby, were raised up. They advanced much further than those in the past and came close to a full recovery in regard to the practicality of the church, the testimony and truth of the church, and the practice of the church life. However, we should not regard them too highly because they did not achieve a complete recovery. Later, the Brethren were divided into many sects.</p>
<p>This history shows how complicated the present situation of the church has become. There are not only state churches and private churches, but out of the private churches, prevailing groups of brothers were raised up. These brothers were of two different stages: an early stage including the Moravian Brethren and a latter stage involving the British Brethren.</p>
<p>In addition to state churches, private churches, and the two stages of the Brethren, a few further situations emerged. The first situation to emerge was that of the mystics. The mystics were in the Roman Catholic Church and were a reaction to the Reformation, which Luther initiated against the Catholic Church. Some believers who experienced the Reformation eventually felt a great sense of emptiness corresponding to the Lord&rsquo;s word to the church in Sardis: &ldquo;You have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead...for I have found none of your works completed before My God&rdquo; (Rev. 3:1-2). As a result, those who loved and pursued the Lord in the Catholic Church rose up to pursue the inner life and forsook the outward forms. Although they knew the errors of the Catholic Church, they were still completely submissive to it. When persecuted by the Catholic Church, they submitted to and acknowledged the authority of the pope. Madame Guyon, one of the mystics, had deep experiences of the inner life. However, her autobiography shows that she also prayed before the statue of the child Jesus. It is difficult for us to imagine this, yet it shows her weakness. The matter of the inner life developed out of the mystics&rsquo; experience. These inner-life believers made adjustments to matters in mysticism, making mysticism more practical.</p>
<p>The first bridge in this development was William Law, a British brother. Many people respected the inner-life believers and received help from them. Andrew Murray and Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis were the most well-known of the inner-life believers. Later there was Brother T. Austin-Sparks. We had contact with Brother Austin-Sparks and observed his condition. After the passing away of Brother Austin-Sparks, the inner-life movement ceased to exist and came to a complete end. Both the mystics and the inner-life movement have come to an end.</p>
<p>Regarding the inner-life movement, there was a side branch, that is, the renowned Keswick Convention, held in England. Although those involved in the Keswick Convention apparently belonged to the inner-life group, they are not as orthodox; rather, they are a side branch. This group of believers received considerable attention in the latter half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century. Those with some attainment in truth and life were invited to speak at the convention, and as a result, this group was prevailing for a period of time. When I first came to America, more than twenty years ago, this group of believers was still well known and had branch meetings in various places within the United States. In the past twenty years, however, according to our observation, they have been gradually vanishing.</p>
<p>This fellowship enables us to draw the conclusion that the Bible reveals that truth, life, and the gospel are a threefold cord; truth is for life, and life is for fruit-bearing, for the gospel. The proper condition is to have all three in proper relationship to one another; nevertheless, after the passing of the apostles, the church became desolate. Hence, the matters of truth, life, and the gospel were thoroughly obscured. The truth became unclear, the matter of life became blurry, and the matter of the gospel became indistinct. Later the Roman Catholic Church further caused the situation to become even more unclear. Eventually God came in to begin His work of recovery. From that time onward, He has been doing His recovery work, little by little.</p>
<p>We are preceded by all those previously mentioned. As those who come later, we are able to read history. Being able to read history is our greatest privilege. If we had been born in the era of the Three Kingdoms in Chinese history, we would have lived our whole life in ignorance. Now, because we have been born many centuries after the time of the Three Kingdoms, our eyes are clear, and we are able to scrutinize everything done by people in the past centuries. We can analyze the historical figures one by one and can clearly distinguish the good and the evil. Later, those who come after us will judge us. Our history will be written based upon how we live in ordinary times; we are accountable to history. What people say about us today, whether good or bad, may not be reliable; we need to wait for history to evaluate us.</p>
<p>Under the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement, I was born into organized Christianity. I followed my mother to meet in the Baptist Church, but I was sprinkled in the Church of Christ in China. After I was saved, I loved the truth, the Bible, and I began to pursue the Lord. Whether in China, Europe, or America, everyone knew that the Brethren were famous for their knowledge of the Bible. Since I wanted to study the truth seriously, I found a Brethren assembly in Chefoo that was five minutes from where I lived.</p>
<p>No one came to knock on my door; it was I who intruded into the meetings of the Brethren assembly. This was because those in the Brethren assembly never went out to find people; even if they were home and someone knocked on their door, they would not want to open the door. According to my memory, during the seven and a half years that I spent with them, I never saw another person intrude into their meetings as I did. They did not go out to invite people, and they would ignore those who came to knock on their door. They certainly expounded the truth, but their practice was to wait for people to come voluntarily to them.</p>
<p>During the seven and a half years that I met with them, I saw fewer than twenty people baptized there; I was one of them. Not long after I began to meet with them, they began to notice me, a young person, and investigated my background thoroughly, but none of them came to fellowship with me or contact me. For at least five years, beginning in 1925, I listened to their sermons. One day they said that they were going to baptize people in the sea, but they still did not pay attention to me. I simply decided on my own to be baptized, so I brought some clothes and went with them. Of course, when they saw me, they were happy and baptized me. This was the condition of the Brethren at that time. I am sharing this so that we will all be on the alert. I am afraid that we also may be entering into this kind of condition. We must be careful regarding this matter.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BEGINNING OF THE CHURCH&rsquo;S<br />
PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Out of my desire for the truth and my study and pursuit of the truth, I came into contact with Brother Nee&rsquo;s books and eventually joined Brother Nee in Shanghai. When the Sino-Japanese war began, I went north to bring my family out, but I fell into the hands of the Japanese and was not able to come out. In the meantime, Brother Nee withdrew with the national government to Chungking, which was far from the war front. Since we had no way to contact one another, I stayed in Chefoo. The church in Chefoo was gradually revived. In 1940 we began to speak of one matter&mdash;the church&rsquo;s preaching of the gospel. This was a new thing. The expression <em>the church&rsquo;s preaching of the gospel</em> had never been heard before. From 1932 to 1940, we had never seen more than fifteen people baptized at one time, and we considered it wonderful if ten people were baptized at the same time. However, if I remember correctly, thirty-seven were baptized the first time we, as the church, preached the gospel. Not only so, we later baptized one hundred on the same day.</p>
<p>Our gospel meetings during the Chinese New Year were called &ldquo;the church&rsquo;s preaching of the gospel.&rdquo; At this time, the whole church was energized to preach the gospel. The Chinese New Year, also known as the Lunar New Year Festival, is the celebration that the Chinese enjoy the most; it is the greatest feast of the year and lasts for almost a week. People did not have to work for a week; instead, they ate, drank, played, made merry, and watched operas all day long. The food they ate during the celebration was not freshly prepared but had all been prepared a month in advance, and there were all varieties of food. In northern China there was no need to use refrigerators because many families had cellars, in which they stored and froze the food that they had prepared. Whenever they needed food, they would take it from the cellars. This festival was a great opportunity to preach the gospel extensively because people were not occupied with anything else. At that time all the saints, whether brothers or sisters, whether young or old, were mobilized and went out in groups to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>To preach the gospel, we asked the brothers and sisters to first invite their relatives, such as their uncles and aunts, to their house for a few days during the New Year&rsquo;s celebration. Furthermore, in the homes of the saints there was a slogan: &ldquo;Not celebrating the New Year, only preaching the gospel.&rdquo; Celebrating the new year was a great thing; the preparation of food alone required a tremendous amount of time. Since our purpose was not to celebrate the New Year, we did not have to purchase anything pertaining to the festival; this saved us a great deal of time and money. For New Year&rsquo;s Eve, which was supposed to be a time of great merriment to the northern Chinese, we announced that it would be a night for fasting and praying. The whole church fasted and prayed specifically for the gospel. Although we ourselves fasted, we still prepared food for our friends and relatives who stayed with us. Then on New Year&rsquo;s Day, we had a gospel meeting in the morning and a second gospel meeting in the afternoon; there was no meeting in the evening. We met in this way for four consecutive days. After each meeting, the adults would contact the newcomers, and the children handed them prayer mats. Whenever the children saw that someone was ready to kneel down and pray, they would immediately pass a prayer mat to that person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEGLECTING THE GOSPEL RESULTING IN<br />
NO CONTINUATION OF SPIRITUAL DESCENDANTS</h2>
<p>The church preached the gospel in this way for a year, and as a result, people were baptized continually over a period of about six months. Approximately one hundred people were baptized in each of the first three to four months, and about twenty to thirty were baptized in each of the last three to four months. This had never happened before. This kind of gospel preaching resulted in a breakthrough in the number of people baptized. Hence, according to our observation, regardless of how much people pay attention to truth and life, if they neglect the gospel, they will not have any spiritual descendants. History also confirms this point. For example, the Brethren paid much attention to the truth, but because they did not pay attention to the gospel, they have few spiritual descendants today. In my youth I pursued and loved the truth and appreciated the Brethren&rsquo;s teaching of the truth; they were especially good at expounding the types and prophecies. To this day I am still grateful to the Brethren teachers because their expositions have been a great help to me. When I was with them, however, I did not see their weak point. It was not until I saw the matter of the gospel that I realized that the way the Brethren take does not work and is not right.</p>
<p>The Brethren assembly in my hometown of Chefoo had a history of over sixty years. The leading brother was an elderly brother from England, by the name of Mr. Burnet. He taught and preached personally because he was the only one who had been taught directly by Benjamin Newton. At that time I was twenty, and he was over sixty; he did all the preaching. He expounded the truth clearly and thoroughly in Chinese, and everyone who heard him was impressed. Brother Wang Ming-tao, who was raised up by the Lord in Beijing, was also helped by him. Brother Wang originally was not clear regarding several matters of the truth. For example, he believed in observing the Sabbath, not the Lord&rsquo;s Day. He later came to Chefoo and met Mr. Burnet. After having some fellowship with this elderly brother for a period of time, his concept concerning the Sabbath was adjusted.</p>
<p>This indicates that Mr. Burnet was a lighthouse of the truth in northern China. Although the denominations did not like him, all those who pursued the truth appreciated him. The Brethren, however, emphasized the truth too much and neglected all other matters. Even though they had been in Chefoo for several decades, they did not raise up another local assembly. In terms of numbers, they had at most two hundred people on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and less than one hundred on other days. I later realized that this is not the right way. No matter how strong their truth was, there was still a great lack because they did not preach the gospel. At that time they strongly condemned the Presbyterian Church; nevertheless, the Presbyterian Church had many more gospel activities than the Brethren. The Presbyterian Church was always active in the gospel, whether by visiting the villages or spreading the gospel within the community. This was the situation at that time.</p>
<p>At that time the Pentecostal movement also came to China and became prevailing in the north. After this &ldquo;wind&rdquo; blew into China, it was difficult not to be influenced by it. Hence, a few of our brothers had contact with them and observed their situation. The first to contact them was Brother Philip Luan. He was originally a member of the Far East Missionary Society, which was founded by the husband of the sister who wrote <em>Streams in the Dessert.</em> Brother Luan was from the northeast; it was there that he contacted the Far East Missionary Society and became a member. Later he came into our midst. He was the first to have contact with the Pentecostal movement. Later, more of us began to have personal contact with the people in that movement; we can say that it is from them that we learned of the Pentecostal movement.</p>
<p>I was born into organized Christianity, and I was edified by the Brethren in the aspect of the truth. I was helped the most by the inner life believers in regard to the aspect of life. In addition, I had contact with the Pentecostal movement. All three groups were unable to agree with one another. The Brethren did not agree with Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis; hence, although they appreciated Brother Nee&rsquo;s writings, when they discovered that he quoted part of Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis&rsquo;s writings in <em>TheSpiritual Man,</em> they were no longer interested in his books. From this we see that those who focus on the truth tend to ignore life, whereas those who focus on life tend to despise the truth, saying that the truth is merely dead letters.</p>
<p>One of the famous brothers among the inner-life believers was Andrew Murray. He could be considered one of its founders. Sometimes he would quote the wrong verses or expound the verses inaccurately. Although his experience was correct and his facts were also correct, he often quoted wrong verse references. Based on this, the Brethren said that Andrew Murray knew neither the Bible nor the truth. Those who study the truth always accuse one another and cannot tolerate one another. This incompatible situation often exists between those who emphasize truth and those who emphasize life.</p>
<p>If we pay attention only to truth but neglect to preach the gospel, we will not have offspring; similarly, if we pay attention only to life but do not preach the gospel, we will not have a continuation. Later evangelicals, including the charismatic movement, appeared. A Chinese evangelist called John Sung was quite famous among the Western missionaries. When he preached the gospel, there were often several thousand people listening to him, and people were saved by the hundreds. However, his gospel had neither truth nor life. For instance, to illustrate the effectiveness of &ldquo;the precious blood washing one&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; he would cite the story of the woman with a flow of blood; this is altogether unscriptural. Hence, not much was left after his passing. This demonstrates that without truth and life our gospel preaching does not last. Truth, life, and the gospel must be twined together as a threefold cord; only then will our gospel preaching produce lasting results.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

TO PRACTICE THE WAY ORDAINED BY THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:25</h1>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING MODERATION<br />
FOR OUR DAILY NECESSITIES AND<br />
NOT FALLING INTO THE SNARE OF THE WORLD</h2>
<p>When a person becomes thirty years old, he steps into middle age, into a time of change. At this time, both the Lord and the world are competing for him; this is the time that decides whether he will be used by the Lord or by the world. The Lord said, &ldquo;No one can serve two masters&rdquo; (Matt. 6:24). This does not mean that every elder should drop his job completely; nevertheless, we should at least allocate our time and give the world only a certain amount of our time.</p>
<p>In other words, if someone does not have a clear leading and burden from the Lord to drop his job and serve the Lord full time, he should keep his job. However, he should not give all of his time to the world; otherwise, he will fall under the hand of Pharaoh in Egypt. The Bible says that no one can serve two masters; it does not require us to drop our jobs, but if we have a job, we should budget our time. As long as we have enough to feed our family and take care of our children&rsquo;s education, we should exercise restraint and not fall into the snare of the world.</p>
<p>Through years of observation, we have seen a great number of people throughout the world wasting all of their time in the world. To waste their time in the world is to waste their time in relation to their living. For instance, cars are a means of transportation; they do not need to be high-class or expensive; as long as they serve the purpose of providing us transportation, it is sufficient. If a car valued at thirty thousand dollars is more than sufficient for our use, why do we want to buy a car that is worth a hundred thousand dollars and for which we must work hard to come up with a way to earn the one hundred thousand dollars? If we do this, whatever we earn will eventually be spent. Some people buy a new car every year; in the end, in order to buy a new car every year, they must work to the point of exhaustion. This also applies to the purchase of houses and clothing. In principle, we should always exercise moderation. If we blindly pursue and are particular in our taste regarding these items, we will continually fall into a snare.</p>
<p>We should practice being frugal and thrifty for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. May the Lord cover me with His blood; the suit I am wearing today was made in 1968, the year of our first international conference. I have been wearing this suit for twenty years. It still looks quite new and does not look like it is twenty years old. My wife always wants me to buy another suit, but I think this suit is good enough and ask for her forgiveness. If our Lord is false and if our service is merely a secondary occupation, then nothing matters. However, if our Lord is real and the words in the Bible are also real, we need to consider how we will face the true and living Lord.</p>
<p>The Bible says that one day our Lord will come and settle an account with us. In Matthew 25 He told a parable of a master who delivered his possessions to his slaves: &ldquo;To one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one&rdquo; (v. 15). But the story does not end here; it does not end with the master delivering his possessions to his slaves. Rather, one day, this master returned: &ldquo;Now after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them&rdquo; (v. 19). In this verse it is not merely a matter of rendering accounts but a matter of settling accounts. The Lord will come back to settle accounts with us. How shall we settle our account? This is extremely crucial for us to realize.</p>
<p>For this reason, we repeatedly stress that if the Lord is real, we need to consider whether He is the one who leads us to pursue all the things related to our career, such as promotions, salary raises, and benefits. If the Lord has led us to do so, we will be able to settle our account to Him when we stand before His judgment seat in the future. We will be able to tell Him, &ldquo;Lord, You led me to do this.&rdquo; However, if we will not be able to say this to the Lord, we need to carefully consider the extent to which we should spend our time and energy laboring on our job. We need to set a limit and exercise restraint. Likewise, we should exercise moderation in the matter of our children&rsquo;s studies and in many other things related to our living. This does not mean that we should not care for our living, our family, or our children&rsquo;s education, all of which are proper things. We should live properly and take care of our children&rsquo;s education properly, but in everything we need to exercise restraint and set a limit.</p>
<p>Worldly pleasures are endless, and they are snares to entrap us. Hence, as long as we have enough to support ourselves, we should exercise restraint. The Bible says explicitly, &ldquo;Having food and covering, with these we will be content&rdquo; (1 Tim. 6:8). In other words, as long as we have food to sustain our life and clothes to cover our bodies, we should be satisfied. We are not here to serve mammon or our stomach; rather, we serve the true and living Lord because He loves us. We will meet Him one day; hence, today we all need to seek His will and ask Him, &ldquo;Lord, to what extent do You want me to work? Lord, as an elder in the church, I need to take care of Your church.&rdquo; We all need to have this kind of transaction with the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">ELDERS NEEDING TO PUT IN THE TIME<br />
FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We will soon have a training for the working saints, and our principal burden is to speak this word to the young saints. It is absolutely right for us to have an occupation, but we should never fall into its temptation or be ensnared by it. We need to see that everything related to our occupation, such as making money, promotions, and attaining high positions, is a big temptation. People in the world, whether they are going to school or holding a job, all aim for one thing&mdash;to gain a place in society. As a result, everyone is aggressive, working restlessly. We too may fall into this condition. We cannot deny that society today is very competitive, and living in it, we must compete, yet we should also know when to stop. We need to realize that it is impossible for us to lead the church if we do not put in the time.</p>
<p>The rise or fall of the church rests fully with the elders. As elders, you must put in the time. In regard to the responsible brothers in Taipei, I hope that at least one-fourth would serve full time. In other words, out of over eighty elders, at least twenty should serve full time. If more than twenty elders in Taipei would serve full time, I believe that the church in Taipei would certainly have a new appearance.</p>
<p>Everything we do requires time. Consider our literature work. The brothers who serve with me in preparing messages know that often after we have finalized a manuscript, I will change a word the next morning, then in the afternoon I will change another word, and again in the evening I will change another word. Word by word changes are added. Consequently, the brothers have asked me, &ldquo;Should we wait until all the changes are made before we send it for printing?&rdquo; In response, I told them that I did not know when I would finish making changes; there is no end to my polishing. This is similar to a carpenter making a table; he is able to continually pare the wood. This paring can be without end and depends on how much money people will pay him; the more money they pay him, the smoother he will pare the wood. This is a matter of paying a price; it all depends on how much we are willing to pay and how much time we are willing to spend. In like manner, there is no end to the literature work. If you asked me to polish the hymns I wrote, there would be much to polish; it all depends on our time and skill at refining.</p>
<p>The elders&rsquo; administrating of the church also requires much time; their labor will not be sufficient if they administrate the church in the same way public employees work for the government. If the elders go to their jobs and demand a high performance from themselves in order to compete for promotions and salary raises, and then they rush to take care of the meetings after work, they will not be able to administrate the church well. This is similar to a carpenter paring the wood only a few times. This will enable him to give the wood a rough shape but not to make it nice and smooth. If we labor in this way, the church under our care will be rough and coarse, because we are not serving the church in a way that is proper, thorough, or self-forsaking. The way I carry out the literature work is that I almost neglect to sleep and eat. When meal times come, my wife always urges me to eat. Although I often say yes, I cannot put my pen down.</p>
<p>My purpose in sharing this is so that the elders would realize that if we do not have time or put in the time, we will not accomplish anything. What is more precious to us today&mdash;the Lord or other things? The future depends on how we make the comparison and choice; we need to consider what is worth all of our time and even our whole life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VAST NEED TODAY</h2>
<p>Actually, according to need, even if half of the elders in Taipei began serving full time, it would not be sufficient. The door in Taipei is open so wide that even if all the elders served full time, it would not be sufficient. Consider that over four thousand are meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning in twenty-three different halls. If all the elders, over eighty of them, were to serve full time, how different the impact would be!</p>
<p>Besides the more than four thousand who meet on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, there are over six thousand who meet in other meetings. Moreover, there are at least twenty-five thousand saints not being cared for. We have gained thirty thousand through door-knocking, but we are able to take care of only eight thousand. Hence, many people still need our care, and they all have open doors. In the past, when the missionaries came to China to preach the gospel, they would have been overjoyed if they were able to persuade the home of one Chinese family to open to them. Today people not only open their doors to us but also let us baptize them in water. This is not a small matter, regardless of whether or not they are clear concerning their salvation. If all the elders of the church in Taipei in all the different halls were able to serve full time, they would be able to take the brothers and sisters to visit these ones, and I believe that half of them would be brought back.</p>
<p>The problem is that no one has the time to do it. The elders need to allot their time; if they do not allot their time, there will be no way. No matter how much they love the Lord, if all of the elders are busy with the affairs of the world, there will not be a way for the church to go on. The elders need to put in their time, perhaps even all of their time. Since they are already in the position of elders, they should do what pertains to their position; the reason that they have not done what they ought to is a lack of time. We all need to pray to the Lord that we may give our time. According to the present situation, even if there were five hundred elders who served full time, much less the ones we have presently, it would not be enough to meet the need. The more we stay away from a task, the less there is to do, but the more we get into it, the more there is to do. For instance, when someone tells me about a certain need, I usually ask him to wait for half a year and I will give him a reply when I have more time; however, when half a year has passed, I find that I am even busier. We can never run out of work; once we engage in a work, we will have more and more work to do.</p>
<p>The Lord has definitely opened a door to us, and many have seen this; in the past twenty years the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have spread over the whole earth. Perhaps, other people may think that our way of preaching the gospel is superior, but inwardly we sense that we still have a long way to go. The reason that we are somewhat flourishing today is that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has the truth, and our truth has the proper ground. This ground may be likened to a Chinese saying: &ldquo;Fighting a war with a just cause.&rdquo; Since Dr. Sun Yat-sen fought with a just cause, he was successful in the Revolution of 1911. This means that when his word went out, no one could refute it. He was right in regard to democracy, politics, and the governmental system. Hence, everyone listened to him because he truly &ldquo;fought the war with a just cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our ground, our truth, and the new way are all proper. We are truly &ldquo;fighting a war with a just cause.&rdquo; The problem is that we who are fighting in this war have not done enough. If we would do what is adequate, the entire church would be in an excellent condition. In regard to the church in Taipei, it is not too much for it to gain one or two hundred thousand people. It would be better if we could gain five hundred thousand. However, this is still not even one-tenth of the entire population of Taipei. In other words, less than one in ten Taiwanese are Christians; this is not enough. Thus, we need to give more of ourselves and our time to lead people to salvation.</p>
<p>If, as full-time serving ones, the elders want to be &ldquo;presidents,&rdquo; &ldquo;deans,&rdquo; or &ldquo;department heads&rdquo; in the church, this is wrong. In the church there is no room for presidents, deans, or department heads; there are no such positions. However, what they can do is knock on doors and find the thirty thousand who were saved recently. If all of these people were brought back and perfected, many more branches and leaves would be brought forth from them because all of them have relatives. In this way we can gain another thirty or forty thousand. This &ldquo;chain reaction&rdquo; of bringing people to salvation will be great. Hence, if all the elders would rise up, their hands would be full. The time required to take care of these new ones depends on the actual situation; all of these matters take time.</p><h2 class="head1">ELDERS NEEDING TO LEAD THE NEW ONES<br />
TO JOIN GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Those Who Take Care of Meetings in the Homes<br />
Needing to Establish Group Meetings<br />
at Any Time and at Any Place according to Need</h2>
<p>In the past, group meetings were established through arrangements made by elders, but it does not have to be this way. Those who take care of the home meetings usually take care of several such meetings. These ones should gather together several neighboring homes whose condition is not bad and meet with them. Group meetings can be established at any time and at any place according to need.</p>
<h2 class="head2">There Being No Regulations or Forms,<br />
with Everything Being Done<br />
according to Environment and Need</h2>
<p>For the group meetings we do not need any kind of regulation or form; rather, we should do everything according to environment and need. The meeting does not have to start at 7:30 P.M.; if some want to come earlier, they can come at seven o&rsquo;clock; if some cannot come early because they need to take care of matters at home or get off work late, they can come at eight, eight-thirty, or even nine o&rsquo;clock. Once there is a form and a set time for meeting, few will come. Therefore, we need to be flexible with the time and lead them gradually to be consistent; sooner or later, they will be on track.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Those Leading the Group Meetings<br />
Needing to Exercise to Direct the Content<br />
of the Meeting, and There Being a Need<br />
to Have Some Ministry of the Word Each Time</h2>
<p>Those who take the lead in the group meetings need to exercise to direct the meeting, that is, to bear the responsibility for the meeting. They need to give the brothers and sisters freedom, yet at the same time they need to know inwardly to what extent they should give the saints the freedom. They should be in control of the &ldquo;rudder.&rdquo; If they give the saints too much freedom, the saints may begin chatting about all sorts of subjects, and there are many conversations that may not be appropriate. Hence, we must &ldquo;hold the reins&rdquo; and &ldquo;direct the rudder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meeting we should not stop or rebuke others; these matters all depend on how we lead. If at a certain point we see that the meeting is going off track, we may read a portion in the Scriptures, pray, or even choose a short hymn to sing; in this way, we prevent the meeting from going off track. Habitual control puts people under bondage. It is best if we can let the brothers and sisters meet together spontaneously, while we are &ldquo;directing the rudder&rdquo;; this is not easy to do and requires much learning. I hope that all the trainees will learn how to do this. If they do not learn this, they will not be able to lead the group meetings successfully, and it will be even more difficult if we later want to hand over the meetings to the local brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Often in group meetings there are two different views of the situation. On the one hand, those who are older or who follow strict regulations may feel that the meeting is nonsensical and inappropriate if everyone is chatting aimlessly and there are no limits that control the situation. This kind of view is not good, because it nullifies the purpose of group meetings. On the other hand, some immature saints may join in the chatting because they may feel that it is quite good. Eventually, everyone is chatting. This view is also not good, because it too causes the group meetings to lose their purpose. Hence, we all need to be exercised in this matter. On one hand, we should not control the brothers and sisters, and on the other hand, we need to learn to &ldquo;direct the rudder&rdquo; in the meetings.</p>
<p>To direct the content of a small group meeting requires having something of the Lord&rsquo;s word to minister at every time. Regardless of how long the speaking may be or how it is carried out, we need to hold to this principle. Every time we have a group meeting, we need to have some amount of the ministry of the Lord&rsquo;s word. Only the Lord&rsquo;s word is able to supply people, even if it lasts for just five or ten minutes, because only the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit and are life. Every time the Lord&rsquo;s word enters into people, it is like sowing seeds or injecting medicine. When people come to our meetings, we need to inject them with the &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; they need so that they may be supplied and healed. If there are &ldquo;germs&rdquo; within them, we need to consider all the more how to inject them with the proper &ldquo;medicine.&rdquo; In this way we will be able to kill the germs and supply them with the necessary nutrients. We must have a firm grasp of the truth.</p>
<p>All the brothers and sisters should diligently learn how to take care of home meetings and lead group meetings. We need to learn to &ldquo;direct the rudder&rdquo; and meet the need. In this way, every time we meet with the new ones, they will receive the benefit. Otherwise, we may visit the new ones and meet with them many times, yet they will be the same as before. If we visit and meet with the new ones for three months consecutively and they remain the same, this means that we have not met the need and that we have labored in vain. We all need to exercise in this matter. The elders in all the churches should also learn this, and at the same time, they should take the lead to train the saints in their localities and let them know that it is not enough to simply spend time to visit people but that the saints need to lead the meetings properly. Otherwise, not only will the saints be discouraged, but others will not want to come to the meetings anymore. Therefore, we all need to realize that this is not merely a matter of directing the meetings but also a matter of doing it well. If we are able to do it well, the new way will surely work.</p><h2 class="head2">Group Meetings Needing to Include<br />
Singing and Praying but without Any Form</h2>
<p>We should never let the saints chat and talk endlessly in the group meetings and neglect to sing and pray. This is not proper. We need to sing and pray, but we should not do so in a formal and rigid way. The advantage of group meetings is that they do not have forms; only when there is no form can the new ones feel related to the saints and be drawn to the meeting. In this kind of gathering we can bring the new ones onto the right track by leading them and enabling them to have contact with the saints and gradually bring them into the district meetings. This is to serve them in order to bring them from a small meeting to a larger meeting of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Goal of the Group Meetings Being<br />
to Bring the Believers into Mutual Acquaintance, Fellowship, Encouragement,<br />
Strengthening, Care, and Intercession</h2>
<p>The goal of the group meetings is to bring the believers into the practice of being mutually acquainted, having mutual fellowship, being mutually encouraged, being mutually strengthened, rendering mutual care, and having mutual intercession; this is the goal that we should attain to. Personal testimonies and fellowship concerning actual situations are very beneficial to the attaining of this goal (Heb. 10:25). We should encourage everyone to give their testimonies and share their actual situations. For instance, they can fellowship regarding physical illnesses, family problems, business difficulties, and so forth. However, we also need to exercise some direction in this matter. It does not mean that once we open up, we need to tell everything. For example, someone may be going through a divorce or separation, and it would not be appropriate for him to share with everyone all the things taking place between himself and his wife. We always need to direct the meetings in the way that the saints may fellowship properly. All fellowship is for the purpose of enabling the brothers and sisters to know one another&rsquo;s actual situation and to help and care for one another with a spirit of care.</p>
<p>What is spoken above are some main points in regard to leading the new ones to join the group meetings. It is difficult to practice the group meetings. If an elder learns how to practice the group meetings, he has done quite well. We need to know that a group meeting is a miniature church life, and it is a test to the elders as to their ability to handle different situations and lead well. An elder who is incapable of leading a group meeting is incapable of leading a church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: I am planning to give my time, that is, to serve full time beginning next month. What can I do when I actually begin to serve?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There are many things that you can do. First of all, you should go door-knocking. At present, there are ninety-five districts in Taipei, and if all are faithful to labor in a regular and steady way, by the end of the year every district will be able to produce another district; as a result, there will be nearly two hundred districts. Every district will need at least one elder. Of course, we hope that the elders are strong in every aspect. The northern Chinese like to hire Canton maids because they are very capable. They can handle everything in the house, including cooking and taking care of children; they are famous in northern China. If in the church life a new group is produced every six months, such a group will need an elder as capable as a Canton maid. In this way four hundred districts may be produced in the future.</p>
<p>Every district needs an elder who is strong in speaking, leading, administrating, and caring. When this kind of elder comes to a district, the district will be different. This kind of elder is like a Canton maid. However, Shantung maids are altogether different. Once they finish cooking and put down the wok, they pay no attention to the dirty floor or the crying children; they do not care about anything. Hence, people do not like to hire Shantung maids. We are afraid of elders who are like Shantung maids. Once a district has this kind of elder, it is finished, but if a district has an elder who is like a Canton maid, it will be successful. I hope that every elder among us is like a Canton maid; then the church will be blessed.</p>
<p>If we look at the situation of the district meetings in Taipei, we will see that it would be easy for every district to produce a new district within a year. In fact, if every district has an elder who is like a Canton maid, there will be not only a twofold increase but also an endless and continuous increase. This is why I like the new way. The new way will definitely be a success. We have already seen the first sign of success, and we have also seen some fruit.</p>
<p>In short, we will surely gain people by going out to preach the gospel, provided that everyone labors diligently. Then in order to keep the new ones after we gain them, we need to lead them to establish home meetings and join group meetings. Eventually, we will need to bring them to the district meetings. An important aspect in regard to the district meetings is that the speaking needs to be strengthened. This strengthening relies on the elders being like Canton maids. Without this kind of elder, the meetings will be lacking, but with this kind of elder, the meetings will definitely be rich.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>

<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO PARTICIPATE IN DISTRICT MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Exercising to Function in District Meetings<br />
by Praying, Choosing Hymns, Giving Testimonies, or Reading the Scriptures</h2>
<p>The most crucial point that we want to fellowship in regard to the district meetings is that we should exercise to function in the meetings. This refers not only to elders and co-workers but to all the saints. Elders and co-workers should be the head sheep who take the lead to function in the meetings of the whole church and in the district meetings. They need to function in every meeting. Every meeting lasts approximately one and a half hours, and there is plenty of time and opportunity for the saints to function. These meetings should not be the same as our meetings in the past in which one person spoke and everyone else listened. In the end, one person occupied all the time. In our meetings today, the one and a half hours are for everyone to function. Some may speak something from a hymn, others may share what they have received in their reading of the Bible, and still others may give their personal testimonies or minister the word. A saint may pray at the beginning of the meeting; then after a while, he may call a hymn or simply a chorus. He may then read two verses or speak a few words to point out their significance. It is not too much for a person to function in such a way three to four times in a meeting. The more the saints function in this way, the livelier and richer the meetings will be.</p>
<p>This kind of meeting makes it possible for everyone to function and to not sit quietly in the meetings as we did in the past. Formerly, only a few, if any, shared in the meetings; now we are divided into districts, and the condition of the sharing in the meetings has greatly improved. The functioning of the saints has become more widespread, and the ratio of saints who speak has increased to roughly forty percent. It has not yet reached a hundred percent, but it is definitely an improvement when compared to the past. In any case, an atmosphere in which everyone can function is on the rise.</p>
<p>All the elders need to function in the meetings. There is no excuse for an elder not to open his mouth in a meeting in which everyone functions. Likewise, all the full-time trainees are now learning to serve the churches. Based on the actual situation, the most important aspect in serving the churches is to open one&rsquo;s mouth and function in the meetings. Hence, whether in group meetings or in district meetings, we all need to open our mouth; opening our mouth will always be of benefit. We must exercise in this matter.</p>
<p>As a result of our continuous speaking and promoting, the atmosphere of functioning in the meetings has already undergone a big change. We can say that it has changed from winter to spring. Although it has not yet changed to summer, summer is almost here. Anything we promote will advance. I want everyone to pay attention to this matter: whether in the district meetings or in the bigger meetings of the whole church, when we come together, we need to try our best to function, either by praying, choosing hymns, giving testimonies, or reading the Scriptures; we need to practice according to 1 Corinthians 14:26.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Needed Function in District Meetings<br />
Being to Prophesy&mdash;to Speak for the Lord<br />
and Speak Forth the Lord</h2>
<p>The most needed function in district meetings is to prophesy, that is, to speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord; prophesying is not mainly for prediction. We need to know that our speaking in the meetings is not something ordinary; we are neither chatting nor talking about the world situation, much less about the weather; rather, we are speaking things related to God and the Lord. This is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord, to minister the Lord. Hence, this kind of speaking is not ordinary.</p>
<p>Some saints are bothered by brothers and sisters prophesying in their local accents. This should not be a problem. When the apostles of the New Testament were carrying out their ministry, they spoke with a Galilean accent, and they were marked out by their accent (Acts 2:7). I believe that on the day of Pentecost, Peter still spoke with a heavy Galilean accent. On the day of Pentecost, after the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, his Galilean accent did not disappear, and he did not begin to speak with the accent of Judea or the accent of Jerusalem. According to the New Testament principle, God and man work together; that is, God and man are mingled.</p>
<p>For the Chinese translation of the Recovery Version of the New Testament, we referenced different English and Greek versions and entered into the depths of the text. Through this, we realized that Peter&rsquo;s proficiency in Greek could not compare with Paul&rsquo;s or even with James&rsquo;s. However, he still spoke for the Lord and wrote two Epistles. Hence, we should not think that someone who speaks with a local accent is ordinary and unable to be a prophet; this kind of thinking is not correct. Local accents do not affect the taste of what is spoken.</p>
<p>We need to endeavor to prophesy; to prophesy is to release God&rsquo;s word. Christianity has no way in this matter, so seminary students are hired to be preachers and pastors to speak for half an hour or even to take the entire time. However, this is not according to the biblical revelation. The Bible says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:26). Psalms and teachings are ordinary, whereas tongues and interpretations are miraculous. Concerning tongues, Paul says clearly in 1 Corinthians 14, &ldquo;I would rather speak five words with my mind, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue&rdquo; (v. 19). When a person speaks in tongues, what is spoken must be interpreted in order to build up the church; otherwise, tongues should not be spoken in the meeting. To prophesy is to speak for God and to speak forth God, which is different from speaking in tongues.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:1 says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.&rdquo; Here Paul says that prophesying is the highest gift. At the end of the chapter, he charged the Corinthian believers again, saying, &ldquo;So then, my brothers, desire earnestly the prophesying&rdquo; (v. 39). In verse 12 he was even stronger, &ldquo;Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.&rdquo; This verse is difficult to render, and many Bible translators have been troubled by Paul&rsquo;s words because he uses the plural form of <em>spirit</em> when he says, &ldquo;Zealous of spirits.&rdquo; This causes many Christians to wonder why Paul spoke in such a way.</p>
<p>There was a background to Paul&rsquo;s word in verse 12. At that time, the Greeks were very superstitious, and according to history, people in Corinth were superstitious to the uttermost. Among them there was even the practice of consulting spirits. People practiced necromancy because of superstition; this was the condition of the Greeks at that time. Although some were later saved and had a new life, they still had such a background among them. Hence, Paul told the Corinthian believers that they were not involved with the unique Spirit but with various spirits. Since they were zealous of spirits, he exhorted them to seek to excel for the building up of the church and not to bring in things that might be related to the spirits. Paul wanted the Corinthian believers to know that they all had the Holy Spirit within them and that they needed to speak from the Holy Spirit; such a speaking is excelling.</p>
<p>When Paul wrote 1 Corinthians 14 concerning speaking in tongues, he was inwardly concerned that speaking in tongues might invite in evil spirits. In England, when speaking in tongues was first introduced, Mrs. Penn-Lewis warned the believers in her writings that to speak in tongues might invite in evil spirits and bring in Satan&rsquo;s attack. Concerning this point, I had a thorough conversation with Brother Nee; however, even to this day, I still do not understand this matter. Brother D. M. Panton, who was believed to be the most accurate Bible expositor of this century, once said that he had tested over eighty people who spoke in tongues and found that a result of their speaking in tongues was always to say that Jesus is accursed. Brother Nee told us about this after he read the article. One day, Brother Nee and I talked about this matter, but it was difficult for us to understand it. Brother Panton personally had contacted those who spoke in tongues and charged them to say whether Jesus is accursed, and all answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; without exception. Mrs. Penn-Lewis and Brother Panton were more or less of the same era, but Brother Panton outlived Mrs. Penn-Lewis for nearly three decades. During the flourishing period of tongue-speaking in England, these two pillars had great influence among the believers; hence, the Pentecostal movement did not spread much within England.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1900, the Pentecostal movement came from England to the United States and began in Massachusetts. Soon it reached the West Coast, in the vicinity of Los Angeles. The Pentecostal movement had a great impact in the United States and was prevailing for a time. Out of that movement many groups were produced, and one of them was a group of brothers led by Brother A. B. Simpson. Although they joined the movement, in the end they saw that some matters in the Pentecostal movement were not according to the truth. For example, the Pentecostal people said that a person is not filled with the Holy Spirit until he speaks in tongues. Brother Simpson did not agree with this. The Pentecostal movement went even further to claim that if a person did not speak in tongues, he was not regenerated. The group of brothers with Simpson felt that they could no longer stay with the Pentecostal movement, so they withdrew and formed the Christian and Missionary Alliance. Of all the missionaries who came to preach in China, those from the Christian and Missionary Alliance were the best. Furthermore, today the best Christian group in Hong Kong is the Christian and Missionary Alliance; their headquarters are in New York.</p>
<p>Concerning the Pentecostal movement, there is much confusion among the Pentecostal groups; the most stable group is the Assembly of God, which was founded in 1915. This group is stable and proper. When we visited Brazil in 1965, we saw their work. For half a century, from 1915 to 1965, the Assembly of God had the highest rate of increase in the world. This is a brief review of the situation within the Pentecostal movement.</p>
<p>Regardless of its origin, by the time the Pentecostal movement reached northern China, it indeed involved evil spirits. Because of this kind of situation, Paul charged the believers in Corinth to not merely desire spiritual gifts but to earnestly desire a higher and excelling gift, that is, to prophesy. Prophesying is the most excelling gift, but not in reference to foretelling, tongue-speaking, or interpretation. Rather, prophesying excels in regard to using normal human language to speak of God, speak for God, speak forth God, and speak God into man to supply man. This is the most excelling gift.</p>
<p>We have read 1 Corinthians 14 for many years, but we have never been as clear as we are today. From now on, we must prophesy more in the meetings; especially the young full-time trainees must all practice to prophesy. Moreover, we need to see that the principle of the New Testament is incarnation; prophesying requires man&rsquo;s cooperation. If we do not cooperate, God will have no way to speak. The Triune God has been consummated as the Spirit, and this Spirit is now within us. The Spirit who indwells our spirit desires that we speak for God; that is, the Spirit is mingled with our spirit to speak for the Lord. We may use a three-legged race as an illustration of the mingled Spirit. When I was a young boy, I always liked to tie my leg to another boy&rsquo;s leg, and then we would walk together with three legs. This was quite difficult because if one person were too quick, he would cause the other person to stumble, and there could never be the proper coordination. Today God and we have become one spirit. He always desires to move, yet we may not move. Likewise, if we do not speak in the meetings, God is limited. God and we are tied together; if we do not move, God will be limited, and it will be difficult for Him to do anything.</p>
<p>Throughout church history, fundamentalists do not encourage people to speak; they want only one person to speak and everyone else to listen and to keep their mouth shut. The Pentecostal movement encourages people to shout, but in the end, their shouting brings in the spirits. Hence, Paul says that when a person prophesies, he must discern or judge (v. 29). At the time 1 Corinthians was written, it was prevalent to consult the spirits, and sometimes the spirits would speak; therefore, Paul charged the Corinthians believers to discern. According to our observation, Taiwan does not have much problem in this regard, and the situation is rather simple.</p>
<p>We all must practice to speak for the Lord in the meetings. For this reason, prior to the meetings, we must first pray, confess our sins, have proper fellowship with God, and allow the Holy Spirit to have the ground within us; in this way, when we come to the meetings, we will be able to cooperate with God. If we are people who truly have God and the Spirit of God within us, we will surely open our mouths and let the Spirit come out in the meetings. Not only will our spirit come out, but the Spirit of God in our spirit will also come out. Hence, the proper way is for everyone to open his mouth but not in the way of senseless shouting, such as speaking in tongues, because it is rather dangerous.</p><h2 class="head2">Avoiding Giving Tediously Long Prophecies,<br />
Three to Five Minutes Being Most Fitting</h2>
<p>We must avoid giving tediously long prophecies; otherwise, we will occupy too much time and take away the opportunity for others to function. According to our experience, especially in the initial stage of the practice of prophesying, three to five minutes is sufficient. In Luke 1 and 2 three people prophesied. None of the three were giving a prediction. This is not to say that there was no prediction in their speaking but that principally they were prophesying. The first to prophesy was Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist; the second, was Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus; and the third, was Zachariah, the father of John the Baptist. Elizabeth&rsquo;s speaking was the most simple and probably did not exceed two minutes, yet it was an excellent prophecy. Mary&rsquo;s speaking was probably about two minutes in length, and Zachariah probably spoke a little longer. His speaking was probably no more than seven minutes. None of them spoke in a lengthy way; rather, they were appropriate in speaking the Lord into others.</p>
<p>Prophesying requires learning. First, we must learn to be skilled in God&rsquo;s word. In order to be skilled in God&rsquo;s word, we must be well versed in the Scriptures. Consider the speaking of Elizabeth, Mary, and Zachariah. Mary&rsquo;s speaking, in particular, was made up of over thirty quotations from the Old Testament; it can be said that her speaking was entirely a composition of quotations from the Old Testament. The fact that this young woman was so familiar with the Old Testament and was able to speak according to the Scriptures is a proof that she belonged to a learned family. God&rsquo;s choosing was right. He chose such a woman to give birth to the Lord Jesus. Her son James was very pious, and her other son, Jude, was well versed in the Old Testament. The Epistles they wrote contain numerous references to the Old Testament. The Epistle of James speaks of many things related to the Old Testament, and although Jude&rsquo;s Epistle consists of only one short chapter, it mentions many stories from the Old Testament. This proves that the whole family was familiar with the Bible. As far as the Scripture is concerned, they were a well-read family. If we desire to learn to prophesy, we need to be well versed in the Bible.</p>
<p>Second, we need to have experience. The words of Elizabeth, Mary, and Zachariah all contain a considerable amount of experience. Their speaking out of their experience and their applying of God&rsquo;s word produced wonderful prophecies. It is amazing that at the beginning of the New Testament, when John and the Lord Jesus were conceived but were not yet born, these three persons prophesied. They did not speak predictions nor did they speak in tongues; rather, they prophesied. Their prophesying was a cooperation between God and man; it was man speaking for God in coordination with God. It sets the New Testament principle of speaking for God in the meetings. Hence, when we prophesy in the meetings, we need to be familiar with God&rsquo;s written word, include our experience, and have an instant inspiration. When we speak in such a way, it is prophesying. We need to have more practice and learning based on our seeing.</p>
<p>It is best if the elders in the various localities are able to serve full time. I absolutely believe that Mary, Elizabeth, and Zachariah must have all been &ldquo;full-timers,&rdquo; meaning that they contacted the Holy Scriptures and read God&rsquo;s word all day long, without being distracted by other things. Zachariah was a priest. A priest should be well versed in the Scriptures. If he had not been familiar with the Scriptures, he would not have been qualified to be a priest. Moreover, the words spoken by Elizabeth, Zachariah&rsquo;s wife, and by Mary prove that they too had spent much effort studying the Old Testament.</p>
<p>The elders among us have to hurry to work every day, and after a week of work, they are physically exhausted. The fact that they are able to enjoy a verse or two in the Bible every morning is quite good. However, to merely enjoy two verses from the Bible in the morning cannot make them rich in the Word. If they want to have something to share in the meetings, they need to diligently memorize the books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. They need to be so familiar with these important Epistles that when they open their mouth, they will be able to prophesy as those whose tongue is the pen of a ready writer (cf. Psa. 45:1). Understanding the Bible and having personal experiences makes prophesying an easy matter.</p>
<p>Perhaps some may ask, &ldquo;Does this mean that all the brothers and sisters should be full-timers?&rdquo; Of course, this would be best. If there were thirty thousand people on the earth doing nothing but studying the Bible every day, it would be marvelous. When this group of people would meet together, every one of them would be able to prophesy, and the effect would be immeasurable. Today all of Christianity lacks this kind of people. As a result, all of their meetings involve only one person speaking with everyone else listening. Consequently, their condition is very poor.</p><h2 class="head2">Every District Meeting Needing to Have<br />
Rich Content in Order to Supply the Saints</h2>
<p>The district meetings are generally fresh and living and are different from the past; more saints are speaking in the meetings, and the atmosphere is more open. However, as a whole, the speaking is not rich enough, so the content of the meetings is rather poor; this is a shortcoming that requires our further study. From now on we will spend more time focusing on the ninety-six districts in Taipei; we will study these districts one by one and present the condition of each district to the saints. This may be likened to our appearing before the Lord&rsquo;s judgment seat in the future. At that time the Lord will ask us what we have done since the day of our salvation. Romans 14:10 says, &ldquo;We will all stand before the judgment seat of God,&rdquo; and verse 12 says, &ldquo;Each one of us will give an account concerning himself to God.&rdquo; Moreover, in Matthew 12:36, the Lord spoke even more severely, saying, &ldquo;Every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment.&rdquo; God records all the words that we speak in our entire life. Today man invents equipment such as audio machines and computers to record sound and information, but God does not need to invent anything; He has already recorded what we have spoken. This is what the Bible reveals to us.</p>
<p>I hope that the saints will make progress in the matter of prophesying. Although we all speak in the meetings, we still need to improve. What we lack is rich content in our speaking. This can be compared to a ball game. Sometimes though every player is capable, because of the weather conditions, everyone feels spiritless on the field, and in the end they lose the game. We have at most fifty people in each district meeting. If all fifty would speak, the meetings would be marvelous. However, one of the responsible brothers may not be happy when he gets up in the morning, another brother may be upset, and many others may have their own situations. In the end, although everyone speaks, every person&rsquo;s speaking was poor, and the entire meeting was flavorless.</p>
<p>At such times, if one of the brothers is watchful, he will be able to turn the condition of the meeting. In a basketball game, when there are only fifteen seconds left and the result has not yet been determined, the coach will ask for a time out to instruct the players, presenting them with a strategy so that they can score in the last fifteen seconds. Sometimes, because of the speaking during the time out, the team gains the final victory. It is the same with the condition of the meetings. Someone must be on the alert and speak something in spirit so that we all can learn and be encouraged.</p>
<p>When we older ones first began to serve in the church, we led in this way; that is, we exercised to be alert. Fifty years ago we learned to &ldquo;direct the rudder&rdquo; in the meeting; though the directing may have not been visible outwardly, we were absolutely in control of the rudder in a hidden way. For example, when a prayer in the meeting was off the mark, we would inwardly ask the Lord to bring the prayer back to the burden. When some saints were not functioning properly, we would ask the Lord to find someone to uplift the meeting. The Lord always answers this kind of prayer. Today in the process of changing the system, we must be on the alert while directing the rudder of the meeting. When we see that the condition of the meeting is not proper and that there are only three or five minutes remaining, we should stand up and speak a word to supply the saints. This depends on our labor in our daily life. If we speak well, we will be able to supply others. Our meetings must be like a feast to which we all gather. On the table there is food, not empty bowls and plates; however, the food may be tasteless. Nevertheless, if in the last few minutes someone would open his mouth to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word, everyone will be supplied. The Lord has revealed this way to us, and if we take it, every group meeting and district meeting will be enriched. This requires that we all labor.</p>
<p>We must labor over the Lord&rsquo;s word, grasping every opportunity to redeem the time and get into the riches in the Lord&rsquo;s word. After we have prepared a ten-minute prophecy, we can practice by speaking it to people. If we do not have a person to speak to, we can speak to the wall. We need to practice unceasingly so that we can quickly learn to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word in the meetings with a rich content. The sisters should not think that because they are sisters, they do not have a responsibility. Although the sisters cannot be elders, they should be prophets who prophesy for the Lord. There were many prophetesses in the Old Testament. For instance, the first one who took the lead to praise God after the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea was Miriam, a prophetess (Exo. 15:20-21). There are also prophetesses in the New Testament. According to Acts, Philip the evangelist had four daughters who prophesied (21:9); this, I believe, was due to Philip&rsquo;s family being a learned family. Hence, we see that the habit of prophesying must be promoted.</p>
<p>Whether we are a brother or a sister, we should prepare ourselves to prophesy in the district meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. We should not wait until the Lord&rsquo;s Day; instead, we should prepare our prophecy by Thursday. Then when we come to the meeting, we should speak it before the brothers and sisters to supply them. Preparing to prophesy in this way is worthwhile. Some may wonder if this kind of preparation involves too much human effort. However, if we consider Mary as an example, we will realize her familiarity with the Old Testament required human effort. Not every Jewish woman could have prophesied as she did; she truly was a blessed woman. We should also see that Mary did not prophesy as people had prophesied in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament when the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon someone, he was able to give a word of prophecy (Num. 24:2-9; 1 Sam. 10:6; 19:20; 2 Chron. 15:1-2). From the outset, however, Mary&rsquo;s prophesying was in the principle of the New Testament, which involves the cooperation of God and man, man working in coordination with God. God needed a woman like Mary who spent much effort to study the Scriptures, was well versed in God&rsquo;s word, loved the Lord inwardly, and had fellowship with the Lord. Only such ones are suitable candidates, and only such human effort coordinates with God&rsquo;s work. This is what we are shown in the beginning of the New Testament.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul exhorts the brothers and sisters to desire earnestly to prophesy; he exhorts them to desire not only the Lord but to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord. All the trainees should practice much in this matter; like the pious Mary, they need to consecrate themselves to love the Lord, study the Lord&rsquo;s word, and not waste time. If we waste time doing other things, we will not be right with ourself, and even more we will not be right with our parents. Our parents have the expectation that we will not waste our time, and we should not let them down; therefore, we must also firmly grasp the time and diligently exercise in every matter. We not only need to be familiar with the Bible, but we also need to thoroughly know the outlines and footnotes of every book. If the majority of us have this kind of spirit, what is within us will be manifested outwardly when we come to the meetings. We will be able to put forth what we have when the opportunity comes. This is to have our human work cooperate with God&rsquo;s work to speak forth God&rsquo;s word and speak it into people so that they may be supplied. How rich such a meeting will be!</p>
<p>In the past, under the influence of the tradition of Christianity, our meetings became somewhat deformed and were the same as the so-called Sunday worship services. Although we used the term <em>meeting</em> and everyone came with their Bibles, no one was concerned about what they should do because the responsible brothers made all the arrangements. It was not the saints&rsquo; responsibility to call hymns and pray, much less to speak; their responsibility was simply to sit and listen. After over thirty years of listening, we became numb, and a tradition of not speaking became established among us. This is the reason that it is so difficult to promote prophesying today. Hence, we should all enter into and promote prophesying, speaking for the Lord. In the past, we did not have the opportunity to do this, but now we have been given the opportunity in the district meetings. Whether we are brothers or sisters, we can join a district meeting, and when the opportunity comes, we can open our mouth to speak for the Lord and speak Him into others.</p>
<p>After serving the Lord for more than sixty years, I have seen that the saints, whether in the East or in the West, have been greatly influenced by Christianity. We know that the Lord&rsquo;s salvation enlivens man, but the practice in Christianity deadens man. Even if people are saved and enlivened through the gospel preaching of some great evangelists, they seem to become frozen once they are sent to the denominations. Although many have seen this outcome, no one has called out loudly to overturn the degraded tradition and let the saints rise up to function. Do not think that my speaking is too much. The burden within me is too heavy.</p>
<p>What causes my heart to ache the most is that some people have doubts concerning the new way. I must tell them to wait and see; the new way will succeed. We can be sure of this because we know that the new way is according to the Lord&rsquo;s word. Matthew 5:18 says that until heaven and earth pass away, not one iota or one serif will pass away from the Lord&rsquo;s word. First Corinthians 14:26 says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.&rdquo; Though this word is very familiar to us, it has not yet been fulfilled. Can this word be in the Bible but not be fulfilled by the time the Lord returns? Moreover, Hebrews 10:25 says, &ldquo;Not abandoning our own assembling together...but exhorting one another.&rdquo; Do we have any meeting in which we exhort one another? We can say that in all of Christianity there is nothing like this; nevertheless, I have a deep conviction that these two verses in the Bible will be fulfilled. Even if I do not see the fulfillment and accomplishment of this word of the Lord in my lifetime, those who continue the recovery will surely see the success of the new way. The Lord will definitely fulfill this matter.</p>
<p>If we are wise, we should not adopt a wait-and-see attitude; rather, we should all endeavor and strive together. Even if we cannot see the success in our generation, the next generation will see it and be grateful that we who preceded them endeavored in this matter. History tells us that the reforms carried out by Martin Luther did not originate with him but were begun by a few pioneers who had brought in some reforms before him. The battle we are fighting is supported by the truth; no one can deny that. Even those with a wait-and-see attitude acknowledge that we are speaking according to the Bible; nevertheless, there is a big &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash;they are unable to keep pace with us. I hope that all the elders and co-workers among us will say Amen instead of &ldquo;but.&rdquo; Let us all push this &ldquo;old car&rdquo; together. Even if the &ldquo;mountain road&rdquo; is difficult, we will be able to push the car uphill if several hundred are in one accord. This is our spirit; we all should have such a spirit.</p>
<p>I am not being proud when I say that in the early days, I was the first one to take this way in northern China. When we first took this way, we had such a spirit, and no one was able to shake us. Some in Chefoo said that they did not need to pay attention to us because we were merely a group of youngsters leading other youngsters and that we would come to an end. However, this was not the case; the situation of the whole church changed completely within as little as one or two years.</p>
<p>After I came to Taiwan, some people told me that the church ground of which I spoke would never work. Later, when I came to America, some people also tried to persuade me that if I spoke about the church ground, no one would accept it. Nevertheless, I was clear inwardly that they needed to wait and see. Although some may not accept it, they do not represent the whole world. It is true that some may not want to take this way, but there are many more who desire to take it. What matters is whether or not we are speaking the truth according to the Scriptures. If some could prove that my speaking was not according to the truth or the revelation in the Bible, I would immediately kneel down to pray, confess my sins, and ask the Lord for His forgiveness and the saints&rsquo; for their forgiveness. However, if my speaking is according to the Bible, none should put a question mark on it. In particular, those brothers who are my fellow workers should not have this kind of attitude. To do so is to be wrong and unfaithful. If some are my co-workers, they should be in one accord with me; otherwise, they are not my co-workers.</p>
<p>From now on, all the responsible ones in the district meetings need to direct the rudder and supply the meetings; otherwise, they cannot be considered responsible ones. To be a responsible one in the district meetings means to be one who prepares a &ldquo;dish&rdquo; in case everyone else fails to bring their &ldquo;dishes&rdquo; to the meeting. It also means being one who can put out some &ldquo;dessert&rdquo; even if everyone else has brought something. The responsible ones need not be in a hurry to prophesy; they can save their prophecy for the end and give priority to others. In this way, the district meetings will not be poor. A long message cannot supply people; everyone functioning is what supplies people.</p>
<p>A lengthy message may not supply people, but if in the last ten minutes of the district meeting a responsible one rises up to speak a finishing prophecy, it will be most edifying. The food we offer to people when they are hungry is the most delicious. They may be listening for forty-five minutes without receiving anything, but when a responsible one stands up to speak eight minutes, he can give them a sense of freshness and of being full of supply. I truly believe and have the assurance that this can be attained to.</p>
<p>Through this kind of fellowship, I hope that we are all clear and understand the direction we should take from now on. We are serving the churches; if we receive this burden, the meetings in all the churches will not be a problem. Furthermore, I hope that we can study and come together for fellowship concerning the increase or decrease in number within the ninety-six districts in the church in Taipei. In this way, we can receive the light for the future progress of our meetings. We are still in the process of investigation and improvement, and we want to receive help and revelation from these words of fellowship so that the churches may reap a great benefit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>

<p>Prayer: Lord, from the depths of our being we shout for joy that You are the victorious Lord. You have gained the victory and will gain the victory again; eventually You will gain the full victory. Lord, we worship You that until today You are still among us and with us. Thank You that Your speaking has never departed from us and is not rare among us but increases more and more. Lord, we express our desire to You and know that our desire is just the expression of Your desire. We believe that this prayer will reach Your throne and that our desire will touch Your throne, the throne of Your authority. Lord, we look to You that You would pour down and pour out Your answer from heaven so that we might see that Your answer is swift, rich, victorious, and full of glory. Lord, we pray that You would be with Your church and remember that this is Your recovery; this is the way that You have led us to walk. Lord, strengthen us and cause us to go from strength to strength and from glory to glory so that You may receive sufficient praise and worship among us. Lord, although we work, we still have rest. Although we have heavy burdens, we still worship You from within. Lord, may You gain the glory and may all Your blessings be upon those who love You so that they may be like the sun when it rises in its might. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW WAY BEING<br />
A PRACTICABLE AND BLESSED WAY</h2>
<p>After listening to some fellowship that took place among the ninety-six districts of the twenty-three halls of the church in Taipei, I have much feeling and would like to share the feelings that I have written down. First, the fellowship confirms that when the training, the leading rendered by the ministry, and the practice in the churches are blended together, it is truly a glorious matter. We can see that all sides benefit. Second, I am truly comforted and encouraged because a large church such as the church in Taipei is willing to practice the new way according to the leading rendered by the ministry. Third, the new way has been proven to be a practicable and blessed way. Fourth, as long as we are willing to practice the new way according to the leading that we have received, blessing and success will come to us. Fifth, a characteristic of the new way is that it provides an opportunity for every saint to function. Formerly, the old way was closed and indirect; the new way is open and direct. The new way provides an equal opportunity to function to every newly saved one and all who love the Lord. Sixth, the new way enables many to learn and make progress in the matter of prophesying, and this progress is unlimited. Although we have seen only a beam of light, a small beginning, we deeply believe that it will reach high noon. Seventh, the new way requires us to labor more and be more diligent than before.</p>
<p>We have seen that this is the way we must take and that this way is full of blessing and rest. However, this blessing can be obtained only by our diligence, and this rest can be enjoyed only in our labor. Moreover, no matter how much help we have received in these messages, I hope that we not only remember it in our heart but also humbly receive from one another. For example, after hearing an excellent testimony from a certain church, we should study the testimony and humbly receive help from it. We should not respond to an excellent testimony by thinking that we need to find an even better way of doing the same thing. This kind of concept will not bring in blessing. Instead, those who are humble will be blessed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR NEGLIGENCE IN TAKING CARE<br />
OF THE SAINTS IN THE PAST</h2>
<p>Concerning dividing into districts, if the number in our big meetings reaches two hundred or even one hundred, we should divide into more districts. Dividing into districts enables us to take care of the saints. From the many testimonies we can see that our shortcoming in the past was that we were inadequate in taking care of the saints and even worse in regard to shepherding. For example, in October of 1984, before we brought up the matter of taking the new way, we estimated that the church in Taipei had at least ten thousand saints. However, in reality, at most only three thousand attended the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting and a little over two thousand attended the table meeting in the evening. Of course, these numbers did not represent all the brothers and sisters who regularly attended meetings. In all, around five thousand were present in the meetings at different times. Besides these five thousand, there were perhaps more than ten thousand who stayed home without anyone taking care of them. This proves that we were truly negligent in the matter of caring for the saints.</p>
<p>In view of this, all the saints in the churches, including the elders and co-workers, who participate in home meetings, group meetings, and district meetings need to make a concerted effort to properly care for and shepherd these ten thousand saints. We particularly look to the Lord that He may lead the elders and co-workers to find a way to carry out this matter. This is an important and precious matter.</p>
<p>A brother testified that he was saved and baptized in 1949 when the church in Taipei began having gospel marches. However, he did not continue to meet with the saints. For thirty-nine years he did not attend a meeting; nevertheless, he did not forget the church. Every time he walked past Ren-ai Road and saw hall one of the church in Taipei, he would linger outside too embarrassed to enter. Not too long ago, some brothers and sisters knocked on his door. Once they entered into his house, he felt that the church had come to him. A few days prior to that visit, he had a thought within him that he desired to come back to the church but did not know how to do so. It was exactly at that time that the saints came to knock on his door and reconnect him with the church. Now he meets in hall ten. This is an excellent example that should encourage us to pick up the burden to visit those brothers and sisters who have been lost.</p>
<p>Yet another part of our family also needs care, that is, the thirty-eight thousand who were baptized through our door-knocking during the training. Among these ones, only six thousand are receiving care. Hence, there are thirty thousand who desperately need care. We cannot be sure that all of these thirty thousand are truly saved, but at least two-thirds of them are saved. According to this ratio, twenty thousand are brothers and sisters in the Lord. We need to pray for these ones and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading as to how to take care of these members of our family given by the Lord to the church in Taipei.</p>
<p>I hope that the church in Taipei will bear the responsibility to take care of them and bring them into the church life. Although we may not be able to gain even half of them, at least we can gain one-third and bring them into the home meetings, group meetings, and district meetings. May the church in Taipei be blessed by God to receive the burden to visit these ones consistently, beginning from today. Currently there are approximately eleven thousand who take turns to come to the meetings. We hope that this number will increase to twenty-one thousand by the end of this year. We all need to endeavor to accomplish this; the elders, in particular, should bear this burden and consider this as their goal.</p>
<p>We need to continue to practice preaching the gospel by door-knocking and visitation. This atmosphere should not be interrupted, and this flow should not stop. This matter should be gradually established as a custom among us, that is, the custom of the church&rsquo;s preaching of the gospel. At the same time, we should consider that door-knocking is one of many ways to preach the gospel and that it is the most effective way. This does not mean that we should not use other ways to preach the gospel. We should use any means that can bring people to salvation, but it seems that door-knocking is the most effective way. Hence, this practice should be established in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery so that it becomes the habit and custom of all the saints.</p>
<p>If the saints have the habit and custom of door-knocking, we have the assurance that with this kind of gospel preaching plus the perfecting in the home meetings, group meetings, and district meetings, that is, through the support of the homes, groups, and districts, we will be able to maintain a twofold increase every year. If from now on we go from strength to strength and continue to increase, the rate of increase will be beyond estimation. It all depends on how we labor and how we practice this way. If we do it properly and if we are all diligent, the newly saved ones will be raised up within a year to function in the same way. This can be anticipated, and it is promising and hopeful. Everything depends upon how we lead. May the Lord have mercy upon us.</p><h2 class="head1">NEARLY NO SIGNS OF REVIVAL<br />
THROUGHOUT THE EARTH</h2>
<p>In Christianity there is a long-held concept of revival that exists not only within the Pentecostal movement but also among fundamentalists. In my youth when I joined Christianity, I saw that almost all the Christians in the world were praying for a revival. For a period of at least twelve years, from 1918 to 1930 after the first European war, almost all the Christians in Europe and America were praying desperately for a revival, asking God to pour down a revival. However, that revival has still not come.</p>
<p>Later the Pentecostal movement was raised up and presumed to be the arrival of a revival. In the 1950s in one of the northern islands in Indonesia some people widely publicized that a great revival would come and that even the dead would be raised. At the time I heard this report, I was in the Philippines, which is not far from Indonesia. Inwardly I was doubtful. Later, when I went to the United States, I found out that the revival in Indonesia had been false and that all the miracles associated with it were fake. In one instance when an Indonesian pastor was performing the &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; of turning water into wine, an American missionary stood beside him and saw that it was simply a deceit. Actually, the wine was already there, and the pastor simply acted like he was turning the water into wine. This missionary witnessed the accomplishment of the &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; and was shocked inwardly; afterward, he began to stay away from the pastor who practiced deception, not desiring to witness such a situation. When he returned to the United States, he was greatly disappointed by the many things that he had observed. Eventually, he began a key making business. After a period of time, he heard about the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and came into our midst.</p>
<p>In 1949 Billy Graham, a thirty-one-year-old evangelist, went to Los Angeles to lead an evangelistic campaign and suddenly became prominent nationally. Later he went on to hold evangelistic campaigns all over the world. In the 1950s he was invited to London, England, to preach the gospel for several weeks. He preached every day, and he preached unceasingly. The British were tremendously attracted by him; even in pouring rain he would preach to them while they would listen with umbrellas over their heads. When I went to visit Brother T. Austin-Sparks in 1958, I heard about this glorious situation from those who had attended Graham&rsquo;s meetings. However, history tells us that even with this kind of situation, there was no revival in England. For the past twenty-five years the denominational churches in America have been on the decline; thus, throughout the whole world there is nearly no sign of revival.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRUTH PRODUCING LIFE AND LIFE BEARING FRUIT</h2>
<p>In the past sixty years we did not see any revival take place in China; nevertheless, we did see the release of the truth that causes people to receive light, life, nourishment of life, and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. This kind of condition has spread to all the local churches on the earth; of course, in some places it is quite thriving, and in other places it is not as evident. I hope we can see that if all of us, especially the elders, co-workers, and full-timers, are faithful to the truth, learn the truth, enter into the truth, release the truth, teach the truth, and preach the truth, the result will be that truth will produce life and that life will bring forth beautiful fruit. When this happens, we can call it a revival, but it is absolutely different from the revival that Christianity speaks of according to its tradition.</p>
<p>Since World War I, Christians from Europe and America have been praying for a revival. Sadly, we have not seen a revival within the last sixty to seventy years, but we absolutely believe that if the truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is given a way to thrive, it will bring in the richness of life, and the result will be clusters and clusters of fruit. Today the Lord has brought us back to the Bible and has shown us the new way clearly. All who are saved, who love the Lord, and who have truth and life within them should go forth to deliver the gospel to people; this is our obligation. However, we should not follow the old way; rather, we need to go into people&rsquo;s homes with the gospel, the Lord, the Bible, truth, grace, love, and salvation. This is an unalterable principle in the Bible. It requires us to visit people, just as the Lord Jesus went to Jericho personally to say to Zaccheus, &ldquo;Hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house&rdquo; (Luke 19:5). Later, the Lord said, &ldquo;Today salvation has come to this house&rdquo; (v. 9). We should all follow the footsteps of the Lord Jesus to visit people.</p><h2 class="head1">HOME MEETINGS BEING ABLE TO KEEP PEOPLE,<br />
AND GROUP MEETINGS HAVING THE FUNCTION<br />
OF JOINING PEOPLE TO ONE ANOTHER</h2>
<p>Although it is very effective to bring people to salvation by visiting them in their homes, it is not that easy to bring them into the church life. After we have set up a home meeting, we may find out that it is not easy. Actually, it is rather difficult to take the next step forward. The Bible shows that when the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He fed five thousand at one time and at another time four thousand (Matt. 14:21; 15:38). These two numbers come to a total of nine thousand, not including women and children. In addition, the Lord also contacted quite a number of other people. Within three and a half years the Lord Jesus must have contacted at least one hundred thousand people. We need to reread the four Gospels and study every gospel incident thoroughly; then we will be able to see how many people the Lord Jesus contacted while He was on the earth. We believe that He must have contacted a minimum of one hundred thousand people.</p>
<p>After His resurrection the Lord Jesus appeared to over five hundred brothers at one time (1 Cor. 15:6). However, it is not clear how many He fully gained. It is difficult to tell how many were gained through the miracles and wonders He performed during the three and a half years of His ministry on the earth; moreover, it is even more difficult to know how many were gained through His vivid appearance to the more than five hundred brothers after His resurrection.</p>
<p>Recently I have been repeatedly considering our experience of going out to visit and baptize people. When we preach based on <em>The Mystery of Human Life,</em> what we speak is truthful, not false. Thus, we are able to quickly open people&rsquo;s understanding and help them to be baptized into the Lord. In the past, many had the concept that preaching the gospel should be done slowly. According to their way, if we preach the gospel to a person, and he is not enlightened, we should simply wait and preach to him again the next week. If he still has not been enlightened, we should wait until the third week. Then we should go to him and lead him to pray. This is man&rsquo;s way of salvation, not the biblical way. The record in the Bible shows that both through the Lord Jesus directly and in Acts people were saved in a quick way. In Acts 16:22-34 there was a jailer in Philippi who was guarding Paul and Silas. One night at about midnight, all the doors of the prison were opened. The jailer, supposing that the prisoners had escaped, was about to do away with himself. At that moment Paul called out with a loud voice and told the jailer not to harm himself because the prisoners had not escaped. The jailer then asked Paul and Silas what he must do to be saved, and they exhorted him to believe on the Lord Jesus so that he and his household would be saved. The jailer was baptized immediately that night, and not by himself but with his entire household. This shows that salvation and baptism as revealed in the Bible differ from our concept.</p>
<p>We do not have the assurance that every one of the thirty thousand newly baptized ones among us are truly saved, but we believe that at least two-thirds are saved. While studying how to bring them into the church life, we have received light from the Bible and have begun to consider how many people the Lord Jesus gained through His earthly ministry. We know that after resurrection, the Lord appeared to over five hundred brothers. I do not believe that the Lord Jesus appeared for only a brief moment and then quickly disappeared. He must have let them look at Him thoroughly and sufficiently. Nevertheless, it seems incredible that some may have seen the bodily-resurrected Lord Jesus, yet they were not completely gained by the Lord. In any case, I believe that of the five hundred brothers, at least one hundred must have been completely gained by the Lord.</p>
<p>The account at the beginning of Acts speaks of a gathering of one hundred twenty saints, including some women. All of the one hundred twenty were Galileans. Perhaps some may ask whether the Lord Jesus gained other people in Jerusalem and the land of Judea. I believe that He must have gained some; however, the strange thing is that the one hundred twenty were all Galileans; no one was from another province. In the Gospels the Lord Jesus frequently traveled in Galilee, and He gained a group of people including Peter, James, and John. Out of the twelve disciples, only Judas was from the land of Judea, and he was false. The rest were genuine disciples and Galileans; they were the Lord Jesus&rsquo; true helpers. Because they were gained directly by the Lord Jesus, they were used by Him to bring the one hundred twenty saints together. This is the function of home meetings and group meetings.</p>
<p>I believe that people like Peter, James, and John must have had home meetings and group meetings together. Through this, the brothers and sisters in the land of Galilee were joined to one another. In the land of Judea, however, due to the lack of such a group of people who were joined and built together, not many were brought in. From this we should see that once we gain some new ones, it is not adequate to merely baptize them or even to show them the Lord Jesus&rsquo; resurrection. Rather, there must be some who join them together continually and unceasingly. Peter, James, and John were such ones. They were continually joining people, and thus the one hundred twenty were gathered together.</p>
<p>The light in the Bible is clear. After we have baptized some, we need to be joined to them. We should have home meetings with a believer during his first week of being saved. Then we should bring him to a group meeting. The home is a foundation to keep him; once this foundation is laid, it is difficult for him to leave. If there is a meeting in his home every week, he will spontaneously be stabilized. This is the light we have received from the Bible. Peter, James, and John were the most useful helpers of the Lord Jesus, but even they did not bring in someone from Judea or Jerusalem. All whom they gained were Galileans because they were close to the Galileans. The principle is that we bring in those whom we are close to and that we lose those whom we are not close to. While the home meetings keep people, the group meetings join people together. If we want to join people together, we need the group meetings.</p>
<p>After a person is saved, we not only need to have meetings with him in his home, but we should also bring him to a group meeting. Homes stabilize people, whereas group meetings join people. The Lord Jesus Himself carried out such a work. By His resurrection He strengthened those who were under His leading; however, only those who were joined together through homes and groups remained. Even though none were brought in from Judea and Jerusalem, one hundred twenty were brought in from Galilee.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT SEEKING QUICK SUCCESS IN THE NEW WAY,<br />
BUT LABORING TO BEAR FRUIT</h2>
<p>Both Acts and the Epistles show the apostles&rsquo; work of building up the church. In the past we appraised their work too highly, thinking that their work was marvelous and that every church they built up seemed to be a New Jerusalem. However, while we were studying the new way and came back to the Bible to consider this matter, we discovered that the work which the apostles did was not extraordinary. According to the Epistles, the church in Philippi was an excellent church, yet Paul still spoke of two co-working sisters who were not in one accord (Phil. 4:2). Even among the co-workers today, we may not have such a condition. I believe that our co-working sisters are better than those two sisters. We do not need to write a letter to certain sisters, charging them to be in one accord and to think the same thing in the Lord, as Paul exhorted Euodias and Syntyche.</p>
<p>In one of his last Epistles Paul wrote that all in Asia turned away from him (2 Tim. 1:15). That turning away was not physical or geographical, because Paul was in a prison in Rome when he wrote 2 Timothy. Rome was a sea apart from Asia. Their turning away from him was in regard to the truth in the ministry; all who were in Asia rejected Paul&rsquo;s ministry. This is difficult to believe.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus gained five thousand and later four thousand; in Acts, on the day of Pentecost, Peter and the brothers quickly gained three thousand (2:41). However, we see from Acts that the church in Jerusalem was not that encouraging. When Paul entered Jerusalem for the last time, the leading brothers, including James, who was a pillar in the church and a leading one, said to Paul, &ldquo;You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed; and all are zealous for the law&rdquo; (21:20). This means that thousands of believing Jews still kept the law. This statement indicates that the church in Jerusalem was nearly worthless. We know that the Jewish believers in Jerusalem, as believers in the New Testament, were in Christ, had received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and were the church, yet they still kept the law. This word was not spoken by a little brother in the church but by the leading elder. The elders of the church in Jerusalem, according to that church&rsquo;s custom of keeping of the law, persuaded Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles, to also keep the law. In this matter Paul was weak.</p>
<p>In Romans and Galatians, Paul says that the law has been abolished; in 1 Corinthians, he also says that knowledge will be rendered useless (13:8). His speaking is very clear in these three books. However, when he went to Jerusalem, due to the persuasion of James, he was softened in his heart and paid the expenses for four Nazarites to undergo the rite of purification. We know from the Old Testament that purification was a ritual that required many offerings to be presented for seven consecutive days, and the purification was not completed until the last day. Paul followed the rite accordingly, entering into the temple with the four Nazarites and giving notice of the completion of the days of the purification until the offering was offered for each one of them (Acts 21:24, 26). By the sixth of seven days Paul must have felt inwardly pained and must have been praying for the Lord to rescue him from this temptation. He probably never imagined that he would be in such a predicament. The Lord heard his prayer, and on the seventh day, when the purification was about to be completed, the Lord did not allow the rite to continue further. A great uproar ensued, the rite of purification was interrupted, and Paul was arrested (vv. 27-33). This was a rescue to Paul. God used that arrest to deliver Paul from the great temptation of the Jewish religion.</p>
<p>God is the sovereign One; He brought about an uproar to preserve His servant Paul, and in His preservation, He transferred Paul from the hands of the Jews to the hands of the Romans. The Jews conspired to take Paul&rsquo;s life when he was on his way to the Sanhedrin and put themselves under a curse to neither eat nor drink until they had accomplished the matter. When the son of Paul&rsquo;s sister heard this, he told Paul and the commander, and Paul was rescued from that tribulation (23:12-24). Paul knew that he was born a Roman citizen (22:28), and he was acquainted with Roman law. Therefore, he told Festus, &ldquo;I am standing before Caesar&rsquo;s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews...I appeal to Caesar&rdquo; (25:10-11). He declared that Caesar should judge him; this stopped Festus from doing anything. He replied, &ldquo;To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go&rdquo; (v. 12). This means that Paul could not be sent to Jerusalem, which was Jewish territory; rather, he had to be sent to Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire. It was in prison in Rome that Paul wrote the Epistles of Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and 2 Timothy. These books in the New Testament are very precious.</p>
<p>In terms of Paul&rsquo;s work, there is much to be praised; nevertheless, in reality the result of his work is nothing like what we would have expected. Even the result of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost is not as we may have imagined. At the end of Acts, we see that the fruit of Pentecost entered into Judaism. In Acts 8, apart from the apostles, all the believers were persecuted and departed from Jerusalem. These ones were not the one hundred twenty but another group of people. After this group of people were scattered, Acts does not clearly indicate how strong and prevailing the testimony became. Therefore, we should be clear and comforted that the new way is a way of labor, step by step.</p>
<p>Even if all the churches in Taiwan take the new way and the Lord enables us to gain twenty thousand in the first year, sixty thousand in the second year, and one hundred eighty thousand in the third year, we need to be careful, because if we have this condition, it could be called a &ldquo;mushroom work.&rdquo; Someone who grows mushrooms can gain a large quantity of mushrooms overnight. However, this is not the pattern for the growth in life. There is a common Chinese saying: &ldquo;He who advances with haste will retreat with haste.&rdquo; This means that if a certain matter advances too rapidly, it will also decline quickly. Hence, the slower we proceed with the new way, the steadier we will be. In order to obtain a long-term, permanent result, we must exert effort and spend time to proceed step by step.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was God, yet He spent three and a half years carrying out His work on the earth step by step. There were no automobiles at that time. For sure there were donkeys, but we do not know whether there were any other types of vehicles. Hence, it is likely that the Lord walked from Galilee to Jerusalem on foot. Since He traveled mostly on foot, the Lord Jesus&rsquo; work must have been very slow. Although it is recorded in the Bible that He gained four thousand at one time and five thousand at another time, in the miniature of the church life in the house of Martha and Mary, there were only three or four people in this &ldquo;home meeting,&rdquo; and even these three or four were not in one accord. After Pentecost, there were three thousand who were in one accord (2:41, 46), but that one accord did not last long. In Acts 5:1-11 Ananias and Sapphira, his wife, tried to deceive the Holy Spirit. Then in Acts 6:1, there was a dispute over the daily dispensing, causing a conflict between the Jews who spoke Greek and the Jews who spoke Hebrew. Therefore, in the early stage of the apostles&rsquo; ministry, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit that the believers received did not guarantee a good church life.</p>
<p>We should be comforted and see that if our work is real, it will surely produce results. Although Paul was not satisfied with his work at the time he wrote 2 Timothy, he said clearly that he knew that he was already being poured out and that the time of his departure was at hand (4:6); nevertheless, he was joyful within because he knew what he had preached and the kind of work he had done. From his Epistles, we see that Paul preached the truth, dispensed and ministered Christ to people, and established churches. He knew that this was real, so no matter how much Satan tried to destroy his work, it would last forever. We have tasted the lasting value of his work. When we read Ephesians, it is as if Paul were right in front of us. We can say that in the New Testament, Paul is the one who renders us the most help. Therefore, we should be assured that if what we do is real, it will come under Satan&rsquo;s devastation; nevertheless, the more he devastates, the more the reality will be manifested, and the more we will be able to see that our work is not a work of wood, grass, and stubble but of gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12), which will last forever.</p>
<p>We should not be discouraged. The new way is truly the right way; we must go out to preach the gospel through door-knocking. After the preaching of the gospel, we need to maintain continual contact with people; the more contact there is, the better it will be. Whether we are an elder, co-worker, or a full-time serving one, we must take the way of going out to preach the gospel, establishing the home meetings and group meetings, and establishing churches. When the number of people in a church becomes too large, the church should be divided into districts. Even if there are only one hundred people in the church, it should be divided into districts. At most, there should be fifty or sixty people in a district because it is difficult to take care of anything above this number. After dividing into districts, taking care of the saints will become more widespread. Furthermore, the opportunity for service will increase, and the members of the Body will all be able to function. This will create opportunities for the saints to serve and fulfill their function in the church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEARNING THE TRUTH FOR PROPHESYING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:20; Acts 2:42; 5:42; 2 Tim. 3:7; 1 Tim. 2:4; Col. 3:16; Heb. 5:13-14; 2 Tim. 2:2</h1>
<p>At present, the most important thing for the church is what Paul spoke of in 1 Corinthians 14:4: &ldquo;He who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but he who prophesies builds up the church.&rdquo; For the building up of the church, the most necessary thing is prophesying. To prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord. Although our testimonies in all the districts of the churches may be good, the content of the meetings is not rich enough. The content of the meetings is not rich because the speaking is not rich. If the speaking is rich in the church meetings, especially in the district meetings, the content of the meetings will also be rich.</p>
<p>Our problem today is related to our speaking; the proper speaking is not an ordinary speaking. In every district everyone is now exercising to speak, either to give a testimony or to prophesy. They are trying their best to exercise to speak a short word. This is good. Some speak with the help of a &ldquo;cane,&rdquo; using <em>Truth Lessons, Life Lessons,</em> or the Life-studies, all of which are helpful. However, the speaking is not rich enough. Hence, although all the brothers and sisters speak in the meetings, some speak on one topic, and others speak on another topic; at the end there is the need for a responsible brother to &ldquo;tie a knot,&rdquo; that is, to release a rich word to conclude the meeting. This is very necessary.</p>
<p>There are different ways to tie a knot; just as it is not simple to tie a knot, it is also not simple to conclude a meeting. Fifty years ago in mainland China, the suitcases and handbags that we carried on long trips were not as convenient and stylish as they now are. Today everything is so convenient. The luggage and suitcases that we carry on the plane from the United States to Taiwan vary in size and style and are all well equipped and elegant looking. However, when we traveled for a long distance fifty years ago, we had to tie a knot around each piece of the old-fashioned suitcase or bag in order to secure them. Sometimes the knot was not tight enough and became loose in the middle of the journey; sometimes, because of hastiness, the knot became tangled and was difficult to untie. Hence, a great deal of consideration is needed in regard to properly tying a knot.</p>
<p>With regard to our meetings, there is the need to tie a knot at the end, that is, to conclude in a proper way; however, this requires much consideration as to who should tie the knot and how to tie it. Not everyone can conclude a meeting, and not every conclusion is satisfying, supplying, and edifying. Hence, through careful study we have realized that in order to meet the long-term need related to the district meetings and group meetings, the concluding word of each meeting must have content. The content depends upon the speaking, not the testimonies. The Lord&rsquo;s word is what edifies and nurtures people the most. While testimonies may be helpful to the saints, they do not adequately nurture the saints, because they do not contain much of the Lord&rsquo;s word. The concluding word must have the truth as its basis; such a word imparts truth into the saints so that they feel solid within. Without the Lord&rsquo;s word the meeting is not solid; with the Lord&rsquo;s word it becomes solid and secure.</p>
<p>It is not easy to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word in a meeting. Fifty years ago Brother Nee saw the light and realized that the big meeting on Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, in which one person speaks and everyone else listens, is not proper and that having such a meeting is to follow the customs of the nations. However, at that time he clearly said we should not stop this kind of meeting, because we were not able to find an adequate substitute for it. If the meeting in which one person speaks and the rest listen had been stopped, we would not have known how to meet. At that time he pointed out that in order for us to have the kind of meeting described in 1 Corinthians 14:26, we would need to experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit was poured out, psalms, teachings, revelations, and even tongues would come. Our change in system in these past few years is based upon our repeated study and exercise to practice 1 Corinthians 14:26. Eventually we have been able to change the format of the meetings from having one person speak and everyone else listen to having a meeting in which everyone speaks and listens, that is, to a meeting full of mutuality.</p>
<p>When we delved into 1 Corinthians 14, the Lord revealed several crucial points. First, in verse 1 Paul says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.&rdquo; If a saint can prophesy only when the Holy Spirit is poured out upon him, there is no need for him to desire earnestly to prophesy. To desire earnestly implies learning. Second, to prophesy is not to speak in tongues. Speaking in tongues does not require much learning. Speaking in tongues usually occurs while someone is praying, and the Holy Spirit suddenly descends upon him, causing him to speak in tongues. Hence, it is a miraculous speaking. Prophesying is different. It is to speak forth God with ordinary words. This cannot be acquired merely by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit; rather, it depends upon the daily learning of the speaking one.</p>
<p>Luke 1 contains the prophecies of Elizabeth, Mary, and Zachariah. As we ponder over their prophecies, we can see that without a foundation of God&rsquo;s word in their daily lives, it would have been difficult for them to prophesy with words matching the standard they displayed. Mary must have been especially familiar with the Old Testament because her prophecy quotes from the Old Testament extensively. In 1 Corinthians 14:26 Paul also points out the way in which all can prophecy. He says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation.&rdquo; This does not mean that whenever we come together, we will spontaneously have something. That would be impossible. Even if someone has a hymn, he still needs to be familiar with the numbering and the content of the hymnal; he also needs to have a deeper learning and knowledge regarding the hymns in order to be able to call a proper hymn in the meeting.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 14:12 Paul says, &ldquo;Seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.&rdquo; If we desire and seek to excel, we must learn. The Corinthians liked to speak in tongues, which does not require learning. However, if someone wants to prophesy, he needs to study and know the Bible. In this verse Paul indicates that speaking in tongues does not excel but is relatively inferior. In other words, although a person may have the gift of tongues, it is not an excelling gift, whereas to have the gift of prophesying is excelling. This truly indicates that prophesying includes learning. At the end of chapter 14, Paul says again, &ldquo;So then, my brothers, desire earnestly the prophesying&rdquo; (v. 39). I hope that we would all earnestly desire to prophesy.</p>
<p>In regard to learning the truth for prophesying, we need to pay attention to several matters.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO TEACH THE BELIEVERS<br />
TO OBSERVE ALL THAT THE LORD COMMANDED</h2>
<p>First, in Matthew 28:20 the Lord personally charged His disciples saying, &ldquo;[Teach] them to observe all that I have commanded you.&rdquo; This clearly says that we need to teach the believers all that the Lord commanded. When there is teaching, there is the need to learn. If someone is teaching but no one is learning, the teaching is useless. Moreover, concerning observing, not only we ourselves should observe; we should also teach others to observe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE BELIEVERS<br />
TO CONTINUE STEADFASTLY IN THE TEACHING<br />
OF THE APOSTLES</h2>
<p>Second, the believers need to continue steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles. Immediately after Pentecost in Acts 2, the condition of the saved ones was that of continuing &ldquo;steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles&rdquo; (v. 42). The teaching of the apostles is the teaching concerning the Lord Jesus, and it is the teaching the Lord commanded the disciples to observe in Matthew 28:20. On the day of Pentecost Peter, James, and John observed the Lord&rsquo;s word and taught others concerning what the Lord had commanded them. Their teaching became the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR APOSTLES TO TEACH UNCEASINGLY<br />
IN BIG MEETINGS AND IN HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Third, apostles need to teach unceasingly in big meetings and in home meetings. In Acts 5:42 we see that the apostles taught wherever they were, whether in the temple or in the homes, and they &ldquo;did not cease teaching.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE BELIEVERS<br />
TO ALWAYS LEARN AND TO COME TO<br />
THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>Fourth, the believers need to always learn and to come to the full knowledge of the truth. Second Timothy 3:7 says that there are people who though always learning are never able to come to the full knowledge of the truth. To come to the full knowledge of the truth requires our learning; our learning should enable us to know the truth. First Timothy 2:4 says that God &ldquo;desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth.&rdquo; Here <em>full knowledge</em> means an adequate knowledge. The truth requires our learning; it is insufficient to have only inspiration. While inspiration can touch one&rsquo;s spirit, it does not help one&rsquo;s mind. Only when one&rsquo;s mind is exercised continuously can he know the truth, the reality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE BELIEVERS TO LET<br />
THE WORD OF CHRIST DWELL IN THEM RICHLY</h2>
<p>Fifth, we need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly (Col. 3:16). How can we let the word of Christ dwell in us richly? If we read the Bible merely in a routine way, the Lord&rsquo;s word will not be able to dwell in us. We need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly in all wisdom and by means of all wisdom. This indicates that by means of all wisdom we need to exercise our mind, to exercise our ability to comprehend, to read, to listen, to write, and to learn, as well as to exercise other means so that the Lord&rsquo;s word may enter into us.</p>
<p>If we want to speak in the meetings and exercise the gift of prophesying, we need to have a certain amount of learning. Without learning, it will be difficult for us to prophesy well. Fifty years ago, we thought that a person would be able to speak whenever there was an outpouring of the Holy Spirit. This is true in regard to speaking in tongues and foretelling, but it is not true in regard to prophesying. Because of this, some Bible translators in the past translated <em>prophesying</em> as &ldquo;speaking the word as a prophet.&rdquo; In order to speak the word, a person must learn the word; without learning the word, a person has no way to speak the word. Likewise, a person cannot prophesy simply by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit; rather, a prophecy results from an inspiration that is joined to the Bible as its base, that is, to a person&rsquo;s knowledge of the Bible that he already has within him. Prophesying is carried out in the principle of incarnation, the principle that God and man cooperate together; a man can speak for God and speak forth God only according to this principle.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE BELIEVERS<br />
TO BE EXPERIENCED IN THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD<br />
THROUGH EXERCISE AND PRACTICE</h2>
<p>Sixth, we need to be experienced in the Lord&rsquo;s word through exercise and practice (Heb. 5:13-14). Hebrews 5:14 says, &ldquo;Who because of practice have their faculties exercised for discriminating between both good and evil.&rdquo; Here <em>faculties</em> can mean senses, implying the powers of perception. Our faculties can become experienced by our exercise and practice. Hence, when we study the Lord&rsquo;s word, we need to exercise our mind, apprehension, memory, and understanding; if we are willing to exercise properly, we will become experienced. As long as some people have the Bible in their hands, they can skillfully link Hebrews to Matthew and then link Matthew to Romans. Sometimes they may even be able to link these books to the Old Testament. A person can do this if he is experienced in using the Bible, whereas this is extremely difficult for one who has just begun to study the Bible. Therefore, if we want to be prophets in the word of God, we must have a foundation in the words of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THOSE WHO ARE LEARNED<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD TO COMMIT<br />
WHAT THEY HAVE LEARNED<br />
TO THOSE WHO WILL BE COMPETENT<br />
TO TEACH OTHERS ALSO</h2>
<p>Seventh, those who are learned in the Lord&rsquo;s word need to commit what they have learned to those who will be competent to teach others also. Second Timothy 2:2 says, &ldquo;The things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also.&rdquo; If a person knows the Lord&rsquo;s word and also knows that a certain brother is a faithful one, he should teach that brother; moreover, the purpose of his teaching that brother is so that the brother would teach others also. However, if a brother does not learn what he has been taught, it will be difficult for him to teach others. We need to learn whatever we are taught; then after we learn, we can teach others. In short, if we want to learn to prophesy in the church, we need to labor on the Lord&rsquo;s word and learn how to speak for God and speak forth God. No one can teach others without first learning himself. Hence, we all need to endeavor to learn to prophesy and then teach others to prophesy.</p>
<p>Through the study of the new way in the recent years and through the revelation the Lord has shown us, we have seen that prophesying is the most important practice for the building up of the church. Hence, we are considering before God how to train the elders in regard to leading and speaking so that all the elders may be apt to teach. If we were able to train one thousand elders to be apt to teach, it would be an easy task to gospelize the whole island of Taiwan. If these one thousand elders were sent to five hundred places, I believe that five hundred churches would be raised up within a year. We truly hope to be able to carry this out. However, not only the elders need to learn but all the saints in the church life also need to be serious learners.</p>
<p>The secret to being an elder lies in being able to lead the church and in being one who is apt to teach. If an elder has learned these two items, it will be easy for him to administrate the church. Thus, an elder who means business will realize that it is not easy to be an elder because it is not the same as being a civil servant who works from nine to five and only takes care of his assigned duties. In contrast, it is easy to be a nominal elder, one who sleeps peacefully every night and cares for nothing. It does not matter to him whether the singing is proper, whether the saints understand the Scriptures, whether there is a supply in the meeting, or whether the condition of the saints is good. To be this kind of elder is easy and comfortable.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this kind of elder will make the saints suffer and cause them to murmur. When the church has problems, such an elder cannot handle them. When the saints have troubles, such an elder cannot bear the burdens. He will not only cause the church to suffer but also stir up murmurings. Eventually, such a brother may say that he does not want to be an elder any longer. Therefore, the most difficult thing in the church life is for the elders to lead the meetings and be apt to teach.</p>
<p>It would be wonderful if all the elders from the more than one hundred churches in Taiwan were able to pass through a two-month training in which they could learn how to lead the churches. First Timothy 3:2 uses the words <em>apt to teach</em> and 5:17 speaks of taking the lead well. If all the elders learn to be apt to teach and to take the lead well, the church will flourish. Concerning these two matters, taking the lead well is not as difficult as being apt to teach. Experience tells us that it is somewhat easy to serve and to lead people, but it often takes great effort to teach others. For instance, if we want to teach a person mathematics, we must first learn mathematics; if we want to teach someone how to use a computer, we must first have some knowledge of computers. In the same principle, in order to teach others to be prophets, to speak for God, we must first labor on the Lord&rsquo;s word. I hope that all the young people, including the sisters, will receive this word, be trained, pursue the Lord, love the Lord, give themselves to the Lord, and most importantly, enter into the Lord&rsquo;s word and be able to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word. We all need to learn how to speak the Lord into people by speaking His word.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE EXERCISE OF SPEAKING<br />
IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Concerning speaking, every elder must speak in the meetings. No one can escape this. At the very least, the elders need to give announcements in the meetings; thus, it is necessary for them to learn to speak in the meetings. This kind of speaking is different from speaking at home or conversing with people. When we speak in the meetings, we need to raise our voice and speak loudly so that others can hear us. Sometimes in the meetings people speak in a low and soft voice. This causes people to suffer; this kind of voice is a burden to the ears. Not only should we prophesy loudly in the big meetings, but we should also lift up our voice and speak loudly even in a small gathering of eight to ten people. This means that our throat must be clear and our voice strong. We should not speak softly; rather, we should lift up our voice and speak with certainty and assurance.</p>
<p>Another point concerning speaking is that our spirit must be released. Generally speaking, when people are angry, they cannot release their anger unless they shout. The louder they shout, the more they let their anger out. When we release our spirit, we also need to lift up our voice and speak loudly. Just as people need to release their anger by raising their voice when they are angry, we also need to raise our voice when we exercise our spirit. In this way, people can hear us. This is what we must learn and practice. Seminary students are required to take a class concerning methods of preaching, which teaches them how to preach. This class teaches them to pay attention to their voice and tone while preaching. When I was younger, I realized the importance of these points, so I purposely used to go to the seashore where there was no one else. There I would practice speaking, especially paying attention to my voice and tone. At times, I also stood in front of a mirror and paid attention to my gestures while speaking. All these exercises related to speaking are helpful.</p>
<p>Since the elders are in the position of elders, they should carry out the duties relevant to their position. In other words, since they are elders, they must speak, and they must speak in a way that people can understand. Now that we know the importance and necessity of speaking, we should all the more encourage the saints to learn and to exercise. This will be a great help to our meetings. The result of our exercise over the span of a few months and years will have a great impact on the building up of the church. Moreover, there is one point that we need to pay attention to; that is, while we usually compose with a pen, we must now compose with our mouth. Thus, we must begin to exercise and learn to speak well. Whether a written composition or a speech is considered good or bad depends very much upon how it begins. Like a basketball or soccer game, if there is a bad start, it is difficult to continue in a good way. Hence, the beginning is extremely important. If there is a good beginning, whatever follows will be easy. This is a principle.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we are going to give a message or prophecy, we need to carefully consider the beginning word or sentence; we should never consider this casually. Some people speak casually, so their words have no impact. The renowned preacher C. H. Spurgeon once spoke of a person whose heart had grown feet. This utterance captured everyone&rsquo;s attention, causing them to desire to know how a person&rsquo;s heart could grow feet and what Spurgeon was actually referring to. Spurgeon spoke this in reference to not loving the world. A heart that has feet is able to run after many things. Hence, a person whose heart has feet is one whose heart has been attracted to the things of the world and who has begun to love and pursue after these worldly things. This kind of eloquence in speaking leaves people with a deep impression that is difficult for them to forget.</p>
<p>Many of Spurgeon&rsquo;s sermons are full of good utterances. When speaking of forgiving others, he used an illustration of people burying a dead dog but leaving the tail above the ground. Although the dog is gone, there is still a reminder. This often is our experience. We may tell people that a certain brother once seriously offended us but that we have forgiven him. This is to bury a dead dog but not bury its tail. Although we may have forgiven the brother, we still frequently mention the matter to others. This is not genuine forgiveness. Although Spurgeon&rsquo;s example was small, it left people with a lasting impression. In this regard, we not only need to learn to speak in the meetings, but we also need to consider and exercise in every aspect of our speaking so that our words may be effective.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEARNING THE TRUTH FOR PROPHESYING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PROPHETS SEEKING NOT THE LETTER<br />
BUT THE LORD HIMSELF</h2>
<p>The first stanza of <em>Hymns,</em> #806 reads, &ldquo;Break Thou the Bread of Life, / Dear Lord, to me, / As Thou didst break the loaves / Beside the sea; / Beyond the sacred page / I seek Thee, Lord; / My spirit pants for Thee, / O Living Word.&rdquo; This hymn may have been written by the Brethren because it contains types and figures. For instance, stanza 1 says, &ldquo;Break Thou the Bread of Life, / Dear Lord, to me; / As Thou didst break the loaves / Beside the sea.&rdquo; Stanza 4 says, &ldquo;Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord, / To me, to me, / As Thou didst bless the bread / By Galilee.&rdquo; This kind of imagery is similar to what can be found in Brethren hymns. This hymn contains a crucial point that shows the kind of person we should be and the kind of attitude and desire we should have, if we desire to seek the word of the Lord.</p>
<p>This hymn also shows that the writer was not seeking mere biblical doctrine but the Lord Himself. Hence, the second half of stanza 1 reads, &ldquo;Beyond the sacred page / I seek Thee, Lord; / My spirit pants for Thee, / O Living Word.&rdquo; Then the second half of stanza 3 says, &ldquo;Show me the truth concealed / Within Thy Word, / And in Thy Book revealed / I see the Lord.&rdquo; The author of this hymn was not seeking doctrines but the Lord Himself in the Word.</p>
<p>Stanza 4 reads, &ldquo;Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord, / To me, to me, / As Thou didst bless the bread / By Galilee; / Then shall all bondage cease, / All fetters fall, / And I shall find my peace, / My All in all.&rdquo; Everyone who seeks to prophesy, who seeks the Lord&rsquo;s word, should learn of the spirit and attitude demonstrated in this hymn. We need to see that we are not seeking the truth as doctrine or as letter. Instead, we are seeking the Lord of reality, the Lord Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LABORING IN OUR DAILY LIVING<br />
TO HAVE RICHES TO OFFER IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We may all be familiar with 1 Corinthians 14:26, yet this verse is difficult to apprehend. Paul says, &ldquo;What then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.&rdquo; Here, <em>psalm</em> does not refer to a hymn like those in our hymnal but to a long poem. According to history, the apostles came out of the background of Judaism and were able to quote long poems from Psalms. Thus, the Greek word for <em>psalm</em> refers to a long poem from Psalms. This verse also says that each one &ldquo;has a teaching, has a revelation.&rdquo; A teaching pertains to a teacher, and a revelation pertains to a prophet. Verse 26 goes on to say, &ldquo;Let all things be done for building up.&rdquo; Building up can also be rendered as &ldquo;edifying.&rdquo; This means that our speaking should edify the saints individually and the church corporately; it should edify the individual members as well as the whole Body.</p>
<p><em>Has</em> is a crucial word in this verse. Brother Watchman Nee rightly explains this word. He says that <em>has</em> means that we do not wait until we come to the meeting to have something but that we prepare something before we come to the meeting. Over twenty years ago, when we were speaking messages on this topic, we saw the type in the Old Testament (Deut. 16:16-17). When the children of Israel went to the feasts in Jerusalem, God charged them not to go empty-handed. Everyone who went to the feasts had to bring with him the rich produce of the good land, whether it was oxen, sheep, pigeons, barley, grains, or fruit. A person could not come empty-handed (v. 16). Going to the feasts without empty hands is equivalent to <em>has</em> in 1 Corinthians 14:26. Every Israelite was required to have something to offer to God, whether an ox, a sheep, pigeons, barley, grain, or fruit. This indicates that our speaking in the meetings should not be an instant speaking but should come from the riches that we have prepared beforehand.</p>
<p>The type in Deuteronomy 16 clearly reveals that before coming to the meetings, we should all prepare something, just as the children of Israel did not go to the feasts empty-handed but brought with them the produce of the good land. Moreover, they were required to prepare the produce properly, bring it to Mount Zion, and offer it in the outer court of the temple. This is clearly spoken of in the Old Testament. Every time we come to a meeting, we must prepare beforehand, praying to the Lord to see which portion of the Word can be offered before God for the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s people; this is how we should prepare.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we noticed that the word <em>has</em> appears five times in 1 Corinthians 14:26. <em>Has</em> does not refer to something miraculous, such as a sign or wonder. <em>Has</em> implies that something is obtained through labor and preparation. In the Old Testament the children of Israel obtained the rich produce of the good land by labor. The produce did not grow by itself simply because God sent the rain. Although a large part of the produce was the result of God&rsquo;s work, if the children of Israel did not plow the ground, cultivate the land, rear the oxen, sheep, and pigeons, and plant the fruit trees, where would the produce come from? Hence, although it is absolutely true that God blessed them, that God sent the rain, and that God caused the land to grow fruit, all of God&rsquo;s activities required the cooperation of human labor.</p>
<p>Our speaking in the meetings should come from what we have obtained from God through our daily labor. If we labor on the good land by cultivating the land, trimming the orchard, and rearing the oxen, sheep, and pigeons, we will have a rich harvest. However, if we are slothful, not much fruit and grain and not many oxen and sheep will be produced. As a result, we will go to the feasts empty-handed. Later, the children of Israel offended God, and there was a barrier between them and God; thus, their labor became futile because no matter how hard they labored, God did not send the rain. Without rain, the land could not yield anything. God even sent the wind not only to dry up their fruit but also to dry out the soil.</p>
<p>When I first visited Israel in 1958, I received the impression that the whole land was covered with sand and rocks, which were thoroughly dry because of the wind. Due to the lack of rain, the soil was not able to hold together. On the one hand, there was no rain, and on the other hand, the wind blew continuously. Ultimately, the soil was blown away, and what remained was dry land. Dry land was everywhere. For several hundred years, the wind has continued to blow over the land of Palestine and there has been little rain. After hundreds and thousands of years, the land is as described in Deuteronomy 28:23: &ldquo;Your sky, which is above your head, will be bronze, and the land, which is under you, iron.&rdquo; Bronze cannot bring forth rain, and iron cannot yield produce. Olive trees were the one thing growing in that land, and even their condition was poor. The olive trees were small and they had only a few roots and a few thin branches. In some areas, growing olives was the sole industry.</p>
<p>This shows that, on one hand, we should endeavor to labor, but on the other hand, if we are not right with God, we should not expect to have a rich harvest. This means that although we may exert our effort in God&rsquo;s word, if there is a barrier between us and God, we should not expect a rich harvest; rather, we will receive nothing. Anyone can read the Bible. Mr. Hu Shih, a Chinese scholar, read the Bible. He was an important leader who introduced significant literary reforms in China in the early part of the twentieth century. He was a person who had read many books. Eventually, he grouped the Chinese Union Version of the Bible with a number of popular books of Chinese fiction; he understood the Bible in the same way he understood fiction. Moreover, he considered the two most well known works of fiction in the Chinese language and the Chinese Union Version as three excellent books that best show the progress of vernacular Chinese. If people understand the Bible in this way, they will not receive blessing. This is why Mr. Hu Shih was never saved.</p>
<p>Although reading the Bible is right, a person must also be right in order to reap the benefits of reading. What kind of book the Bible is depends on the kind of person reading it. Mr. Hu Shih sought for the improvement of vernacular Chinese; thus, the only thing he found in the Bible was progress in vernacular Chinese. He did not see anything else in the Bible. If a person is not right, his heart too will not be right, and as a result, neither his pursuit nor his goal will be right. This makes it difficult for a person to reap anything positive.</p><h2 class="head1">IN ORDER TO HAVE A TEACHING,<br />
ONE NEEDING TO KNOW GOD AND GOD&rsquo;S WAYS<br />
AND TO HAVE A PROPER BEING</h2>
<p>If we want to be prophets, we must have a foundation in God&rsquo;s word; without a foundation in God&rsquo;s word, it will be difficult for us to speak for God. Moreover, our person must be right; if our person is not right, it will be futile even if we can prophesy well. The prophets need the revelations in God&rsquo;s word, and the teachers who present a teaching also need the riches of God. When I was newly saved, I was desirous of the truth and tried my best to find books to read. At that time, I was a poor student and did not have much money. In addition, I did not live in a big city, so not many books were available; nevertheless, I still did my best to buy books.</p>
<p>When I first began to read, I did not have much discernment, and I thought that all the books were good. I read one book that expounded the matter of the leaven in Matthew 13:33. This verse says that leaven was hidden in three measures of meal. The book explained that leaven is the power of the gospel that motivates the democratic nation and society. When I first read this, I felt that it was a good exposition. Gradually, however, as I joined the meetings of the Brethren assembly, heard their expositions, and read their books, I began to realize that the mention of leaven throughout the entire Bible, whether in the Old Testament or in the New Testament, is always related to something evil. First, it signifies evil; second, it signifies corrupted things, because of the germs within the leaven. This exposition has its scriptural basis in the Old Testament. After keeping the Feast of the Passover, the children of Israel kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread in which they ate unleavened bread (Exo. 23:14-15). In the New Testament the Lord Jesus also spoke regarding leaven, saying, &ldquo;Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees&rdquo; (Matt. 16:6). After learning the correct interpretation of leaven, I abhorred the harmful books that I had read. For them to cheat me of my money is a matter of little consequence, but it is a serious thing for them to deceive my mind and rob my energy.</p>
<p>It is not easy to be a good teacher and to expound the teachings in the Bible. Moreover, not everyone can expound the Bible, because the Bible is not an ordinary book to be read and understood by anyone according to his own taste. The Bible has its principles. Thus, in order to speak for God, we need to see the revelations contained in the Bible; then when we teach people, we must take God&rsquo;s riches as the content and reality in our teaching. Only in this way can people touch God and receive God&rsquo;s riches in our words. Furthermore, we need to instruct people concerning the ordinances, principles, and statutes in God&rsquo;s Word; this will constitute a good prophecy.</p>
<p>Psalm 103:7 says, &ldquo;He made His ways known to Moses; / His acts, to the children of Israel.&rdquo; This indicates that for a teacher to apply God&rsquo;s word, he needs to know God and God&rsquo;s ways. Only then can his speaking minister God to others, open their eyes, and cause them to know the ways of God. God&rsquo;s ways are the laws, the principles, by which God acts. For example, we know that God is righteous and that He never does things that are unrighteous; this is a law, a principle. If we want to help people to see this principle of God, we should never do anything that wrongs another person. Only when we ourselves have come to know the ways of God will we be able to teach them to others. Hence, a person who teaches and preaches must enjoy God and know both God and God&rsquo;s ways. Obtaining a basic constitution of the truth does not come simply by linking together a few verses in the Bible prior to coming to the meeting; it does not come so easily.</p>
<p>Prophesying and teaching require us to be persons who know God, enjoy God, and know God&rsquo;s ways, God&rsquo;s rules, and God&rsquo;s principles. We must familiarize ourselves with the stories in the Old Testament so that in these stories we may see God and God&rsquo;s ways and thus be able to derive messages from them. Then when we speak, we will enable others to realize that God is full of lovingkindness, full of forgiveness, and abounding in grace. In this way, we speak forth God and speak God into others for their enjoyment.</p>
<p>Genuine teachings come from our labor in God&rsquo;s word; nevertheless, this differs from studying hard in school as a student. It does not matter whether the being of a student studying in school is right or not; his results will be fine as long as he studies hard. The school cannot determine that because a student is a thief, he will not do well academically, nor can it expect that because another student is a modest gentleman, he will obtain a perfect score on his exam. The score one obtains on an examination depends upon how much effort one puts in. Even if a student is a thief, as long as he spends time to study hard before an examination, he will be able to earn a good score. In contrast, if a person both steals and spends time studying God&rsquo;s word, he absolutely will not obtain a perfect score, because his person is not right. His person disqualifies him from speaking concerning God&rsquo;s ways, because God&rsquo;s ways are righteous and therefore will not permit any stealing. Hence, when we speak for God, our person must be right.</p><h2 class="head1">IN ORDER TO HAVE A REVELATION, A PERSON NEEDING TO BE ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD<br />
TO KNOW THE MYSTERY OF GOD</h2>
<p>The requirement concerning revelation is even higher, because a revelation is God making known the intent of His heart. Psalm 25:14 says, &ldquo;The intimate counsel of Jehovah is to those who fear Him.&rdquo; Intimate counsel carries a sense of revelation, indicating that if we want to receive God&rsquo;s revelation, we must be those who draw near to Him. If we are those who draw near to God, contact Him, and are joined to Him, we will be one spirit with the Lord. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; If we are joined to the Lord in spirit, we will surely receive revelation. Revelation is different from teaching and is deeper than teaching; it requires us to be those who draw near to God, fellowship with God, be one spirit with the Lord every day, and labor on the Bible continually; if we are such persons, God will reveal much to us through the words of the Bible. This kind of revelation does not necessarily come to us in the church meetings but is obtained through our reading the Word and praying at home during our daily living.</p>
<p>Revelation primarily enables us to know the mystery of God, which in the New Testament is God&rsquo;s economy. This New Testament economy consists mainly of two great mysteries: the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ. The mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church. Hence, Christ and the church are the two great mysteries in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This is not a teaching; it is altogether a revelation.</p>
<p>A person does not receive this kind of revelation by memorizing the Bible. A person may be familiar with the Bible and adept in linking together verses in the Bible, yet he may not have any revelation or light. We must realize that we will not necessarily have light simply because we are familiar with the Bible. Having light is altogether a matter of our spirit.</p>
<p>The Bible is a great book. Though people may expound it using their wild imagination, it never loses its greatness and authenticity. I was born into fundamental and organized Christianity and read a number of books after I was saved; nevertheless, it was not until I met the Brethren that I began to know some of the fundamental and accurate truths. The truth that the Brethren taught was pure and accurate. This was a great adjustment and cleansing for me, allowing me to become clear concerning all the improper doctrines that I had received. Later, I came into contact with Brother Nee. He was a person who knew the Bible very well. Both of us had contacted what fundamental Christianity passed down.</p>
<p>In the history of Christianity from the sixth century to the sixteenth century, a total of ten centuries, the Roman Catholic Church locked up the Bible, causing the church to fall into the Dark Ages, an age without God&rsquo;s word, revelation, and light. In the 1500s Martin Luther rose up to introduce some reforms. Prior to Luther, people such as John Wycliffe and John Huss had already begun the work of reformation. The state churches and private churches that were produced by the Reformation were all orthodox. Then in the eighteenth century, John Wesley rose up. At the same time, in the southern part of Germany Count Zinzendorf opened his estate to the Lord&rsquo;s believers because of his love for Him. This resulted in the producing of the Moravian Brethren and brought in a great revival. A century later, the British Brethren were raised up. All the Brethren groups were orthodox. In the interval the mystics were also raised up, and they too were orthodox. Later, William Law made mysticism practical and brought in the matter of the inner life. We have inherited everything orthodox from the past nineteen hundred years.</p>
<p>Bible exposition has its unchanging principles, which have been established through the studies by Bible scholars throughout the generations over the past nineteen hundred years. We must solemnly say that through our collecting and compiling work, most of these riches have been &ldquo;crystallized&rdquo; in the Recovery Version of the New Testament. If we read the footnotes of the Recovery Version of the New Testament carefully from beginning to end, we will see that all the principles are contained in it. These principles form the standard that secures our understanding, comprehension, and expounding of the Bible so that we would not stray from the truth. These principles also apply in our expounding of the prophecies, types, plain texts, and history of the Bible. Because the Bible is the revelation of the mystery of God, our application of these principles will preserve us from straying off.</p>
<p>In summary, in order to receive a revelation we must be proper persons. Our being must be right, and we must be those who seek the Lord Himself and are able to teach something. This is the minimum requirement. Second, we must advance further. Not only must we be right, but we must also know the spirit and have deep fellowship with the Lord in spirit. Hence, we need to be teachers who are able to teach something and prophets who are able to speak for the Lord. In prophesying, we speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord. A large part of prophesying consists of revelation. For example, the praise offered by Mary is a prophecy, but it is also full of light and revelation. She said, &ldquo;My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has exulted in God my Savior&rdquo; (Luke 1:46-47). This word is a word of revelation. If we want to prophesy in such a way, our person must not only be right, but our spirit must also maintain close fellowship with the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">THE URGENT NEED AT PRESENT BEING THE ABILITY<br />
TO LEAD, TO TEACH, AND TO PROPHESY</h2>
<p>At home most of the married brothers listen to their wives. If their wives are proper, the husbands will be able to serve peacefully. Hence, in the church life it is necessary to lead the sisters well. According to my observation in 1946, the sisters in Shanghai, especially the middle-aged sisters, were more trustworthy than the brothers. This was due to the help rendered behind the scenes by Ruth Lee and Peace Wang. These two sisters helped the sisters in Shanghai to be obedient and submissive. Because the leading sisters overthrew the &ldquo;nest&rdquo; of problems, the brothers and the co-workers had no problems whatsoever in regard to the sisters&rsquo; service.</p>
<p>Ants have nests, but the ants will leave if the nest is toppled. These two sisters&mdash;Ruth Lee and Peace Wang&mdash;were skillful in overturning the &ldquo;nests.&rdquo; No matter which household had problems, as long as these two sisters handled them, everything was solved. Hence, the work is difficult if no one leads the sisters. The experienced sisters need to be able to lead the sisters and teach them at the same time. Ruth Lee was truly apt to teach. She wrote hymn #127 in our Chinese hymnal. This hymn was written in a skillful and precise manner. From it we can tell that she was a teacher, one who was apt to teach.</p>
<p>If all of the brothers and sisters learn to prophesy, it will be a great matter. When they go out, they will all be useful wherever they go. Within half a year, churches will be raised up one after another. In another three or five years, there will be churches all over Taiwan. This is what we need today. If we want to gospelize Taiwan, we must carry it out in this way. In order to gospelize Taiwan within the next five years, we need to develop these three matters: the ability to lead, teach, and prophesy. Once we succeed in these three matters, the purpose of the full-time training will be accomplished.</p>
<p>In the early days, when we came to Taiwan to serve full-time, we were empty-handed and had nothing. Fifteen years later, however, thousands of people had been saved, and group after group of elders and co-workers were perfected; this was due to leading, teaching, and speaking the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>These three matters are the most important matters related to administrating the church; we must take the lead well, be apt to teach, and be able to prophesy. If we look back in history, we will find that the success of the church depends upon leading, teaching, and prophesying. Whenever leading is lacking, weakness is manifested; whenever teaching is lacking, breaches and leaks occur; and whenever prophesying is lacking, there is no strength. However, when some are able to take the lead, are apt to teach, and are rich in prophesying, the Lord&rsquo;s work will be strong and the church will prosper. I hope that the elders will take this word and not merely understand it but strive together so that the church can advance even further.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING AND LEADING IN MANY ASPECTS</h2>
<p>On one hand, leading is general; on the other hand, leading involves many details. An elder should not be afraid of being capable. For instance, he should not be afraid to know multiple languages. Darby, an Englishman, was competent in English. He was a scholar produced by the Episcopalian Church and translated the Old Testament and the New Testament into three languages&mdash;English, French, and German. Moreover, he also knew the two original languages of the Bible&mdash;Hebrew and Greek. Hence, he was proficient in all five languages, not just familiar with them in a general sense. He remained single for his whole life, and consequently all of his time and energy were spent on studies and acquiring proficiency in these languages. This enabled him to do the work of translating the Bible. This was not a simple task. Laboring in this way, he became the &ldquo;king of Bible exposition&rdquo; in the past two hundred years of Christian history.</p>
<p>Due to certain circumstances, I was not able to obtain a college degree; nevertheless, after I was saved, I studied on my own because of various needs. Eventually, what I obtained through self-study exceeded what I had learned in school. This shows that we really need to learn and continue to pursue further studies.</p>
<p>In a sense, there is no need for training centers; I myself have never gone through any training. One time, some brothers asked me, &ldquo;Brother Nee praised you and said that your progress could be likened to flying; please tell us how you &lsquo;fly&rsquo;?&rdquo; This question was difficult to answer, because what use would it be for them to ask me how I fly if they would not fly? In fact, all they needed to do was fly. If we want to know how to fly, the best way is to fly. If we try, we will learn to do it. At the beginning we may have no idea how to fly, but we will learn within a few hours. When I was young, I did not learn to ride a bicycle. Later, when I went to Shanghai at the age of thirty, I needed to ride a bicycle for transportation. At that time, no one was able to teach me, so I borrowed an old bicycle and learned on my own. When I first tried, I fell, but I tried repeatedly. Through repeatedly getting up and falling down, I eventually learned to ride skillfully. This is why there is the saying &ldquo;Where there is a will, there is a way.&rdquo; As long as we have the heart to do something and are persistent in carrying it out, we will succeed.</p>
<p>What lies before us is a great opportunity; the whole earth is our work place. Our only concern should be that of not entering in. If we enter in and propagate, the future will be immeasurable. Hence, whether we are elders or co-workers, we should proceed toward this goal. The co-workers must have an adequate pursuing. If we are inadequate in languages, it will be difficult for us to propagate anywhere. Today in Taiwan, for the purpose of international trade, people regard learning languages as a very important matter. If a businessman wants his products to spread into a certain country, he must at least know the language of that country. If he does not, it will be difficult for him to create business contacts. As a result, some university students in Taiwan not only know English but have also learned Spanish. After they graduate from college, they can enter the import and export trade. Some may even go to South America to do business there.</p>
<p>A Christian from Chile told me that the suit pants and shirt he wore, though bought in Chile, were in fact imported from Taiwan. This shows Taiwan&rsquo;s position in the international market. This is the world situation. All the more, we must not fail to advance in the Lord&rsquo;s work. For example, the aborigines and local Taiwanese are all within our reach and need our visitation. It is a shame if none of the co-workers speak Taiwanese. Anyone who has a heart to serve must be able to speak Mandarin and Taiwanese in order to be qualified to be a co-worker. If we do not have this kind of spirit, how can we accomplish anything? Thus, we hope that we would all have an aggressive spirit so that we can propagate.</p>
<p>Although the supply of the word in our midst has been rich, and our spiritual publications have been bountiful, we still need to use some effort to receive the supply. For example, when we eat, we must use a little effort; no one is able to eat for us. In the same way, receiving the supply from God&rsquo;s word also depends on our effort. Sometimes we may be so busy that we think it troublesome to eat three meals a day. In this respect, our human body can be very troublesome. Not only does it need to eat, but it also needs to get rid of the waste and be maintained in many other ways. On one hand, this may be troublesome, but on the other hand, if we do not serve our bodies well, our bodies will not and cannot serve and work for us.</p>
<p>All the leading brothers in the churches should study the content of this book so that the churches under their leading might be living. Some elders have said that given the condition of their localities, no matter how much they endeavor, it is difficult to go on. This may be true, but even in such an unfavorable condition, considerable progress can still be made if the elders are willing to endeavor. Let us consider the cleaning of the meeting hall. Everyone can improve the way that it is cleaned. There is room to improve the manner in which the curtains are opened and closed, the doors to the restrooms are pulled shut, and the chairs are arranged in the meeting hall. Perhaps the present condition is already satisfactory; nevertheless, there is always room for improvement. It is always good to make progress. As long as we all have the heart to endeavor, the churches will be able to advance.</p>
<p>Due to the Lord&rsquo;s grace in the past, there are more than one hundred churches in Taiwan. If all of these churches, regardless of size, would rise up, if the elders would take the lead well and be apt to teach, and if the young ones would strive, be faithful, and prophesy well, the future will be bright. Let us consider the church in Kaohsiung. The situation of this church is very good. If the brothers would resolve to strive together, I believe that the whole church would have a new look within a year and the number of saints meeting would double. If this does not occur, the brothers who coordinate should come together to fast, pray, and come up with a strategy. They should not let the situation go. Since the Lord has given us so many brothers and sisters who love Him, so many rich truths, a definite ground, and a clear way, we should take the lead faithfully and bring in a flourishing situation. May we not go home and sleep peacefully; rather, let us give our whole being to strive and endeavor. If we do not, even the angels cannot help us.</p><h2 class="head1">AVOIDING HAVING DIFFERENT OPINIONS</h2>
<p>From now on we need to strive and push toward the goal of taking the lead well, being apt to teach, and prophesying well. The young people should never have differences of opinion or live according to their moods. Instead, they should go on steadily in the church life. I co-labored with Brother Nee for eighteen years. May the Lord cover me with His blood; in those eighteen years I never expressed any opinion to Brother Nee. He used to turn toward me in the co-workers&rsquo; meetings and ask, &ldquo;Brother Witness, what do you think?&rdquo; I would smile and not say a word. I maintained an attitude of obedience because I was not taking the lead. I simply obeyed; I did whatever he wanted me to do, and I went wherever he wanted me to go. This was my attitude. In those eighteen years, I never voiced an opinion. Furthermore, all the messages I spoke in those eighteen years were Brother Nee&rsquo;s messages. I would even tell the saints the year in which Brother Nee had released the message that I was speaking. I never considered it a shame to speak Brother Nee&rsquo;s messages; on the contrary, I was proud of it. I am not exaggerating. In January of 1934, after I heard ten messages in a conference in Shanghai, I went back to Chefoo, and by June I had repeated those ten messages. This was how closely I followed Brother Nee in the past.</p>
<p>Today the most damaging things to the Lord&rsquo;s work in His recovery are opinions and gossip. These things are a big shame to us. Once we have differences in opinion and live according to our moods, it will be difficult for us to continue on in the Lord&rsquo;s way. We all need to learn to be without opinion. A person who is not taking the lead should obey the directions he receives, and one who takes the lead should provide directions. If we can neither give directions nor follow directions, we are through. I have had many experiences of riding in people&rsquo;s cars. I have learned not to say anything when a brother is driving. I do not say to go north or south, to turn right or left, or to go fast or slow. The only exception occurred when a brother and I drove from Las Vegas to Los Angeles in the middle of the night during the winter. The brother fell asleep while driving, and upon seeing it, I needed to remind him that for our safety he should not fall asleep. Often people express many opinions while riding in the cars of other people. This makes it difficult for the drivers.</p>
<p>I hope that all the elders and co-workers will avoid expressing different opinions in the work. If all the co-workers, elders, and full-time serving ones avoid expressing their opinions, the churches will be blessed. Where there is opinion, there the church is through; even if the opinion is the greatest and brightest, it is still useless. This can be compared to a chemical experiment; opinion is like the corrupting factor in the experiment. No matter where this factor is added, the experiment is ruined. Hence, whether we are co-workers, elders, or young full-timers, we need to realize that when we serve together, we need to learn to have no opinion. Ahead of us is only one goal. All the elders and co-workers should not have any opinion when they go back to their localities. Instead, they should take the lead well, teach well, and prophesy well. They should also endeavor to labor on the Lord&rsquo;s word, pray much, pursue the truth, and seek the Lord Himself. Moreover, they need to have close and intimate fellowship with the Lord and live in spirit so that the Lord can give them light and revelation at any time. In this way, they will be able to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, and to speak forth the Lord, thereby bringing in great blessings for the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEARNING THE TRUTH FOR PROPHESYING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH SERVICE TODAY<br />
BEING OPEN TO ALL THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>The new way is entirely open to all the saints and all the churches. All of the opportunities in church service&mdash;preaching the gospel, home meetings, and group meetings&mdash;are open to everyone. There are many opportunities for us to function, and we all need to function to preach the gospel and to participate in home meetings, group meetings, and district meetings.</p>
<p>Presently, there are about ten thousand who attend the various meetings&mdash;home meetings, group meetings, and district meetings&mdash;of the church in Taipei. Those who attend are not merely numbers; each one represents an actual person with a name. In addition, there are approximately ten thousand saints who have become dormant over the years. We have also contacted over thirty-eight thousand people through door-knocking during the training. We are now able to take care of only eight thousand, but the remaining thirty thousand are left unattended. Through the brothers&rsquo; study and fellowship, we have found that it is worthwhile to continually labor on at least twenty thousand of these newly saved ones. According to this calculation, there are at present about forty thousand brothers and sisters who are waiting for us to labor on them. This demonstrates that if we temporarily stopped knocking on doors to gain new ones, we would still have forty thousand people waiting to be led and served.</p>
<p>Through our fellowship with all the churches and our consideration before the Lord, we feel that there are three places that urgently require our care and our labor&mdash;Tainan, Taichung, and Hsinchu. We should pay attention to the campus work in these places. If we ignore the campus work in these places, it is like eating chickens but ignoring their eggs. That would be pitiful. However, if we labor in these places, we will have to divert a part of the energy from Taipei, which still requires our labor. Furthermore, because of the great need and high quality of people in Taipei, many things can still be learned in this large church, that is, unless we do not have the heart. If we have the heart, we should remain in Taipei to observe and compare all the different aspects, whether right or wrong, whether good or bad. If we would do this, we will receive much benefit, and at minimum our field of vision will be broadened.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENDEAVORING TO PURSUE THE TRUTH<br />
IN ORDER TO PROPHESY WELL</h2>
<p>Today in the church there is not only the need to take the lead well and to teach well, but there is also the need to prophesy well. There are currently ninety-six districts in the church in Taipei. If in every district there is a prophet who can minister the word strongly and speak God&rsquo;s words precisely, accurately, and to the point, the entire church in Taipei will be able to spread rapidly. If a person were to ask why we stay in Taipei and do not go elsewhere after having been in the church for so many years, we should answer by saying, &ldquo;I am waiting for the ninety-seventh district to be formed so that I may go and be a prophet there.&rdquo; If all of us strive to press on in this way, perhaps two hundred districts will be produced by the end of the year. Each of these two hundred districts will need at least two prophets, and for this reason, we need to endeavor to exercise to be prophets. In fact, if there is a strong prophet in each district, the situation will stabilize. Even if the leading is not adequate, the condition of the district will be fine if there is a strong prophet. Even if the teaching is not satisfactory, the teaching can be strengthened in the prophesying. However, if all the other aspects are strong except for the prophesying, the manifestation will be poor and the need will not be met.</p>
<p>Paul realized the importance of prophesying; thus, he wrote 1 Corinthians 14, an entire chapter concerning the matter of prophesying. In verse 1 he says to &ldquo;desire earnestly...that you may prophesy.&rdquo; In verse 39, the last verse, he again charges, &ldquo;Desire earnestly the prophesying.&rdquo; Moreover, in verse 12, in the middle of the chapter, he says, &ldquo;Seek that you may excel for the building up.&rdquo; In this chapter Paul repeatedly spoke of prophesying. His hope for the church was that the church would prophesy. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.&rdquo; In this verse Paul speaks of three things. First, he speaks of love, which is easy to understand and is appreciated by everyone. Next, he speaks of the need to desire earnestly spiritual gifts. Then Paul goes on further to say that in desiring spiritual gifts, one should especially desire to prophesy. The word <em>prophesy</em> is rendered &ldquo;speak the word as a prophet&rdquo; in the Chinese Union Version. Prophesying is a big lack in Christianity and has been neglected even among us because of the harm done by the traditional concept and system. Now that the old system has passed away, everything in the church life is open to the saints, and everyone has the opportunity to speak. This is a great opportunity for all of us.</p>
<p>If the elders in all the churches rise up to urge the saints to learn the truth, dive into the truth, and enter into the riches of the spiritual publications, the content of the church life will be greatly enriched. Currently, among the churches in the United States, the churches in Texas are the best in this matter. The Life-studies are everywhere in the saints&rsquo; homes&mdash;in the bedrooms, on the dressers, on the nightstands, and even in the bathrooms and kitchens. In their homes there is no place without at least a few Life-study messages. Each saint&rsquo;s home is full of spiritual riches. A person can go to any corner of the saints&rsquo; homes and receive benefit by opening and reading any paragraph on any page of any book. This is the significance of the saying &ldquo;Reading is always beneficial.&rdquo; Such an atmosphere is worth promoting.</p>
<p>People in the world pay much attention to education and know that education is the foundation of everything. In the church we highly regard the truth; hence, we should pay much attention to the cultivation of the truth. If the truth is given the free way and the proper standing among us, the church will be strong. Studying the truth is basic and fundamental, and we should pay much attention to it. I am afraid that although many brothers and sisters purchase the Life-studies, they merely put them on their bookshelves without spending much time to read them; this is pitiful.</p>
<p>The Recovery Version of the New Testament is the crystallization of the collection of the knowledge of the divine revelation seen by all the saints throughout the past two thousand years. If we study properly by entering into the text and footnotes of the Recovery Version and by entering into the Life-studies, the church life will undergo a noticeable change. If we enter into the riches of the Recovery Version and the Life-studies, within a few years the outcome will be astonishing. Our entering into the riches of the truth will be a great help to the success of the new way, because the success of the new way depends upon speaking the Lord&rsquo;s word. In order to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word properly, we need the proper materials, preparation, foundation, and base. For example, people who speak Mandarin or Taiwanese do not all have the same degree of proficiency. A person with an elementary school education speaks in a certain way, whereas one who has received a high school education speaks in another way. Moreover, a person who has received a college education speaks in an even more sophisticated manner. A person&rsquo;s level of education has a definite effect on his speaking.</p>
<p>Today our spiritual education is fully related to the Bible; however, most people read the Bible according to their own way. The Bible is not easy to apprehend. Even if we read it a hundred times, we may still not be able to understand its meaning. Because it is not easy to understand the Bible, people tend to read it according to what they think they understand based on their particular knowledge. In the Recovery Version of the New Testament there are over nine thousand footnotes to help us understand the Bible. The Bible verses that are difficult to understand have footnotes to help guide our understanding. If we find that the footnotes are inadequate in answering our questions, we can read the Life-study messages. As long as we search carefully according to the chapter and verse, there will always be an explanation. If we study systematically in this way, we will definitely obtain many riches from the truth.</p>
<p>Perhaps we may not all be able to buy our own set of the Life-studies of the New Testament, but at least several saints should have one set in common. One-third of the set may be at one saint&rsquo;s home, another third may be at another saint&rsquo;s home, and the final third may be at the home of yet another saint. If we do this, we can read according to a monthly rotation. In terms of the application of our time, the brothers and sisters with jobs can put a book in their briefcase and bring it with them. While they wait for the bus or have a break at work, they can freely read a few pages. In short, we must try our best to urge the saints to pursue to know the truth, which comes from familiarity with the Lord&rsquo;s word. This is the base, the foundation. When the saints have this base, this foundation, we should then encourage them to speak.</p>
<p>When Brother Nee first promoted the matter of everyone speaking, he proposed that we use the brothers&rsquo; meetings and sisters&rsquo; meetings. In this way everyone could exercise together. This way was good because there were no chairmen or leaders in the brothers&rsquo; meeting. Everyone was a brother and was absolutely equal. Everyone was free to call hymns, pray, and give testimonies. However, eventually we did not how to go on in these meetings because the meetings depended primarily upon everyone giving their testimonies. In half a year everyone had exhausted their testimonies. The same situation occurred in the sisters&rsquo; meetings. Hence, it is not easy for the brothers and sisters to learn to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>There are three practices that can strengthen the participation in the meetings: first, calling on the name of the Lord; second, pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s word; and third, sing-speaking the hymns. These practices are a great help to the meetings. When we come to a meeting, we can begin by calling on the name of the Lord, then we can find a verse from the Bible, read it, and pray over it. We can also begin by choosing a hymn and sing-speak it together; these practices will be a great help. Moreover, there are several &ldquo;crutches&rdquo; that can help us speak: the <em>Life Lessons</em> and the <em>Truth Lessons.</em> If we think that these two sets of books are too rigid, there is a third &ldquo;crutch,&rdquo; the Life-studies. If some think that the Life-studies are too broad, there is yet a fourth &ldquo;crutch,&rdquo; that is, the other spiritual publications, such as <em>The Knowledge of Life, The Experience of Life,</em> and <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy.</em> All these books are our &ldquo;crutches&rdquo; for us to use. They are there to help us. For the long term, however, we must help the brothers and sisters to learn to prophesy. Without prophesying, nothing can be realized.</p>
<p>The key to our advancing is that we who love the Lord and His recovery must learn to prophesy; some must advance in this matter. For a school to do well in basketball, not every student needs to play basketball. Out of one thousand students, there may be five or six teams, that is, thirty to fifty basketball players. In the church in Taipei there are several thousand brothers and sisters who love the Lord. If they exercise to speak, some competent prophets will soon be produced. For this reason, I hope that hall by hall and district by district the elders in the church in Taipei will take this word and immediately begin to lead the brothers and sisters to exercise to read the Bible, the footnotes, the Life-studies, and other related spiritual publications. In this way, over a period of several months and years, the saints will unconsciously acquire a deposit of the truth. Moreover, we all need to acquire some experience. If we have the practical experience as well as the truth, we will have light when we speak for the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">SPEAKING FOR THE LORD<br />
REQUIRING GRAVITY AND WEIGHTINESS</h2>
<p>When we exercise to speak for the Lord, we should avoid conducting ourselves lightly or frivolously. Once we are frivolous, we are worthless; thus, we must be solemn. One of the virtues of an elder is gravity, which refers to the weightiness of a person. Some among us, although they have an intelligent mind and strong comprehension, are too frivolous in their speaking. In contrast, often when saints in their sixties or seventies open their mouth, light shines forth. A person who constantly laughs and jokes gives people a light feeling. It is best if this kind of person does not stand up to speak for the Lord; otherwise, he sells himself cheaply. It may be acceptable, however, if he simply gives a testimony. Hence, if a person speaks for God and speaks God&rsquo;s word with a frivolous attitude, his speaking lacks significance; even if a saint is merely giving a testimony, he still should not be flippant. A Christian should be grave. To be grave means to be weighty. Weightiness is to be as steady and weighty as a precious stone, not light or easily tossed about like a feather in the air.</p>
<p>Gold, silver, and precious stones are weighty, whereas wood, grass, and stubble are light. Some people are at a disadvantage in that according to their natural disposition they give people a feeling of being frivolous. Their lightness causes them to lose the qualification to speak in the meetings. I have also seen the opposite situation. Some American young people, who are only fifteen or sixteen and have not yet graduated from high school, bear themselves in such a way that whenever they stand up in the meetings they give people a feeling of weightiness and gravity. People receive such an impression even before they open their mouths. In this regard, it is not proper for us to always be laughing and joking in the meetings. We should be free, released, fresh, and living in the meetings, yet we should not to be frivolous, casual, or reckless.</p>
<p>Our meetings should be high, yet they must also be weighty. This does not mean that we need to wear a long face all the time, as if someone has offended us. If we are always stiff and have a stern look when we speak in the meetings, people will be afraid. This also is not acceptable. We should smile, but we should also give people the feeling of weightiness when we smile. To speak according to this principle requires the proper exercise. The way we are according to our natural disposition, our old creation, must be terminated in the new creation. If we pursue in such a way, people will spontaneously respect us.</p>
<p>If we do not receive much spiritual training and education related to our speaking, our meetings will have an atmosphere of being &ldquo;rough.&rdquo; Our prayers and testimonies will give people a &ldquo;rough&rdquo; feeling. However, if we spend time in the Lord&rsquo;s word and pursue the spiritual life, after several months and years our condition will be completely different. The meetings in all the churches in Taiwan will be rich and sweet, because the level of spiritual education will have risen. In the past we had only the equivalent of an elementary school education or perhaps even no education at all. Now we not only have finished the equivalent of high school, but some who have made faster progress have already attained to the equivalent of a college education. By spending time in the Lord&rsquo;s Word and pursuing the spiritual life, a high level will spontaneously be expressed in our meetings, prayer, singing, and speaking without any special effort on our part.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE CHURCH TO EXERCISE AND PRACTICE</h2>
<p>In the past, we did not have much heart to learn; we simply went to the meetings faithfully. We did not care who called hymns in the meetings, we sang casually, and it did not matter to us whether we sang at all. This was our condition in the meetings. Some time ago, I saw several people talking in a meeting; this was a big distraction. While the brothers were giving reports on different districts, conversations were going on in the audience. This was truly disturbing. This is against the regulation of the training and is impolite; it not only offends man but also offends the Holy Spirit. When everyone is paying their full attention to the meeting, allowing the Holy Spirit to speak to us, how could some talk among themselves? This is not proper. All the leading ones should pay attention to this matter in the meetings. It does not matter what kind of meeting or training we are conducting, we must pay attention to the weightiness and cannot be loose; otherwise, everything will be in vain, no matter how great our capability or how high our skill.</p>
<p>It is definitely not an easy or light matter for an elder to take the lead in a church. A brother is not capable of taking the lead simply because he has such a desire. As an elder, a brother cannot be late to the meetings; this is to take the lead. In one of the district meetings I noticed that most of the brothers and sisters were at the meeting before the elders arrived. This is to have no leading. When there is no leading, the meetings drag on. If the elders are three minutes late, others will be five minutes late, and some will even be ten minutes late; as a result, a meeting scheduled to begin at 9:30 A.M. will not be fully attended until 10:15 A.M. This shows a lack and unfaithfulness in leading.</p>
<p>If the president were to visit us, would we arrive late? I believe that we would all arrive early. If this is the case, we must consider the Lord Jesus to be inferior to the president. Since we are meeting with the Lord Jesus, how can we be late? All the leading ones must see the significance of taking the lead in the church. To take the lead in the church is to build up the saints day by day and little by little until a model is eventually established and a pattern is set before them. This is to take the lead. If the elders do not take the lead in small matters, it will be difficult for them to take the lead in big matters. Even in regard to the hymnals used in our meetings, there should be a proper arrangement; they should be kept properly, not in a manner that is disorderly. Likewise, waste paper should not be thrown away carelessly but should be disposed of properly. These are examples of taking the lead.</p>
<p>Today the new way is open to all of us and should be borne by all of us. If we do not bear the responsibility to carry out the new way, it will become an empty way, and we will not be able to proceed. Since we all need to bear the responsibility, everyone should be responsible to learn whatever he needs to learn and to exercise accordingly; in this way we will definitely succeed.</p>
<p>Our ground is accurate, and our way is straight. No matter how much opposition there is from people in Christianity, at least they understand in their heart that our ground and way are irreproachable and that our truth is rich. The Lord has brought us further to see this new way in the Bible; this is a great recovery. Our endeavor has a definite way. We have the ground, the way, the truth, and the goal; in other words, we are serving with a just cause. We will surely win a swift victory.</p>
<p>In regard to the matter of prophesying, if we rise up to pursue the truth, within three years more people will be speaking in the meetings, and every meeting will be enriched. We will become an &ldquo;educated&rdquo; spiritual family. Our meetings will be filled with spiritual learning because everyone learns and everyone teaches one another mutually; moreover, as everyone speaks, the riches will spontaneously flow out.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters have told me that although my messages are good, they are often repetitious. However, one sister has discovered the secret. She explained, saying, &ldquo;Do not overlook this kind of repetition. These messages are repeated over and over again because a few do not understand. This repetition is for them.&rdquo; This explanation is accurate. When we release a message, we do not fulfill our duty simply by speaking it; rather, our hope is that everyone who listens will be able to understand it. When I speak from the podium, I can clearly tell that some do not understand what I have spoken. At the same time, I am also aware that the message I have released contains some profound truths. Such a profound message cannot be understood simply by listening to it three or five times; it may require us to hear it eight or ten times in order to adequately apprehend it. Moreover, there is a sequence to my repetitions. I do not repeat myself exactly. The first time I may speak from one angle, and the second time, from another angle. I always try to speak from different angles so that the listeners will be able to understand. However, I also realize that even after this kind of repetition, some may still not understand or know how to enter into what I have spoken; this is the reason that we need to release some messages again and again.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ORIGIN AND BENEFIT<br />
OF THE LIFE-STUDY OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Today the truth is among us, and we need to endeavor to enter into it. We have several meetings a week, which we should use to learn the truth, exercise in the truth, and enter into the truth. Everything in our Christian life depends upon the truth; hence, our goal should be to learn the truth. Beginning in 1974, I felt that my work in the United States should not focus on traveling to visit the saints and the churches as I had done for the previous ten years. Although this kind of visitation was able to bring people into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and gradually raise up churches in various places, I realized that the supply of the truth would be inadequate if I continued my work in this way. Hence, I made a firm decision to spend time to carry out a life-study of the entire Bible. The purpose of this kind of Bible study is to release messages based on the entire New Testament and according to the truth contained therein, not to release messages randomly according to an instant feeling or inspiration. As a result, we began the life-study trainings in the United States. Through the publication of the Life-study messages, several hundred churches have been raised up all over the earth. These few hundred churches are mainly the result of the Life-studies.</p>
<p>Sadly, few of the elders and co-workers in the churches in Taiwan know how to use the Life-studies. This is not to say that they do not use them but that they do not know how to use them. Using the Life-studies is not simple. When we do something, it makes a difference how we do it. It is one thing to do something in a matter of fact way, it is another thing to do something with our whole effort, and it is yet another thing to give our life for it. The outcome will naturally be different, depending on the way a matter is carried out. The more effort there is, the better the outcome will be. It is not that the churches in Taiwan do not use the Life-studies but that the elders and co-workers do not feel that it matters whether they use them. The leading co-workers have not entered into the Life-studies aggressively. The Life-study messages that were released, especially in the final stage, have focused on God&rsquo;s economy; nevertheless, I am concerned that the co-workers in Taiwan may have not entered into God&rsquo;s economy and may even have only a limited understanding concerning God&rsquo;s dispensing. Entering into the truth is a matter of degree. We have spent months and years leading the churches, but several decades have passed, and the churches remain more or less the same, without much progress or riches. Nevertheless, to the degree that the brothers have applied these spiritual riches in their leading of the churches, there are some visible results today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO BE CONSTITUTED WITH THE HIGH TRUTHS</h2>
<p>In 1961 I went to America, and as a result that year became a point of demarcation in my work. The following year I began my work in America. Prior to 1961, every time I returned to Taipei from abroad, I was afraid to go to the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting because everything was old. The hymns were old, and the prayers were old. However, during the few recent times I have come back to Taipei, I found that the singing at the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting has improved. The saints have learned to sing: &ldquo;In the bosom of the Father, / Ere the ages had begun, / Thou wast in the Father&rsquo;s glory, / God&rsquo;s unique begotten Son,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Once Thou wast the only grain, Lord, / Falling to the earth to die&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #203, stanzas 1 and 3). At the same time, I noticed that some older sisters, who are not highly educated, still knew to pray: &ldquo;O Lord, You are the only grain that fell to the ground and died to produce us as many grains. Thank You for dispensing Your life into us.&rdquo; The old hymns used in the remembrance of the Lord were gone. Thus, we can say that we have entered into a new age.</p>
<p>From our youth we have been taught that there is a big category in our hymnal for the breaking of bread. Those hymns are related to our attendance of the Lord&rsquo;s table, and we cannot say that they are not good. However, if we continue to sing the hymns belonging to that category, we will stay forever at that level. Now when we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table, we sing concerning the Lord being the only grain that died and brought us forth as the many grains and blended us together in spirit to make us the one Body. This is much higher. The Lord&rsquo;s table meetings in Taipei have been uplifted so that nearly all the old hymns are no longer used. For instance, <em>Hymns,</em> #806, &ldquo;Break Thou the Bread of Life, / Dear Lord, to me,&rdquo; is a good hymn, but its level is not high enough. This requires our learning.</p>
<p>In one of our meetings, a brother without a high level of education called <em>Hymns,</em> #152; this surprised me greatly, because this hymn speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s love on a high level. It not only speaks of how the Lord was crucified for our redemption, but concerning His love it says, &ldquo;It has caused Thee death to suffer / And to me Thyself impart&rdquo; (stanza 1). This is on a high level. Singing these kinds of hymns and being on this kind of level spontaneously affect our living. I have seen that some of the elderly brothers and sisters are very much influenced and uplifted in their living. These are examples related to leading the church. When there is the proper leading, the church will spontaneously advance. The evaluation that I am giving should also be a leading to us. With this kind of leading, we will know how to advance.</p>
<p>We need to lead the saints to have a foundation in the truth, the Lord&rsquo;s Word, and to enter into the experiences of life. Over a long period of time, these will become a deposit within us. Then when we come to the meetings, whether a group meeting, home meeting, or district meeting, our tongue will be the pen of a ready writer, because of our inward constitution; this is not merely a kind of composition but a constitution. If we are under the influence of such an atmosphere for a period of three years, the element of this atmosphere will be all the more constituted into us.</p>
<p>If a person stays for three hours in a house filled with the smell of garlic, when he walks out of the house, he will smell of garlic because garlic will have become his constitution. Likewise, if we sit in a seafood restaurant eating seafood for two hours, we will smell like seafood when we walk out. If on the contrary, we have been meeting for three years, attending three or four meetings per week, but are not constituted with anything, this indicates that our meetings are plain and flavorless. They do not carry a strong flavor like that of garlic or seafood; rather, our meetings are just like plain water. If, after meeting for three years, we do not have any special flavor, it would be like drinking plain boiled water for three years. The result depends upon the leading brothers motivating the saints. The way has been set, and the goal, the focus, and the path are clear. If we do not advance, I do not know how we can give an account to the Lord.</p>
<p>Today the riches of the truth are before us, and everyone has the opportunity to pursue them; moreover, the truth is not too mysterious for us to enter into. When a person is newly saved, he may feel that he does not fit in, but after pursuing for two years, he should begin to enter into the truth. Due to their intense pursuing, within a year some brothers may gain significant familiarity with the truth. Some brothers and sisters, who have come into the church life for only a short period of time, come to the prayer meeting, burning within and desiring to pray something to the Lord; nevertheless, they are not able to pray, so they try to recite a few sentences. Sometimes, however, they are not able to recite anything but still try to pray. In this regard, there is nothing to be embarrassed about. If all of us would go on in such a way, the practice of everyone speaking in the church meetings will succeed. I encourage all of us to try our best to promote this matter so that everyone will exert much effort in studying the Recovery Version and the Life-studies. In this way, after a few months or even a few years, we will have a significant constitution of the truth.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO TAKE DEFINITE STEPS TO PROMOTE<br />
THE NEW WAY IN ITS VARIOUS ASPECTS</h2>
<p>We need to promote the home meetings with all our strength. The saints should first have home meetings in their homes; then they should go out to lead others and establish home meetings in the homes of the ones they are leading. Of course, there is also the need to lead the group meetings. In short, every aspect of the new way needs our promoting and leading. The elders need to look to the Lord&rsquo;s leading. If possible, they can call a mini-conference in order to fellowship with the saints regarding this particular burden. It may not do any harm to have a set practice of sending twenty-five out of one hundred saints door-knocking. This does not mean that the same twenty-five saints should go out every time but that one-fourth of our manpower will be visiting people by door-knocking. We need to encourage the brothers and sisters to consecrate themselves and set apart their time for this matter. We also need to continually pray and fellowship with them and make arrangements for them. We must perfect these ones and direct this matter along the right path. Gradually the practice of the new way will become a kind of atmosphere and will be established as a habit. If we merely make a few announcements and provide the saints with a little encouragement to go door-knocking, those who hear our encouragement will not think that they need to carry it out; in the end, less than ten percent of our manpower will participate. Hence, we need to lead the saints practically and strongly promote the burden of using one-fourth of our manpower to go door-knocking.</p>
<p>In order to perfect the saints in door-knocking, we need to have some training. The main point is not to knock on many doors or expect a quick result. If there are one hundred saints meeting in a certain church and twenty-five saints go door-knocking, at most they will gain four hundred people a year; do not expect too many. Even out of these four hundred new believers, three hundred may not remain in the church life due to various reasons; nevertheless, as long as one-fourth remain, we will have a twofold harvest. Of course, these four hundred new ones will require continual visitation and care from the brothers and sisters in the church. If these ones are well cared for and become stable, we can continue to go door-knocking. In this way, the one hundred saints who meet regularly will always have at least four hundred new ones as fruit for them to visit and take care of.</p>
<p>The church definitely needs leading. Most brothers and sisters will not take care of the new ones simply because the elders have spoken about it and made a few announcements; rather, we need to find a way to lead the saints and make arrangements for them. There is a need for some administration, regardless of the situation. Even in regard to cleaning the meeting hall, we must arrange chairs for the meeting in an orderly way and not simply pile them up haphazardly. In addition, we also need to keep the things for public use in prearranged places. Even in a small district, there is the need for a proper arrangement; this is what is involved in leading. With this kind of leading, the church life will have a pathway upon which it can advance steadily and sequentially in every aspect and according to every step. Both the individual saints and the church will be able to advance.</p>
<p>The majority of the saints love the Lord, and as long as the elders lead them, some will surely be willing to knock on doors. However, they do not need to knock on doors every week. A team of three may only need to go out every other week for two hours. After a year, they will more or less be able to gain the number we have estimated. At the beginning, they will need to nourish the newly saved ones gradually. Eventually, everyone should receive the burden to take care of the home meetings. Moreover, during the week there should be group meetings. While the home meetings are for stabilizing the new ones, the group meetings are for joining them to the saints and caring for them mutually. Finally, we will take them to the district meetings. We should not expect quick results. It may take as many as six months or even a year. As long as we are serious about our participation&mdash;knocking on doors and taking care of the home meetings, group meetings, and the various aspects in the district meetings&mdash;the entire operation will be like a machine, and everything will be on the right track; then there will surely be a rich result within a year.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN ADDITIONAL WORD ON PROPHESYING</h2>
<p>In not only 1 Corinthians 14:1 does Paul say, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy,&rdquo; but also in verse 39 he says, &ldquo;Desire earnestly the prophesying.&rdquo; In addition, in verse 12 he says, &ldquo;Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.&rdquo; This means that in terms of spiritual gifts, we should seek to excel; we should not desire the inferior gifts but the excelling gift, that is, to prophesy. Verses 3 through 5 also speak of prophesying: &ldquo;He who prophesies speaks building up and encouragement and consolation to men. He who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but he who prophesies builds up the church. I desire that you all speak in tongues, but especially that you would prophesy; and greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, that the church may receive building up.&rdquo; Verses 29 through 31 say, &ldquo;As to prophets, two or three should speak, and the others discern. But if something is revealed to another sitting by, the first should be silent. For you can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged.&rdquo; From the beginning to the end of chapter 14, Paul simply charges everyone to prophesy. He had a deep realization that without prophesying, the church would not be rich or strong; thus, he paid much attention to prophesying. In order to be able to prophesy, we need to be constituted through exercise every day so that when we come to the meetings, we can truly speak for the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE MINISTRY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:7-9; 4:1; Eph. 4:11-12; Acts 2:42</h1>
<p>The New Testament ministry and the apostles&rsquo; teaching are two matters in the church that have not been accurately understood by most believers for the past two thousand years. The Brethren, who were raised up in England about one and a half centuries ago, saw a little concerning the apostles&rsquo; teaching and began to pay attention to this matter. Apart from them, nearly all other Christian groups are neither clear nor pay attention to this matter. This is a great loss.</p>
<p>The Greek word for <em>ministry</em> means &ldquo;service, or work,&rdquo; that is, to serve as a slave; service is a kind of work. However, the ministry as referred to in the New Testament carries a more precise and refined significance. In the New Testament this word is used in relation to particular people and matters. To serve and take care of a patient is a ministry (Matt. 25:44), and to serve tables, as the seven brothers did in Acts 6:5 is also a ministry. In addition, the Bible says, &ldquo;Say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it&rdquo; (Col. 4:17). A believer&rsquo;s personal service to the Lord is also a ministry. For example, some brothers and sisters clean the meeting hall. Whether they wipe the chairs, mop the floor, vacuum the carpet, or wash the windows, all of which are seemingly trivial tasks, their service is a ministry.</p>
<p>Acts 1:17 and 25 speak of &ldquo;this ministry.&rdquo; After the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, Peter, one of the twelve apostles, asked the Lord to choose someone to become a witness with the apostles of His resurrection and &ldquo;to take the place of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.&rdquo; The ministry that the twelve apostles received was to bear the testimony of the Lord Jesus, testifying that He is the Triune God and that, as the Son of God, He was incarnated to be a man to pass through human living on earth for thirty-three and a half years, that He was nailed to the cross and died there according to &ldquo;the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God&rdquo; (2:23), that He was raised up after three days, and that in resurrection He appeared to the apostles and disciples, charging them to preach Him as the gospel to the whole inhabited earth.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:1 Paul speaks of the New Testament ministry as &ldquo;this ministry.&rdquo; Here the phrase <em>this ministry</em> has an even greater significance than the ministry of which Peter spoke in Acts 1. The ministry spoken of by Peter is the ministry that the twelve apostles received from the Lord Jesus, who was incarnated, passed through human living, died, and resurrected. In other words, their ministry was to preach this God-man to all the nations, telling them how He was incarnated, passed through various processes of human living, died, and resurrected to become the Savior of the world. This is the ministry Peter received.</p>
<p>It is clear that the ministry Peter received is not focused on the church; it speaks only of Christ, that is, how the eternal God became a man, passed through death and resurrection, and became both Lord and Christ in resurrection. This is the ministry that the twelve apostles received, and it is the first half of the New Testament ministry. Later, when Paul spoke of &ldquo;this ministry&rdquo; in 2 Corinthians, much more was included. The ministry he speaks of includes the ministry that Peter speaks of and applies the Christ whom Peter and the other apostles had received to those who are chosen, redeemed, and justified, causing them to become members of Christ to constitute the Body of Christ, the church. This is the New Testament ministry.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF<br />
THE SPIRIT AND OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2>
<p>In short, the New Testament ministry is the content of the entire New Testament. The content of the twenty-seven books from Matthew to Revelation is the New Testament ministry. This ministry speaks of Christ being the mystery of God and of the church being the mystery of Christ. These two are the great mystery, Christ and the church (Eph. 5:32). This is the New Testament ministry. This New Testament ministry is the ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness (2 Cor. 3:8-9). To say that this ministry is of the Spirit means that this ministry is entirely of the Triune God. He has passed through all the processes and is consummated as the Spirit; hence, this ministry is of the Spirit.</p>
<p>This ministry cannot be separated from the Spirit. In the New Testament the Spirit is all-inclusive. The Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God. God is eternally triune; but before His incarnation, death, and resurrection, He was not yet processed. He was the Triune God, but He was not the <em>consummated</em> Triune God. He was perfect but not consummated. Hence, the perfect Triune God needed to pass through some procedures and processes in order to be consummated by the addition of a few elements.</p>
<p>The Triune God was perfect in eternity past, but He had only the divine element, divinity, without the human element, humanity. He had not passed through the process of human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. When He stepped out of eternity, entered into the world, took the human shell, the flesh, and partook of humanity to become a proper man, another element was added into Him; that is, humanity was added to divinity. Moreover, He was in the womb of Mary for nine months. It was a great process for the Triune God to be conceived in a human being. After He was born, He passed through thirty-three and a half years of human living and experienced all the hardships of human life. The Triune God, the eternal, infinite, and omnipotent God, entered into a human womb, spent nine months there, was born as an ordinary man, and passed through human life in the world. Then according to His eternal plan, the will that He purposed in eternity, He went to the cross, was crucified according to the prophecies in the Old Testament, and accomplished an all-inclusive death.</p>
<p>On the negative side, the Lord&rsquo;s all-inclusive death solved every problem, and on the positive side, His divine life was released. On the cross He was not only the Lamb who took away sin (John 1:29) and the bronze serpent that judged Satan (3:14) but also the grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died (12:24). This aspect is not related to sin and Satan but to the divine life. He, as the grain of wheat, died to release the divine life and bore much fruit. As chosen, redeemed, and regenerated ones, we are the fruit. We constitute His Body. After passing through an all-inclusive death, He stayed in death for three days and then rose from death and ascended. In resurrection His body was transfigured into a spiritual body, and He became the life-giving Spirit. After passing through these processes, He is the perfect and consummated Triune God.</p>
<p>After the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection the triune name&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;was used for the first time. In Matthew 28:19 the Lord told His disciples in resurrection, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The Spirit spoken of in the New Testament is included in the simple divine title <em>the Holy Spirit.</em> When the Lord was in the flesh, on the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles He stood and cried out, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit&rdquo; (John 7:37-39a). If anyone comes to Him and believes into Him, his thirst will be quenched, and he will receive the Spirit. John, however, says that the Spirit was not yet at the time the Lord cried out (v. 39b). This means that the Spirit was not yet completed, because Jesus had not yet been glorified. Jesus&rsquo; glorification refers to His entering into resurrection from death (Luke 24:26). The glorification of a grain of wheat occurs once it falls into the ground, dies, and begins to grow out from the ground. Then it bears much fruit and displays a glorious form. Glorification is multiplication. Christ was a single grain, but now He has many grains; this is glorification as well as multiplication and propagation.</p>
<p>From this we see that the Spirit as the all-inclusive Spirit represents the mysterious God who possesses divinity and humanity, who has passed through human living, accomplished an all-inclusive death, entered into resurrection, and became the life-giving Spirit. He is able not only to redeem us but also to enter into us to be our life and mingle Himself with our spirit to be our nature and person. Therefore, the New Testament ministry is the ministry of the Spirit, belonging to the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">IN CONTRAST WITH<br />
THE MINISTRY OF THE OLD TESTAMENT,<br />
THE MINISTRY OF DEATH AND OF CONDEMNATION</h2>
<p>Since the ministry of the New Testament is of the Spirit, it is a ministry of justification, not a ministry of condemnation. In the New Testament the result of justification is that man may have life. Romans 5:18 says, &ldquo;As it was through one offense unto condemnation to all men, so also it was through one righteous act unto justification of life to all men.&rdquo; Justification is for us to have life. The ministry of the New Testament is in contrast to the ministry of the Old Testament. The ministry of the Old Testament is of the letter and of death. Second Corinthians 3:7 and 9 reveal that the ministry of the Old Testament, the ministry in letters and of death, condemns, whereas the ministry of the New Testament justifies. The ministry of condemnation is unto death; the ministry of justification is unto life. These are the ministry in the Old Testament and the ministry in the New Testament. Since the creation of all things and man, God has had only two ministries: the Old Testament ministry and New Testament ministry. The Old Testament ministry ministers law to people, which condemns people and puts them under death; the New Testament ministry ministers the Spirit to people, which justifies them and gives them life so that they may become members of the Body of Christ to constitute the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>We need to know these points to the extent that they are constituted into our entire being. In Christianity, throughout the whole earth, you can hardly find any books or hear any speaking concerning these matters. The New Testament ministry is absolutely part of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and can be considered the theology of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING UNIQUELY ONE</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 4:1 indicates that the ministry of the New Testament is uniquely one. This ministry began with the preaching of repentance by John the Baptist, was continued by the work of the Lord Jesus on earth, and was brought on further by the works of the twelve apostles, who were chosen directly by Him, as well as of those who were with them. All these works are included in this ministry. We, the apostle Paul, his fellow apostles, and all those under their leading are included in this ministry. Do not think that we are being led by a particular brother; this is altogether wrong. We are being led by the apostle Paul. In other words, until the full manifestation of the new heaven and new earth, the works of all those who belong to God should be part of &ldquo;this ministry&rdquo; (Acts 1:17, 25; 2 Cor. 4:1).</p>
<p>In Ephesians 4:12 Paul does not use the word <em>this;</em> instead, he says, &ldquo;Unto the work of the ministry.&rdquo; Here the sense conveyed by <em>the ministry</em> is stronger than that conveyed by <em>this ministry. The work of the ministry</em> implies that the work of the ministry is unique. Because the sun and the moon are unique, we speak of them as &ldquo;the sun&rdquo; and &ldquo;the moon,&rdquo; not as &ldquo;this sun&rdquo; or &ldquo;this moon.&rdquo; Likewise, the work of the ministry is simply the work of <em>the</em> ministry, which is uniquely one.</p>
<p>The apostles are the many ministers of the New Testament. There is one ministry, but there are many ministers. The singular <em>ministry</em> refers to the matter, the work; the plural <em>ministers</em> refer to those who carry out the ministry. Paul uses both of these words. In 2 Corinthians 3:6 he says that the Lord &ldquo;has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant,&rdquo; and in Acts 20:24 he says, &ldquo;In order that I may finish...the ministry,&rdquo; that is, the New Testament ministry.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:1 Paul says, &ldquo;Having this ministry as we have been shown mercy.&rdquo; Here <em>we</em> refers to the ministers, that is, the apostles. <em>This ministry</em> is singular and includes the ministry of John the Baptist, the Lord Jesus, the twelve apostles, the other disciples under their leading, Paul and his fellow apostles, and all those under their leading; we are also included among them. This is the ministry spoken of in the New Testament and is what Ephesians 4:12 refers to when it says, &ldquo;Unto the work of the ministry.&rdquo; The apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers are all for the perfecting of the saints. The next phrase reads, &ldquo;Unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; According to Greek grammar, <em>unto the work of the ministry</em> and <em>unto the building up of the Body of Christ</em> are in apposition, meaning that the latter refers to the former. This means that the work of the ministry is for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">ALL THE GIFTED ONES AND ALL THE SAINTS<br />
BEING FOR THIS MINISTRY</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:11 says, &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers.&rdquo; These are the gifted ones. Verse 12 continues, &ldquo;For the perfecting of the saints.&rdquo; This reveals that all the gifted ones are for the perfecting of the saints. Thus, these two groups of people&mdash;the gifted ones and the saints who are being perfected&mdash;are for the work of the ministry and for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Many people have asked me over the years whether we have a problem in regard to the matter of ministry. We need to answer this question carefully. In the past twenty-five years, especially since we began propagating overseas, some people have said that we have brought the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to the point that it receives only Brother Lee&rsquo;s ministry and no other ministry. For us to take the Lord&rsquo;s new way, all the co-workers and elders need to see clearly that we have only one ministry in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the unique ministry. Although there is only one ministry, all the serving brothers have their ministries within the unique ministry. For example, some saints&rsquo; ministry is to go to the communities to knock on doors and to take care of home meetings, whereas my ministry is to train the elders and co-workers and revise the Recovery Version of the New Testament. While I am fulfilling my ministry, they are also fulfilling their ministries.</p>
<p>There are over forty thousand saints in the church in Taipei, and more than thirty thousand of them still need to be visited and cared for. This requires that at least ten thousand brothers and sisters fulfill their ministries. Sometimes the brothers and sisters may be moved by the Holy Spirit to knock on doors and bring people to salvation; then after baptizing them, they immediately need to establish home meetings and read <em>Life Lessons</em> with them; this is their ministry. Many brothers and sisters in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have this kind of ministry. There are also hundreds and thousands of saints who take care of the high school students, the college students, or who specifically bring people to salvation. In the church there are many people who have different kinds of ministries.</p>
<p>In our practice, we accept many ministries, and we emphasize the word <em>many.</em> Today there are thousands and even tens of thousands of ministries within the church. Hence, those who criticize us do not know the distinction between the singular <em>ministry</em> and the plural <em>ministries.</em> As far as the ministry is concerned, in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we do not have two ministries; we have only one ministry, the unique ministry. As far as ministries are concerned, every saved one in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has a ministry as long as he exercises to function; in this sense, we have many ministries. Our hope is that everyone would function in the meetings; this functioning is the fulfilling of their ministries. Therefore, there are both ministry and ministries.</p>
<p>We need to see from the New Testament the relationship between <em>ministry</em> and <em>ministries.</em> In the New Testament John the Baptist had a ministry, and the Lord Jesus also had a ministry. Was the ministry of the Lord Jesus an addition to the ministry of John the Baptist or a repetition of it? It is not easy to answer this question. It is correct to say that the ministry of the Lord Jesus was a repetition of the ministry of John, because the Lord Jesus preached what John had preached. In the New Testament the Lord Jesus repeated John&rsquo;s words. In Matthew 3:2 John said, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.&rdquo; When the Lord Jesus ministered, He said exactly the same thing without changing a word (4:17). Later He sent His disciples to preach the same message (Mark 6:12). Thus, we see that John the Baptist, the Lord Jesus, and His disciples all spoke the same thing. These three groups of people repeated one another.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus came, He repeated and added to what John the Baptist had spoken. Later the disciples came and repeated and added to what the Lord Jesus had spoken. Then Paul repeated and added. Still later Brother Nee and I did the same thing, repeating and adding. Today all of us should be repeating and adding. In this way the ministry is a whole, a totality, of many ministries. This totality will ultimately consummate as the manifestation of the New Jerusalem. Before the manifestation of the New Jerusalem, the works done for God by all who belong to Him are parts of the totality of the one ministry. Thus, we are not carrying out our own ministries; rather, we repeat and add. We are not at all independent. We are not carrying out thousands and thousands of independent ministries; instead, we are carrying out thousands and thousands of repetitions and additions. This is the work of the unique ministry.</p><h2 class="head1">FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">To Hold On to Some Special Creeds<br />
Being to Build Up One&rsquo;s Own Ministry</h2>
<p>On the earth today there are many Christians in different denominations. In Taipei there are Baptist churches, Presbyterian churches, and Bread of Life churches. After we are saved and begin to love the Lord, people may tell us that it is good to love the Lord but that it is possible that we have been deceived because even though we say that others are sects, are we not also a sect? Let us consider our fingers as an illustration. A hand has five fingers. Names such as the Presbyterian Church and the Baptist Church are like a sixth finger in addition to the five fingers of the hand. The local churches do not have six fingers because we do not have a special name. We are proper and normal; we have only five fingers, not six. If there is an extra finger, that finger is a division.</p>
<p>The preachers of the Baptist Church are carrying out the ministry of the New Testament, but they are also carrying out the ministry of the baptism of the Baptist Church. Their work is to establish the Baptist sect, that is, the Baptist denomination. Likewise, the Presbyterians establish Presbyterian sects, and the Pentecostals establish tongue-speaking sects. Hence, every denomination builds up its own sect. We, however, are simply and purely building up the Body of Christ, which is expressed in all the localities as a local church, a church not belonging to any sect or denomination and that is not divisive.</p>
<p>In one area of the United States almost one hundred brothers came into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery out of the Baptist Church. Some of their parents were pastors and deacons in the Baptist Church, having a strong denominational background. As a result of our introducing something new into the area, the Baptist Church began to pay much attention to us, and arranged for a theologian with a doctoral degree to come to join our conference and listen to my preaching. After the meeting he came to me in a humble and meek way. He was a proper person with a refined manner of speaking. In addition, he was a highly educated and knowledgeable person. In our conversation he frequently made reference to his Doctorate of Divinity, but I did not pay attention to that; rather, I asked him whether being Baptist is something extra, and I also asked him for some explanation.</p>
<p>Whenever we ask people this kind of question, they are caught, because even though baptism is in the Bible and baptism is right, to make it an item of the faith is heresy. In like manner, although the matter of the elders&rsquo; administration of the church is also in the Bible, to make it an item of the faith and a basis for establishing the church is also heresy. Furthermore, although tongue-speaking is right, it is also heresy to make tongue-speaking an item of the faith and a basis for establishing the church. In a Christian nation such as the United States, whenever a person finds out that someone else is a Christian, the first question he asks is, &ldquo;Which denomination do you belong to?&rdquo; Hence, my question was not too blunt.</p>
<p>When I asked this theologian whether being Baptist was something extra, he had nothing to say; all he could say was that there is no other way. I then asked him how there could be no other way, and I pointed out to him that baptism is just baptism and should not be made an article of the faith. Moreover, the Baptists acknowledge only the baptisms that are conducted by their pastors, and even the water for baptism must be the water in their baptisteries. I told him that this is superstition. After all, there are many regenerated Christians who have not been baptized in the Baptist Church. How can the Baptists recognize only those who are baptized among them? I told him that although my mother was a member of the Baptist Church, I neither joined that church nor was baptized there. Nevertheless, I have been regenerated. He could not deny it. Later he told people that it would be best for him not to see me again, because he could not win.</p>
<p>Recently, another Baptist theologian came to visit us. He came with a younger brother. After conversing with them for a while, I realized that this visit was different from those in the past. They knew not to bring up the problem of division. They knew that if they were to bring it up, they would not have a stand. Therefore, they did not talk about divisions but spoke of positive matters. In the end, they told me that they wanted to put my books in their collection for theological studies. When I heard this, I asked them under which category they would put my books. One category in their collection consisted of books on the orthodox faith, another consisted of books on the Pentecostal faith, another consisted of books concerning those faiths that are questionable in regard to accuracy, and yet another consisted of books concerning special creeds in regard to baptism. I asked them under which category they would put my books. It was difficult for them to answer this question. Finally I told them that if they desired to put my books in their collection, they would have to add a new category: the most fundamental truths. This is the situation in America.</p>
<p>Today nearly every denomination teaches from the Bible, preaches the same Savior, and worships the same true God, but every denomination also has its own ministry. The ministry of the Baptists builds up Baptist churches, and the ministry of the Presbyterians builds up Presbyterian churches. If a person desires to be a preacher in the Baptist Church, he would need to be baptized in their midst and graduate from their seminary; otherwise, it would be difficult for him to become a pastor. Furthermore, they would investigate his background; if his parents and grandparents were members of the Baptist denomination, there would be no problem. However, if he was from another denomination or had graduated from a seminary of another denomination, it would not be easy for him to become a pastor. If this were the case, he would be required to be baptized in their midst and become an official member of the Baptist Church. Moreover, he would also need to agree to preach only the Baptist faith. Therefore, the work of the Baptist denomination is entirely to carry out the ministry of the Baptist denomination.</p>
<p>When we consecrate ourselves to serve the Lord full time, the work we do is the work of the ministry. When we speak to people, they may not know us and thus think that we have a special title; nevertheless, on our part we know that we are all doing the work of the one ministry, which is to build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12).</p><h2 class="head2">The Problem with Apollos</h2>
<p>We may encounter a situation in which some brothers love to expound the Bible; they are the Apolloses of this age. In the beginning of Acts, Peter and a group of brothers carried out the ministry; later, the apostle Paul and some other brothers began to carry out the ministry. These two groups of people were positive. However, in Acts 18:24-25 Apollos suddenly appeared. He was eloquent and powerful in the Scriptures, expounding the Scriptures very well. Although he was well versed in the Scriptures and spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, he only knew of the baptism of John; he did not know God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>The ministry of the New Testament includes the ministry of John the Baptist. It is the first part of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This economy is an arrangement; as an arrangement, it is divided into several parts. For example, in a building containing five stories, those on the third floor are in the building as well as those who are on the second floor. Although they are in the same building, they are in different parts of the building. John was in the beginning of the New Testament economy. He merely touched a small portion of the New Testament economy of God. Only John and his disciples should have been in that part; those who came after them should not have remained there.</p>
<p>The ministry of John the Baptist is part of the New Testament ministry. It took place before the Lord Jesus began to preach and had come to an end by the time of Apollos. The official beginning of the New Testament economy took place after the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus. He said, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19). When John the Baptist came, he baptized people merely into water (3:11). At that time there was not yet the way to baptize people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, because the process through which the Triune God was to pass had not yet been accomplished. Once the Lord passed through death and entered into resurrection, He was no longer merely the perfect Triune God but the consummated Triune God. Hence, He was able to tell people to go and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God. This is the complete New Testament economy.</p>
<p>When Apollos appeared, chronologically he was in the latter stage and should have been fully in the New Testament economy. However, because he was taught inadequately, he did not enter into the New Testament economy. Consequently, he mostly taught people to know the Old Testament. Although he was well versed in the Scriptures, he knew only the Old Testament and the beginning of the New Testament, that is, the story of John the Baptist. In John 3:26 the disciples of John the Baptist had problems and quarreled with the disciples of the Lord Jesus. The disciples of John the Baptist said to John, &ldquo;He who was with you...of whom you have testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him.&rdquo; The disciples of John complained to John that everyone was following Jesus instead of coming to John to be baptized; this indicates that they had problems. Moreover, in Matthew 9:14 they went to ask the Lord Jesus, &ldquo;Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?&rdquo; Obviously there were problems between John&rsquo;s disciples and the Lord&rsquo;s disciples. This demonstrates that if someone remains at the beginning, he will have problems with those who advance. Hence, no one should remain at the beginning stage. This was the problem in regard to Apollos.</p>
<p>We may also encounter this kind of problem. A brother may know the Bible very well, but he may not have a clear picture of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, and he may merely enter into one particular point at the beginning, adhere to that point, and thus becomes a problem. How should we deal with this kind of person? Paul&rsquo;s attitude was not to reject but to forbear. According to the Bible, the problem with Apollos was never completely solved. In 1 Corinthians 16:12 Paul told the Corinthians, &ldquo;Concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him many times to come to you with the brothers; yet it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity.&rdquo; This shows that Paul was very concerned about the church in Corinth. In 1 Corinthians Paul may be likened to a father who has just disciplined his children severely; hence, they were not happy. As a result, he asks the mother to go and see the children, yet the mother says, &ldquo;I do not want to go. I will go when it is convenient for me.&rdquo; Apollos had this kind of attitude.</p>
<p>I believe all parents have similar experiences in regard to disciplining their children. After the father spanks the children, and the children are in pain, the father&rsquo;s heart is also in pain; however, since the father has just disciplined them, it is not easy for him to say anything to the children. Thus, he asks the mother to serve as a buffer to warm and cherish the children. This was Paul&rsquo;s intention. In 1 Corinthians Paul severely disciplined the Corinthian believers in the first few chapters. As a result, in chapter 16 he spoke of Apollos because Paul wanted him to go and see the Corinthian believers. Sadly, Apollos was not willing. Although Paul felt that Apollos should go, Apollos did not feel the same way. His attitude did not reflect Paul&rsquo;s sense of urgency. Rather, he would come when there was opportunity. To Paul, the present was the best opportunity.</p>
<p>This portion of the Scriptures is precious because it shows that although Paul was a leading one, he never controlled the co-workers. He did not say, &ldquo;Apollos, you must go to Corinth; you have no option.&rdquo; Paul left the matter in God&rsquo;s sovereign hand. He felt that if this matter were of the Lord, Apollos would go to Corinth promptly; if Apollos would not go, then this matter must not be of the Lord. Paul was very concerned about the Corinthian believers. When he wrote 2 Corinthians, he was caring for the Corinthians to the uttermost. He told them that when he came to Troas, although a door of the gospel was open to him in the Lord, he was not able to do anything because he was anxious to see Titus, who had just gone to see the Corinthian believers; thus, Paul promptly went to Macedonia to wait for Titus (2:12-13).</p>
<p>Paul anxiously cared for the Corinthian believers, but Apollos was not as concerned about them; in this regard, he was more like a stepmother. We may liken him to being Paul&rsquo;s wife but not the birth mother of the Corinthian believers. After the father spanks the children, a real mother, without waiting for the father to say anything, will quickly go to comfort the children. At the same time, she will tell the children that the father&rsquo;s spanking was right. Hence, before the father asks, the mother has already warmed up the children. If Apollos had done this, he would have been a genuine co-worker of Paul; this would have also indicated that he knew the New Testament economy and carried it out together with Paul. However, this was not the actual situation. Although Apollos was a co-worker of Paul, he was not in the same move, the same economy, with Paul.</p>
<p>It is a rare opportunity for us to have this kind of fellowship. Although we may have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for many years, we may not be clear concerning the Lord&rsquo;s way or the different kinds of people in relation to the ministry. According to 1 Corinthians, the Corinthians regarded Apollos on the same level as Paul and Cephas. First Corinthians 1:12 says, &ldquo;Each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas.&rdquo; This proves that Apollos&rsquo;s gift in preaching and expounding the Scriptures was not inferior to Paul&rsquo;s; however, he did not have an adequate knowledge of the entire economy of God. This is the problem we encounter today, and we need to have some understanding concerning these matters.</p>
<p>The New Testament ministry is for the building up of the Body of Christ. When Apollos was working in Corinth, he must have thought inwardly that he was building up the Body of Christ. However, in his feeling, was he the same as Paul? In Apollos&rsquo;s feeling and view, was he able to say, &ldquo;I, Apollos, am not doing my own work; rather, I am building up the Body of Christ with Paul, all the other apostles, and all the saints&rdquo;? We should ponder this matter to consider whether Apollos indeed had the same feeling as Paul. I believe that perhaps there was a little of the same feeling in Apollos as in Paul with regard to the building up the Body of Christ; nevertheless, I do not believe that his feeling was as strong as Paul&rsquo;s feeling. To illustrate with colors, Apollos&rsquo;s feeling may be compared to a light red, while Paul&rsquo;s feeling may be compared to a dark red; the difference is a matter of the degree of depth.</p>
<p>I deeply believe that Paul&rsquo;s feeling, even his every cell, could testify that what he did was not his own work but was for the building up of the Body of Christ. I am afraid that this feeling of building up the Body of Christ had not penetrated Apollos as deeply. Nevertheless, he must have felt that he had accomplished a work. If someone among us feels that he has accomplished a work, its value is questionable. We should not have this kind of feeling. We should have a common, deep, and penetrating feeling that we are simply building up the Body of Christ, not that we are accomplishing some kind of work. The only work we should be accomplishing is the building up of the Body of Christ. We should have the feeling that we are only building up the Body of Christ with the other brothers and sisters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ACCORDING TO THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES</h2>
<p>Today we are carrying out the one ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ, but what is the basis of our building? The Baptists, Presbyterians, Methodists, and Seventh-day Adventists all carry out their work according the regulations of their particular denomination. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we should be building up the Body of Christ according to the teaching of the apostles, which is the entire New Testament. We must carry out the New Testament ministry according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching (Acts 2:42).</p>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching takes the New Testament economy as its center; this New Testament economy is Christ and the church. Ephesians 5:32 says, &ldquo;This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.&rdquo; In fulfilling our ministry in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, do we take Christ and the church as the center? Or is baptism our center? Although we have baptism, it is not our center. Are the elders our center? Although we have elders, they are not our center. Is the expounding of the Scriptures our center? Although we have rich Life-study messages, they are not our center. Our center is the all-inclusive Christ, who is God yet man, having both divinity and humanity. He became flesh, passed through thirty-three and a half years of human living, experienced death, entered into resurrection, ascended to the heights, became the life-giving Spirit, and now enters into those who believe into Him, making them His members to constitute His Body, that is, the church. Moreover, He will come back to bring in His kingdom and consummate the New Jerusalem. This is God&rsquo;s economy.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:20; 1 Tim. 6:3; Matt. 16:16-18; Eph. 3:5; Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4; 5:32; Jude 3; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; cf. 1 Cor. 16:12; Acts 13:2, 4; 2 John 9-11</h1>
<p>The ministry of the New Testament is to build up the Body of Christ according to the teaching of the apostles. <em>The teaching of the apostles</em> is a special term in the Bible (Acts 2:42). It has a deep and strong background, that is, Judaism. Outwardly speaking, Judaism is linked to the Old Testament, which existed among the Jews for one thousand five hundred years. During the period of time beginning with Moses and continuing until the coming of the Lord Jesus, Judaism became strongly and firmly established among the Jewish people. All the Jewish people, men and women, young and old, had a deep impression of Judaism. Their conversations, practices, and daily life were all according to the law of Moses, that is, the teachings of Moses. For this reason, God even arranged for a group of priests, who were required to come before God every day to offer sacrifices, burn incense, and light the lampstand in the Holy Place. These same ones also bore a commission before man, that is, to speak and teach the law of Moses.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THE THINGS THAT THE LORD JESUS COMMANDED</h2>
<p>When the Lord Jesus came, He was the first one who kept the law. It can be said that ever since the law was given through Moses, no one had ever fully kept the law. Only Jesus of Nazareth fully kept the law. Moreover, He also complemented the law. Although the law was good, it was not good enough; although the law was complete, it was not sufficiently complete. For example, the law says, &ldquo;You shall not kill&rdquo; (Exo. 20:13), but the law does not say, &ldquo;You shall not hate.&rdquo; Hence, in Matthew 5:22 in His teaching on the mountain, the Lord Jesus complemented the law. He told His disciples, &ldquo;Everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment.&rdquo; Anger is the motive of murder. The Lord Jesus not only dealt with murder but also with the inward motive. The law says, &ldquo;You shall love your neighbor&rdquo; (v. 43), yet if we love only our neighbors, only the good ones, what shall we do with those who are not good, such as our enemies? Hence, the law is incomplete. The Lord told us as a complement to the law, &ldquo;Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you&rdquo; (v. 44). On the one hand, the Lord Jesus kept the law of God, and on the other hand, he complemented the law.</p>
<p>Such matters as keeping dietary regulations and keeping the Sabbath are matters of ceremonial law. No one can fulfill the ceremonial law because no one can be man&rsquo;s food and rest. However, when the Lord Jesus came, He was the rest typified by the Sabbath and the reality of the various offerings. Only He was able to fulfill the ceremonial part of the law. He did not abolish the law but fulfilled and complemented it. He fulfilled every item in the law. The second paragraph of footnote 2 in Matthew 5:17 reads, &ldquo;Concerning the law there are two aspects: the commandments of the law and the principle of the law. The commandments of the law were fulfilled and complemented by the Lord&rsquo;s coming, whereas the principle of the law was replaced by the principle of faith according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill&rdquo; (5:17). Through keeping the law, the Lord complemented the law and fulfilled all the commandments of the law. In the law of the Old Testament the ten main commandments, such as to honor one&rsquo;s parents and not to steal, concern human ethics and man&rsquo;s relationship with God. The Lord kept, fulfilled, and complemented all the laws of the moral commandments.</p>
<p>In the Bible there is the testimony of the law. In the Old Testament age the principle of God&rsquo;s dealing with man was according to the testimony of the law and based on the law. If man did well and was perfect, he could live; otherwise, he had to die. Hence, we see that when man kept the law, he was justified, but when man disobeyed the law, he was condemned. This was the principle with which God dealt with man in the Old Testament. This principle is based on the law and has nothing to do with faith; therefore, we can say that in relationship to the law, faith is not found in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus came, He fulfilled and complemented the law. He put the law aside, and thereafter, the principle by which God deals with man was no longer based on the law but on faith. Hence, faith became the principle with which God deals with man in the New Testament. This faith, that is, the faith, is what we believe in. The contents of the entire New Testament are in faith. God deals with us based on the principle of faith. Whoever believes is justified; whoever does not believe is condemned. This is entirely different from the principle of the Old Testament. The Old Testament is based on the principle of keeping the law; the New Testament is based on the principle of believing in the Lord Jesus, that is, on the principle of faith. If we understand the law in this way, we will be clear concerning it.</p><h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLES RECEIVING ALL REVELATIONS FROM THE LORD THROUGH THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching teaches us concerning the faith, not concerning the law. To teach concerning the law was something of Moses and the priests of the Old Testament. In the New Testament, however, the apostles&rsquo; teaching is altogether the faith in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This faith, which is the contents of the New Testament, was first taught by the Lord Jesus when He ministered on earth. After His resurrection He told the disciples, &ldquo;Go therefore...teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19-20). The disciples were charged to teach all the nations to observe all that the Lord commanded them. Therefore, the first aspect of the apostles&rsquo; teaching is related to the things that the Lord Jesus taught while ministering on the earth for three and a half years. At the end of that time, He told His disciples, &ldquo;I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality&rdquo; (John 16:12-13). The Spirit of reality in the disciples was to lead them into the profound truths. These profound truths are the economy of God.</p>
<p>The center of God&rsquo;s economy in the New Testament is that Christ, the God-man, accomplished redemption, entered into resurrection, became the life-giving Spirit, enters into all who believe into Him to be their life, their everything, their life supply, and their person, and mingles Himself with them to be one spirit with them to make them members of His Body. The center of God&rsquo;s economy is to save us to the extent that Christ becomes our Head and we become His members.</p>
<p>In regard to this center, Christianity has spoken, at most, only concerning Jesus living in us. Twenty years ago, when I came to the United States, people told me that they never knew that there is a spirit within man. However, twenty years later Christian radio stations are now telling people that there is a spirit in man. Sadly, they do not know that there is a verse in the Bible that says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:45b). Not only do they not know that Christ has become the life-giving Spirit, but they even consider it a heresy. Christianity adheres to the doctrine of &ldquo;three persons, one substance,&rdquo; saying that in the Godhead there are three persons with one substance. This is to say that the Father is a person, the Son is a person, and the Spirit is a person. This can lead to tritheism if the persons are considered to be both distinct and separate. This was condemned by the church fathers.</p>
<p>Ever since we came out of mainland China and went abroad, we have had the burden to tell people that as persons, we have another person living within us; a regenerated person is the dwelling place of God. We also have the burden to tell people that the Lord Jesus is God who became flesh, passed through human living, died, resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit. Many may acknowledge that Christ lives in His believers, yet how could Christ enter into them and dwell in them unless He became the Spirit? For Him to dwell in His believers, the Lord Jesus must be realized as the Spirit. Since Christianity teaches the doctrine of &ldquo;three persons, one substance,&rdquo; most Christians dare not say that Christ is the Spirit. Although they advocate the doctrine of &ldquo;three persons, one substance,&rdquo; they also say that there should not be the confounding of the persons. This means that one should not say that the Father is the Son, that the Son is the Spirit, or that the Spirit is the Son. Hence, they dare not say that Christ is the Spirit, because once they say that Christ is the Spirit, they believe that they are confounding the three persons of the Godhead.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,&rdquo; and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; A number of people understand <em>the Lord</em> here as referring to Jehovah in the Old Testament. As a result, in this verse God&rsquo;s being the Spirit corresponds with John 4:24, which says that &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo; This is to misinterpret the truth of the Lord being the Spirit and thus to lose the revelation of the truth.</p>
<p>For twenty years we have been fighting the battle for the truth, and we have read quite a number of books on this subject. According to our observation, the booklets published by Christianity are influenced by the thought that the three in the Godhead are three distinct and separate persons. However, the fact is that God is distinct in person but absolutely not separate. We have published a number of books which show from the Gospels that although the Lord Jesus came to the earth from heaven, He came to the earth with the Father. He said, &ldquo;He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone&rdquo; (John 8:29). When He was on the earth, He did not work by Himself, because the Father was with Him. Not only was the Father with Him, but the Spirit was also with Him wherever he went. Therefore, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit were embodied in Jesus the Nazarene.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CONTENT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The center of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is that the Triune God was incarnated to be the God-man Jesus, who brought our sins, our old man, the old creation, Satan, and the world to the cross and crucified them there. His death solved every problem and released the divine life from within Him. In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit; thus, when we believe in Him, He enters into our spirit to be our life and our everything, making us members of His Body, who are joined to Him. He is the Head, and we are the members who constitute the Body of Christ. This is the center of God&rsquo;s economy in the New Testament. To have a part in this, all we need to do is believe. This is our faith; this is what we believe.</p>
<p>Sadly, among tens of thousands of Christians, only a handful are able to speak our Christian faith in such a succinct way. Consequently, I hope that all the elders, co-workers, and full-timers will know this faith in a thorough way. We cannot simply tell people that we believe in Jesus; rather, we need to speak forth the kernel of the New Testament. The kernel of the New Testament is that the Triune God became flesh, passed through human living, was crucified, resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit and that He now enters into us to be our life, our person, and our everything and to mingle Himself with us, making us a part of the Body of Christ to express the Triune God. This is the New Testament ministry, which is our faith.</p>
<p>If we read John 14 through 16 carefully, we will see the deep thought contained in these chapters. The Lord said to His disciples, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me,...My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him&rdquo; (14:23). Moreover, the Lord prayed for the believers: &ldquo;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us&rdquo; (17:21). These words are profound. When the Lord Jesus said these words, He knew that Peter, John, and James had no way to apprehend them at that time but that when the Spirit of reality came, He would guide them into the reality of the truth (16:12-13). John, in particular, wrote several Epistles addressing this matter.</p>
<p>When the Spirit of reality came, He found a person named Saul of Tarsus, who had been taught the law of the Old Testament under the great rabbi Gamaliel; this provided Saul with a thorough knowledge of the law. Furthermore, the Holy Spirit revealed to him the New Testament economy, that is, the kernel of the New Testament, the deepest portion in the New Testament concerning the faith. In Colossians 1:25-26 Paul says, &ldquo;I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God, the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints.&rdquo; Here <em>you</em> refers to the church; Paul received a stewardship for the church. The word <em>stewardship</em> in Greek is translated elsewhere as &ldquo;economy.&rdquo; This indicates that when God&rsquo;s economy came to Paul, it became a stewardship. He became a steward in the house of God with a stewardship to dispense God&rsquo;s economy. Hence, Paul continued by saying, &ldquo;To complete the word of God.&rdquo; Prior to Paul, although the word of God existed, it had not yet been completed. The word of God was completed at the time of Paul.</p>
<p><em>Complete</em> is a weighty word. The word of God is the revelation of God, the holy Word of God spoken in the New Testament. There are twenty-seven books in the New Testament, of which fourteen, over half, are Paul&rsquo;s Epistles. If we were to take Paul&rsquo;s Epistles out of the New Testament, a great part would be missing, and we would not be able to see God&rsquo;s economy or the mystery of God in Christ. The fourteen Epistles of Paul form the kernel of the New Testament; they complete the word of God and fully reveal and fulfill the word of God. The portion that Paul completed is spoken of in Colossians 1:26: &ldquo;The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations.&rdquo; The words Paul spoke revealed the mystery hidden in God from the ages and from the generations; this mystery is Christ in us, the hope of glory (v. 27). Christ in us is our life today, and He will be our hope of glory in the future. This is God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, that is, the faith that God has given us in the New Testament. The apostles&rsquo; teaching is simply the content of the New Testament.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE MYSTERIES OF GOD AND<br />
OF CHRIST&mdash;CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching is also concerning the mysteries of God and of Christ (Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4; 5:32). The content of the New Testament, that is, our faith, is concerning the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ. The mystery of God is Christ; the mystery of Christ is the church. Hence, Christ and the church are the great mystery of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY IN FAITH</h2>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching is God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which is in faith (Jude 3; 1 Tim. 1:3-4). If we were to take the apostles&rsquo; teaching out of the Bible, the New Testament would be empty. The Old Testament concerns the law of Moses, and the New Testament concerns the apostles&rsquo; teaching, that is, God&rsquo;s New Testament economy in faith. Many Christians know that the Old Testament is concerning the law of Moses and that the New Testament is concerning the grace of Christ, but this is all they know. Very few know that the grace of Christ in the New Testament is God&rsquo;s economy. This economy is the Triune God who became flesh, passed through human living, was crucified, resurrected, became the life-giving Spirit, and enters into us to be our life and person, becoming one with us and making us part of the Body of Christ for His expression; the ultimate consummation of the Body of Christ will be the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem is the processed Triune God working Himself into His redeemed people to be one with them. There was the age before the law and the age of the law; now we are in the age of grace, and in the future there will be the age of the kingdom. Passing through one age after another, God accomplishes everything; eventually, in the new heaven and new earth, the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s economy, the New Jerusalem, will be manifested. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the church. This is God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, that is, the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>Although Luke was not an apostle, he wrote the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts under the direction of Paul. It can be said that Luke wrote for Paul based on all that Paul had conveyed to him. Mark was also not an apostle, but he was the spiritual son of Peter; Peter conveyed to Mark the things concerning the Lord Jesus, and Mark wrote accordingly. All the other writers, such as Matthew and John, were apostles. It is the apostles who completed the New Testament; hence, the content of the New Testament is the teaching of the apostles. Today our faith is the entire New Testament, which is the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>The denominations in Christianity promote certain practices in the New Testament as their faith. For example, the Baptists promote the practice of baptism by immersion; hence, their faith is baptism instead of the entire New Testament. Presbyterians promote the governing of the church by the presbytery as an item in their creed. As a result, they do not have the entire New Testament as their faith; rather, they take a certain item in the New Testament as the primary element of their faith. This is the case also with Episcopalians, Lutherans, and Methodists. The Pentecostal movement promotes speaking in tongues. This is the condition of Christianity today. If someone asks us what our faith is, we should tell him, &ldquo;Our faith is the entire New Testament, that is, the teaching of the apostles.&rdquo; The twenty-seven books of the New Testament are the teaching of the apostles and speak primarily of the economy of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADERSHIP IN THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTRY<br />
NOT RELYING ON A SINGLE PERSON</h2>
<p>For over a century, the matter of the New Testament ministry has been discussed, debated, disputed, and even attacked by Christians. Everyone is involved in discussions as to who should take the lead in the New Testament ministry. The Catholic Church says that Peter should take the lead, because Peter was the successor of the Lord Jesus. They also claim that the popes succeeded Peter. They claim that Peter was the first pope; thus, the pope should take the lead. Whenever those in the Catholic Church encounter a problem, their decision is not based upon the Bible but upon the papacy. Some may not say that it is according to the pope but according to the Vatican; nevertheless, because the Vatican refers to the pope, it is still the pope who takes the lead.</p>
<p>The Reformation, initiated by Martin Luther, recovered justification by faith and overthrew the headship of the pope. In the Lutheran Church, undoubtedly, Luther was considered to be the leader. The Baptist churches, on the other hand, are not led by any person but by the teaching of baptism. If a person is a preacher in the Baptist Church, whatever he teaches, speaks, and does must be according to baptism. If a preacher teaches, speaks, and does anything different from baptism, he will be rejected. As to the other denominations, some take an individual as their head, and others take their so-called faith as their head. In the Episcopalian Church, that is, the Anglican Church, the state church of England, the king or queen of England is the head.</p>
<p>According to the record of the New Testament, Peter took the lead at the beginning, but in Galatians 2:11-14, when Peter came to Antioch, Paul opposed him to his face because he stood condemned. Before some came from James, he continually ate with the Gentiles, but when they came, he shrank back and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision. The rest of the Jews also joined him in this hypocrisy. When Paul saw that they were not walking in a straightforward way in relation to the truth of the gospel, he said to Peter before them all, &ldquo;If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like the Jews?&rdquo; After this incident, it seems impossible that Peter would be able to continue to preach Jesus among the people. Not long after this, Paul went up to Jerusalem to discuss the matter of circumcision with the apostles and elders. He knew deep within that Peter&rsquo;s fault was apparent; God had established Peter to take the lead, but he led the saints into hypocrisy. This example shows that Peter was not the &ldquo;pope&rdquo;; he was not the leader.</p>
<p>In the New Testament ministry, who is the &ldquo;pope&rdquo;? Who is taking the lead? The teaching of the apostles is taking the lead. When Peter was rebuked, it was not actually Paul who rebuked him; it was the teaching in the New Testament that rebuked him. If one does not act according to the standard of the truth of the gospel, such an action damages and violates the truth of the gospel. It was the truth of gospel, not Peter, that was taking the lead. The teaching of the apostles is the leadership in the New Testament ministry. We began to see this matter in 1986; earlier, we were not clear concerning this point. Through our experience in serving the churches for the past several decades and due to our research and study, that is, our comparing and checking with the New Testament, we have seen that the leadership in the New Testament ministry does not rely on a single person, not on Peter, Paul, or anyone else; rather, it relies on the teaching of the apostles. Only the teaching of the apostles counts.</p>
<p>In the Catholic Church, Peter is considered irreproachable. He is called the successor of Jesus Christ, the leader in the New Testament. However, this is not according to the facts. When Peter and Paul carried out their ministry, their ministry was led by the apostles&rsquo; teaching. As an illustration, a nation is actually led by its constitution, not by its president. The &ldquo;constitution,&rdquo; that is, the leadership in the New Testament, is the teaching of the apostles; we all need to follow this teaching.</p><h2 class="head2">The New Testament Ministers<br />
Not Being Ruled by Man Directly<br />
but Sent by the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Perhaps some may say that Paul led a group of co-workers and that everything was under his direction. Although this is not altogether wrong, if we consider carefully the record in the Bible, we cannot find a definite verse that indicates that Paul was directing his co-workers. He did write to Timothy, saying, &ldquo;Be diligent to come to me quickly;...the cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, bring when you come, and the scrolls, especially the parchments&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:9, 13). In 1 Corinthians Paul severely rebuked the Corinthian believers, but when he wrote the book of 2 Corinthians, he was apprehensive and sorrowful within, anxiously awaiting the arrival of Titus so that he would know the condition of the Corinthian believers (2 Cor. 2:13; 7:6). At the end of 1 Corinthians, Paul indicated that he had hoped that Apollos would go to comfort the Corinthian believers, but Apollos was not willing. Regarding this Paul said, &ldquo;Concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him many times to come to you with the brothers; yet it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity&rdquo; (16:12). This is a strong proof that every co-worker has the liberty in the Holy Spirit in his work. According to our natural concept, we may think that Paul took the lead in the work in the same way that the pope does today; however, this understanding is not correct. If the pope were to say to a bishop under him, &ldquo;Go and pay a visit to Corinth,&rdquo; I doubt that any bishop would be like Apollos and dare say to the pope, &ldquo;It is not at all my desire to go now; I will go later when it is convenient for me.&rdquo; This proves that Paul did not direct the co-workers.</p>
<p>In the Catholic Church the Virgin Mary, the so-called mother of God, is considered to be without the sinful nature. Beginning in the Middle Ages, a great controversy began concerning whether or not Mary was without original sin. Finally in 1854, Pope Pius IX broke the deadlock and made it church dogma that Mary was without original sin. From then on, all Catholics and Catholic theologians must say that the Virgin Mary was without the sinful nature. Even Madame Guyon, author of <em>Sweet Smelling Myrrh,</em> obeyed the pope to the uttermost. Although the pope put her into prison, she still obeyed him. This is not according to the Scriptures.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Leadership in the New Testament Ministry<br />
Relying on the Teaching of the Apostles</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Apostles&rsquo; Teaching Not Allowing Man<br />
to Teach Things That Are Different<br />
from God&rsquo;s Economy</h2>
<p>The example concerning Paul and Apollos shows that Paul was not the directing one. In other words, a matter was not settled simply because Paul said something. In sending co-workers to particular places, Paul did not insist; rather, he gave the brothers absolute freedom. In the matter of speaking the truth, however, he was unyielding. In 1 Timothy 1:3 Paul told Timothy, &ldquo;Even as I exhorted you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things.&rdquo; From the context, these different things refer to the law, Old Testament genealogies (v. 4), and profane and old-womanish myths (4:7). According to Paul&rsquo;s thought, we should speak only God&rsquo;s economy, which is in faith; that is, we should speak only the apostles&rsquo; teaching. Hence, we draw the conclusion that it was the apostles&rsquo; teaching that took the lead in the New Testament, not Paul as an individual. The apostles&rsquo; teaching, the truth, the faith, the teaching of God&rsquo;s economy took the lead in the New Testament ministry.</p><h2 class="head3">Rejecting Everyone Who Goes Beyond<br />
the Teaching of Christ</h2>
<p>In 2 John 7-11 the apostle John charged the saints that if some did not bring them the teaching of Christ but preached that Jesus Christ did not come in the flesh, they should neither receive such ones into their house nor even greet them. In 3 John 9-10 Diotrephes, who loved to be first, would not receive the Lord&rsquo;s workers, including John, but babbled against them with evil words. Moreover, he forbade those intending to receive them and cast them out of the church. This indicates that John was merely carrying out the leading. Hence, the leading one is not an individual person but the apostles&rsquo; teaching; it is the faith that leads the saints.</p>
<p>In the very beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in mainland China, Brother Nee was clearly in the lead. Nevertheless, having worked with him for eighteen years, I can testify on his behalf that I cannot remember one instance in which he took the lead. One time a co-worker asked him, &ldquo;Brother Nee, I have a burden to go to Nanchang in Kiangsi Province. How do you feel?&rdquo; At that time Brother Nee was at home in his rocking chair. After being asked repeatedly, he continued not to say anything but kept rocking in his chair. Eventually, Brother Nee replied, &ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; When dinnertime came, he went to eat and did not continue the conversation.</p>
<p>Later I asked Brother Nee why he remained silent when someone asked him a question. He told me, &ldquo;This brother had already made the decision to go to Nanchang. If I were to tell him that he should go, he would go, but if I were to tell him that he should not go, he would still go. He came to ask me simply because he wanted to receive an &lsquo;endorsement&rsquo; so that he could say that Brother Nee wanted him to go. Why should I do that? Even if I were to ask him not to go, in the end he would still go, because he had already made the arrangement to go. He came to me merely to receive an &lsquo;endorsement.&rsquo;&rdquo; This shows that Brother Nee was not the so-called leading one; otherwise, if he felt that this brother should not go, he would have told him not to go. He was not the directing one, nor did he desire to be the directing one. Brother Nee also realized that even if he expressed how he felt, people might not listen.</p>
<p>After I went abroad, many people have attempted to add the title of &ldquo;pope&rdquo; to me. Consequently, I would like to ask whether I have been the directing one. Since 1949 I truly took the lead in the church and the work in Taiwan; nevertheless, from 1961 to 1984, a period of twenty-three years, I have never directed the church in Taipei to do anything nor have I interfered with the church. If I remember correctly, when I was first in the United States, Brother Chang Yu-nan wrote me every week, providing me with detailed fellowship concerning the church, and the letter was co-signed by Brother Chang Wu-chen. Later, Brother Yu-nan became physically quite weak, so Brother Wu-chen began writing me every two to six months. After some initial leading, I ceased to inquire about the matters related to the church in Taipei. Moreover, as a result of our publication work, at least six hundred churches were raised up in the West. None of them are under my control. This is strong proof that I am not the directing one and that I have no intention to be such. However, I am burdened that all the churches would walk according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching. If there is any discrepancy between the churches and the apostles&rsquo; teaching, I must speak up. This proves that, according to the fellowship in the New Testament, it should be the apostles&rsquo; teaching in the New Testament, not any person, that takes the lead among us.</p>
<p>Since my return to Taiwan in 1984 in order to change the system and bring in the new way, it may seem that I have done so much and that I am directing everything. Nevertheless, if someone inquires of the elders in the church in Taipei, he will find out that I have been in constant fellowship with them. Everything related to the church in Taipei has passed through the meeting, discussion, and decision of the elders before it was carried out. They do not simply do whatever I tell them; this would not be right. Neither is it right for two or three to make a decision and do something simply because they all agree that things should be done in a certain way. Rather, everything needs to be carried out according to the principle of the elders&rsquo; administration of the church; that is, the elders discuss matters together, seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading together, and make every decision in the elders&rsquo; meeting. After the decision is made, then they need to discuss who will carry out the matter; this person will be appointed in the elders&rsquo; meetings.</p>
<p>From the beginning of 1949 until 1988, not one local church on the island of Taiwan or anywhere else on the entire globe has received orders from me. Many times brothers have written to me and told me of the problems they are encountering and have asked me for advice. I often have answered by saying that they should bring this matter before the Lord in prayer and ask for His leading.</p>
<p>If a church does not walk according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching, this is truly a problem. When I returned to Taiwan in 1965 to handle the matter related to the four dissenting co-workers, I followed this principle. We must realize that the way we are taking is not the way of human organization but the way of following the apostles&rsquo; teaching in the New Testament. Everything is under the leadership of the apostles&rsquo; teaching, that is, God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, the faith of God in the New Testament. Whether in the work or in the church, we should rely upon the apostles&rsquo; teaching. The apostles&rsquo; teaching is the constitution of the church and the work.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING<br />
THE WORK WITH THE STUDENTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BODY BENEFITTING<br />
THE WHOLE BODY</h2>
<p>In human society typically many things are not discussed in public meetings but privately in small gatherings. The private discussions are then followed up by public meetings. This should not be our practice in the church life. In the church, matters should be discussed and fellowshipped by everyone in public meetings and not discussed in private fellowships. For over fifty years we have been paying attention to and leading the saints into this practice; nevertheless, at present this matter has not yet been adjusted among us.</p>
<p>It is not proper for us to have our private fellowships and then announce our private decisions in the meetings or present our private decisions as an order. It is wrong for only a few people to make decisions for everyone and for the majority not to have much knowledge about the matters at hand and to be in the passive position of receiving orders. This is altogether wrong because this is not the Body. Similar to our physical body, it is not proper for four or five members in private fellowships apart from the Body to make decisions for the Body. Any private fellowships apart from the fellowship of the Body are improper.</p>
<p>If someone desires to discuss matters privately in order to avoid revealing secrets, this is a great mistake. In the Body there should not be the need to keep secrets; when there is a secret in the Body, it is a cancer. A cancer is produced when a group of &ldquo;cells&rdquo; gather by themselves to keep a secret. In the end they become a cancer. Hence, in the church life we need to avoid keeping secrets. Do not be afraid that others would know something, because we are not organizing a political party; we are in the church. Almost every nation in the world has two, three, or four political parties that are always involved in intrigue against one another. Even a great democratic country such as the United States is no exception. In contrast, we need to see that there are no parties among the churches. There is only one church, one Body. As we are serving in different localities, there should be no distinction between Taipei and Taichung. We are one church expressed in every place as the one Body.</p>
<p>There is nothing that cannot be made public among us. We should not be afraid that others know of our affairs. For instance, all the churches should be able to know about the affairs of the church in Taipei. The advantage is that the other churches can pray for the church in Taipei. Recently, we completely &ldquo;dissected&rdquo; the church in Taipei. At the time, it was as if the church in Taipei was put on an operating table; after being dissected, it was sewn back up. Not only did the church survive, it became even more living and healthy than before. Whether the church is in Kaohsiung, Tainan, or Taichung, nothing should be hidden; rather, everything can be completely displayed. For instance, in the past because the church in Taichung had a need, it had the courage to tell us that the church in Taipei should not take care of only itself. Likewise, the church in Tainan had similar fellowship concerning its need. This is good because it proves that we do not have private fellowships among us. Through open fellowship, all of us are able to see the needs of the churches. This is the lesson we all need to learn.</p>
<p>According to the intention of the elders of the church in Taipei, originally they felt that there was no need to ask so many halls to fellowship regarding their condition; instead, they wanted to choose only good halls and good districts to give their testimonies. This kind of attitude is to report the good news and conceal the bad news. To exhibit only the nice things is similar to inviting people to our house and allowing them to sit only in the living room while preventing them from entering the bathroom. When we go to someone&rsquo;s house, if we see only the living room, it is difficult to determine whether the house is neat and clean; in order to determine whether the house is neat, clean, and orderly, we need to take a look at the bedrooms, kitchen, and bathrooms. Hence, in leading the church, we should not be afraid to reveal the true condition of the church for fellowship; this will help us to know what needs to be improved and strengthened.</p>
<p>Concerning the work with the students, we first need to study the college work and then work with the high school and junior high students. Every church involved with the students&rsquo; work should fellowship with one another to learn from one another&rsquo;s practices. If some have been warned or admonished due to their mistakes, we can receive help from them. In this way we will all receive the blessing. During fellowship, we need to try to speak without giving any opinion. For example, if we are studying the college work, and someone working with high school students speaks up, this may only be an opinion. His fellowship, however, may not be an opinion if it is confined to the issue under discussion. Through fellowship, we will receive both the burden to pray and the revelation. When we listen to others&rsquo; fellowship, we need to realize that we are being placed on the altar to be slaughtered so that the entire Body may reap the benefit.</p><h2 class="head1">WORKING FOR THE LORD<br />
AND NOT RELYING ON ORGANIZATION</h2>
<p>To work for the Lord, we should not rely on organization; once there is an arrangement and organization, our work will be similar to a worldly enterprise that first establishes a small unit and then develops into a bigger organization. This is how a general leads an army. First, he trains the soldiers; then he forms them into a corps or division. Although such an arrangement is not altogether useless in the Lord&rsquo;s work, if our work relies entirely on organization, it will become like degraded Christianity. Organization is not a sign of advance but of becoming fallen. If the church is established by organization, it is merely an organization, not the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is an organism. It can be compared to the human body. In the operation of the human body, although there is a certain amount of organization, it is linked to the body organically. For example, although dentures can be inserted into our mouth, they are merely an organization; they may be in the right position and have the proper function, but they do not have an organic relation with the body.</p>
<p>The value of a work or a church depends on how much is left after organization is taken away. In 1975, due to the need, there was a change in the church in Taipei. The church in Taipei had a history of twenty-six years, extending from 1949 to 1975; through these twenty-six years of development, it was inevitable for the church to experience some changes. The longer a church is in existence, the more the church becomes organized and develops a kind of organization; the more the church is an organization, the more fallen it becomes. Therefore, no matter where we work, we must endeavor to avoid organization.</p>
<p>After the change of system in 1975, the number attending our Lord&rsquo;s table meeting decreased by one-third. When there was an organization, over seven thousand met in seventy to eighty homes for the Lord&rsquo;s table. After the change, the organization was removed, and everyone walked and served according to the spirit without relying on organization. In the end, the number of attendees dropped from seven thousand to four thousand; approximately one-third of the people were gone. This proves that in 1975 one-third of those attending the Lord&rsquo;s table were upheld by organization, and two-thirds were upheld by life. Some said that it was sad to lose one-third of the people; nevertheless, I felt that it was quite good that two-thirds remained and that not everyone left once the organization was removed. I believe that if the organization in the denominations ceased, only one-tenth would remain, and the majority would be scattered.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE SAINTS TO DEVELOP<br />
THEIR ORGANIC FUNCTION</h2>
<p>Those who work with the students need to lead them to function for the development of their organic function. The development of the students&rsquo; organic function is an important part of our service. In the past we may not have paid much attention to this matter; instead, we relied on organization and arrangement. In fact, part of the work with the students relies on visiting people through door-knocking. Every student needs to knock on the doors of his classmates. This is not an arrangement. Although outwardly speaking it seems to be an arrangement, this arrangement is for every brother and sister to fulfill his or her organic function. In the same way, after we preach the gospel through door-knocking and bring people to salvation, we need to begin to contact the new believers and help them establish home meetings and group meetings. Apparently, it may seem to be an arrangement, but this arrangement is for all the brothers and sisters to fulfill their organic function. In the matter of door-knocking, if there is no arrangement, everything will amount to zero. This kind of arrangement relies on the organic function of the saints and develops their organic function.</p>
<p>The organic function of the saints will not be influenced by a change in the national situation. Even if the national situation changes, the brothers and sisters can spread to the whole inhabited earth, to the cities, villages, roadsides, and parks and fulfill their organic function by preaching the gospel everywhere. If preaching the gospel is merely a matter of arrangement, once the national situation changes and the arrangement is gone, no one will do anything because, like a machine without an arrangement, no one will know what to do. Thus, we always need to remember that the church and the Lord&rsquo;s work are an organism, not a machine. If it is a machine, it would not be able to move when there is no &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; or when a &ldquo;screw&rdquo; is missing. However, this does not apply to organic function. For example, if a person has a kitchen and a dining room in his house, he can cook three meals, sit down, and eat with his family. If, however, the kitchen were demolished and the dining room no longer existed, the family would still think of a way to eat. They could still buy bread or noodles and eat by the roadside and stay well fed. Man&rsquo;s eating is something organic and does not require a certain arrangement. When we lead the church and the Lord&rsquo;s work, we can still find food to satisfy the need of the Body even if the &ldquo;dining room&rdquo; and &ldquo;kitchen&rdquo; are destroyed. Hence, although the environment may change, our organic function of eating continues.</p>
<p>Some may say that because of the change in the outward arrangement, many works have been incorporated into the training center, and thus, the campus work is affected. This proves that our work is a matter of arrangement and is not organic. For example, our literature work puts out books and publications when we have desks and sufficient equipment, and we also put out books and publications when we do not have desks or sufficient equipment. We write when we have pens and pencils, and if we run out of pens and pencils, we continue by writing with brushes. No matter what circumstances we face, we continue to put out our publications because our literature work is organic. This organic operation cannot be defeated or hindered. We should lead the church and the work in a similar way.</p>
<p>My inward, organic feeling toward the literature work and the leading of the church remains the same. Based on my learning, I do not want to have so many arrangements, but I would like to serve and lead by the organic function. I hope that we would all remember this principle. It is not that we cannot use outward arrangements, but we should make use of them only when they are necessary.</p><h2 class="head1">SOME PRINCIPLES CONCERNING<br />
THE STUDENTS&rsquo; WORK AND THE TRAINING CENTER</h2>
<p>There is a need for some explanation regarding the students&rsquo; work and the training center. If in our understanding the students&rsquo; work, the ministry, and the training are combined together, this is wrong. We have no such intention. At present, all the full-time serving ones are in the training, and as a result, the personnel is temporarily in the hands of the training. Consequently, regardless of the specific service, whether with the high school or junior high students, if there is a need for the help of the trainees, we can fellowship with the training center and let the training center arrange for some to work with the high school students and some with the junior high students. No one should go to the training center and summon a certain number of trainees to help with a specific student work. This kind of fellowship is neither proper nor right. The arrangement of personnel should be under the direction of the training center.</p>
<p>All the saints serving full time, whether they are laboring in colleges, communities, high schools, or junior high schools, are being trained in the training center. In the training there is a specific time for classes and for work. The living arrangements and rest schedule of the trainees is completely planned and arranged by the training center. However, this should not change the nature of the students&rsquo; work and cause it to merge with that of the training center; this is an erroneous understanding. The students&rsquo; work is absolutely an independent work, and it cannot be interfered with easily. If there is a need in the churches due to the full-timers&rsquo; participation in the training, the churches should fellowship with the training center through the proper channel. For instance, if there is a need for fifty people to labor in the college work, the training center will consider this need and fellowship with the brothers. They will assess the situation and consider how many the community needs, how many the colleges need, and how many the high schools and junior high schools need. In this way the training center will determine a number for each work; perhaps only forty people will be available for the college work. This will provide an overall strategy that keeps the whole work in view.</p>
<p>It would be foolish to merge the students&rsquo; work with the training center. For example, the Ministry of National Defense does not need to merge with the Ministry of Finance simply because the former needs money from the latter. If this were the case, the Ministry of National Defense would not be able to engage in warfare. The Ministry of Finance does not know how to fight; this is the job of the Ministry of National Defense. When the Ministry of National Defense needs money, it must use its budget through the proper procedures and channels. Every nation has a system to budget for national defense. This enables it to carry out matters related to national defense according to a budget. The Ministry of National Defense does not need to merge with the Ministry of Finance simply because it needs money.</p>
<p>The proper way for us to serve is to arrange for certain ones from the entire work to labor on the colleges, that is, to make them &ldquo;ministers of the national defense.&rdquo; When they serve on the various campuses, they should serve according to their capacity. For instance, in Taipei we need to see how many universities there are, how many brothers and sisters are studying in each one, and how many among them are able and have a strong desire to be useful. Based upon this, we can decide how many trainees will be needed to cooperate with the college work. Because the trainee brothers and sisters are now in the training, it is more than appropriate for us to fellowship our need with the training center. We should not go to the training center to recruit people secretly; this is not permissible. Each church or school should inform the training center regarding the number of people and the age group they need; then the training center can allot the needed manpower to the churches and schools according to the actual situation. After we hand over the manpower, the training center will not interfere with the work in the churches and in the schools.</p>
<p>The trainees are restricted in their time. For instance, after being sent out to labor for a while, they need to come back to the training center to receive more training and do their assigned homework. Hence, if the college work desires to use some of the manpower from the training center, it needs to cooperate with the training center. If it does not cooperate, the training will not be able to proceed. The responsible brothers from all the churches need to pay attention to this matter and cooperate with the training center.</p>
<p>Since most of the trainees are young people, the training has arranged a comprehensive and integrated training curriculum to strengthen them in such matters as truth, life, the gospel, the church, and so forth. In regard to their character, we need to train them in the habits of rising early and having a set schedule for work and rest. For instance, they are assigned certain times to read the Bible, read the ministry, discuss the ministry mutually, and attend Greek class. All these items are included in their training. Every day they also need to allot some time to carry out the student work, either in the colleges, high schools, or junior high schools. With this kind of comprehensive training, we believe that they will be able to accomplish much.</p>
<p>When the training is in session, the training center will surely cooperate with any need related to the work with the students. However, since the trainees are &ldquo;on loan&rdquo; to the various services in coordination, they need to return to the training center after serving. These trainees are still required to follow all the regulations set up by the training. In other words, even their campus work is part of their work related to the training. Some people may be under the wrong impression and believe that the training has taken over everything. We should be clear that these trainees are the possessions of the churches; similar to a big family, all the children are ours, but we also send them to school.</p>
<p>Every school has its class schedule. For instance, often the first session begins at 8:00 A.M., and the school dismisses at 3:30 P.M.; the school has a set timetable. If a father tells the school that his child&rsquo;s grandfather is visiting and wants to take the child out for lunch, I believe that the school would not be very happy. Although the child belongs to the father and the father has all the rights to the child, he should abide by all the regulations of the school because he has committed his child to the school; otherwise, he makes it difficult for the school to function. Hence, if parents desire that a school provide their children with a good education, they should have the peace of mind to give them to the school and let them abide by the school&rsquo;s regulations. Some schools may require the students to live in dormitories and may have certain regulations related to the dormitory. No parent would like a school if it had no regulations and the students were free to wander about after class and return to the dormitory in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Since the parents have given their children to the school, they surely desire that their children abide by the school regulations. For example, often students are allowed to leave the dormitory after 2:00 P.M. on Saturday but must be back to school at 7:00 P.M. on Lord&rsquo;s Day evening. During this period of time, the school gives the children back to the parents and has no responsibility over them. This is the principle of schooling&mdash;the parents must cooperate with the school&rsquo;s timetable; only then can the education be successful. This example is to show the saints that we cannot incorporate the work with the training center; this would not be right.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING THE LESSON OF THE CROSS</h2>
<p>The goal of our service is to bring the brothers and sisters into the church life. When we began our work in Taipei in 1949, the land for hall one of the church in Taipei was bought with the money of the ministry. Later, with great effort we gradually built up the church in Taipei. In 1962, when I began the work in America, I did not bring any brothers with me; I simply took my Bible bag and left by myself. I left the brothers in Taipei with what I had labored on for over ten years. Now in 1984 I have returned, desiring with all of you to bring the church on. I admit that wherever I go, there are no peaceful days. To speak frankly, if anyone wants to have peaceful days, he should not come to listen to my messages. He should go to the denominations because it is very &ldquo;peaceful&rdquo; there. Year after year in the denominations, both those who preach and those who listen live peacefully. The Lord has not commissioned me to do this kind of work. Wherever I go, I work in such a way that no one is able to sleep peacefully. The brothers who conduct the training are apprehensive that once my burden comes they will not be able to live peacefully. It is truly difficult to conduct the training in Taipei. On one hand, it needs to please the many elders in the churches, while on the other hand, it needs to satisfy the young people and also myself. This is not easy.</p>
<p>Since the start of the training, there has been much gossip. We have all heard the gossip, but no one has heard my voice. A person who takes the lead in the Lord&rsquo;s work and the Lord&rsquo;s church must be like this; he must learn the lesson of the cross. Some who come from other places speak loosely regarding whatever they see. They say that this is right and that is wrong, this is good and that is bad. They speak this way because they have never learned the lesson of the cross. The first lesson of the cross is not to speak. Even if we were the apostle Paul, when we come to the church in Taipei, we should first come and sit without saying anything. If a person is able to sit for twenty days, even four months, without saying a word, he would be comparable to Paul; such a one would be useful and able to accomplish something. When some people go to a certain place, they begin to speak loosely and express their own views after having only been there for two weeks; this is to express their opinion. We may use the example of riding in someone&rsquo;s car. One who has truly learned the lesson of the cross does not have anything to say concerning the speed and condition of the driving when he rides in another person&rsquo;s car. He does not comment whether the driver drives too slow or too fast, or whether the driver should make a left turn or a right turn, or go forward or back up. Willingness to say something proves that a person has not learned the lesson of the cross.</p>
<p>We may have heard many doctrines concerning the cross, but when situations come, they manifest whether or not we truly know the cross. We can tell how much a person has learned the lesson of the cross by his speaking. One who has truly learned the lesson of the cross does not and dares not speak loosely; speaking is the touchstone of the cross. If someone has truly learned the lesson of the cross, he will not speak loosely when he visits another place. To use the example of driving, only the driver should speak. When we are in someone&rsquo;s car, we should not say nonsensical things, such as, &ldquo;Your driving is not good.&rdquo; We do not need to speak, because we are not in our car and we are not the one driving. Someone may go to Kaohsiung and say that Kaohsiung is good in a certain matter and not good in another matter; this shows that he has not learned the lesson of the cross and does not know the cross.</p>
<p>We realize that the brothers and sisters serving full time in the churches are inadequate in many ways and that there is a need for some to perfect them properly; thus, we have picked up the burden to provide these full-timers with some training. After the training, we need to consider where we should send them. For example, when someone establishes a medical school or a department of medicine, there must be a hospital nearby that will cooperate with the school. In this way, the medical students will have a place for internships. Without a hospital, the students will not have a place to practice what they have learned. For a medical school to be established, cooperation must be successfully established between a hospital and the medical school. Similarly, the trainees cannot stay in the training center forever; they must go out and practically apply what they have learned. Hence, we require that they go out to labor; in order for them to be able to labor, they must fellowship with the churches in their localities. When the training fellowships with the churches, it demonstrates that what the training carries out is not for the training but for the churches.</p>
<p>I hope we can all see that neither the church nor various works are being merged with the training center. This fellowship is so that all of us may learn the lesson that we are not a social organization that has private fellowships. The churches should not take this way. If we take this way, we should permanently close down and do no more work. Our concept must be utterly changed. We need to realize that we have been saved and regenerated, that we have been sanctified, and that we are in the process of transformation. This is the same in regard to serving in the church; we must pass through regeneration, sanctification, and transformation. We need to serve the church with such a vision.</p>
<p>Through this kind of fellowship and explanation, I believe that the brothers and sisters will have a deeper realization of the cross. In this period of time, if you have anything to say, you must be cautious. Not being careful can be likened to a household full of women whose gossip and criticisms are not fair. There is a saying in Chinese: &ldquo;Even an honest official cannot judge family affairs precisely.&rdquo; No one can precisely judge the family affairs of the church; thus, we should not criticize so easily. We need to have an understanding of the training as a whole. As for unintentional criticisms, we do not now know how to handle them, and we find it difficult to handle them. Thus, we need to pay special attention to these matters.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING THE LESSON OF NOT SPEAKING LOOSELY</h2>
<p>May the Lord cover me with His blood. I have been serving with the brothers for several decades, and none of you, whether in Taiwan or abroad, have ever heard me say anything loosely. I have never said that a certain place is good or that another place is not good. I have never said that Japan is good or that Korea is good. The elders and especially the co-workers must learn the lesson of not speaking loosely, regardless of where they are. If they can refrain from speaking too much, regardless of where they are, their work will surely be successful. One who speaks much cannot help people, but one who speaks little is able to render the most help to people.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago when I was in Shanghai, there were five co-workers, of whom I was the last to arrive. One day, one of the co-workers was about to travel to another place. Because of this he went to Brother Nee and asked him, saying, &ldquo;A certain place has invited me to work, but I do not know what to do.&rdquo; Brother Nee replied, &ldquo;You simply need to do one thing, that is, to say &lsquo;I do not know.&rsquo;&rdquo; This means that when someone asks us what he should do regarding a certain matter, we should have only one answer: &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo; Later, another person may ask the same question. To him we should also give the same answer: &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most people may wonder how a person can carry out a work if he does not know anything. Actually, we need to realize that we can help people the most when we truly do not know anything; if we know everything, we will not be able to help others. For instance, if we have the answer regardless of whether people ask us about the east or the west, or about our mother-in-law or our daughter-in-law, we will be useless in God&rsquo;s hand. Some co-workers are like this; in the end they have no usefulness in God&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>A good doctor does not give people a diagnosis casually. Doctors with special skills often sense their own inadequacy. Although they are very familiar with their own specialty, they sense that their knowledge is limited to certain matters, to a special field. If they encounter other problems, they are aware of the need to consult and discuss with doctors in the relevant fields. Those who do so are good doctors. Those who think that they know everything are &ldquo;medical quacks.&rdquo; Those who have not studied medicine thoroughly often think that they know everything, yet those who have studied medicine more thoroughly rarely say that they know anything; they often say that they do not know. When the co-workers go out, they must have this kind of attitude: &ldquo;I do not know; I have learned so little.&rdquo; Even if we really know something, unless we are in our own place, that is, unless we are in our own &ldquo;car&rdquo; and we are the one &ldquo;driving,&rdquo; we should not say anything. We need this kind of attitude and learning to work for the Lord.</p>
<p>We fellowship these points with the hope that we will all learn this lesson. We should not only pay attention to how to carry out the students&rsquo; work or to how well we do it; rather, we need to pay attention to the matter of the cross, put it in our heart, and learn this lesson together. If we learn this lesson well, our work with the students will surely succeed; however, if the students&rsquo; work is not successful, it is not because the way is not good but because our learning is inadequate.</p>
<p>We should labor and take the lead according to this principle and continue to keep this principle by giving everyone the full opportunity, enlightening them, and inspiring their organic function. Whether it is the work with the college, high school, or junior high school students, the first group of people we can and should use is the existing brothers and sisters who are students. For instance, we can list all the colleges and universities and see how many brothers and sisters we have in each of these schools. Then we need to motivate them and help them to function. If there are fifty brothers and sisters in the National Taiwan University, the first thing we should do is to motivate them to labor on their university. After motivating them, we should see how many full-time trainee brothers and sisters are needed to cooperate with them and strengthen them. If we begin in this way and follow this principle, I believe that the students&rsquo; work will be successful.</p>
<p>For over three years we have been studying the way for the church to gain the increase and have seen that door-knocking gains people, the home meetings keep people, the group meetings join people together, and the district meetings bring people into the church. The principle is the same with the students&rsquo; work. We need to visit people and gain people directly on the campuses. Then we need to keep them by the principle of the home meetings. Although the students do not have homes, we must find a way, based on this principle, to keep them. Then we need to use the group meetings to join them with others. Finally, we can use the district meetings to bring them into the church. While the work of gaining people is done on the campuses, we still need to bring the new believers to attend the district meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day so that they can taste the church life and have some knowledge and feeling for the church. Whether it is the campus work or any other work, we may have all kinds of activities during the week, but we must bring the new ones to the church meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. I am presenting some principles, but there is still the need for the elders to study concerning the details. If we are able to practice these points well, we will succeed.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING<br />
THE WORK WITH THE STUDENTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">ANY WORK PRODUCED BY INCITEMENT<br />
BEING WITHOUT ETERNAL VALUE</h2>
<p>As we lead the church and the work, we should not rely too much upon organization. This does not mean that we should not have any arrangement. No matter what we do or what kind of move we have, there is a need for some arrangement. Without a certain amount of arrangement, it is difficult to move; hence, there is a need for some arrangement. However, to work merely by organization is the way of degraded Christianity. Moreover, we need to pay attention to never incite or stir people up. While this may have some impact at the beginning, in the long run and in reality, inciting people has no eternal value of life. Any work done out of incitement does not last. For example, after the international high school and junior high students&rsquo; meeting in 1987, the result in all the localities seemed quite good, but things changed with the passage of time, and now we may say that the positive situation was only momentary and that not much fruit remains.</p>
<p>At the very beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, whether in the work related to the church, the gospel, or the students, we always tried to avoid inciting people. From the time we were raised up by the Lord, we have had much experience in this regard and have seen that whatever comes out of incitement does not have the value of life. We have learned many lessons in this matter. Currently, the move of the work in many places depends too much on incitement, especially the work of the high school and junior high students. Besides having organization, there is arrangement and incitement. It seems that locality after locality has not paid attention to the testimony of the genuine work of life. Consequently, we need to spend some time to pray before the Lord not only for an open door in all the colleges and high schools but also for some among us to be raised up to bear the burden in life. These ones will bear the burden to labor on a particular school, to serve with the high schools and junior high schools, or to work with the college students. In short, we ask the Lord to save us from incitement; we do not want any incitement but a genuine burden of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL WORK BEING PRODUCED<br />
BY A GENUINE BURDEN OF LIFE</h2>
<p>In the church, anything that comes out of incitement is temporary because its principle is wrong. Those who incite others are soulish and cannot touch people&rsquo;s spirit. Only the kind of work that comes out of genuine prayer, genuine burden, and paying a great price is of life, has the issue of life, and is eternal. According to my knowledge, there is a definite lack in the condition of the students&rsquo; work in various localities in regard to the element of the burden of life. Although there may be eight or ten junior high and high schools in a given locality, we should not simply go out and recruit eight or ten &ldquo;salespersons&rdquo; and assign them to work in the schools. This can be compared to using salespersons to sell commodities. While salespersons can be assigned in this way, we cannot do the same in the matter of preaching the gospel and ministering life. In our students&rsquo; work, we must see if there are any brothers and sisters who are burdened for these schools or for a particular school; then we need to fellowship with them as to how they can serve these schools. Spiritual work is altogether a matter of burden and of life and is not carried out by methods one uses in a career. In other words, spiritual work cannot be carried out simply by assignment and negotiation.</p>
<p>In the Bible, there is no such thing as assignment or negotiation; rather, everything is carried out according to burden. The elders in all the churches need to pay attention to this matter. Since they are the ones who take care of their locality, they should first receive a burden. If the elders do not receive a burden, it will be difficult for the students&rsquo; work to advance and continue. Some brothers and sisters may receive a burden directly from the Lord. This is acceptable. In short, with the students&rsquo; work, there must be the initiation of someone who has received a burden; it may be that the elders receive the burden or that other saints pray and the Lord answers their prayers by raising up burdened ones to do the work directly. Perhaps their burden is toward a particular school; then we should let them labor on that school. While laboring, they still need to remember to follow the principle of never trying to incite people or trying to gain eight or ten people at one time; inciting people and gaining large numbers fast are not according to the principle in the Bible. We need to remember that even if we gain fruit by incitement, it will disappear within half a year.</p>
<p>For example, in the past some suggested to conduct a training camp in Taichung before school started in order to gain the college students. In the end, over one thousand six hundred were baptized. Nevertheless, it seems that there was no further development. Instead of spending the time and effort to labor on these one thousand six hundred, we should devote the manpower to our burden. In other words, we should lead the students one by one to pick up the burden to labor. Perhaps the burdened ones may labor on only two hundred students, and if the majority remains, this will be effective. Through incitement, we may quickly gain one thousand six hundred people, but in the end, we may have only their names but not their persons. Moreover, knocking on the doors of the students is very different from preaching the gospel in the communities. While people in the community have addresses, students have a great deal of mobility, which makes it difficult to knock on their doors.</p>
<p>We need to bear in mind that to do a work of incitement will waste our time and energy. In other words, works produced by incitement are not solid; a solid work must be carried out from one&rsquo;s burden. For example, some brothers and sisters may have the burden to take care of the students&rsquo; work. If they have a burden, there is no need for incitement. Instead, they should begin by praying. This matches our experience. When we pray to the Lord and ask Him for a certain one, He may grant this one to us. Then our rising up is out of a burden, and we can impart this burden into people and lead them according to life. After receiving the burden, they will gradually lead others as well.</p>
<p>According to our observation, we cannot say that what we have done is not good or is wrong. However, using a method to carry out the work, that is, to push and incite people, will not yield much result. If a brother contacts his classmates out of a burden he has received, he does not need to contact many classmates. He only needs to contact one or two. By doing this, he will impart a &ldquo;spirit of producing and propagation&rdquo; into them. This is the real producing, the real propagation. We do not need to incite, promote, or lead people to do anything; this kind of work eventually produces nothing. Rather, we all need to have a burden and labor in it actively.</p>
<p>We must keep this principle. We should never expect a quick success in the work. Some kinds of fungus, such as mushrooms, sprout overnight, but plants such as apple trees are not able to grow and bear fruit in a single night. Even wheat takes a few months to bear grain. This is the same with regard to spiritual work; it is a matter of burden, life, labor, and paying a price. Hence, no matter what we do, if we merely rely on a method, there will not be much eternal value in the result. Even in regard to what we do in the training, we need to consider whether it comes out of burden or incitement. Anything that comes out of incitement does not have much value and cannot last eternally; only that which comes out of burden can last.</p>
<p>I hope that the elders and co-workers receive this word. From now on, no matter what kind of work we lead, we must stay in this principle. We should never incite others or do something out of incitement. To incite people can be likened to making artificial flowers. Today many factories in Hong Kong and Taiwan make artificial flowers; in order to increase sales, they can make thousands of flowers overnight. The real flowers, however, are different; they cannot grow that fast. There must be seeds of life and then cultivation; after some time, there will be a result. I hope that we all learn this lesson so that our work will have a future. Otherwise, our work will be in vain. After a period of incitement, there will be nothing, and after another time of incitement, there still will be nothing. This is what we need to avoid.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CRYING OUT TO THE LORD,<br />
ASKING HIM TO RAISE UP BURDENED ONES</h2>
<p>We love the Lord, fellowship with the Lord, and receive the Lord&rsquo;s dealing. In the Lord&rsquo;s dealing, we receive His burden. After receiving a burden, we need to pay a price. Everyone who receives a burden needs to pay a price. Upon receiving a burden, we need to pay the price to labor, sow, cultivate, water, and take care of the new ones. Then at a certain time, we will reap the harvest. This is the way to lead the church, and this is also the way to carry out the work with the junior high and high school students. Actually, this is the way to carry out every work. There are secondary schools all over Taiwan; I hope that the brothers and sisters will receive a burden related to the students. This applies also to the children.</p>
<p>We need to come together to pray specifically for the students&rsquo; work that the Lord would open the door for us and raise up burdened ones to carry out this work. This is a desperate need. As for the way, the brothers&rsquo; houses and sisters&rsquo; houses are quite good. Moreover, if there are saints who are willing to open their homes as &ldquo;support stations,&rdquo; it will be a proper and effective way to labor on the students. Sometimes we do need to borrow some ways, but more fundamentally, we need burdened ones. We all need to cry out to the Lord and ask Him to raise up more burdened ones.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRINCIPLE OF DISCUSSING MATTERS<br />
IN THE ELDERS&rsquo; MEETING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 28:29-30; Acts 15:6-22, 28-29</h1>
<p>In the church life the principle of discussing matters in the elders&rsquo; meeting is of great importance. The church is an assembly of many persons; if we think that the discussion of matters in the elders&rsquo; meeting is the same as the discussion of official business in the world, this view is absolutely wrong. The Bible contains no such thought, and strictly speaking, it does not allow us to do so. According to the record in Acts 14:23, once the church came into being, elders were appointed in the churches locality by locality.</p>
<p>The designation <em>elders</em> is derived from the Old Testament. It is not a new term in the New Testament. In Genesis the record is mostly of individuals, not of a congregation. This record extends from Adam until Jacob, including Joseph. It is not until Exodus that the congregation of Israel appears. This congregation consisted of the descendants of Jacob. Thus, in Exodus there is a congregation including a group of elders (cf. 4:29; 12:21; 19:7; 24:9).</p>
<p>The appointment of elders is based on the outward manifestation of their actual condition. For example, elders in a clan are determined by age and conduct, that is, by the manifestation of the maturity of the clan members. No doubt, Moses appointed the elders of Israel based upon their age and conduct. When Moses ascended Mount Sinai to draw near to God, he brought with him seventy elders (vv. 1, 9). In the Old Testament, before there were kings among the children of God, the elders were the rulers and administrators; nevertheless, if the elders wanted to understand God&rsquo;s intention toward His people, they needed the help of the priests. In the Old Testament the elders were a group of older ones who were responsible for the administration and management of practical affairs, and the priests were a group of people who drew near to God to seek God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the Levites served God by bearing the responsibility of slaughtering cattle for the offerings, and the priests lit the lamps and burned the incense. In addition, the priests bore a great and important commission to teach the children of Israel concerning the law in the Old Testament and to let them know all the words written by God in the Old Testament. Although God&rsquo;s written word is extensive, it could not cover every matter. In addition to the written word, there was a need for another item, that is, the breastplate, which the high priest wore when he came near to God. The Bible calls this item the &ldquo;breastplate of judgment&rdquo; (Exo. 28:29-30). Every time a question or problem arose among God&rsquo;s people that the priests could not answer based on the law of the Old Testament, the high priest was needed to bear the breastplate of judgment before God to receive a direct revelation from Him.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the administration of God among His people was neither a democracy nor an autocracy but a theocracy; that is, God ruled His people directly. God led and governed His people by His written word and by instant instruction transmitted through the breastplate of judgment worn by the high priest. Hence, two categories of people carried out this government: the elders and the priests. The elders carried out God&rsquo;s administration, and the priests received instructions from God. If there had been only elders but not priests, there would have been only administrative personnel without a channel, or means, to receive divine revelation. The priests were the channel and means through which divine revelation was received.</p>
<p>In the New Testament God still desires to administrate His children through the elders, and they must be assisted by the priests. In the New Testament all Christians, those who have been saved and regenerated, are priests (1 Pet. 2:9). Hence, the elders appointed from among the believers are also priests. In the age of the Old Testament the elders and priests were two separate groups of people, but in the New Testament age elders and priests are the same group of people. On the one hand, they rule the children of God; on the other hand, they seek God&rsquo;s instructions. In the New Testament age every one of us has a Bible in our hands through which we can search and know God&rsquo;s intention. However, the written word is not written so completely that there is no need for the instant revelation of the Holy Spirit, typified by the breastplate of judgment in the Old Testament.</p><h2 class="head1">LETTING THE HOLY SPIRIT BE<br />
THE PRESIDING ONE</h2>
<p>The principle of the discussion of church affairs in the elders&rsquo; meeting is to let the Holy Spirit be the presiding One. In the elders&rsquo; meeting, we should never elect a presiding officer; if we elect one, we annul the authority of the Holy Spirit. We need to believe that every time we meet together, the Lord is in our midst (Matt. 18:20). Today the Lord is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), that is, the Holy Spirit, who is with us in all the gatherings of the church. The elders&rsquo; meeting is no exception, and it surely has the presence of the Holy Spirit. We must bear in mind that to elect someone to preside over the meeting is offensive to the Holy Spirit. In the church the Holy Spirit is the presiding One in all the meetings; thus, we should not have another presiding officer. The unique presiding One is the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL ATTENDANTS BRINGING UP<br />
MATTERS FOR DECISION<br />
BY FOLLOWING THE LORD&rsquo;S LEADING</h2>
<p>In the elders&rsquo; meeting, all the attendants may bring up matters to be decided upon by following the Lord&rsquo;s leading. There is no need for an agenda in the elders&rsquo; meeting. When the elders come together, if someone senses the leading within to mention a certain matter that needs a decision, he may mention it. After this, everyone needs to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading together. Perhaps some may have the same feeling, and some may have a different feeling; all may speak forth their feeling so that everyone may seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading together. We can see this principle clearly from the example in Acts 15.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO FOLLOW THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
IN DISCUSSING MATTERS</h2>
<p>In the elders&rsquo; meeting, we need to learn to follow the Holy Spirit in discussing matters. Hence, the elders should not only be elders but also priests who draw near to God and contact God. It is not sufficient for the elders to merely carry out the administration of the church; they must have direct contact with God and seek God. Their relationship with God must be so intimate that He can tell them His intention at any time. God tells man His intention by two means: the Bible and the Holy Spirit, which is represented by the breastplate of judgment in the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Neither Democracy nor Autocracy<br />
but Theocracy</h2>
<p>When the elders follow the Holy Spirit in discussing matters, there is neither a democracy nor an autocracy but a theocracy, that is, the rule of God. Although the elders take care of the church administration, they need to fully submit to God&rsquo;s leading. The elders ruled the children of Israel under God&rsquo;s instructions; hence, strictly speaking, God ruled the children of Israel in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>We must remember that the way to administrate the church is not like the way worldly governments administrate. Today, in both democracies and autocracies, man governs. However, God does not want a democracy or an autocracy; rather, He desires that we seek His instruction. Today God&rsquo;s rule is based on the Bible outside of us and on the Holy Spirit within us. Therefore, the elders must understand the Bible; if they do not understand the Bible, they will not be able to properly discuss and make decisions regarding church matters.</p>
<h2 class="head2">According to the Type of the Urim<br />
and the Thummim in the Old Testament</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Names of the Twelve Tribes of Israel<br />
on the Breastplate of the High Priest<br />
Containing Eighteen of the Twenty-two Letters<br />
in the Hebrew Alphabet</h2>
<p>Since the Bible does not provide an answer to every question, the elders not only need to understand the Bible but also need the Holy Spirit to give them revelation through the Bible. The Holy Spirit is typified by the breastplate of judgment worn by the high priest. This breastplate was composed of twelve stones upon which were engraved the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. These twelve names contained eighteen of the twenty-two letters in the Hebrew alphabet. Thus, four letters were missing.</p><h2 class="head3">The Thummim Being an Object Engraved<br />
with the Remaining Four Letters<br />
and Added to the Breastplate</h2>
<p>Because there were four letters missing from the breastplate, another object&mdash;the Thummim&mdash;was added. The word <em>Thummim</em> means &ldquo;perfecters, or completers.&rdquo; Without this object, the Hebrew alphabet on the breastplate of the high priest would have been short of four letters and would not have been complete. When the Thummim was added, four letters were added, and thus the twenty-two letters in the Hebrew alphabet were present.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Urim Being an Illuminator<br />
Inserted into the Breastplate</h2>
<p>Moreover, there was the need to add another object&mdash;the Urim. <em>Urim</em> means &ldquo;lights, or illuminators.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">The High Priest Going into<br />
the Presence of God with the Breastplate<br />
to Read God&rsquo;s Instructions and Make Decisions<br />
according to the Shining of the Engraved Letters</h2>
<p>Every time the high priest went into the presence of God, there were two kinds of plates on him: one was the shoulder plates, representing strength, for bearing God&rsquo;s people, and the other was the breastplate, which implies caring in love. The Lord cares for us by holding us in His bosom and supplies us with power by bearing us on His shoulders. Today the elders should also hold the saints in their &ldquo;bosom&rdquo; and bear them on their &ldquo;shoulders.&rdquo; The bosom&rsquo;s holding is an expression of love, and the shoulders&rsquo; bearing is a supply of power. Every time the elders draw near to God, they need to wear these two kinds of plates; that is, they need to bear the saints upon themselves as they come into the presence of God. The elders&rsquo; receiving of God&rsquo;s revelation reflects the receiving of revelation through the letters on the breastplate.</p>
<p>Many years ago I read an article concerning the Urim and the Thummim written by a Hebrew scholar. The author of this article said that in Joshua 7 Achan&rsquo;s sin was probably discovered through the Urim and the Thummim. He stated that when the high priest came to seek God, he was able to put words and sentences together through the illumination of the letters on the breastplate. Thus, through the Urim and the Thummim the high priest discovered that the one who sinned belonged to the tribe of Judah; then he identified the household and finally the person. The principle related to the use of the Urim and the Thummim is that the elders&rsquo; administration of the church is not through human government. Instead, it is a divine government, a theocracy, not a democracy or an autocracy. The elders must submit to God&rsquo;s authority and seek God&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<p>How does God lead the elders? First, He speaks through the Bible; second, through the Holy Spirit; and third, through the saints as an alphabet. When the elders come before God, they must bear the brothers and sisters on their shoulders and hold them in their bosom. As they bear the saints in God&rsquo;s presence, God enlightens and enables them to read the condition of the saints. The longer the elders stay before God, the more they will understand God&rsquo;s intention. This is an excellent type in the Old Testament, and when it is realized in the New Testament, it preserves the principle of God&rsquo;s government.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Serving as New Testament Priests<br />
in Caring for the Brothers and Sisters<br />
by Bringing Them into the Presence of God<br />
in Order to Read Their Condition<br />
and Seek God&rsquo;s Instruction</h2>
<p>There are three means by which the elders administrate the church: the Bible, the Holy Spirit, and the saints as an alphabet. Our experience confirms these points. When the elders take care of God&rsquo;s children, they need to seek God&rsquo;s guidance; they need not only the Bible and the Holy Spirit but also the brothers and sisters as the alphabet. This means that they need to bear the brothers and sisters before God and read the condition of every brother and sister before God. In this way the elders will know what God wants them to do and what God&rsquo;s present will is in the church life.</p><h2 class="head2">Using Facts and Experiences as References</h2>
<p>Apart from the above points, we also need to use facts and experiences as references. Acts 15 shows that the brothers had a discussion (v. 7); this means that all the attendants had an equal right to speak. Today when the eighty-some elders of the church in Taipei come together, every elder has an equal right to speak. However, this kind of speaking should not be the same as in the worldly conferences in which quarrels and fights occur. We need to understand that even in our discussion, we need to follow the Spirit. When we follow the Spirit, our spirit will not desire to fight but will require us to be calm. There are no chairmen in our meetings; no one pounds a gavel and holds a sign to ask people to be quiet; rather, the Holy Spirit within us always pounds a small gavel and reminds us inwardly.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Testimony of Peter</h2>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s speaking in Acts 15 was a testimony (vv. 7-11). Peter was in Jerusalem not long after being rebuked by Paul (Gal. 2:11-14). Peter was severely rebuked by Paul and fully put to shame. Humanly speaking, he did not seem to have the position to be an apostle; nevertheless, in Acts 15, at the conference in Jerusalem, he was full of courage. When everyone finished the discussion, Peter stood up to speak to the people. He said, &ldquo;Men, brothers, you know that from the early days God chose from among you that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe&rdquo; (v. 7). This is to read the facts, experiences, and present condition of the brothers and sisters; this was Peter&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Testimonies of Barnabas and Paul</h2>
<p>After Peter&rsquo;s speaking, Barnabas and Paul further strengthened his speaking with their testimonies. They related to the elders and apostles who were at the conference in Jerusalem the signs and wonders that God had done among the Gentiles through them (v. 12).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Making Decisions according to<br />
the Truth in God&rsquo;s Word</h2>
<h2 class="head3">James&rsquo;s Views Based upon the Truth</h2>
<p>After the brothers finished their testimonies, James decided the matter by offering his views based upon the truth in God&rsquo;s word. We can see that James spoke very well. His speaking was fully in tune with the testimony of Peter and also with that of Barnabas and Paul. He was fully in coordination with the brothers (vv. 13-21). However, we must also point out that James&rsquo;s decision was still very much under the influence of his Jewish background. The Scriptures he quoted were correct, but in the end he added something of Judaism by speaking of &ldquo;what is strangled and blood&rdquo; (v. 20). It was right that James spoke according to the truth, but he also added something of himself. Hence, we need to be careful not to add our own ideas to God&rsquo;s idea because of our background.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Decision of the Holy Spirit and<br />
the Apostles with the Elders</h2>
<p>Eventually, a resolution was formed in Acts 15, which was the decision of the Holy Spirit and the apostles with the elders; this is beautiful (vv. 22, 28-29). The apostles and elders had the revelation of the Bible and the instant revelation of the Holy Spirit according to the condition of the saints at that time. Then based on this they made a decision. Sadly, although the decision was correct, it was mixed with James&rsquo;s opinion. We absolutely believe that Paul was not satisfied with part of the decision, because it contradicted his concept in Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews. The matter of abstaining from blood and from that which is strangled belongs to Judaism and should not be added to the New Testament. May we all learn the lesson.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
THE CO-WORKERS AND THE ELDERS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:5; 5:17; 3:2; 1 Pet. 5:1-2; Acts 14:23a; Titus 1:5; Acts 13:1-3</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Taking Care of the Church and<br />
Bearing Responsibility for<br />
the Administration of the Church</h2>
<p>The primary responsibility of the elders is to take care of the church and bear responsibility for the administration of the church (1 Tim. 3:5; 5:17). The administration of the church is the elders&rsquo; responsibility, whereas the co-workers in the church simply work in coordination with the elders to build up the church in a locality. The co-workers should not touch anything related to administration. If they do, they go beyond their duties and infringe on others&rsquo; authority. This can be likened to the priests and prophets in the Old Testament who helped the elders but did not replace them. Later, they also helped the kings but did not replace them. We need to know that the elders are the administrators among God&rsquo;s people and that the co-workers should not interfere with the administrative matters of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Teaching and Shepherding God&rsquo;s People</h2>
<p>The elders should not only bear responsibility for the administration of the church, but they also need to teach and shepherd God&rsquo;s people (3:2; 5:17; 1 Pet. 5:1-2). In the matter of teaching and shepherding, although the elders may not be weak, sometimes they are not able to meet all the needs related to shepherding and teaching; hence, there is a need for the co-workers to release the word and help with teaching and shepherding. The co-workers should be given the opportunity to do as much as they are able in spiritual matters, such as teaching and shepherding, and the elders should give them the opportunity to fully develop their function so that the serving ones can learn to function as well.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Bearing the Responsibility for<br />
and Serving in Only One Locality</h2>
<p>The elders of a local church should bear the responsibility for and serve in only one locality (Acts 14:23a; Titus 1:5). They should never interfere with nearby churches that are smaller; it is dangerous to do so. For example, because the church in Taipei is a large church, the nearby churches can be easily influenced by it. According to worldly experience, cities with fewer people usually follow and learn from cities with more people. It is rarely the other way around. This should not be the case in the church. If the basis of the church in Taipei is wrong, the leading of the church will also be wrong. In this case the churches that follow the church in Taipei will also be wrong. Due to this danger, the elders of the church in Taipei should stay within the boundaries of Taipei. Taipei is their sphere, their realm; they should never extend beyond their boundary.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CO-WORKERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Laboring in Spiritual Matters<br />
in Coordination with the Elders<br />
to Build Up the Church, the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>The co-workers labor in spiritual matters in coordination with the elders in order to build up the church; this is a clear principle. On the one hand, the elders should never be self-content, thinking that because they are elders, they have no need of the co-workers. This attitude is wrong. On the other hand, while co-workers are laboring in various places, they may see that an elder is not so capable or may be lacking in experience and insight. Even if this is the case, it is wrong for co-workers to go beyond their duties and labor in place of the elders. At times, the co-workers may feel that they cannot do much spiritually because the elders do not fellowship with them; this concept is also incorrect. Although the elders are responsible for the administration of the church, they do not necessarily need to fellowship with the co-workers. Even if this is the case, the co-workers still need to bear spiritual responsibility.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:11 speaks of a number of gifted ones, such as apostles, prophets, and evangelists. The elders in some localities may not be good at preaching the gospel. They may be able to take the brothers and sisters to knock on doors, but they may not be able to perfect them in the preaching of the gospel. However, there are some co-workers among us who are good at the gospel work. Especially in a big church such as Taipei, there is a need for some to work specifically in the gospel to lead and perfect the brothers and sisters in the preaching of the gospel. When these ones lead the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel, they do not need to fellowship with the elders. However, if they need to use the meeting hall for a gathering, they must fellowship with the elders. If the co-workers decide to use the meeting hall at the same time that the elders have planned to have a meeting, this will cause conflict, and the administration of the church will not be carried out smoothly.</p>
<p>College students like to listen to seminars, and as a result, many seminars are conducted on college campuses. In order to attract young people, some may suggest that the ones serving on the college campus should host a seminar on human life and the Christian faith. Surely such a seminar would help some understand the human life. However, if the serving ones take this suggestion, decide to have the seminar at the meeting hall without fellowship, and announce it excitedly, this is not appropriate. In serving the Lord in the church we must maintain the principle that although it is all right for the serving ones to host a meeting or gospel seminar at the meeting hall, they should not touch the administration of the church. Since the meeting hall is under the administration of the elders, they should first fellowship with the elders before using the meeting hall. Otherwise, the serving ones at a college campus may decide to use the hall for a gospel seminar at a time that conflicts with an event previously decided upon by the elders. This lack of coordination causes conflicts and problems. It is not likely that such a thing will happen in small churches, but it often happens in larger churches. This example demonstrates the principle of how the elders and co-workers should coordinate in the church.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Like the Five Prophets and Teachers<br />
in the Church in Antioch</h2>
<p>While laboring in various localities, the co-workers need to be like the five prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch. Even though they served in Antioch, they never touched the administration of the church (Acts 13:1). They were not involved in the administration of the church in Antioch. As gifted ones, they labored in that locality, serving the church and the saints, yet they did not touch the administration of the church. It was the elders in Antioch who bore the responsibility for the administration of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Sent by the Lord<br />
to Do a Spiritual Work in Other Places</h2>
<p>The co-workers may be sent by the Lord to do a spiritual work in other places, just like the prophets and teachers in Antioch. Acts 13 says that some of the prophets and teachers in Antioch were led by the Lord to preach the gospel and establish churches in various localities (vv. 2-3). The church in Antioch did not hire these five and send them out to establish branches of the church in Antioch, as is the practice of Christianity today. If this were the case, the co-workers would have been under the control of the church in Antioch. A church should not control those sent out. There should be only spiritual fellowship and no relationships of employment between the co-workers and the local churches. When the co-workers go to other places to do a spiritual work, the church may send them off with prayer and later, when the co-workers return, gather the saints for fellowship and a report.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Taking Care of the Needs of All the Churches</h2>
<p>Unlike the elders who bear responsibility for and serve the church in only one locality, the co-workers take care of the needs of all the churches. In other words, although the co-workers may live and serve in one locality, they also take care of other churches according to the need. For example, if the co-workers who labor in Taipei see that one of the nearby churches is weak in the matter of teaching, they should send one or two co-workers to release the word in the meetings and lead the saints with the word. In other words, they need to build up a meeting in which everyone speaks and everyone listens according to the practice in 1 Corinthians 14, that is, a meeting in which everyone either prophesies, has a teaching, or has a revelation. In such meetings everyone can participate and rise up to speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord.</p>
<p>We all need to understand that in the church meetings there are many kinds of gifted ones, but there are no &ldquo;elders.&rdquo; Once the elders come to the church meetings, they should leave their status of being an elder outside the door. If there are matters that need to be announced after the meeting, the elders should make these announcements because they are related to the administration of the church. However, in the meetings the elders do not bear the status of elders but of brothers; they should function in the meetings by either speaking as prophets or teaching as teachers. The serving of the co-workers in the church is a very practical matter. The church in Taipei is a big church with many co-workers; thus, it needs to have a proper understanding regarding this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: In regard to the principle by which the elders meet and discuss matters, why do we call James&rsquo;s decision in Acts 15, a decision based on his own opinion, &ldquo;the decision of the Holy Spirit and the apostles with the elders&rdquo;?</em></p>
<p>Answer: First, we need to see that in Acts 15 the conference was in the Holy Spirit and presided over by the Holy Spirit; this is certain. Moreover, the decision obtained from the conference passed through the apostles and elders; hence, it is not wrong to say that it was the decision of the Holy Spirit and the apostles with the elders. However, because one of the apostles was not clear due to his background, he was not resolute in the truth. This demonstrates the New Testament principle in which God cooperates with man and needs man&rsquo;s cooperation. If God Himself does not do a certain thing, He desires that man not do it either. When God wants to do something, the outcome of the work depends entirely upon the one who cooperates with Him. If the work falls short, it is because the cooperating one falls short. Hence, the determining factor is man, not the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Second, church history has exalted James too highly. In fact, he was not that positive. As a result of the prevailing Jewish influence that he brought into the church, the Lord allowed the Roman prince Titus to destroy Jerusalem in A.D. 70, without leaving a stone upon a stone. From the human perspective, James and the Jewish brothers may have thought that the church in Jerusalem should be a certain way; however, because God did not want those things, He dismantled the mixture. James bears a great responsibility for bringing the influence of Judaism into the church, as seen in Acts 21.</p>
<p>The decisions related to matters of the church are determined by the Holy Spirit and the apostles with the elders. However, the apostles, elders, and serving ones are not perfect; hence, there are often shortages. When a serving one releases the word for the Lord, the Holy Spirit is with him and works with him; nevertheless, he still needs to speak for the Lord through prayer and by relying on the Lord. For example, when we speak for the Lord, our personal background may unconsciously be added to certain points. Although the Holy Spirit is still with us, the feeling that we give people is not pure. For this reason, we need to learn the lesson of not giving ground to any mixture from our background; we need to be pure.</p>
<p><em>Question: In actual situations where the elders and co-workershandle matters, how can they draw a clear boundaryconcerning responsibility and authority? Moreover, in Taiwan in the localities south of Panch&rsquo;iao there are many churches but few co-workers; how can we take care of the needs in those places?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There are at least three aspects to this question. First, we need to consider whether churches in every locality need co-workers. Second, perhaps there is a need, but because the churches prefer co-workers who are like the apostle Paul, there is no way to meet their need. Third, part of the responsibility lies with me. Many people have said that I am the &ldquo;pope,&rdquo; but they do not realize that I am very reserved in everything related to directing the move of the co-workers. Hence, among the co-workers in Taiwan, there is not a strong leading.</p>
<p>If the churches south of Panch&rsquo;iao need co-workers, they can fellowship with the brothers and see if someone receives a burden. If we have learned the lesson well, we will not act independently but will fellowship with the leading ones in the work; this is to maintain a proper situation. At the same time, because of the different backgrounds and environments of all the churches, we simply do not have an absolute leading.</p>
<p><em>Question: The elders bear responsibility for the administrationof the church and also spiritual responsibility, but whatare the areas of responsibility related to administration?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The responsibility of the elders in regard to church administration is mainly related to business affairs, whereas the service of the co-workers is mainly related to spiritual matters. This subject involves many fine points. For example, in the United States after Congress passes a bill, they send it to the president, who has authority to veto it. Although Congress may insistently try to pass a law two or three times, according to law, the final decision is made by the president. This is similar to the coordination between the elders and the co-workers. In Taipei there are currently a number of districts in every hall; hence, we can say that the halls form a kind of boundary. On the one hand, the co-workers should not interfere with the administration of the halls, yet because of the propagation of districts, the elders and co-workers should learn to coordinate. A certain hall may start a new district, which requires buying or renting a meeting place; this matter is the responsibility of the elders. Although this matter occurs in the district, it is related to the business affairs of the church; hence, it is under the administration of the elders. However, if there is a co-worker who has the burden to minister to the saints a message of eight to ten minutes, he does not need the elders&rsquo; permission, because this is something spiritual.</p>
<p>The co-workers do not need permission to do spiritual things within the districts. If a certain co-worker decides to speak a message of several minutes at the end of the district meeting every week, he does not need the permission of the elders but only needs to act according to his burden. However, after this co-worker releases a word for three consecutive Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings, the elders and other saints who attend may feel that it would be better for him not to speak. At this time, the elders have the position to tell the co-worker that he needs to speak more concisely. The relationship between the co-workers and the elders is not simple.</p>
<p><em>Question: Many young full-time brothers and sisters do not yet seem to have the weight of co-workers. How should they fulfill their function in the church?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The young full-time serving ones are in the learning process; they can be likened to apprentices who learn by doing. They cannot be considered co-workers. For example, there is a barbershop that I used to go to more than thirty years ago. At that time, the present shop owner was still an apprentice. I did not like him cutting my hair because he was only beginning to learn the skill; however, I sympathized with him. If I did not give him a chance, how could he learn? In other words, I needed to be sacrificed in order to perfect him. Eventually, the apprentice became the owner and is very kind and grateful toward me because I gave him the opportunity to be perfected. Hence, there are two sides to all these matters, and there is not a definite answer.</p>
<p>Although we say that these young full-time brothers and sisters are apprentices, we still need to respect them. When they go to the various districts to help with the work, many saints feel that they are merely apprentices and do not know much; as a result, they disregard them. They may be likened to an intern in the hospital who has just completed his study of textbooks and laboratory curriculum. Due to his lack of experience, he may feel miserable within and may even need to listen to the nurses. Hence, it is not easy for these young full-time serving ones to coordinate and serve in the various halls and districts. The situation in the church in Taipei is intricate and complex; it is not easy to be a co-worker here, and it is probably even more difficult to be a full-timer. This complicated situation produces good apprentices. If the situation is easy, no apprentice would be perfected, and there would be no future success.</p>
<p><em>Question: The elders need to bear the responsibility for the business affairs in the administration, but the elders often decide upon spiritual matters. How should these two aspects be coordinated properly? That is, do elders decide the entire spiritual direction of the church?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The elders not only coordinate among themselves in regard to the service but also with every member. We all are members of the Body. For example, when my feet move, my entire body moves; when my mouth moves, my entire body cooperates. Hence, we cannot strictly say that the co-workers bear all spiritual responsibility and that the elders do not have any spiritual responsibility, nor can we say that the co-workers should labor on the spiritual matters and that the elders should labor only on business affairs. If this is the case, it will be difficult for the church to advance; rather, we must all coordinate together to serve in the church.</p>
<p>If what we do in the church life is related to the business affairs, we need to fellowship with the elders, that is, to fellowship regarding the practical matters. For example, if we desire to use the meeting hall to host a gospel seminar, even if we are sure that the meeting hall will not be used at that time, we still need to fellowship with the elders. If the elders know that there will be a gospel seminar in the meeting hall, they will not schedule another activity during the same period of time, but even more, they will receive a burden to pray for the gospel seminar. A Christian&rsquo;s living cannot be detached from fellowship. We are not trying to make fellowship a law but to emphasize the need for fellowship. Moreover, when we fellowship, we should not leave people with a confused understanding; rather, we need to pay attention to the outcome of the fellowship.</p>
<p><em>Question: There is a situation in which two halls occupy one another&rsquo;s space. Since this is something pertaining to the aspect of administration, how should we solve this problem? For example, one day saints from one hall found that the meeting hall was packed with things and that there was not enough space to even walk up the stairs. Even the saints who serve in the deacons&rsquo; office had to stand outside. Since the administration of the church is the responsibility of the elders, should we simply let the elders know about the situation and let them handle it in a good way according to the actual situation?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There should have been fellowship when things were brought into the meeting hall and were left there to occupy the space; it is wrong to have no fellowship. In regard to procedure, there should first be contact, and in regard to principle, there should also be fellowship. Furthermore, since this incident was so sudden, and it involved the occupation of so much space, it should have been fellowshipped not only with one elder but also with the brothers who handle the business affairs and those who are on duty in the deacons&rsquo; office. Regarding this point of fellowship, we should never forget to fellowship in the service of the church; once there is fellowship, everything is enlivened, and there is a way. A lack of circulation in the body is due to a lack of fellowship; a lack of circulation will cause the entire body to become sick. Once the circulation is healthy and there is fellowship, all sicknesses will be gone. I hope that we will all remember this word. Our present condition is fundamentally due to the lack of fellowship.</p>
<p><em>Question: Since the church in Taipei was divided into districts for the practice of the new way, the administration of the meeting halls has been borne by the elders, whereas the spiritual progress of the districts is occurring within the districts. As a result, most of the districts have experienced much advancement. On the one hand, this is good, but on the other hand, there has been an inadequate amount of fellowshipbetween districts. For example,one district is not doing so well, and there is a shortage of burdened ones and serving ones. Since it is not convenient to combine districts together, it is difficult for the elders to handle the situation. The brothers and sisters in the district find it stressful to continue in this way and do not want to meet as a district. They would like to combine withanother district. This situation is difficult for the elders. If theycombine the district with another by force, it may interfere with the spiritual progress of the stronger district, but if they let this situation continue, it will be a loss to the brothers and sisters. How should this situation be solved?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This kind of situation can be solved through fellowship. The elders and those who attend to the spiritual matters within the two districts should have much fellowship and look to the Lord to lead them. At the same time, they need to bring this matter before the brothers and sisters in the districts and ask them if they desire to remain as two districts or if they would like to be combined with another district. As long as everyone is willing to fellowship, whatever comes out of the fellowship will be proper.</p>
<p><em>Question: If the responsible ones from the two districts continue to hold different opinions after their fellowship, what should we do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We need to realize that the elders and co-workers should not have different opinions. We need to fellowship, but fellowship should not produce different opinions. If you insist that your view is the most accurate, it will become your opinion. In Acts 15 James made a decision in a conference. I believe that Paul must have had some feeling within, but he did not force others or insist on his own feeling. We all need to learn this lesson, that is, not to force people. In principle, it is not important whether we combine our meetings or divide our meetings. As long as we are not worshipping idols, we are free to arrange the meetings according to how we feel best. It is permissible for one district to divide into two districts, or even three districts. As long as there is not the worship of idols, it is all right. If the co-workers and elders have this kind of attitude, there will spontaneously be no opinion among us.</p>
<p><em>Question: Some brothers and sisters from a certain district have expressed their desire to remain combined with another district; they feel it would be difficult for them to continue if they were separated. Hence, through the help of the elders and co-workers, a decision was made to keep the districts combined. However, one responsible brother in the district does not come anymore, and another one, who did not want the meeting to be combined, continues to insist on his own view. Consequently, we do not know what to do.</em></p>
<p>Answer: Please remember that your districts are not the whole church in Taipei. If this problem cannot be resolved between your two districts, you should ask all the elders to come together for an urgent meeting to fellowship about this matter. It is not necessary for the two districts to settle the problem alone. Moreover, in the church life we should never say, &ldquo;Unless this or that condition is met, I will not come to the meeting.&rdquo; We should never speak like this. This can be likened to a couple who seeks a divorce when they are not in agreement with one another; such an attitude makes it difficult to live the marriage life and gives people a negative feeling. A co-worker once made a request, saying, &ldquo;It must be done this way; otherwise, I will not agree.&rdquo; I would like to ask who this &ldquo;I&rdquo; is. Please bear in mind that no one has the position to speak like this. Even if Paul were here, he would not speak in this way.</p>
<p>Philippians 2:14 says, &ldquo;Do all things without murmurings and reasonings.&rdquo; To murmur and to reason is to have opinions; murmurings and reasonings are opinions. Hence, from now on, we all need to be on the alert. In the church life we should never say, &ldquo;If this is the way things are done, I will not come anymore.&rdquo; We need to ask who the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is and how much value it has. If the one speaking this way does not come, will it matter? If he does not come, will the church close down? If he does not come, will the work stop? All such words are ignorant and should not be uttered; they are our shame, and they are the flesh, which we should abandon. We all need to learn the lesson that the church is the church and that there has to be a proper way to handle this kind of matter.</p>
<p>Concerning the service of the elders in the districts, first, they need to set aside their time; second, they need to exert their effort and pay the price to learn to prophesy. In this way, they will be able to meet the great need while avoiding many troubles. As for the co-workers, they should go to the different districts without having any view or opinion; neither should they insist on anything. It is not important whether the two districts remain as two districts or are combined as one. The administration is not in the co-workers&rsquo; hands; whether they speak to one district or two districts, it is not an issue. Whichever district they go to, it is not a problem; even if they go to one district this week and another the next Lord&rsquo;s Day, it is still not a problem. As co-workers, we are there to serve people and minister food to them. As for the arrangement of the dining table, it is none of our business. Others are responsible for the arrangement, while we are responsible only for the ministering of the food. We should never tell people, &ldquo;If you arrange the dining table and chairs this way, I quit!&rdquo; or &ldquo;If you meet in this way, I will not come.&rdquo; This kind of speaking is not proper; we should never say such words.</p>
<p>In addition to the elders and co-workers, even the working saints should not say this kind of thing. We should have a family tradition of not reasoning or murmuring. We should be firm only about major issues, such as idolatry, fornication, sectarianism, and division; we should not care too much about other matters. For example, we may have a usual way of arranging chairs in the group meetings, but if someone feels that he should help the brothers and sisters learn the lesson of not being late and thus intentionally takes away the last three rows of chairs so that the latecomers must find chairs to seat themselves, I will not oppose. This is not something sinful; he merely wants others to learn a lesson. However, inwardly I will ask, &ldquo;How many lessons have you learned? You may want others to learn a lesson, but how many lessons have you learned?&rdquo; I believe that we understand the true significance of this kind of fellowship. There should not be reasonings or murmurings among us; rather, we simply need to follow the Lord. As far as the way is concerned, any way is acceptable.</p>
<p><em>Question: The elders were originally elders of the whole church, but after dividing into districts, the elders have gone to the districts to promote the work, to serve, and to take care of the saints. As a result, over a long period of time, the elders&rsquo; view toward the church as a whole diminishes, whereas their view toward their district enlarges. Thus, in the elders&rsquo; meeting matters pertaining to one district are decided by the elders in that district, and matters pertaining to another district are determined by the elders in that district. In the end there are fewer and fewer matters that are common to the church as a whole. This seemingly produces a peaceful situation, because everyone is unrelated to one another: the elders in one district are responsible for matters in that district, and the elders in another district take care of matters in their district. However, we are not sure that this way is scriptural. In the end the elders are also somewhat at a loss.</em></p>
<p>Answer: Even if we abolish all the districts, there are still twenty-three halls, functioning as twenty-three units within the church in Taipei. Hence, we all need to learn the lesson and receive the grace to bear the responsibility in the districts, while continuing to care for the whole church. In short, we all need to learn to fellowship. We must fellowship. As long as we fellowship, there will be no problems. We all need to learn not to place demands on others but to bear the demands ourselves. As for secondary matters, we can put them aside temporarily.</p>
<p><em>Question: If there is a brother who always speaks improperly in the meetings, should we forbid him to speak during the meeting?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We do not need to forbid him to speak during the meeting; perhaps one or two elders can fellowship with him and exhort him to not speak loosely in the meetings.</p>
<p><em>Question: We have already done this, but his situation has not improved.</em></p>
<p>Answer: If the situation has not improved, you need to warn him that if he does not improve, the brothers and sisters will not be able to accept him.</p>
<p><em>Question: How do we help brothers and sisters who do not have a clear mind, yet they attend the meetings and always desire to speak, often digressing from the subject of the fellowship?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We need to thank the Lord that at least ninety-five percent of the saints have a clear mind. Hence, you need to pray to the Lord and ask Him to give a clear mind to those who do not have one; otherwise, you need to ask the Lord to open a way to deal with this kind of situation.</p>
<p><em>Question: Concerning discussing matters in the elders&rsquo; meeting,we have learned from the Bible that the matters to bediscussed must be confirmed by everyone in spirit as to whetherthey are what the Lord desires; how can this be carried out in a smooth way in the course of a discussion?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The elders must learn some basic lessons; if they have not learned what they should have learned, it will be difficult for them to be elders. Elders must learn how to discuss matters. For example, matters such as using various halls for gospel seminars for college students should not take much time to discuss, because they are not worth much discussion. However, during fellowship there will be points that not every elder agrees upon; at such times, we should learn not to think that only matters that we agree upon should be carried out, and that those that we do not agree upon should not be done. Who are we? We should give the Lord the authority; this was Paul&rsquo;s attitude.</p>
<p>There are serious matters that the elders need to consider and pray over again and again. If there are several matters that need an urgent decision, then we should put aside the controversial matters, or if the brothers sense the need, they can move these matters to the next meeting for fellowship. Such decisions can be made according to the actual situation. This is how to discuss matters. The elders must learn how to be elders and how to discuss matters. In the discussion of matters, there is a difference between the length, the weight, and the urgency of different matters. Based on this principle, certain matters may not need to be discussed in detail; if they are not urgent, they do not need to be discussed immediately. All these points should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p><em>Question: In the elders&rsquo; meeting every attendant has an equalright to speak; however, due to different views and observations, different opinions arise, and no one is able to come to a conclusion. What should we do? If we continue to speak but cannot express opinions, what should we do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: As long as we are willing to bear the cross, there should not be a problem. For several decades, we have learned the lesson that as long as we endeavor to learn and labor and are strict with ourselves while placing no demand on others, we will avoid many problems. As for who should bring up matters or who should speak, these are trivial things; we should never try to compete for a position. If everyone learns this lesson, even great matters can be solved.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS CONCERNING<br />
THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ELDERS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: After the full-time trainees finish the training, should they stay in Taipei or go back to their sending localities to serve?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Responsible brothers who originally served in other localities have come to Taipei to be trained for two years. During this period of time they obviously could not serve in their sending localities. From this standpoint, the churches in those localities have suffered some loss. At the same time they must hope that what these brothers have learned faithfully and properly in the training will be repaid in their localities after their return. Many big companies and hospitals have this practice; that is, they send employees to other places to learn through the exchange of experience. In this period of time the quality of medical care at the hospital may not be as good as before, or the quality of production in the factory may suffer, but these companies are willing to suffer this loss with the hope that those who are sent will learn higher skills and increase the production when they return. In this way what is initially lost will be compensated for later.</p>
<p>In fact, last summer we already considered whether we would let the brothers and sisters return to serve in their respective localities to compensate for the loss. At that time, however, tens of thousands of people had been gained through door-knocking in Taipei and were entrusted not only to the local saints but also to those who came for the training and had obtained permission from their sending localities to stay in Taipei to take care of the new ones. As a result, all the churches suffered loss; no one can deny this. Therefore, after studying this matter thoroughly, we hope that these trainees will return to their localities after the training. This is not only for the benefit of the sending localities, but I believe that it is profitable for all.</p>
<p>In our labor we not only need people, but we also need to use them properly. If everyone stays in Taipei but cannot be used properly, it is better for them to return to their sending localities. When they return to their sending localities to serve and coordinate in the church, they will surely be more profitable to the churches. This matter deserves our consideration.</p>
<p><em>Question: Three brothers bear responsibility in our locality, but since two went to Taipei for the training, only one remains. Can one or two brothers fill up this gap?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Of course, we first need to consider if there already is a suitable person who can fill the gap. Being an elder is a relative matter, not an absolute matter. For example, being a husband is also a relative matter. Some husbands sweep streets, and some are presidents. If every man was required to be a &ldquo;president&rdquo; in order to be qualified to be a husband, only one person in the whole country would be qualified to be a husband. This is the same in regard to the elders. Whether an elder is suitable depends upon those with whom he is matched; thus, it is a relative matter.</p>
<p>If we want to make a small table to hold a teacup, and we cannot find good material like teakwood, we may use softwood, and if we cannot find softwood, it is sufficient to use inferior wood. We simply need a small table so that when we drink tea, there is a place for us to put the cup. If we insist upon our consideration of materials and are unable to produce a small table, we have missed the point. It is the same in regard to our work for the Lord; we need to learn to use the materials that are available. This applies not only to our leading in the work but also to the brothers in all the churches in regard to arrangements and appointments. The churches are these brothers&rsquo; household, so they should fellowship and come up with an idea. For instance, when we encounter a situation in which two of the three responsible brothers temporarily leave to attend the training, we should carefully consider if we can use any of the available brothers. This matter depends upon our management, and it is our responsibility.</p>
<p><em>Question: If we need to appoint elders in the church, when is an appropriate time?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is the apostles who appoint elders. A church may need two elders; thus, if the leading ones find two brothers who are fitting, they should motivate them a little. If the brothers have not grown &ldquo;tall&rdquo; enough, the leading ones should try to help them mature. This matter depends upon the motivation of the brothers in a locality. If their feeling is not to appoint elders but to temporarily ask some to function in the office without giving them a title, this also depends on the actual situation. We do not have a set law; our only consideration is to serve the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and the churches well.</p>
<p><em>Question: Could you explain the function of the apostles?</em></p>
<p>Answer: According to the Bible, first, apostles should be able to preach the gospel, to preach the person and ministry of the Lord Jesus in its entirety, that is, thoroughly according to God&rsquo;s plan, God&rsquo;s economy. Second, the apostles should be able to establish churches. Some saints are able to save people through gospel preaching, but they are not able to establish churches. The apostles must be able to establish churches; to establish churches is not a simple matter. Third, the apostles must know the apostles&rsquo; teaching, just as a lawyer must know the nation&rsquo;s constitution and all of its laws. When there is a problem in the church life, he must be able to solve the problem based on the apostles&rsquo; teaching in the New Testament. If a person is not able to do this, his qualification for apostleship is questionable; at most, he will be a very weak apostle.</p>
<p>For example, it is not acceptable for a lawyer to know the law only to a limited extent. He must know it thoroughly. Knowing the law thoroughly is even more important for justices because they judge matters related to the law. Their qualification is based on their thorough knowledge of the law. Similarly, in fulfilling his ministry, an apostle must be constituted with the apostles&rsquo; teaching and thoroughly know the truth. If there is any shortcoming in his knowledge of the truth, he will not be able to make proper judgments, and his judgment will not be accurate. This does not necessarily mean that he is not an apostle, but he is certainly not strong enough. Hence, in principle an apostle should be able to do three things: preach the complete gospel, establish local churches, and truly understand the apostles&rsquo; teaching. In Acts 2 three thousand people were saved and all of them continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles (vv. 41-42). The apostles&rsquo; teaching is the fundamental truth in the New Testament.</p>
<p><em>Question: In our locality we have perfected a number of brothers and sisters who can be pillars. At this time, is it better for them to propagate in nearby towns and villages or stay in our locality? In some of the towns and villages, some older brothers have been meeting for quite a while, and they claim that a certain one is the responsible brother. How should we proceed in our further fellowship with them?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We should consider two factors in regard to whether we should ask saints to stay in our locality to labor or send them out to propagate. As far as manpower is concerned, we need to consider where it is more profitable to labor. If it is more profitable to labor in your locality, they should stay to labor there; if it is more profitable to labor elsewhere, then they should go elsewhere to labor. Like farmers, we should go where the rain is. In some places there may be a drought for a whole year; thus, there is no need for us to farm there. This is based upon a principle in Genesis 2:5; that is, no rain came because there was no man to work the ground. The growth of plants depended upon the principle that some needed to work the ground.</p>
<p>Based upon this principle some should be sent from our locality to the surrounding villages, but if there is not much fruit or growth because of the lack of rain, we should stop. A farmer knows that he needs to labor on the fields that grow and leave the fields that do not grow; once the rain comes and the land is watered, he will begin to plow another field. This is the direction we should follow.</p>
<p>When people begin to meet, sometimes elders are spontaneously produced. When we go to help them, we need to observe their situation accurately. Are the elders who have been produced spontaneously the proper ones? Are there other brothers with more experience than them? If this is the case, we will have to try our best to lead them so that the more experienced ones will rise up and bear the responsibility. This will lead to a greater and better result. However, this matter is difficult to carry out; hence, we must be very careful.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is no set rule or dead regulation governing this matter; rather, it is based on the facts, the benefits, and the leading according to the actual environment. In a locality there may be two or three brothers who are already elders, yet there may be two or three with more experience; however, due to the situation of the church and the particular environment, a change may lead to something negative and produce a poor result; in this situation it is better not to make any change. Instead, simply go along with the situation and help them based upon the actual situation with the hope that one day God will perfect the elders and raise them up.</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD OF EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>We have invited close to eighty trainees, who are neither elders nor co-workers, to join the training for elders and co-workers. At the same time we have also accepted some from various localities who are learning to be elders. I hope that these ones will not think that their coming here means that they are elders; hence, they should not give people the impression that they are being trained and invited to the elders&rsquo; training because they will soon be appointed to be elders. This simply is not true. Our purpose in inviting these ones is that many more young brothers will know the importance of the elders, the need for elders, because as Paul said, &ldquo;If anyone aspires to the overseership, he desires a good work&rdquo; (1 Tim. 3:1). Whether or not these ones eventually become elders depends upon their future performance.</p>
<p>No one should think that because he has been invited, he is an elder. Becoming an elder depends on future performance and the manifestation in their environment. Nevertheless, we deeply hope that after hearing such a word and seeing God&rsquo;s need, the younger generation will pray, &ldquo;O Lord, have mercy on me. For Your use I want to have the portion of being an elder and bearing responsibility in Your recovery.&rdquo; If there are six hundred elders who can be sent out two by two to serve in different places, over three hundred churches will be raised up immediately. We believe that if two proper elders, who have some learning, know the truth, and hold God&rsquo;s people in their bosom and bear them upon their shoulders, are sent out, they will certainly raise up a church no matter where they go.</p>
<p>Our problem today is basically that the elders in the local churches are weak. If the elders were strong and rich in spiritual matters, we would have had much increase in these twenty years. In Taipei we have ten thousand saints as a foundation; although we have such great capital, we have not made a profit in twenty years; this is inexcusable. We are here not to reprimand anyone but with the hope that we all will be on the alert and know our real situation and lack.</p>
<p>This lack is mainly due to two groups of people: the elders and the co-workers. If the condition of an existing church is poor, the elders bear more of the responsibility. If the elders are strong and rich in spiritual matters, the church will surely yield rich fruit, and it will not be without increase for twenty years. Moreover, the population in Taiwan is increasing, the economy is thriving, and every aspect is progressing; only the church is an exception. It is not right for every aspect of society to be advancing while the church stands still. If the entire society was going backward and the population was decreasing, there might be an excuse for the lack of increase in the church, because basic qualities are lacking. However, in these twenty-some years, the development of Taiwan has become well known throughout the world. At the same time the conditions for the advance of the church are more than favorable; nevertheless, if the church is still unable to advance, the responsibility lies entirely upon the elders and co-workers.</p>
<p>For this reason we need to come together to study and see God&rsquo;s need from the view of God&rsquo;s economy. We should never think that since we serve full time and have some experience in the Lord&rsquo;s work, we are co-workers. In fact, this is not worth anything. If we have some value, it is because our heart is truly set on the Lord, and we are willing to do something for Him. I hope that the young people can see this point clearly. There is no position among us; if someone desires to seek a position among us, he has come to the wrong place. There is no future among us; if some here are planning for their future, they have come to the wrong place. We have neither position nor future. All we have is God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>The Lord has given us many messages on the cross for the purpose that we would daily live under the shadow of the cross and put our soul-life to death. As such people we have no future. We daily live in death and put our soul-life to death. We know that while man seeks to live, Christians need to die. On the one hand, we have lost our future and are without any future. On the other hand, we have a future, a future that is full of glory. If we are not for the Lord&rsquo;s church, our being on earth is without meaning. Many who have heard my experience know that I should have died many years ago, but the Lord has allowed me to live for more than twenty years; therefore, I would like all the young people to see the Lord&rsquo;s way clearly, receive a burden from the Lord, and be used by Him to release His riches and grace. Today in the local churches the Lord needs two groups of people&mdash;the co-workers and the elders. The church needs these two groups of people. I hope that we all are clear concerning this point and learn to present ourselves and pray to the Lord: &ldquo;Lord, I want to be a co-worker or an elder.&rdquo;</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">A REVIEW OF OUR GOING ON<br />
IN THE NEW WAY</h1>
<p>It is rather easy for the church to gain many new ones and reach a goal of increase, but it is more difficult to stabilize these new ones and bring them into the church life. It is possible to gain someone with just a little effort, but we may not be able to keep him with even ten times that effort. We may be able to gain one hundred people, but if we hope to bring them all into the church life, we need to spend at least ten times as much effort.</p>
<p>As a result of our studying and experimenting, we have found a direction. We have discovered from numerous testimonies that it is best to be selective in our door-knocking. This selectiveness has several aspects. First, we should begin by knocking on the doors of those whom we know, that is, our friends and relatives. Second, we should knock on the doors of the friends and relatives of the saints. Third, we should knock on the doors of the friends and relatives of the newly saved ones. Hence, we should begin with these various groups of friends and relatives. The elders and leading ones in all the churches should spend some time to arrange and organize a list of names so that the saints who knock on doors will not waste any time. At the same time, the new ones whom we bring in will be more stable. In the matter of door-knocking, we also need to be selective in regard to the districts we choose to labor in. We need to consider which districts we should labor in and how we should labor in them. This does not mean that the gospel of God is selective; rather, proper selection and preparation will provide a foundation for our work.</p>
<p>When we go out to gain people, we should not gain too many at one time. If we do this, we will not be able to shepherd them well. In the past we had activities that some called &ldquo;blitzes&rdquo; and &ldquo;festivals.&rdquo; They were necessary steps in the process of our study; however, after passing through a number of experiments, we learned that we do not need a &ldquo;blitz&rdquo; to gain people in a speedy way. If we beget too many children at one time, we will not be able to shepherd them well. For instance, if someone begets five or seven babies in one delivery, only one or two may survive; hence, we need to labor according to our capacity.</p>
<p>As far as the church is concerned, not everyone needs to knock on doors. It would be ideal if one-third, that is, one out of three, were able to knock on doors. Twenty to thirty percent of the brothers and sisters can knock on doors, not only for themselves but also for their companions, that is, for those who cannot go door-knocking. After gaining some people, they can then distribute these ones to those who are not able go door-knocking and let them take care of the new ones. For example, if a brother gains five new ones in two weeks through door-knocking, he can take care of one and introduce the remaining four to other brothers and sisters. The first time he may need to knock on doors by himself, but after the second time, when he begins a home meeting, he can bring his companion along and introduce his companion to the new one, saying, &ldquo;This is our brother. From now on, I hope that he will have more contact with you. Since I still have many things to take care of in the coming days, I have troubled him to share my burden.&rdquo; After this kind of proper handover, the situation of taking care of people will be quite balanced. Every brother and sister will be able to care for one or two; it does not need to be many. If there are too many, we will not be able to take care of all of them.</p>
<p>A normal, or proper, brother or sister should at least come to the Lord&rsquo;s table to remember the Lord and learn the truth every Lord&rsquo;s Day. His or her meeting life should also include attending the prayer meeting on Tuesdays, preaching the gospel one evening a week or going to people&rsquo;s homes for a home meeting, and attending a group meeting on another evening. We should be able to reach this standard in terms of meetings. As for those whom we have gained through door-knocking, besides the one or two under our personal care, we should give them into the care of other brothers and sisters. In principle, we should visit the new ones once a week. Moreover, according to what we have said earlier, if we exercise some selection in our door-knocking, it will not be that difficult for us to bring people to salvation. Perhaps after three or four months we will be able to bring them into the church life and introduce them to the brothers and sisters so that they may have some mutual fellowship. At this point, we can go out again to gain more new ones through door-knocking. This can be likened to farmland in Taiwan that yields three times a year; we too may be able to have three harvests a year. The rate of increase will then be very high. Although not every one of us can go out to knock on doors, if thirty out of a hundred people in the church life are able and succeed in gaining a threefold increase, there will still be a one hundred percent increase overall.</p>
<p>Concerning our going out to visit people and to preach the gospel, there is still a need for further study; we not only need to develop the practice but also to find out the most effective ways. Up until this point, the best way is not to gain too many people at one time through door-knocking. In the past we sought to gain people with speed and in great numbers; however, not many survived. This was due to the lack of people to care for them. The result of the endeavor and practice of the churches is that we gained some experience and now realize that although it is easy to gain someone, it is difficult to retain him and even more difficult to bring him into the church life. Hence, we have studied the situation further and discovered that we should not gain too many too hastily; if we gain many without taking care of them, it is a waste of effort. Therefore, after we have gained some, we need to first take care of our capacity to shepherd them. Once we take care of this capacity, we can continue to gain more.</p>
<p>The principle is the same in regard to the natural law of reproduction given by God to human beings. A woman cannot give birth to a child today and deliver another child tomorrow or the day after. She needs to wait for at least nine months to deliver another baby. It is a great thing for a woman to give birth once a year. Moreover, it is rare for a woman to give birth twice within a single year. This is a natural law. If a woman delivered too many babies at the same time, she would not be able to raise them well. This is why God has provided human beings with a natural law that requires a woman to wait nine months to deliver another baby. We should learn from this law. After we gain some people through door-knocking, we need to wait three or four months, that is, until we have brought them into the church and handed them over to the church, before we go out to knock on more doors. If we have two or three harvests each year and everyone practices according to his personal environment, capacity, and situation, I believe this will help the church to increase.</p>
<p>We need to build up an atmosphere of going out to preach the gospel. After several decades, we realize that no other way is more effective for gaining people. As long as we are willing to go out, pay the price, expend our energy, and spend the time to knock on doors, we will surely gain people. Moreover, the brothers and sisters do not need to labor all year long and go out every day to knock on doors; they can go out once every three or four months. Once they have gained some people, they should nourish them properly and then go out again to preach the gospel several months later. In this way they will build up an atmosphere of constant gospel preaching in the church. This does not mean, however, that we use only one way to preach the gospel. As in doing many other things, there are many ways to preach the gospel. For instance, there are often many routes one can take to get to a certain destination. Hence, in some localities we may go out to preach the gospel, and in other localities we may preach the gospel in the small groups; this also is powerful. In short, we need to decide which way to preach the gospel based on the condition and situation of our particular locality. There are many ways; hence, the churches should labor according to their capacity.</p><h2 class="head1">PAYING ATTENTION TO BOTH LIFE AND WORK</h2>
<p>Before the change of system, we were lacking in matters such as gospel activities, shepherding people, and group meetings. This does not mean that since we currently have many activities, we can neglect the emphasis on life. The whole church still needs to pay attention to the matter of life; the elders and co-workers especially need to take the lead to pursue life and grow in life. John 15 shows that Christians need to bear fruit (vv. 2, 4-5, 8). Our going out to gain people is to bear fruit; fruit-bearing depends on the riches of life within, and the fruit is the issue of the outflow of the life within. It is difficult for us to be balanced before the Lord. We tend to either lean toward one side or the other. We are like a cake not turned (Hosea 7:8). We tend to bake only one side; thus, in the end one side is burned, and the other is still uncooked. This is improper. We must take care of both sides, turning to this side and to the other side. Hence, we need to pay attention to life and to work; we need to focus on the growth in life and on bearing abundant fruit. These two matters need to be balanced; we cannot focus only on one side. If we lean toward one side, we will surely suffer loss.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DESPERATENESS AND URGENCY IN PRAYER</h2>
<p>We also need adequate prayer. In the past we have been short in the matter of prayer; we did not have adequate prayer. For example, according to Genesis 2:5, once man tills the ground, God sends the rain. Today we have tilled the ground but there is little rain; this requires our prayer. Regarding this point, I have some special fellowship for the co-workers and full-timers. Since you have more time than the other saints, you should learn to spend more time to pray. The brothers and sisters serving full time do not have the same time constraints as the working saints. Though the working saints have the heart, it is difficult for them to find the time. Hence, the full-time serving brothers and sisters should learn to pray and must realize that prayer is the first crucial matter in the work. Every day you need to set aside a period of time to pray. You should aspire to have a prayer life.</p>
<p>The elders and co-workers should spend much time in prayer. No matter how busy we are and how little time we have, we need to endeavor to tell the Lord all the burdens within us and pray before Him. If possible, all the churches should have one day a week to fast and pray. If the brothers and sisters are strong enough physically, they can fast. If not, do not force them. The saints may fast for a meal or two or even a whole day. This will increase the brothers and sisters&rsquo; feeling and burden for prayer. According to our studies and experiments, the new way is right. Nevertheless, the principle in the Scriptures is that we should always pray. When we do not pray, it seems that God cannot do that much. Hence, we need to cooperate with God&rsquo;s work through our prayer. In themselves, our studies, experiments, and various ways cannot help the saints&rsquo; feeling or strengthen their spirit; these matters require our prayer. Once we have prayer, we will need an outward practice. It is one thing to have the rain, but man still needs to till the ground. This is of two sides: we need to pray, and we also need to labor.</p>
<p>Our fellowship is not for the purpose of giving an order for all the churches to fast once a week. Rather, this matter depends upon the feeling of the responsible brothers. If these brothers have this burden, they can practice it in their locality. Some may not think that it is necessary to fast every week but will announce a fast as needs arise; this also is good. In short, we need to strengthen the prayer of the church. If we lack prayer, we will lack spiritual power. The source of spiritual power is prayer. When there is adequate prayer, power will come, and when there is adequate prayer, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit will be upon us. Hence, the church needs to strengthen the prayer.</p>
<p>Beginning last October, everyone has been endeavoring in one accord, yet after laboring for half a year, we have not seen a rich result from the new way. Nevertheless, compared to the old way, the new way is more profitable. Why has the result of the new way not been so abundant? It is because there is a lack of rain, that is, a lack of the Holy Spirit and of the power of the Holy Spirit. In brief, our prayer is lacking; hence, we must pray. We desire that the elders go to the districts to promote and encourage this matter. Not only should a fast be announced to the elderly brothers and sisters who have retired, but they should be exhorted to always have the burden to fast and pray for the church.</p>
<p>Concerning this matter, I would like to give you some additional fellowship. Recently, I contacted a doctor, who told me that it is very healthy to skip a meal once a week. In the New Testament the Pharisees fasted twice a week (Luke 18:12). This surely has to do with the principle of the repetitive cycle of our physical body. It is absolutely beneficial to our body that we fast one day a week, skipping at least one meal, if not all three meals. Fasting not only enables the digestive system to rest properly but also enables the blood circulation to be cleansed. Hence, we should not be afraid to fast. It does not hurt to fast once or twice a week; rather, it is beneficial.</p>
<p>Those who have digestive ailments or a heart condition should not fast. We need to take care of our bodies. For the brothers and sisters with these conditions, their health is first, not prayer. As for the healthy saints, I hope that they will receive more burden. In the past, in a training for elderly saints we found that the elderly sisters were very strong in the matter of prayer; hence, they should promote the matter of prayer. The church needs to strengthen the prayer; it would not be too much if the amount of prayer were increased five times more than our current amount.</p>
<p>In the future we may announce a fast and encourage prayer on Tuesday afternoon before the evening prayer meeting. Then when we come together in the evening, we can continue to pray. The churches all over the globe, especially the churches in Taiwan, have not paid enough attention to the prayer meeting in the past few decades. This is reflected by the number of attendants in the meeting. The ratio of people attending the prayer meeting is too low, and this needs to be adjusted through much encouragement so that the brothers and sisters pay more attention to the prayer meeting and thus come to the prayer meeting. In this way the number attending will increase. The weight of the prayer of all the churches needs to be greatly increased. We need to see that the extent to which we pray is the extent to which God works. When we pray, God works.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING CONCERNED ABOUT THE WORK<br />
IN SMALL CHURCHES</h2>
<p>We also need to pray for many small churches that need workers who have the heart, who are more gifted, and whose functions are more manifested to visit them and meet with them once a month or once every two months; this will be a great help to them. At present, we are very short in this aspect, because over half of our gifted co-workers stay permanently in one locality. There should be some adjustment in this practice; that is, the co-workers do not need to stay in a fixed place to take care of the church there. They can visit and strengthen other places for three or five weeks. This is definitely profitable. If our co-workers take turns to go out in this way, the help that the small churches receive will be immeasurable. I hope that all the brothers and sisters, especially the co-workers, will pray for this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO SPEAK IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>All the responsible brothers in the churches must take the lead to learn to speak in the meetings. To speak in the meetings is different from our ordinary speaking. Perhaps a certain church may have only ten or twenty people in the meeting, and thus a person does not need to speak loudly in order to be heard; nevertheless, if a person speaks in an ordinary way, the feeling of the spirit will be weakened. If we learn how to speak in the meeting, we will be able to strengthen the release of the spirit. To speak in the meeting, we not only need to lift up our voice but we also need to increase our volume; that is, our throat needs to be clear so that our voice will be loud and our volume will be weighty. Words that bear a weighty tone can easily touch people. An ordinary speaking, even with touching words, does not move people, because both the volume and the voice are inadequate. We all need to learn how to speak in the meetings.</p>
<p>Many people testify that if the young people who meet with us joined a debate competition at school, they would be the top ones because they practice speaking in the meetings. The Chinese family upbringing, generally speaking, does not train children to speak; nevertheless, the young people who have been meeting with us for some time do have this practice. Hence, they have an advantage over those who have not yet practiced at school. To practice speaking is widely beneficial.</p>
<p>At present, the entire church is learning to speak, and the responsible brothers are even taking the lead to speak. When a responsible brother speaks, he needs to bear in mind that speaking in the meetings is different from speaking at home or in any other setting. A brother&rsquo;s speaking in the meeting must be living and loud enough for people to hear; hence, his voice must be loud and his tone weighty. At the same time, he should not speak too fast, because people may not be able to keep up with him; rather, he should speak slowly with good intonation so that his speaking is soothing to people&rsquo;s ears. We all need to bear this burden and responsibility. Even in a meeting of only eight to ten people, we should not neglect this matter. When we speak, all the brothers and sisters are listening and learning. If they learn well, when they stand up to speak for the Lord, they will also speak well. In this way the speaking in the meetings will become weightier.</p>
<p>This is crucial in the normal building up of the church. In other words, all the churches need to pay attention to the matter of speaking. Once the skill of speaking is improved, the amount of speaking in all the localities will be increased. If our speaking cannot be heard, understood, or taken in by people, it is the same as not speaking. If we can speak properly and people can hear us and take in our words, this will make a big difference. At the same time, we need to see that the responsible brothers in all the churches are patterns in speaking; every time they stand up to speak, everyone is learning. Therefore, not only do we need to speak in the meetings, but we also need to speak in a way that people can hear so that the moving power can come out, and the Spirit can work accordingly. If some take the lead regarding these points, it will be very helpful in our regular meetings.</p>
<p>Learning to speak is especially important in regard to the practice of the new way. It does not focus on one man speaking but on everyone speaking. Everyone should learn to speak. Pastors and preachers in Christianity also receive training concerning how to speak. They have a class on evangelism that teaches them how to practice speaking. In Christianity, however, it is sufficient to have only one man speak, but among us, we want everyone to speak. Therefore, we want to help all the brothers and sisters practice to open their mouth and use the proper gestures, tone, and volume in their speaking. I believe that learning these practices is not too difficult and will definitely be of much benefit.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO BE AGGRESSIVE AND PATIENT<br />
IN TAKING THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>Some local churches have a large number of elderly saints, and the leading ones in these localities hope that they can all speak and function; this may not be easy for the elderly saints. We need to be patient with them and wait for them. In a sense, we are climbing a mountain. The younger ones certainly will be in the front, but the older ones may not be able to keep pace. At such times, the younger ones need to exercise patience to wait for the older ones. In carrying out the new way, we should not force people, expect too much, or want to achieve enormous success with the first try. The elderly saints are not young in age, and it is impossible for them to be like the young people; therefore, we need to take it slowly and not be too hasty. Rather, we need to work in a slow and steady way. Do not expect an instant success. A quick success often implies a quick failure. A slow success, on the contrary, lasts longer. There is an ancient Chinese saying: &ldquo;He who advances with haste will retreat with haste.&rdquo; This means that quick progress often results in a quick withdrawal; in contrast, a steady progress that occurs little by little is the most secure. If we spend five years to put the new way into practice in Taiwan, we will greatly please the Lord.</p>
<p>The trainees among us pass through four terms of training, that is, two years. However, not a single program in the secular system of education is able to perfect a talent within two years. Elementary school usually takes six years, junior high school takes three years, high school also takes three years, college requires another four years, and in order to get a masters degree, graduate school takes an additional two years. If someone has the ability, he may receive a doctorate degree after even more years. This demonstrates that there is no program of study in the world that is able to perfect someone within two years. We should never expect that after four terms of training, the trainees will be specialists.</p>
<p>Although two years of study cannot produce specialists, there is still a great difference between those who have passed through two years of the training and those who have not. Even if someone has finished only four years of elementary school education, he is still very different from one who has never been to school and is illiterate. We should not seek to advance quickly in the new way; rather, we need to take care of people&rsquo;s actual situation.</p>
<p>The young people learn fast no matter what the subject matter is. In reference to climbing a mountain, although they may be able to reach a peak within thirty minutes, they should not leave the older ones behind. Instead, they need to take care of the older ones. When older people try to climb a mountain, they may need to rest for ten minutes after walking for five minutes. Young people are able to walk fast without any rest, whereas older people need to walk and sit. They may not reach the peak in half a day; however, sooner or later they will arrive. The situation with the church is the same. I hope that the responsible brothers in all the churches will exercise patience to lead the saints positively, continuing in the new way but not being too hasty. They should believe that the new way will eventually succeed.</p>
<p>In 1937 Brother Nee spoke of the need to change the big meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, a meeting in which one person spoke and everyone else listened. Nevertheless, he also said that the habit that needed to be changed was deeply and firmly constituted into the saints and that it would be difficult to overthrow. To overthrow this habit requires that everyone push in one accord. I still remember clearly that he used the word <em>push.</em> He said that slowly but surely this deeply and firmly rooted habit within us will be overturned. I believe that as long as the brothers and sisters go on faithfully and patiently, the old system on the island of Taiwan will be completely overthrown within five years.</p></body></html>
