   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. PEOPLE OF THE FLESH PERSECUTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THOSE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Galatians 4:29 says, "But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The children according to the flesh, like Ishmael, persecuted the children according to the Spirit, like Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul said that now it is also the same.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The people of the flesh always persecute those of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>NOTHING GOOD DWELLING IN THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Romans 7:18a Paul said, "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not say that we have something good in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may think that we have bad flesh and good flesh, but there is no such thing as "good flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nothing good dwells in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE FLESH BEING ENMITY AGAINST GOD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Romans 8:7a says that the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is because the flesh itself is enmity against God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the mind is set on the flesh, it also becomes enmity against God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to develop this point when we share it with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE FLESH NOT BEING SUBJECT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>TO THE LAW OF GOD</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE FLESH BEING UNABLE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>TO SUBJECT ITSELF TO THE LAW OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Romans 8:7c goes on to say that the flesh is unable to subject itself to the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even if it wanted to be subject to the law, it would be unable to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 8:7 is the strongest verse in the Bible describing the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The flesh is enmity against God, the flesh is not subject to God's law, and the flesh is not able to subject itself to God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It does not have the ability.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To expect the flesh to keep the law of God is like expecting a cat to fly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul was very strong to say that we should not expect that our flesh can keep the law or can subject itself to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It does not have the ability.</S>
