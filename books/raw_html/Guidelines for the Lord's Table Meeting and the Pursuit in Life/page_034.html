 <h2 class="head1">TWO ASPECTS OF THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
NOT BEING SEPARATE FROM THE CROSS</h2>
<p><em>Question: Does the cross have a positive aspect? As far as the experience of the cross is concerned, is the filling of the Holy Spirit an inward filling or an outward pouring?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The cross has two aspects, a positive aspect and a negative aspect. On the negative side, the cross is for termination; on the positive side, the cross is for life dispensing. All of our experiences of the Holy Spirit must pass through the cross. After the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion the Holy Spirit was manifested on the evening of the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and on the day of Pentecost. Two events transpired on two days. On the evening of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, the Holy Spirit as breath was breathed into man as life (John 20:22); on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit as wind came upon man as power (Acts 2:2-4). Many people acknowledge the aspect of the Holy Spirit seen on Pentecost but not the aspect of the Holy Spirit seen on the evening of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. Even Andrew Murray was not clear regarding this point. He had the experience, but he was not clear regarding the truth. He said that the experience of the indwelling Spirit is the same as the experience of the outpoured Spirit, and the experience of the outpoured Spirit is the same as the experience of the indwelling Spirit. This proves that he was not clear concerning the two aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>From his writings we can see that he was confused in the experience of these two aspects. According to the truth, it is one thing for the Holy Spirit to dwell in man, and it is another for the Holy Spirit to come upon man. On the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, the Lord breathed into His disciples and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (John 20:22). Therefore, we cannot say that they did not have the Holy Spirit. Forty days later, however, the Lord told them that the Holy Spirit had not yet come and that they were to wait for the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:3-5). This shows the two aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit. Although there are two aspects, there are not two Spirits but one Spirit with two aspects of work.</p>
<p>Revelation further tells us that the Spirit is now the seven Spirits (1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6). Are there actually seven Spirits? No. There is only one Spirit, but this Spirit is intensified in function sevenfold. From the Bible we can see that the Holy Spirit has several aspects in His work. His descending upon us is one aspect, and His being breathed into us is another. His being breathed into us is for us to receive life; His descending upon us is for us to receive power. Both of these aspects came into existence after the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion.</p>
<p>Thus, without passing through the cross, there is no way to reach a &ldquo;day of resurrection,&rdquo; and without passing through the cross, there is no way to reach a &ldquo;day of Pentecost.&rdquo; Without passing through the cross, it is difficult to receive the Holy Spirit into us as life, and without passing through the cross, it is difficult for the Holy Spirit to come upon us as power. The cross is necessary to experience these two aspects of the Holy Spirit. Not a single experience of the Holy Spirit can bypass the cross. There is nothing that God wants to do in us that can be separated from the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF A CHRISTIAN<br />
BEING TO ALLOW THE CROSS TO WORK</h2>
<p><em>Question: What is the operation and work of the Holy Spirit within us? What is it to feel oppressed inwardly?</em></p>
<p>Answer: All the problems in our spiritual experience need to be dealt with by the cross. The problems in our mind, emotion, and will need to be dealt with by the cross. This means that the more we know the cross, the more the cross can do a killing work within every part of our being. When we are in our mind, the death of the cross deals with our mind; when we are in our emotion, the death of the cross deals with our emotion; when our will is especially strong, the death of the cross breaks our stubborn will. Hence, the way of a Christian depends upon the cross.</p>
<p>Sometimes we sense that our will is too strong and that we should suppress it so that it would not be so strong; sometimes we also feel that our emotion is too strong and that we should change it so that we would not lose our temper easily. But this does not work; this is not the way of a Christian. The way of a Christian depends on God&rsquo;s mercy to reveal that the death of Christ on the cross has terminated our mind, emotion, and will and that this death has entered into us and is operating in us. When our will is stubborn, the death of the cross will touch our will, and our will will be defeated. The cross is like a long sword that chops our will off at the &ldquo;waist,&rdquo; and immediately our will succumbs. In the same way, our emotion will be softened, and our mind will be restrained. At that time, the Holy Spirit will be able to move within us in a spontaneous way.</p>
<p>A will that is no longer stubborn, an emotion that is no longer wild, and an unrestrained mind that no longer hinders God show that the cross has worked in our soul, and the Holy Spirit has a free way to move in us. Hence, the way of a Christian is to allow the death of Christ on the cross to have the inward ground to work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES DEPENDING ON SEEING<br />
AND NOT ON CONSECRATION</h2>
<p><em>Question: In the spiritual experience of a Christian, does consecration follow immediately after baptism?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Strictly speaking, consecration has a limited impact on one&rsquo;s spiritual experiences. After a person believes in the Lord and is saved, he should consecrate himself, but strictly speaking, consecration alone is not enough in one&rsquo;s spiritual experience. Even though many people have thoroughly consecrated themselves, they still have never seen the cross. Christianity appeals to many people who have a desire to consecrate themselves in a thorough way; they are willing to give up their position and wealth in the world and to focus only on His work. There are not just a few people in this category. Nevertheless, they deviate in their spiritual experiences because they have not seen the cross.</p>
<p>With regard to speaking on consecration, throughout the two thousand years of church history no place can be compared with the Keswick Convention in England. These meetings are still held twice a year. People have traveled from Europe and America as if they were on a pilgrimage in order to attend the convention, and the hotel business makes much profit from this. The book <em>The Spirit of Christ</em> says that the Keswick Convention also has branch associations in India and South Africa. The focus of the convention is consecration. They think that the reason a person does not know how to take the Lord&rsquo;s way, does not have the presence of the Lord, and does not have light in reading the Bible is a lack of consecration. In other words, if a person wants to have the strength to take the Lord&rsquo;s way, the presence of the Lord, and light, he must consecrate himself. They consider consecration to be the turning point in all spiritual matters.</p>
<p>It is only in recent years that many people have begun to realize that consecration cannot solve the problems of a Christian and that it is not the way of a Christian. In response to this realization God raised up Mrs. Penn-Lewis to show people that the way of a Christian is not with consecration but with the cross. I am not belittling consecration, because we are consecrated ones and we have even consecrated ourselves more than once. However, consecration is not the way of a Christian; it cannot solve the problems of a Christian.</p>
<p>In the meetings many brothers and sisters have been touched by the Lord to kneel down and consecrate themselves to Him. This is good. But we need to ask how much we know spiritual matters after our consecration. Although our consecration causes us to be more zealous for the Lord, does it cause us to love the Lord more, to know the Lord more, or to see the death of the cross more? Consecration does not need seeing, it merely needs encouragement and exhortation. But in order for us to see the death of the cross, encouragement and exhortation are futile. Preaching the doctrine of the cross without seeing the cross is only a sermon. The listeners may be touched to shed tears and give themselves and everything to the Lord, but this kind of speaking can be compared to exhorting people to be humble and faithful; it is a word of exhortation, not a word of revelation. As long as the speaker is eloquent, this kind of word will be able to move listeners in their emotion and cause them to shed tears and bow their heads to consecrate themselves. In the end, however, the more people appreciate this kind of speaking, the more difficult it will be for them to see. The word of the cross requires our eyes to be opened to see a spiritual matter; hence, seeing is such a great matter.</p>
