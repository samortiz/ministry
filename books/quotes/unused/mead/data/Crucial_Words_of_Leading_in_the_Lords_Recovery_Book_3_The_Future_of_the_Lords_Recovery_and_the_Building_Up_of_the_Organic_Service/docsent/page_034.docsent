   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH EMPHASIZING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING MULTIFACETED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>HAVING CHRIST AS THE CENTER</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we serve in the church, we must remember the word multifaceted.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is what we have gained from our experience and from our observation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our leading is multifaceted.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are not teaching the saints only to be a lion with the face of a lion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to have the head of an eagle and the backbone of an ox.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Of course, most importantly, we have to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The man, the lion, the ox, and the eagle are all present, but they do not have any problems, because Christ is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is being multifaceted.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the trainings that began in 1952, our leading was always multifaceted.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you read the outlines of the trainings, you will see four main points: truth, life, the church, and the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This can be compared to each of the four living creatures having four faces.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The four items truth, life, the church, and the gospel may be likened to a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle, and Christ is their center.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To have four sides is to be multifaceted.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE OLDER SAINTS AND THE YOUNGER SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>COORDINATING TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is a problem with the character of the Chinese, which is that they seem very soft, but they are very hard.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes even dynamite cannot open the hard Chinese character.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This outwardly soft and inwardly hard character causes problems in our coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such a character causes the older ones to look down on the younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is even difficult to avoid in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The younger ones like to be with the other young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They like to listen to young people, and they dislike listening to those who are older.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When such a situation is brought into the church, it affects the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes the older saints can imperceptibly form one group, and the younger saints form another group.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the older ones come together, they may say that there is nothing that they can do with the young people because they are so young.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And when the young people get together, they may complain that there is nothing they can do with the older saints because they are so old.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The older saints have no way with the younger ones, and the younger saints will not go to fellowship with the older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the Lord s table meeting, everyone has the instant grace to shout, O Lord, we are one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Lord, we are one!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are bold to shout the word one, but we may not have the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the meeting, the older saints gather with other older saints, and the younger saints want to be with other young saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The older and younger saints are no longer one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As long as we remain in ourselves without Christ, we cannot be one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For the Lord s recovery to spread and gain people, we must be in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Christ revealed in the New Testament does not have only one aspect; He has many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this message we have mentioned at least four aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, we should not wish that there would be only older saints in the church and no young people; neither should we wish that there would be only young saints in the church and no older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In other words, we should not wish that the saints would be the same as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Regardless of how gifted a person is or how rich his ministry may be, as long as he insists that others be the same as he is, he will not last very long.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He will not remain in the church for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who can remain with their gifts and ministries must be multifaceted.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE NORMAL SITUATION</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>BEING MULTIFACETED The Example of the Human Body</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God created man as a multifaceted being because he has a spirit, a soul and also a body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The human body needs at least four things: to breathe, to eat, to sleep, and to exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is easy for the young people to pay attention to their souls while neglecting their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The older ones, however, know that they have to take good care of their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They know that in addition to breathing, eating, and sleeping, they need sufficient exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When they exercise, their body is stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When I was young, I did not waste any time; I spent all my time reading the Bible and writing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But I have learned the lesson: I must take care of my spirit, soul, and body; I must be multifaceted.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, no matter how busy I am, I usually walk for at least an hour a day.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I would rather sleep less than not walk.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If I do not exercise, my body will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus, we must spend the time to exercise and thus take care of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, we must not only take care of our body; we must also care for our soul and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we do not fellowship with the Lord, open to the Lord, or spend time with Him, we will suffer a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God does not want the man whom He created to be idle.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He wants man to take care of his soul, his body, and most of all of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The developed countries in the world try to ensure that their citizens have a life of abundance and that they can obtain all kinds of things for their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Governments also open schools to teach people many things, thereby developing their souls.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But the greatest shortcoming is negligence in caring for people s spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We preach the gospel and teach the truth in order to care for people s spirits and to fill up this great lack.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we want to be a normal person, we must have a healthy body, a prosperous soul, and a strong spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>By taking such multifaceted care of ourselves, we will become healthy people.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Likewise, the church cannot be single-sided; it must be multifaceted.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the Lord s recovery, the churches in Taiwan have a history of more than thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They have a good foundation, and they have been blessed much by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, the Lord s recovery must advance.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many saints in the churches must come forward to serve, even to serve full time, but we are concerned that in the future problems will arise in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It may be that there will be problems in the localities between the elders and the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Or the young people who come out to serve full time may question the leading of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Thus, even though the young people have a heart to serve full time, they must pay attention to being multifaceted in their practice.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Only then can they avoid complaints about the leading brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Likewise, the elders who take the lead must remember to be multifaceted in their leading.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the only way for the church to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The older saints as well as the younger saints must all exercise to be multifaceted.</S>
