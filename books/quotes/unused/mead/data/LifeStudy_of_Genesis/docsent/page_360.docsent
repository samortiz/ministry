   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a A Practical Living in Oneness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>with the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the common understanding of most Christians, the main point of this chapter is that Isaac is a type of Christ as the Bridegroom and that Rebekah is a type of the church as the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, this is not the main point.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The primary point is the practical living in oneness with the Lord for the fulfilling of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not understand the Bible according to our common knowledge or tradition, but come back to the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever we read any portion of the Scriptures, we must forget all we have learned in the past and look to the Lord for something new.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Fifty years ago I read Genesis 24 carefully, doing my best to remember every point.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nevertheless, when I come to this chapter now, I do not care for what I had in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I like to come to this portion of the Word as if I were reading it for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I can testify that just recently I have seen something new in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Have you ever realized that in Genesis 24 we can see a practical living in oneness with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we have seen, God has a purpose, and the way to fulfill His purpose is by life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These are the two governing points in understanding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we would understand Genesis 24, we must apply these two governing points.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why does Genesis 24 give us such a record of Isaac's marriage?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we only read chapter twenty-four we cannot see the purpose of this record.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to answer this question we must read the three foregoing chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Genesis 21:12 says, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God called Abraham with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For the fulfillment of this purpose, God promised to give Abraham the good land and the seed which would inherit the land.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's eternal purpose is to express Himself in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to have this corporate expression, God must have a people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This people is the seed of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, in order to have the people to express God corporately there is the need of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What then is the purpose of the marriage in Genesis 24?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Is it simply that a single man might have a happy, comfortable life?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No. If you consider the Bible as a whole, you will see that Isaac's marriage was altogether for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without marriage, how could Isaac have brought forth the seed?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If this single man was to have seed for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose, he had to get married.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After Abraham had been tested in chapter twenty-two, God said, "In blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed" 22:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here we also have the seed for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, Isaac's marriage was not common nor merely for his human living; it was for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose.</S>
