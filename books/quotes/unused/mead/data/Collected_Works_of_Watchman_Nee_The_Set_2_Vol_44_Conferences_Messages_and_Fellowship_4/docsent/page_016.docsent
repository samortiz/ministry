   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETY-THREE THE WORK OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have mentioned before that God's eternal plan is for Christ to be glorified and to be made the Head over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Satan rebelled and man fell, God had to come in to deal with these two problems before He could accomplish His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Originally God created man with the purpose of having man deal with the rebellious Satan and to displace his rule.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But man was deceived and fell.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now God had to take care of two problems.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What did He do?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He dealt with these two problems through the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today we will consider the work of the Lord in God's plan: how He solved the problems that stood in the way of God's plan and how He accomplished God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord's work was carried out mainly on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the cross He dealt with sin and the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He redeemed us from sin and removed us, the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the negative side of the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In addition, the Lord stood in the place of Adam, that is, in the place of man and opposed, withstood, and defeated Satan by exercising His will as a man and seized the power of authority back from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>HIS BIRTH IN BETHLEHEM</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every incident in the Lord's life was connected to God's plan and related to the destruction of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, He was born in Bethlehem, taking on a body of blood and flesh Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was not only for the purpose of having blood and shedding blood to forgive our sins, but also for the purpose of dealing with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God wants the created man to deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Satan could never touch the will of the man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the second man Jesus, God gained what He could not gain in the first man Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>HIS TEMPTATION IN THE WILDERNESS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the Lord was baptized by John in the Jordan, He rose up from the water and a voice from heaven said, "This is My Son, the Beloved" Matt 3:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then the Lord was led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness and tempted by the devil 4:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the first temptation the devil said to Him, "If You are the Son of God..." v. 3 . Satan wanted Him to be the Son of God rather than a man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He wanted the Lord to leave His position as a man and take the position of the Son of God, that is, to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was Satan's deception.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Satan knew that once the Lord took the position of God, He would lose His position to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the Lord saw through Satan's deception, and He answered saying, "Man shall not live..." v. 4 . It seems as if the Lord was saying, "I am here as a man, not as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although I am the Son of God, I am taking the position of a man."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first Adam, who was a man, wanted to be God and failed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The second Adam, who is God, was willing to stand in the position of a man and prevailed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only man can accomplish God's eternal plan and only man can deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the second temptation Satan seemed to be saying, "If You are a man after God's heart, You should be able to jump down from the wing of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God will surely protect You."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no love in Satan's temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Wherever there is love, there is not temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Temptation comes when a person does not understand God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When a person is ignorant, he will try anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Satan tried to completely separate the Lord from God once He firmly stood in the position of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet the Lord would not tempt God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He knew that He was joined to God, and He did not doubt God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, He did not take Satan's suggestion to tempt God by jumping down from the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the temptations that the Lord encountered in the wilderness, He was tempted to give up his position as a man and He was tempted to doubt whether He was one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the third temptation the devil said, "If You will fall down and worship me" v. 9 . Satan's goal is worship.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since the Lord represented all men, all men would have failed if He had worshipped Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the Lord stood on God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He only worshipped God and served Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He overcame Satan's temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the garden of Eden man's will sided with Satan and brought in his utter failure.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the wilderness man's will sided with God and was one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As a result man completely overcame.</S>
