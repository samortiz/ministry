   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR RESPONSIBILITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is our burden?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is our responsibility?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must not just preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must bear the testimony of Jesus, as Revelation says 1:2, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must be witnesses to Him, as Acts 1:8 tells us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must bring forth fruit by abiding in Him, as John 15:5 and 16 tell us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the proper preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is no need to use any gimmicks.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must lay our gimmicks aside, just as Paul determined not to use excellence of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our responsibility is to live Christ, to bear a living witness to Him in our daily life, to know nothing but Christ, the all-inclusive One revealed in the completing ministry of Paul and the mending ministry of John.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then, whenever we come together, we are one Body and the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no discrimination, whatever our background is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Praise the Lord for such a country as the United States!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The other countries are made up of people of one nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Germany, for example, is composed of Germans.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The United States is the only country that comprises all different races and national backgrounds; that is why it is called a melting pot.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Is it not sovereign of the Lord that there should be such a nation right in the center of the inhabited earth?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How good for the new man!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here there cannot be Greek or Jew, black or white, Oriental or Westerner, "but Christ is all and in all" Col 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our ultimate responsibility is to live Christ and to meet together in our locality in such a way that we may be the Body, the new man, the lampstand, and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We meet in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Christ we live and preach is not divided.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Christ we testify is not divided.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We live Him according to this view we have of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We live the all-inclusive, extensive Christ who is now the life-giving Spirit as the ultimate expression of the Triune God after many processes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And we meet together according to locality as the church, the church which is not only an assembly but also the Body, the new man, the lampstand, and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We also practice the genuine oneness in every locality one Body, one Spirit, one city, one church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Such a living is our ultimate responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By Twos to Different Countries</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The spreading of the Lord's recovery must be considered part of our ultimate responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Lord was on earth, He sent the disciples out two by two.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the church testimony was spreading, Paul and Barnabas also went out by two.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I believe this is a divine principle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose some are burdened to go to other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How will they make a living?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It will be hard in a new country.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I believe, however, that the rest who remain here could pick up the burden to support them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who go out by twos to foreign countries may mostly go to study, to attend school, to learn the language.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They can also contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Foreign students find it easy to contact other students and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Out of these contacts they will be able to pass on Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There will be no need to be concerned about living expenses, because the saints here will support them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This will be easy to carry out, and it is the biblical way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Small Lampstands Raised Up</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After a few years there could be a small testimony in many countries.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The two in each place, as they are studying, or working, or just contacting people, could bring at least ten to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then there would be twelve meeting together as a small lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A lampstand is not big like a lighthouse; I believe the Bible uses the lampstand to signify the church to give the sense that the church does not have to be a big thing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Suppose two brothers go with their wives to Athens, Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With four of them there, all studying and contacting other students, do you not believe that they can bring in at least ten within five years?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then there can be fourteen meeting there as the church in Athens!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They will go there not like traditional missionaries but rather as the high-class witnesses to Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They will bring the high gospel to Athens.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They will bring the deeper knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They will bring Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They will bring the testimony of Jesus, that is, the Body, the new man, the lampstand, and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A Sober Consideration Needed</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I believe this may be the Lord's way to prepare His bride Rev 19:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now that I have spoken to you, I have fulfilled my responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now the responsibility is yours.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As you consider what you have read in these chapters of the world situation and of the Lord's recovery, what will you do?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Will you simply stay where you are and make a good living?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Will you be content with good meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Good meetings are enjoyable, yet would the Lord not lead you out?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Be sober and alert that the Lord may grant you the proper guidance whether to stay or to go, where to go, and the way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If He leads you to stay, how much responsibility should you bear for those who go out in His name for His recovery by faith to other countries?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A move like this is living; it is the Lord's move in His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the ultimate responsibility we must bear for the Lord's ultimate recovery under the present ultimate world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We thank Him for this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We thank Him for the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We thank Him for His grace, which will enable us to bear such a responsibility.</S>
