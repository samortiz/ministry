   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE POISONING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A believer's spirit can become poisoned by evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is what the fiery darts of the enemy do.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He can shoot his darts directly into a believer's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He can shoot sorrow, sadness, suffering, grief, and heartbreak into a believer's spirit, causing him to have a "sorrowful spirit" 1 Sam 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"But a wounded spirit who can bear?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Prov 18:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, this greatly affects a person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When a believer feels sorrowful, he thinks he is feeling sorrowful, considering this sorrow to be very natural.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He does not try to find out its cause nor does he try to oppose it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He accepts everything that comes to him silently and without any objection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to remember that this is very dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can never accept a thought carelessly or allow any feeling to come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we want to walk according to the spirit, we have to be watchful in everything; we must study all our thoughts and feelings and find out where they come from.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sometimes Satan causes our spirit to become hard, stubborn, narrow, selfish, wild, and disobedient.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Consequently, the spirit is not able to cooperate with the Holy Spirit and carry out God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We will lose all of our love for men and all of our gentleness, sympathy, and considerations for the weaknesses of others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When this happens, the Holy Spirit cannot use us to any great extent; we will have lost the Lord's broadness and set up a boundary for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sometimes the enemy puts an unforgiving spirit into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the most frequent poison that believers take in. This probably accounts for the majority of the cases of failure in spiritual believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This kind of poison, such as fastidiousness and vengeance, is the most deadly poison to the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even after a believer has suffered from this poison, most of the time he will still not be clear about what happened or realize that this poison came from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, he thinks that he hates others and that this cannot be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes Satan causes believers to become narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He will cause believers to set a boundary for themselves and separate themselves from others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If believers do not have the concept of the church being the Body of Christ, instead making their own little group their foremost concern, it is a sign that their spirit has dwindled and become narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A spiritual believer considers God's business as his own business and the whole church as the object of his love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If his spirit is open, the river of life will flow everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if he becomes narrow, he will frustrate God's work and minimize his own usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If our spirit is not big enough to include all of God's children, it means that our spirit has been poisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes Satan causes the believers' spirit to become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this way they become boastful, self-respecting, and self-esteeming.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Satan causes the believers to think that they are not destitute, that they are somewhat important, and that they have some worth in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This kind of spirit is also a great cause for the believers' failures.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Pride goeth before destruction,/and a haughty spirit before a fall" Prov 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The evil spirits inject such things together with other poisons into the believers' spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the believers do not oppose these things immediately, they will quickly turn into things of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If believers know how to live in the spirit, these things will only be Satan's poison at the beginning; they will not have an opportunity to become a sin of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, if believers do not oppose them, subconsciously accepting them instead, they will soon turn into sins of the flesh.</S>
