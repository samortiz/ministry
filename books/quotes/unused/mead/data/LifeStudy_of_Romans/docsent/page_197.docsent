   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LOOKING AT THE ASCENDED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should not look at ourselves, but look at the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hebrews 1:3 says that after Christ made purification for sins, He sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The ascended Christ seated at the right hand of God is the receipt for the payment for our forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a matter of tremendous significance, for it is the foundation of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever our conscience condemns us because of our failures, we need to remember to stand upon the foundation of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You may be fervent for the Lord today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in the future, you may fail Him and therefore become very disappointed with yourself, unable to believe that God could ever forgive you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you remain under this feeling of condemnation and disappointment, you will not be able to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, you may become subject to the subtlety and deception of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At such a time you need to praise God for His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Tell Him that no matter how much you have failed, Christ is still at His right hand as the receipt for payment for all your debts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our experience may fluctuate, but God remains righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever we claim the blood of Jesus and appeal to God s righteousness, God has no choice except to forgive us 1 John 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE FOUNDATION OF OUR</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our experience of Christ rests upon the foundation of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should never have confidence in ourselves, thinking that we cannot backslide or fail the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not be like Peter who said that he would be faithful to the Lord, even though everyone else might deny Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The foundation is not our fervency or victory; it is God s righteousness, the unshakable foundation of God s throne.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God has shown forth His righteousness by passing over the sins of the Old Testament saints and by forgiving us of our sins in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By doing these things God has proved that He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now this very righteousness is our foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The work of being designated sons of God is built upon this foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, we must be clear that the foundation is not the process of designation; it is the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>CHRIST, THE END OF THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>UNTO RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 10:3 and 4 say, For they, being ignorant of God s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, did not submit to the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one who believes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here we see that the Israelites made the mistake of seeking to establish their own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do this today, we also are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is the end of the law so that we may gain the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>CONSTITUTED THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 2 Corinthians 5:21 Paul says, For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be constituted the righteousness of God in him Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>. According to this verse, we are not only righteous in God s eyes, but we are being constituted righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Christ, we are becoming the very righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This experience is subjective and rather deep.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1 Corinthians we have the matter of objective righteousness, but in 2 Corinthians, subjective righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that we are not only righteous before God, but that we are God s very righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This takes place through the work of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is in the process of transforming us with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we are transformed by God in this way, the more we become the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As sons of Adam, we were sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But as the members of Christ, Christ is being wrought into us to transform us gradually from sin into righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Righteousness means to be right with God in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It means that in no matter are you wrong or unfair in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Every part of your being is right according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are as righteous, just, and fair as God is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not firstly a matter of outward behavior, character, or conduct, but a matter of our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the eyes of others, you may be quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But as you stand before God, you will realize that you are not good at all.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You may be better than others, but certainly you are not as good as God is.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To be justified by God means to be the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we were saved, we were covered by Christ as our garment of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is objective righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But now God is working to make our person, our being, the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is not merely a garment put upon us objectively; it is the very element of Christ wrought into us subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this way we have not only the foundation, but also the building.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Becoming the righteousness of God inwardly and subjectively is also related to designation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The more we are designated the sons of God, the more we become the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is a matter of Christ wrought into our nature, our element, our being, our substance.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is not a matter of something imputed to us objectively, but a matter of subjective transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Praise the Lord that we, the believers in Christ, are on the foundation of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now this righteousness is being wrought into us to constitute us the very righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Concerning righteousness, there is a difference between 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>First Corinthians 1:30 tells us that Christ is our righteousness objectively, whereas 2 Corinthians 5:21 tells us that Christ is being wrought into us to make us the righteousness of God subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Concerning objective righteousness, from the time of our salvation we all are righteous already.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But concerning subjective righteousness, we are under a process.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In other words, positionally we are righteous in the eyes of God, but dispositionally we are not yet the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>STANDING ON GOD S RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Nevertheless, we must praise the Lord for our righteous position.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>No matter how poor our disposition may be, we still have the position of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Because we have this position and foundation, we have the boldness to tell God that He has no right to forsake us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We can say, Father God, even if You don t like me, You must still accept me.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You put the Lord Jesus on the cross and judged Him on my behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Furthermore, You have raised Him from the dead and caused Him to sit at Your right hand as proof that You have received His death as payment for my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I believe that You love me, but even if You don t love me, You still must receive me according to Your righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have been saved by God s love and by His grace, but especially we have been saved by God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God s love and grace may change in relation to us, but it is impossible for God s righteousness to change.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Before Christ died on the cross, God could have changed His mind about us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>At the last minute, He could have decided to let us all perish and to create a new human race for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But as we have pointed out, now that Christ has died for our sins and has been resurrected for our justification, God cannot change His mind.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God has signed the will, and He is legally bound by it.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Therefore, for our salvation, we stand not on God s love nor on God s grace, but on God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The book of Romans speaks both of God s love and of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, Romans does not say that either love or grace is the power of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Rather, in this book Paul clearly declares that the power of the gospel is the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I am deeply grateful to God for His love and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But my standing is upon His righteousness, the foundation of His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>His righteousness cannot be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we would be designated the sons of God for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose, we all must know this unshakable foundation and stand firmly upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Many Christians praise God for His love and grace, but not many praise Him for His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Praise Him that the foundation of our salvation is His righteousness!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We also praise Him that He is transforming us in Christ into His very righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Eventually, God will be able to say, Satan, look at My children.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>They are not only righteous before Me, but they have become My righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Once we have been saved according to God s righteousness, we cannot be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If we are clear concerning God s righteousness in the gospel, we shall be at rest knowing that the righteousness of God is our eternal security.</S>
