   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TEACHING IN MUTUALITY FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After fellowship, intercession, mutual care, and shepherding which includes the rendering of some help, we come to the main purpose of the group meeting the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To perfect the saints is to edify, educate, and raise them up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This perfecting depends upon our teaching, but we should not teach in the way that Christianity does with one man teaching and the rest listening.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That way does not develop the gifts of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the group meeting, the teaching is carried out by every member in mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we have an assigned teacher, everyone will come merely to hear this teacher's teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That might be considered as a kind of group meeting, but that is the old way; that is not what the Bible reveals as a group meeting, especially Hebrews 10:24-25: "Let us consider one another for inciting to love and good works, exhorting one another."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These verses show that a group meeting is full of mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every time we come together in the group meeting, everyone is exercised to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By this practice everyone is developed in their spiritual function, gift, and ability.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the group meeting, everyone is both a teacher and a learner.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Everyone is both an asker and an answerer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every answer becomes a part of the teaching in the group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because the group meeting should have some very young believers, we must learn to begin our teaching with something very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One of the new ones may say, "I was saved one week ago and was also baptized, but I do not understand what baptism is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is baptism?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If after such a question, everyone would turn to a certain brother for a reply, this is the way of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even if the question was directed toward a particular brother, it would be altogether right for a sister to say, "I would like to tell you something concerning baptism."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This shows the livingness of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our speaking we should not be formal or religious, but come directly to the point.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A sister may say, "Baptism is when we put you into the water, and the water is very significant."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is simple and direct; this is a good beginning, but this sister or someone else should continue by sharing some of the significances of the water, using some verses from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all must learn to function together as one teacher a sister shares something, I may add something more, and several others would add other points.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, we should not do this in a foolish way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must care for a proper continuation in our teaching and cover the points of the truth step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually, after about five minutes, seven different saints may have spoken a point concerning baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These seven points added together should be a very good short message concerning baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There may be a brother among us who is more experienced and knowledgeable in the truth, but he must learn not to be the only teacher in the group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He should exercise to sit and listen while all the attendants function.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then at a certain point, he may feel that this subject has been covered but that there is the need of a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then this brother may give a word as a conclusion to the seven persons' speakings in order to complete this short "message."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this way everyone learns something in a short period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In practicing the group meeting, although we are teaching others, we must realize that we are also learning how to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not think that our teaching is that good or complete.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A new believer may say, "I was baptized last week, and I noticed that you were all calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And you also asked me to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But when I called on the Lord this week, I did not have any feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It seems that you have some feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why don't I have any feeling?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may be able to respond to this question in many ways, but we must learn to answer such a question in a simple and direct way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Someone might answer saying, "Calling on the name of the Lord is just like breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Quite often when we breathe we don't have any feeling, but when we breathe deeply, we do have some feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the same way, the louder you call, the more feeling you will have."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With a short word of only a few sentences, we can answer such a question.</S>
