   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE INITIAL SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BECOMING THE UNITING SPIRIT 2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The oneness mentioned by the Lord in His prayer in John 17 is mysterious, for it is a oneness realized and practiced in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank the Lord for the clear picture of this oneness in the building of the tabernacle in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The building of the tabernacle in Exodus corresponds to the oneness in John 17.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord prayed that all His believers would be one so that God could have a dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The tabernacle was such a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The oneness seen in the tabernacle is simply the building of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The tabernacle had forty-eight boards.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because these boards were built together to be the dwelling place of God, the tabernacle is a clear picture of the oneness in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This oneness is not in the acacia wood out of which the boards were made; it is in the gold that overlaid them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The wood and the gold signify the Christian s human and divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The human nature is signified by the acacia wood, and the divine nature, by the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Each board was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because we Christians are both wooden and golden, we are wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have seen that acacia wood signifies not our fallen nature but our transformed and uplifted nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have been regenerated, and now we are undergoing the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Day by day, a change is taking place in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This change is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although I have not been fully perfected yet, I can testify boldly that a great change has taken place within me since I became a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is not a mere change in behavior, but a change in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we are being transformed into acacia wood, we are also being overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We worship the Lord and give Him praise that daily He is overlaying us with Himself as the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our oneness is in this gold.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THREE ASPECTS OF ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This oneness has three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first aspect, the initial aspect, is with the golden rings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am quite certain that the golden rings were attached to the boards before the boards were overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, the first step was to attach the rings to the boards and the second step was to overlay the boards with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The third step was to make the uniting bars, which held the forty-eight boards together and brought them into oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This oneness is the building, which is the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without the picture of the tabernacle, we cannot adequately understand the oneness spoken of in John 17.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since my youth I have devoted much attention to John 17.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But because I was short of experience and did not see the picture of the oneness portrayed in the tabernacle, I did not have an adequate understanding of the Lord s prayer for oneness in John 17.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But now, after years of experience and even of suffering, I can say that the oneness for which the Lord prayed in John 17 is the very oneness seen in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By considering the picture of the tabernacle, we can have the proper understanding of the practical oneness for which the Lord Jesus prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>ONENESS IN THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This oneness is in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The boards were one in the gold, and the gold signifies the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have pointed out that on each board there were the three rings signifying the Triune God, who is the sealing Spirit we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This Spirit is not merely the Spirit of God, but the Spirit of God with the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In John the Lord Jesus said that the Spirit would be sent from the Father 15:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Greek preposition rendered from should actually be rendered from with.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that the Spirit is sent not only from the Father but also with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After He sent the Spirit, the Father did not remain in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No, when the Father sent the Spirit, the Spirit came to us with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, to have the Spirit in us is also to have the Father in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In like manner, the Son is with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From eternity to eternity, the Son has always been and always will be with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, to have the Spirit in us is also to have the Father and the Son in us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, we have the Triune God as the three rings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, when we have the Spirit, we have the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the initial Spirit, the sealing Spirit, we have received as the rings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This life-giving Spirit has regenerated us and now is dwelling in us.</S>
