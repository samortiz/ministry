   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REFUSING TO COME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I wanted to preach to the birds.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I wanted to tell them, "Little birds, I have no special intention in doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is winter on the mountain, and food is scarce.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have enough food with me, and I just want to share it with you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Please be at peace and come down.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I only ask that as you eat, I can sit among you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I want to listen to your songs and watch you playing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Come.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us be friends..."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the birds would not come.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They did not understand me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I had to give up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later I had a certain realization within.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I began to preach to myself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I said, "This body of mine is too big.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I could shrink from five feet eleven inches to the size of a bird, and even change myself into a bird, they would not be alarmed by my presence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I could then tell them my heart's intention, and we could spend the winter on the mountain Lu-shan together."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>GOD MUST BECOME THE SAME AS WE ARE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have a similar problem today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If God remained God, we could never understand Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If He talked to us in His language, we would be altogether lost.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If God wants to reveal Himself through speaking and have fellowship with man, He must shrink Himself to such a degree that He and we are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only then would He be able to speak to us and tell us of Himself and of the mysteries of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only then would we be able to understand Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Has God become a man to reveal Himself through His speaking?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let us again use the method of supposition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What if God revealed Himself through the human language?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What if He became a man and fellowshipped with man?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The implication is tremendous here!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It would mean that in this world, among all the human beings throughout history, one person was not merely a man, but God as well!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If it is granted that God became a man, there must be a mortal who was also divine.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to find out about this One.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>QUALIFICATIONS FOR A MAN TO BE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a thorny task.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But we will employ the effective method we have adopted namely, setting down a few principles.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then we will search according to these qualifications and directions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We want to base our evaluation on what manner of life a person should possess and what qualifications he must have if he is God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first condition that this person must fulfill is that he must claim to be God while he is on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He cannot be apologetic about it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He must declare boldly that he is God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only then can we know who he is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without this declaration, we have no way to guess his identity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, a declaration is our first qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Second, the way this person came into the world must be different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If I said that I am God and yet was born in the same manner as every other mortal, my words would carry no force.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If on the other hand, I dropped down from heaven, my assertion would be taken seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The way this person comes into being must be extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He must come in an absolutely different fashion; otherwise, his words will not carry the necessary weight.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Third, this man must bear a moral standard that is far above that of all other human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He must have God's holiness, and his life must bear the mark of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For example, if I became a bird and lived in exactly the same way as other birds, without showing them anything extraordinary, I could not convince them that I was actually a man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If God is to become a man, His moral behavior must be of the highest quality.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the only way that we could identify Him as God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, if a person is God, he must necessarily be able to perform things which no mortal can do.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If he can achieve what we cannot achieve and know what we do not know, we can say that he is truly God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Lastly, this person must be able to tell us the divine purpose concerning man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What was God's purpose in creating the universe and man?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How does He take care of human pains and sorrows?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What is the origin and ultimate solution of everything in the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What should our attitude towards God be?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All these he must reveal to us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Unless this one shows us what we do not see, we cannot say that he has shown us any revelation.</S>
