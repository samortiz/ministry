<h2 class="head1">THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</h2><p>We expect to see the whole church rising up to preach the gospel and all the brothers and sisters serving God together, rather than three or five people serving by themselves. The works that the church has to do include: first, the preaching of the gospel, which should not just be the responsibility of those who are giving the messages; second, there is the gospel visitation, which is conducted in the homes; third, there is the visitation of the new believers; fourth, there is the perfecting of the new believers; and fifth, there is the care for the poor.</p><h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel</h2><h2 class="head3">Mobilizing All the Brothers and Sisters</h2><p>The first kind of service is the preaching of the gospel. The brothers responsible for the preaching of the gospel should promote the gospel work in all the districts, schools, and other places. These few brothers should not just be responsible for the preaching itself but should be responsible for mobilizing others to preach the gospel. Whether or not our work can be successful depends not only on how well the responsible brothers are serving, but on how much the other brothers and sisters are serving. Today in Christianity there are no priests; there are only pastors. But among us we have to put all the one-talented ones to use. When all the one- talented ones rise up, we will have the church. If we replace their functions, we are wrong. The right thing to do is to help them along in their work.</p><h2 class="head3">Not Being Negligent<br />and Not Being Covetous for Gain</h2><p>At the same time, if you are a person who is not serious and who is loose and irresponsible, you cannot serve God. You cannot serve God in a careless or negligent way. I am not hired by the church; I am not receiving the church's salary. I am not a hireling. I am here to serve God. As such, I cannot be negligent. Others may have to sleep on the floor in order to get their work done. I have to be more desperate than they are; I have to sleep under the floor. If a man cannot be negligent in serving the earthly things, how much more must he not be negligent in serving God? We are not here for money. In order to serve the Lord, we cannot ask anyone for anything, not even a bowl of rice. We serve because we love the Lord.</p><h2 class="head3">Everyone Participating</h2><p>Every week we should have a gospel meeting, and every brother and sister should invite people to come to this meeting. This should be the responsibility of all the members. Never allow the brothers and sisters to develop the habit of asking what the meeting that night is about. If it is going to be a gospel meeting, do not let them say, "All right. I will go home and sleep.'' You have to say to such brothers, "No. Now that you realize it is a gospel meeting, you have to rise up immediately, because you have a part in this meeting.''</p><h2 class="head2">Gospel Visitation<br />and Visitation of the New Believers</h2><h2 class="head3">Being Baptized as soon as One Is Saved</h2><p>The responsibility of visiting the new believers is quite heavy. If the church assigns a certain brother to visit someone, this brother should take the one who introduced the new one to the church along with him. As soon as a person is saved, he should be baptized. Many people were quite alive when they first believed, but after waiting a while to be baptized, they became dead. As soon as a person believes, he should be baptized. If he is baptized and something happens later, he will not feel so free to deny his faith.</p><h2 class="head3">The Whole Church Working,<br />Bringing Increase in Quantity and Quality</h2><p>In arranging the visitation we should divide up the city into districts according to the map. Once the time is ripe and there is a certain number of ones desiring to be baptized, we should baptize them. If we do this, we will double our investments in a short time. No other period of time affords as much opportunity as today for the work to go on. If the whole church rises up, there will be no place to hold the blessings. Within one to two months a thousand people were saved in Foochow. When the whole church is involved in this kind of work, everyone who comes into the church will be up to the proper standard. Everyone who is born this way will be an eight- to nine-pound baby; no one will be a twelve-ounce baby that has to be kept in an incubator.</p>
