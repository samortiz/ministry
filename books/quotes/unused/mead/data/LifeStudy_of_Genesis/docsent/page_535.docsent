   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>d No Begging after Arriving in Egypt</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Jacob arrived in Egypt, he did not beg for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, when he was young, he begged wherever he went.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He not only begged; he supplanted others and robbed them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jacob expected to have everything for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he stayed with you, what was in your pocket would sooner or later end up in his.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the early years, Jacob robbed his father, his brother, his uncle, and even his wives.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually, when he was old, he himself was robbed and was bereft even of his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But, in his maturity, he did not beg for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to his position after he arrived in Egypt, he had the standing to claim everything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, he did not ask for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a strong sign of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A mature person is not demanding.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead of demanding, requiring, or asking, Jacob stretched forth his hands to bless others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we beg, ask, and demand, it proves we are young in life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We, the saints, should not place demands on one another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, this cannot be performed; it is the issue of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In any family the children are very demanding, much more demanding than anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The grandfather, on the contrary, demands nothing; instead, he is constantly giving.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But all day long the little children are asking for candy, cookies, and toys.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>My grandchildren are constantly asking their grandmother for things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The younger you are, the more demands you make.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may make demands of the elders, and of the brothers and sisters, but you never make demands of yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This proves that you are like a little baby.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A baby does nothing except make demands.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While the Lord may take some time to answer my prayer, the prayers of the babies are answered immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Making many demands is an indication that you are young.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Excessive praying may also be a sign of immaturity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some young saints, thinking that the elders are not humble or diligent enough, pray for them in a childish way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not praying for the elders in this way is a proof that you have grown up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Praying improperly for the elders indicates that you are young.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more you pray for them, the less mature you are.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you do not pray for the elders, then you must be grown up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many prayers for the church are also childish.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some saints pray, "Lord, I dare not tell you about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But, Lord, You know the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>O Lord, do something about it."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This kind of prayer is actually a condemnation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When you pray like this, you accuse the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To pray this kind of prayer is to ask the Lord to deal with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You pray so much for the church because, in your eyes, the church does not satisfy your requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul, however, did not pray for the church in this manner.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Fifty years ago, I also prayed in the way of blaming, begging, demanding, and accusing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the Lord can testify for me that during the past six months I have not prayed for the elders in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This does not mean that they are perfect; it means that I do not make demands of them and that I am not inwardly bothered by them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not try to imitate this characteristic of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not say, "Brother Lee told us that for six months he did not pray for the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From now on, I won't pray for them either."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you are able to keep from praying for the elders for six months, it is an indication that you have grown.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It reveals that you are not begging or making demands.</S>
