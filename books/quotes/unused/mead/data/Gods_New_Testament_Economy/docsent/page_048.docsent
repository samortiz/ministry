   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE SPIRIT AS THE BLESSING OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Gal 3:14, 2-3, 5; 4:6, 29; 5:16-18, 22-25; 6:8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is not so easy for us to see the aspect of the Spirit mentioned in the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that the book of Romans talks about the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By studying 1 Corinthians diligently we all can see that the Spirit there is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is easier to see that in 2 Corinthians there is the transforming Spirit; however, it is not so easy to see what is the aspect of the Spirit mentioned in Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE BACKGROUND OF GALATIANS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During the time that Paul wrote this book, the Christians were being bothered, troubled, and distracted by the law keepers, the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These law keepers or Judaizers, on the one hand, pretended to be Christians, but they still remained so faithful to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They treasured the law much more than the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They not only kept the law by themselves but they also did their best to Judaize the Gentile believers, misleading them to keep the law rather than hearing the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To hear the faith means to receive the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We realize today that the law was absolutely an Old Testament matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was something in letter and at best it was something in promise, in types, and in prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nothing was a reality and everything was in letters and in shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Judaizers, however, did not realize this and treasured these shadows, and they forced the Gentile believers to follow them in treasuring these shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The stress in their teaching distracted and even misled the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those believers who had been distracted were missing the blessing of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Under such a background, Paul wrote this short Epistle to the Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>GALATIANS 1 3</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the first two chapters Paul presented the Galatians with a clear view that God s intention is to work Christ into us as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God had no intention for His chosen people to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His intention was only to use the law as a custodian, a guardian, a child-conductor, to watch over His chosen people before Christ came, and to escort and conduct them to Christ when He did come 3:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The law is also likened to a sheepfold John 10:1 , in which God s chosen people were kept and guarded in custody and ward until Christ came.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the day of Christ s coming dawned, God wanted His chosen people to come out of the fold, to come out of custody, to receive Christ directly as their life and life-supply.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In chapter one Paul showed that God s intention is to reveal His Son, Jesus Christ, into His chosen people v. 16 . God did not have any intention of revealing the law in His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s desire is that His chosen people would receive His Son into them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In chapter two Paul goes on to show us that Christ replaces the law and that God did not want us to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, God put us on the cross with Christ, and we have died to law that we might live to God 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have been crucified with Christ on the cross, and it is no longer we who live but Christ lives in us v. 20 . Christ lives in us not to the law, but to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not live to the law, but we live to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not live a life to keep the law, but we live a life to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have nothing to do with the law since the obligation under the law, the relationship to the law, was terminated in Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only were we crucified, but even the law of the commandments in ordinances was nailed to the cross Col 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In chapter three Paul was very frank in his writing to the Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He called them foolish Galatians v. 1 . When Paul wrote the Galatians, they had all been misled to be blind and veiled, to be foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, Paul called them foolish Galatians and he asked them, Did you receive the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By receiving the gospel, the Galatians received the consummation of the Triune God which is the living, all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is so living, so real, so availing, and so prevailing, and much higher than the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul wanted to show the Galatians how foolish it is to neglect the Spirit and drift back to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul told them that since they had begun their Christian life in a good way by the Spirit, they should run the race to be perfected by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, they were distracted, trying to take the way of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>So Paul asked them, Are you so foolish?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To begin by the Spirit is by faith in Christ; to be perfected by the flesh is by works of law 3:2 .</S>
