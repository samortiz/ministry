   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning Listening to a Message</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The same is true in regards to listening to a message.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When someone preaches something that is different from our belief and practice, we should ask God if his speaking is really improper.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If his speaking is not improper, then are we improper somewhere?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we can learn humbly before God, our hearts will be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Consequently, even though our thoughts may be improper at times, our minds will not be improper all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, if our motives are not proper and we only want to argue, we will always be able to find a couple of verses to oppose the truth taught by others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many Christians study the Bible like a lawyer studying a law book; their purpose is only to defend their own case.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, it is their motive that is corrupted first, not their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They first have a tendency to covet in their heart; then their mind and whole being are dragged into the peril of covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Concerning Reading the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Among our brothers and sisters, is there anyone whose mind cannot understand the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I would say the reason we do not understand the Bible is that our heart is improper.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit will guide us into all truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I often wonder why some people understand the Bible so poorly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The reason is that they are improper in the inclinations of their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps they are too subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result, their nous cannot receive the light of God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The heart becomes corrupted, and the nous follows.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the heart is not calm and balanced, the mind will become corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Someone said that Eve did not fall because she ate the forbidden fruit, but because her motive was not proper in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When she spoke with Satan, her heart was dissatisfied with God and already corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Soon after, Genesis 6 says that every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart was only evil continually.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The nous becomes corrupted after the heart has been corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One brother in the West said that before Eve ate the forbidden fruit, she had fallen already.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When she added the words "neither shall ye touch it" in her conversation with Satan, her heart was not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By Genesis 6, God pronounced every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart to be only evil continually.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, the heart is improper; second, man is alienated from the life of God; and last, man's imagination and thoughts become totally evil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Any Christian who has a proper heart can read the Bible; he can receive God's light from the Bible, he can know God's will easily, and he can receive full grace from God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Concerning Listening to Others</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you want to know whether or not a person's heart is proper and his mind is right, you need only talk to him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whoever can listen well has a good mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some Christians' minds are like a wheel; they rotate all day long and cannot listen to what others say to them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Just as the wheel splashes dirt as it rotates, these Christians only raise questions and do not take in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These conditions indicate that a person's mind is improper.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The mind is improper because the heart is improper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a person likes to interrupt the conversation of others, it is also a sign of sickness in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In listening to others, we can sometimes add a few remarks to indicate whether or not we agree, but constant interruption is a sign that there is sickness in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the thoughts that go through your mind swirl around and around all day long, your nous must be sick.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this condition, a person cannot listen to others; he cannot even listen to God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The root of the sickness is in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A self-righteous, self-confident heart, a heart that believes in its own cleverness, or some prejudice in the heart makes it impossible for one to listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not being able to listen to others is a sickness of the nous.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the root of this sickness is an improper heart.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No matter what we hear, we have to transfer what we hear to our inner being before we can understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This work of transferring is somewhat like the work of language translation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For people who do not understand English, words must first be translated into Chinese before they can be understood.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This work of "translation" within us goes on quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a man cannot understand what others say, it means that his nous cannot translate.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a man misunderstands what others say, it means that the nous mistranslates.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once I was preaching in a certain place, and I told the people that man is saved not according to work, but according to what Christ has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There were two Taoists in the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After hearing my words, they told others, "He was only exhorting others to do good!"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many people are filled up inside; they cannot receive God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we do not empty out what is inside of us, we will never be able to understand the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our heart should be as meek as a child's, ready to be taught before God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must tell Him, "God, I do not know if what this person says is good or bad, right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I pray that You grant me judgment, so that I will know what is right and what is wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By this, we will understand and see what God wants us to see.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many people think that the inability to understand the truth is due to the sickness of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Actually, the basic cause is the sickness of the heart.</S>
