<h2 class="head1">THE MAIN CONTENT OF THE BOOK OF EPHESIANS</h2>
<p>The book of Ephesians does not talk about the material things, and it does not contain mere knowledge. There are not even many Old Testament quotations in this book. Moreover, it does not mention the miraculous gifts. In this book the gifts are persons, such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers (4:11), not the gifts of healing and other miraculous things. The book of Ephesians is a book on the church, the Body of Christ (1:22-23). This book speaks about the unsearchable riches of Christ and how this Christ as the Spirit is in us (3:8, 16-19). This is not an outward Christ but an inward Christ, because He is making His home in us. He is our Head and our life, and our heart&mdash;our mind, emotion, will, and conscience&mdash;is His home. No one can measure His breadth, length, height, and depth, but such a Christ is making home in our heart. Eventually we are filled, not with material things or even with knowledge, gifts, or power, but unto all the fullness of God.</p>
<p>In chapter 1 there is the sealing of the Holy Spirit (v. 13). The Holy Spirit as a seal in us is inward, not outward. In chapter 2 there is the new man created by Christ and in Christ (v. 15). This also is something apart from material things, mere scriptural knowledge, and gifts. The new man created in Christ and by Christ is fully of Christ, and it is even Christ Himself. In Genesis 3 Eve was a part of Adam and came entirely out of Adam. In the same way, the new man is a part of Christ and was taken from Christ. Then in Ephesians 3 we realize the unsearchable riches of Christ, and Christ makes His home in our hearts (vv. 8, 17). In chapter 4 we grow and arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. We are no more carried away by every wind of teaching, even good teaching, but we grow up into Christ in all things (vv. 13-15). We receive something from Christ as the Head, and we minister it to others. In this way the church is built up (v. 16).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY FOR THE CHURCH TO BE BUILT UP IN LIFE</h2>
<p>We need to spend more time to see how the church is built up. Like many young Christians, I was hungry for scriptural knowledge after I was saved. I met a certain group of believers who stressed that in order to be good Christians we must know the Bible. Therefore, I spent much time to know the Bible. Later, about six or seven years after I was saved, there was a &ldquo;spiritual grace&rdquo; movement in north China, which was a branch of the Pentecostal movement. It was very prevailing, and in only a few years it swept over the whole of north China. Thousands of people were saved, and there were many miracles and signs. To a certain degree I was influenced by that movement, so I studied the situation. Eventually I was made clear by the Lord that the Body of Christ could not be built up in that movement. At that time I was not clear about the central content of Ephesians, but through my experiences the Lord showed me that the church can be built up only by our experience of Christ as life, not by knowledge, gifts, or the so-called Pentecostal manifestations. Knowledge and gifts help a little, but the church, the Body of Christ, cannot be built up by these alone. The church must be built up by Christ as our life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Key to the Building Up of the Church<br />
Being the Inner Experience of Christ as Our Life</h2>
<p>Some may argue for the gifts, saying that they are mentioned in 1 Corinthians. However, out of all the sixty-six books of the Bible, the main book on the church is Ephesians. In this book on the church the gifts are not mentioned. Rather, it speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ. This Christ with His unsearchable riches wants to make His home in our hearts. This is what we need. In the Bible there is some ground for knowledge, gifts, miracles, signs, and power. However, these are not the main items needed to build up the Body of Christ. The main item needed for the building up is Christ Himself as life to us. We admit that there is a certain need for knowledge and gifts, but too many Christians do not admit the need for the inner experience of Christ. We admit that sometimes we need medicine, but too many do not acknowledge that we mainly need regular food.</p>
<p>Since we have become Christians, we may have heard very few messages about the inner experience of Christ. In the book of Ephesians, however, the experience of Christ is very prominent. Every chapter deals with this matter. Although some Christians realize that Ephesians is about the church, many still neglect the key to the building up of the church. The key is the inner experience of Christ. Without the inner experience of Christ we can never have the reality of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Central Portion of the Book of Ephesians</h2>
<p>The book of Ephesians is the very heart of the Bible. The heart is the most crucial part. People today fear a heart attack more than anything. We may be able to move, speak, and do many things, but if our heart stops, we are finished. Since Ephesians is the heart of the Scriptures, the enemy, Satan, attacks people&rsquo;s understanding of this book. People today talk about this book, and many realize that this is the most profound book on the church, but they neglect the secret, the key point, of this book. The heart and key of this book is 3:16-19.</p>
