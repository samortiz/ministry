   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Moreover, when we incline our heart toward a certain person, it is very difficult for us to keep our heart calm.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Rather, we are under the influence of our emotions, trying ardently to please this person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At this time, we probably have less of an interest in drawing near to God than we do of drawing near to the loved one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our interest in spiritual things, things relating to the intuition, will be greatly reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perhaps there is no outward change, but our heart lingers beside the one we love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this kind of condition, our interest in spiritual things, if not completely gone, is greatly diminished.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then we will not be able to keep our heart from loving the vanities of the world because we can please our loved ones with them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Worldly things, beauty, glory, and many other things unworthy of mention will gradually become the object of our seeking so that we might please our loved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God and His requirements will then be forgotten and ignored.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should realize that we can love only one person and serve one master.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we love man, we cannot love God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, any secret relationship that we may have with a person must be severed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only God can satisfy a believer's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Human beings cannot satisfy the believer's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many believers fail simply because they seek in man that which can only be found in God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Human love is nothing but vanity; only God's love can satisfy the desires of a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If he seeks affection outside of God, his spiritual condition will immediately deteriorate.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He can only live by God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In view of this, do we not need to love anyone?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we look at the Bible's repeated charge to love our brothers and our enemies, we know it is not God's intention that we not love others; rather, He wants to direct our love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He wants us to love others not for ourselves, but for Him and also in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our natural goodness and wickedness have no place here.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Natural affection also loses its power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God wants us to be directed by Him because we love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When He wants us to love a certain person, we can obey; when He wants us to terminate our relationship with a certain person, we can also obey.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the life of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only when we have the Holy Spirit deeply applying the work of the cross in us and causing us to experience the putting to death of the soul-life can we lose the self in our affections.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we have really passed through death, we will not be attached to anyone; we will be guided only by God's commands.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When our soul-life goes through this step, it loses its power as if it has died in the matter of affection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then God can instruct us on how to begin anew to love others in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God wants us to have new relationships in Him with those whom we loved in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every natural relationship should be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should pass through death so that we may begin the relationships anew in the realm of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What a difficult life this seems to be to the believer!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only those who really live this way know what a blessing this is!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God often "strips" the believer of his loved ones because of the believer's consecration or for the benefit of the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God will either work to make our heart submissive, or He will strip us of what we love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When He uses the latter method, He causes our loved ones to change in their love toward us, or He causes the environment to hinder us from loving them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Perhaps our loved one has gone on a far journey, perhaps he has deceased, or perhaps there are other circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If our consecrated heart is honest before God, God will strip us of everything until we have only Him left.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the believer wants to obtain a real spiritual living, he must willingly abandon all that is dear to him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God requires anything that conflicts with a heart that loves Him to be abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The spiritual life does not allow our affection to be scattered and wandering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In God's eyes, our love, whether wrong in its motive, excessiveness, or goal, is just as wrong as our hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the sight of God, the love that comes out of our self is just as dirty as hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When a believer goes through such a time, he will see how pure his heart is in loving others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is nothing of the self mixed in it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All of his heart is for God and also in God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although he loved others in the past, he loved himself even more, considering himself more important than others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now he can share in other's happiness and sorrow, bearing their burdens and serving them with love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He will not love what he loves but what God wants him to love.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He will not love himself more than others but others as himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since he loves himself in God and for God, he also loves others in God and for God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, he can love others as himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Believers should know that letting God direct their affection is an essential prerequisite to their spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How uncontrollable our affection is!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If it is not subdued under God's purpose, there is a possibility of endangering our spiritual life at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is easy to correct wrong thinking, but it is hard to handle wrong affection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should love the Lord with all our heart, allowing Him to direct our love.</S>
