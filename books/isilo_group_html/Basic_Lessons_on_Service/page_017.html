Stanzas 2 and 3 say:</P><ol class="decimal" start="2"><li>How deep the holy joy that fills that scene,<br>Where love is known!<br>Thy love, our God and Father, now is seen,<br>In Him alone;<br>As, in the holy calm of Thine own rest,<br>He leads the praise of those Thy love has blessed.<br><br></li><li>He leads the praise! How precious to Thine ear<br>The song He sings!<br>How precious, too, to Thee &#151;how near, how dear<br>Are those He brings<br>To share His place: 'twas thus that Thou didst plan;<br>Thou lovedst Him before the world began.</li></ol><P>This hymn is simple and short, yet high in its thought and full of light. It would be good to ask the saints to read these stanzas so that they can be impressed with the significance of worshipping the Father.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Warning</H2><P>Related to our partaking of the Lord's table, there is also a warning in the Scriptures.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Proving Ourselves and Discerning the Body</H2><P>We have to prove ourselves and discern the Body at the Lord's table (1 Cor. 11:28-29). We have to discern whether the bread on the table signifies the unique Body of Christ or a sect, a division, a denomination. This is why we can take the Lord's table only in the local churches. We cannot partake of the so-called communion in other places because that bread on the table does not signify the Body but a division. Whenever we go to a place to attend the Lord's table, we must prove to ourselves that the bread on the table really signifies the Lord's Body, without any division.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Basic Lessons on Service &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
