We should obey God, and we should obey those whom He has chosen. God needs a group of people who will submit to deputy authority. God desires to see men who will be sensitive to His authority as soon as it is manifested. Such ones are obedient and submissive, and they uphold God's authority. They look for authority everywhere they go, and they submit to this authority. They are neither rebellious nor defiant. Once God finds such men, He has a testimony. His urgent need today is to find expressions of authority as well as testimonies of submission. When God's authority and man's submission meet, we have a testimony that is after God's heart. What a glory it will be if we have three or five brothers and sisters who know authority and submission. Today we hear noise and words everywhere, and we find confusion, friction, and defiance everywhere. What a difference it would make if we had a group of brothers and sisters who realized God's authority and who submitted to this authority! This would bring men face to face with something real. If a place has a testimony of submission, it will find a greater and greater expression of God's authority. The degree of the manifestation of authority depends on the amount of submission. The more manifest the submission, the more expression of authority there is, and the greater the revelation of God there is. If we are this way, even a casual onlooker will know that the local church is different. They will say that God is here. This is the way of our testimony. When a family has a head and there is authority and submission in the family, others will find order in it. No matter where we go, we have to see authority.</p><p>The whole world is in rebellion today. Rebellion lies in man's very nature. When a man acts according to his own nature, he rebels. Today everyone likes to say that this is the age of democracy, and that he is the master of himself. The flesh loves to be in defiance! It loves to go along with its own nature and rebel! Yet a man who has seen God's authority will smell rebellion as soon as it is around. God is high on the throne. He is the God above the heavens. His authority must be honored. How can we uplift ourselves and crave to be our own masters? How can we crave to be equal with God? We have to confess our sins before God, and we have to admit that we are lawless and rebellious men. Since we were saved, how often have we tried to rebel, to turn back, to refuse coordination, to act independently, and to be insubordinate and stubborn? We have to confess these sins.</p><p>If the church cannot get through in the matter of authority, it cannot take up any work or service. I have to shout and repeat a thousand times, even ten thousand times, that we need the testimony of submission in the church. Every time a preacher of the Word preaches, and every time a minister speaks for God, he has to be inwardly sensitive. If you are speaking about submission, and some in the audience are opposing, rebelling, or setting themselves up against you, you will not be able to say any strong words. Your spirit will shrink back. You will not be able to speak with ease and freedom. I have spoken on wives submitting to husbands, servants submitting to masters, and children submitting to parents many times. I do not remember once when I did not encounter any resistance. If a man has not touched God's authority, something in him will be hard as soon as you touch him. The testimony of Jesus has nothing to do with doctrines or teachings. God must have a group of people who are not only holy, righteous, and loving, but who are able to give others the impression that they have a spirit of submission, that is, that they submit to authority. Our testimony is not a lucid exposition of the truth. Genuine testimony is the operation of the spirit of submission among us. If this situation is found among us, God's authority will reign in the church, and God will have a free way to go on. What a beautiful picture it will be when all the brothers and sisters seek submission wherever they go, when the whole church has its head covered, when no one has any personal opinion, loose tongue, or presumptuous thought, and when obedience is manifested on all sides! This should be our testimony. If we build up everything except this one thing, our service will be useless.</p><p>In today's world and in the church, there are many language interpreters. They interpret and communicate. An interpreter translates words that you do not understand into words that you do understand. If the matter of authority is not effectively communicated to you today, your stay on the mountain will be nothing but a torture to your very life. From now on you have to look for authority wherever you go. To look for authority means that you do not try to be the master, head, or lord of your house. If such a submission is manifested in the church today, what an unprecedented highway it will give to the Lord! When others see this, they will bow down and worship the Lord. We can find brotherly love in many places, but we hardly can find submission. It is the most beautiful thing to find brotherly love among the saints on the one hand and mutual submission on the other hand. Submission without brotherly love is Catholicism. Brotherly love without submission is Brethrenism, and if both brotherly love and submission are absent, we have Protestantism. In Christianity we find three different kinds of conditions, characterized by Catholicism, Brethrenism, and Protestantism. We should not belong to any one of them. We should not practice submission at the expense of brotherly love, nor should we practice brotherly love at the expense of submission. May the Lord have mercy on us so that our brotherly love will increase while our submission will not be lacking. We have to take a firm stand and submit to authority. This should be our testimony. It is something that is rare to find today.</p><p>Today a testimony of submission cannot be found anywhere in the world or in the universe. This is the reason God has ordained authority in the church. He expects to find His authority expressed through the church. For years we have experienced great confusion, rebellion, and insubordination. We have to confess our sins to the Lord. May the Lord be merciful to us. May we see the system of authority He has ordained in the church, and may we become a testimony of submission to authority.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> </body></html>
