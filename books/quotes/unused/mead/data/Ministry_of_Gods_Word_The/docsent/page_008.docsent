   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE PAUL S COURSE AND HIS MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have discussed already the nature of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s word contains many human elements, yet it nevertheless remains God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not corrupted by the human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word remains eternal, excellent, transcendent, divine, holy, and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have also seen that the ministry of the word consists of the release of this human-impregnated word through human faculties such as the memory, understanding, thoughts, heart, spirit, and utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the reason that it is so important for a minister of the word to be proper before God when he preaches the word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If his condition is not proper, God s word will be corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us consider Paul, who was very much used by the Lord in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We will see the ways he served as a minister of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>ONE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul said, I have finished the course 2 Tim 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word course in Greek refers to a journey.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul s course was based on an itinerary; it was marked in advance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God assigns a definite course for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This course is marked and calculated in advance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is marked not only as to its direction but also as to its distance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul obtained mercy from God and was able to run on his assigned course.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He finished his course at the proper moment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When it was time for his departure from the world, he said, I have finished the course.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I believe God placed this course before Paul on the day that he believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know that God begins His work on a person long before he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul said the same to the Galatians: But when it pleased God, who set me apart from my mother s womb and called me through His grace, to reveal His Son in me that I might announce Him as the gospel among the Gentiles, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood Gal 1:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the first part of this passage Paul said, God, who set me apart from my mother s womb and called me through His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This shows that Paul was set apart from his mother s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then he told us that he became a minister of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While he was yet in his mother s womb, God set him apart, and his course was assigned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When he was saved, he embarked on this course.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This shows that the preparation and initiation of a minister is determined by God when he is still in his mother s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every experience we had before we were saved was under God s sovereign arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God gives us our distinctive characters, our temperaments, our inclinations, and our virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God prepares all of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No one goes through any experience by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every experience is part of God s sovereign arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No person inherits a character trait by accident; everything is under God s sovereign hand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He made provisions long ago for our natural abilities and experiences, and He has prepared us for our future commission.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul was set apart from his mother s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His course was set long ago by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even his profession before his conversion was set by God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Peter was fishing when he was called.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His lifetime work involved bringing men to the Lord Matt 4:18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The keys to the kingdom of the heavens were given to him; he was the one who opened the door 16:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He opened the door at Pentecost, and he opened the door at the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should pay attention to the fact that it was the fisherman who brought in the men.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>John was also a fisherman.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But when he was called, he was not fishing; he was mending the nets 4:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Gospel of John was the last of the four Gospels to be written.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In his Gospel he unveiled the matter of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we only had the first three Gospels and if John had never mended what was lacking in these three, we would not know what eternal life is today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moreover, John s Epistles were written decades after Peter s and Paul s Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By that time the Gnostics had brought in their philosophies.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>John turned men back to the matter of the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He showed us the condition and expression of a man who is born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the early days of apostasy, we had a mender who mended the net with eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>John s Revelation is the last of the sixty-six books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Without this book, the Bible would not be complete; many things would not have a proper conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>John mended the net and completed the Bible with Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This shows us John s ministry the ministry of mending.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Let us turn back to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God had set a course for him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even his profession was foreordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He was a tentmaker; he was not a weaver.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He sewed and stitched with fabric, and he made dwellings fit for traveling.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>His ministry came after the work of the Lord Jesus and the work of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Paul s ministry stands between Peter s work and the work of the future kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The kingdom has not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the meantime, men are being saved and are building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Paul s ministry was in the principle of tentmaking; he put material together and built it into a habitable dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>His work was not to produce the fabric a kind of raw material.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>His work involved tents which serve as habitable dwellings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Paul s profession was something arranged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A minister of God s word is set apart from his mother s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For this reason, no one should act foolishly before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Everyone should understand God s sovereign arrangement in his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God s sovereign hand is behind everything his environment, his family, and his profession.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God has no intention to annul these human elements; He has no intention to remove them.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God does not want us to act unnaturally.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He does not want us to be pretentious or legal in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He wants us to be like simple children.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Yet at the same time, He wants to break our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Spirit of God can reconstitute all of our human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>At the same time, our very self not the human elements , which is made up of our natural shell, i.e., our natural life, together with our emotional and intellectual life, must be broken by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God has to break these things.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The outward man must be broken and torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But this does not mean that God will set aside the human elements completely.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The biggest problem is that we do not know at which point this work begins and where it ends.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We do not know how much of what we have in us is permitted to stay and how much is hated by God and in need of being broken.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>As soon as we function in our ministry, whoever has been taught by God will have an inner registration of a pure or a defiled service.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is not a simple pathway to take.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Everyone has to submit to God s discipline; everyone has to submit to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The cross has removed everything that God condemns and hates, and it has broken down everything that needs to be broken down.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>A man must learn submission; he has to tell the Lord, I have many problems within me.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I do not know how to deal with them all.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I ask for Your shining, for the killing of Your light.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Deal with me according to Your light.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Deal with me to such an extent that my human elements will not become a hindrance to Your work but a means to express Your work.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Paul s entire life, from beginning to end, was under God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>His salvation was a pattern to others 1 Tim 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>First, God s light subdued him; he fell before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This was a strong salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Immediately after he stood up, God s word came to him, and it never stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He wrote most of the Epistles of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>God was pleased to release His word continually through Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He was indeed a great minister under God s hand.</S>
