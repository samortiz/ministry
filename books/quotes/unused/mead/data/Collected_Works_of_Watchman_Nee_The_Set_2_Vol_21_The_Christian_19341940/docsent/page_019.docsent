   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The question today is not whether you have believed, but whether or not you have been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are not asking if you have received the Lord, but if others have seen this change in you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Believing involves a breakthrough in your spiritual life and passing from death unto life inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Being baptized involves a breakthrough in the physical realm and passing from death unto life outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Believing is to pass from death unto life before God, while being baptized is to pass from death unto life before men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Believing is to inwardly receive the eternal life, while being baptized is to outwardly announce to others that from now on, you have opened up yourself to showing others that you are a Christian, that you are hidden no more.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Prior to this, you were a hidden Nicodemus, but now you are telling others openly that you are saved and different from them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A baptized person is like a person who has entered the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The ultimate destination of our most loved ones is the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Marriage lasts until the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The grave is one's final destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When a man dies, his corpse can still be seen, but after he enters the grave, he is gone forever and never seen again.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Baptism means to be seen no more.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not a "See you tomorrow," but a "See you never again."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The water is a symbol of the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we enter the grave symbolized by the water, we are separated from the world; the world will acknowledge that we are delivered out of it, and that we no longer belong to it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why Acts indicates that saved persons are added to the church, because the local church is the outward gathering of all the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"The whole church" in Acts 15:22 means the gathering of all those who are called by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let me ask you once more.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What are you doing when you are baptized today?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You are telling others that from now on, your coming and going will not be the same as before; your view toward the world has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although you have taken the same way as others for many years, that relationship is over today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From now on, you stand in a different place; you have been delivered out of them, and are no longer among them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To believe is an inward deliverance, while to be baptized is an outward deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To believe is a deliverance in the spirit, while to be baptized is a deliverance in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To believe is to be delivered from the world morally, while to be baptized is to be delivered from the world in one's conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the salvation spoken of in Mark 16 and Romans 10.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must also remember that you are not the only one who is saved in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are many others who are also saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Most of the ones who are sitting here today are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are many saved people, and you are only one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the past, you were in the world; you helped the world, tried to improve the world, and exercised your strength to serve in the world community.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now you have been delivered from it, and you belong to another community.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As before, you have many companions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are the believers, and they are now joined to you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, you can no longer be an individual Christian and no longer act independently.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because you are joined to them, everything that you do represents your brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After we are baptized, we become one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Wherever you are, the church is there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If there is a place where someone should not go, yet he goes there, he damages the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are restricted in every way by the oneness, we will be preserved in our footsteps and avoid many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, we should remember that whenever we do anything, we should take the brothers with us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One Western brother once related a story.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A sister went to listen to a modernistic theologian's blasphemous preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When she came back from the meeting, she told an elderly brother that even though the teaching was wrong, his English was good.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The elderly brother said, "If you went, I was there also."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She said that it was impossible for him to have been there.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He said, "Indeed, I did not want to go, but you carried me along with you."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is very true.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all are related to one another as members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When one member goes somewhere, the other members go along with him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When you are baptized today, you are declaring to others that from now on you are separated from the world and are choosing to live with the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whatever you do now, all the other brothers are included in your actions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore brothers, please do not carry me to places where I do not want to go, and please do not do what I do not want to do.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This may be a difficult thing to practice at times.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But we must always wait to see if our brothers agree to our actions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I hope that all the brothers and sisters would know that being saved is not just going to heaven, but being different from the world and being separated from among them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May the Lord bless His word, and may we have a clear vision of it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>May we know that the border of our garments should be fringed with blue.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every one of us should be heavenly and belong to the Lord; all of our actions and walk should express this blueness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Brothers and sisters, baptism is just the beginning of this journey; there is much ahead of us!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>May we be encouraged to go on.</S>
