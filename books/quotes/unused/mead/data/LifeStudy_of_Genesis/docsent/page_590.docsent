   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I shall push you together to the ends of the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Remember, Genesis 49 is a prophetic record of the entire history of God's people, beginning with sinners and ending with the Christ who inherits all things and takes over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is not only fruitful, victorious, and blessed to the uttermost; He is also full of strength to push the peoples on earth according to His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For centuries, the Russians, inhabitants of a cold region, have been trying to spread to the south, to the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When they tried to reach the Persian Gulf, the British fought them back.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then they built the Siberian railroad to the Far East in order to reach the sea, and after that they constructed the Manchurian railroad to the Pacific.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The hidden intention of the Russians is to take over the good land, including Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But eventually Christ, the strong ox, will come with two horns and push the Russians back to the northern region.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He may say, "Russians, your destiny is to live in a cold region.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not try to come down to the Mediterranean Sea, which is reserved eternally for My people."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This strong ox will push back the Russians and other peoples to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you think I am speaking nonsense, I ask you to wait and see.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sooner or later, this will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The crucial center of international relations today is the Middle East, and many nations want to spread into that region.</S>
