   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are like a small transistor radio.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Within, there is a receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without this receiver, the radio would be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The receiver must function properly, and it must be tuned in to the right station.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then it can transmit the radio waves to us as music.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some young people walk along the street with their radio next to their ear, listening to music which may be coming from far away.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Are they only imagining they hear music?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Can real music really be coming out of the air?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are really hearing real music, because their receiver is tuned in to the radio waves in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our receiver is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If it is functioning properly and is tuned in to the right station, we can receive the heavenly waves!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without a spirit we are as useless as a radio without a receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In God's eyes, the spirit is as great as the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are ranked together in Zechariah 12:1, where the Lord is described as the One who "stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man is the highest of all the created beings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because of his spirit, he is as important as the heavens and as the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do you think the heavens are more important than your spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many religions stress the heavens as man's ultimate destination.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God, however, is not all that satisfied with the heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Isaiah 66 He describes the heavens as His throne and the earth as His footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then He goes on to ask, "Where is the place of my rest?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the Lord: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's resting place is not in heaven, but in the spirit of the one who is poor and contrite.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may want to go to heaven, but God wants to enter into your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The most heaven can be is God's throne.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It cannot be His resting place.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The heavens exist for the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without the rain, sunshine, and air of heaven the things on earth could not survive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we know from space exploration, there is no air on the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is a lifeless, desolate place, where not even germs can exist!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The earth, in contrast, is full of life because of the supply from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The meat we eat is available because the heavens sustain the life of the cattle, sheep, and chickens.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The vegetables and grains that supply us with nourishment also owe their existence to the water, sunlight, and air from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Heaven sustains the earth that it may, in turn, sustain man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Plants, animals, water, air, and sunshine are all for the purpose of providing for man's need.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What makes man so important that he is the focal point of the creation of the heavens and the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is that man has a spirit created by God so that God could become one with him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has no interest in becoming one with cows!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The angels are not for this either.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only man has a vessel within which can receive and contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you think about this in a scientific, scholarly way, you will tell me it is superstitious to talk of a God who cannot be seen or touched.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Where is He, you will want to know.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let me say, the question is not whether God exists; it is whether the receiver in you is functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You cannot know God if your receiver is out of order, anymore than you can hear the music that is in the air if your radio receiver is not working.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more you use your mind to analyze God, the farther away He seems to be.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Turn away from your mind, and take care of your conscience, which is part of your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you give heed to your conscience, you will repent and confess your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the way to adjust your receiver and let in the heavenly music!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Your spirit will touch God, and He will come in.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Formerly our spirit was without life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When God comes in, our spirit becomes alive and has another life added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He as the Spirit mingles with our spirit, and the two spirits become one.</S>
