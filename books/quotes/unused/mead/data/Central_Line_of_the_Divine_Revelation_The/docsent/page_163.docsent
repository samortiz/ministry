   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. To Dispense the Lord's Divine Element</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in His Resurrection Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>into His Believers' Inward Element</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The transformation of the renewed believers is by the dispensing of the Lord's divine element in His resurrection life into His believers' inward element.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do have a natural element, and this natural element is not altogether evil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because Christ's redemption has dealt with the evil element, our natural element is a redeemed element.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Into such a redeemed element the divine element is now being dispensed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the divine element is added into our redeemed and uplifted natural element, we are sanctified and renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The result is that we are metabolically transformed, and the image of the resurrected Lord in the glory of His divine life is formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christians are not a group of working people but a group of eating and enjoying people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We Christians need to learn to keep ourselves away from work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should stay away from the "office," the place of work, and come back "home" to eat and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The teaching in today's Christianity produces a group of working people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Husbands are taught to love their wives, and wives are taught to submit to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is possible to pick up hundreds of commandments in both the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Nee once said that any teaching that helps us to work is wrong, but any teaching that ushers us into Christ for enjoyment is right.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not need to work for transformation, but we need to behold and reflect the glory of the Lord in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then some element from Him will be dispensed into us and be absorbed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He dispenses, and we absorb Him, the very processed and consummated Triune God, as the life-giving, compound, indwelling Spirit into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then, we praise Him with hallelujahs all the day long.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we praise our Lord all day long, we will be blessed; we will be an enjoying people.</S>
