   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE STARTING POINT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN KNOWING GOD'S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ABSOLUTE CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the subject of knowing God's will, Paul said that we should not be foolish, but should understand what the will of the Lord is Eph 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is a starting point in knowing God's will, and there is a continuation in knowing His will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If one does not have a proper start, he cannot know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But even if one has a proper start, he still cannot know God's will if he does not have a proper continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Was there one day in your life when you consecrated yourself absolutely to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not mean consecrating yourself to Him to be a preacher, but consecrating yourself to Him to do His will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You do not have to be concerned for what God's will is; you only have to consecrate yourself honestly to Him to do His will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You must realize that you should have a direct relationship to God's will; this relationship should not be affected by the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the Lord wants me to go to the east, I will go to the east.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I will not be affected by any person, event, or thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, my eyes will not be set on the east, but on God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The danger of God's workers today is the danger of making their work the center.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot build up any intimate relationship with the work, people, or any event.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must be directly related to God and set our eyes on Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The seven Spirits in Revelation are sent forth into all the earth, but they do not have anything to do with the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The seven Spirits are before the throne of God 1:4; 5:6 and are related to God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must consecrate ourselves fully to God at least once, for the carrying out of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the starting point in our knowledge of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without this starting point, we can never understand God's will properly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE CONTINUATION</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>IN KNOWING GOD'S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>DEALING WITH ALL HINDRANCES</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>An absolute consecration is the starting point of knowing God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if you want to advance in His will, you must deal with all the hindrances.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you have any stubbornness, jealousy, pride, or petty problems of a similar nature, you will be spiritually sick and unable to know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you want to stop your ear from hearing anything, there is no need to plug it with a rod or a desk; all you need is a little finger.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The same principle applies in knowing God's will a little hindrance will stop us from knowing His will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once I was taking a walk with Miss Barber in a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After some time the two of us became tired, and we sat down on some chairs under a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She said, "There is a bright star in the sky, but I cannot see it because a leaf has blocked the view.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brother Nee, if someone comes and tells me many ways to see the star, I still could not see it even though the ways he said were good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The reason is that my position is wrong; I am standing on the wrong ground."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The words she said that night are still fresh in my mind today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She explained that a little leaf could block the light of a big star.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many times, God's will is frustrated by very small things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When you seek after God's will again and again and are still unclear, you should not change the method, but change the person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you find that you cannot know God's will, it means that there is some blockage between you and God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It may be that God has spoken to you already, but that you are unwilling to obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You have to remove these hindrances.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After you have dealt with these problems thoroughly, you will know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In knowing God's will, we have to pay attention to the person rather than the methods.</S>
