   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ENTERING IN, THE APPLIER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Father is the source, the initiator, the Son is the expression, the accomplisher, and the Spirit is the entering in, the applier John 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Father sent the Son John 8:29 , and the Son came with the Father John 16:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Son sent the Spirit John 16:7 , and the Spirit came from with the Father John 15:26 in the name of the Son John 14:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By this you can see that the Father by Himself cannot reach us, nor can the Son by Himself enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Father is unapproachable 1 Tim 6:16 , but the Son came to tabernacle among us John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But still He was not able to enter into us because He was blood and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a man with a physical body He was able to be among His disciples, but not within them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So He told His disciples that He had to die and to be raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By His death and resurrection His form was changed from a physical form into a spiritual form.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He became the pneumatic Christ who was able to enter into His disciples John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the reaching of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Triune God reaches His redeemed people, He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, with electricity there is both the power plant and the installation in your house.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just to have the power plant is not practical.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is only when the power is installed into your house that the electricity becomes practical in your daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You are a building and God is the source, the power plant, in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Spirit, the reaching of the Triune God, has been installed into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Spirit enters into your being, He does not leave the Father and the Son far away in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That is a wrong concept.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Spirit comes into you, He comes with both the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you have the Spirit, you have the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you have the Son, you also have the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You have all Three.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Father you taste love, in the Son you enjoy grace, and in the Spirit you participate in the communion, the fellowship, the flow, of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Love is the source, grace is the enjoyment, and the Spirit is the communion 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the dispensing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I was young I taught people that to be a Christian is, first of all, to fear God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You must have a holy fear toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second, you must love the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Third, you must endeavor to improve yourself to be good a good husband, a good wife, a good child, a good father, a good mother, a good neighbor, a good student, etc. But now I want to tell you that a Christian is one who lives a life of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is not one who lives a life of good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A Christian is one who lives a life of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today the very reaching of this Triune God into you is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the Spirit comes, He comes in the Son s name, and He comes with the Son and with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>So when you have this reaching Spirit, you have the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And when the Son comes to you, He comes in the name of the Father, and He comes with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When you have the Son, you have the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now you have all Three living in you as one to be your life, your life supply, your everything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As a Christian you don t need to take care of good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Forget about that!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You have to thoroughly and absolutely take care of the Triune God within you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is so real.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When you call Lord Jesus, don t you have a deep sensation of comfort, of light, of happiness, of peace, of consolation, of so many pleasant feelings?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you were to call on Abraham Lincoln or George Washington, nothing happens.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when you call Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I love You! you have the deep sensation that He loves you also and that He is living in you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not a superstition; this is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Spirit is the reality of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When this reaching Spirit is in you, the entire God is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A bonafide Christian is simply one who lives a life of this reality, a life of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To live a life of the Triune God simply means to be one with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As He moves, you move.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As He speaks, you speak.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As He stays, you stay.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not a matter of ethics or of trying to overcome sin and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You just need to take care of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You just live a life of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you live such a life, the world will be judged, the Devil will flee, and all sinful things will be overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Triune God becomes your life, your living, your victory, your holiness, your righteousness, your love, your life, and your light.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is a bonafide Christian with the divine ethics, much higher than the human.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You need to live a life of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Spirit is the entering in and the applier of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our God is not only the source and not only the expression, but also the entering in. He has entered into our being.</S>
