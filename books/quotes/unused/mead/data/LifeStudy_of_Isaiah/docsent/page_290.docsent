   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to His Believers</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's sure mercies are the resurrected Christ who did not see the corruption of death and became the base of God's justification to His believers.</S>

   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to study these six verses again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Otherwise, we will not be able to enter into a proper understanding of them.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Based upon such a justification in Christ's resurrection, we are enjoying Christ as the mercies which sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not forget that the resurrected Christ today is the sure mercies of God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He has become the base of our justification, and upon this justification something is built up, that is, sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, sanctification is something built with and by the sure mercies of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These sure mercies are Christ.</S>
