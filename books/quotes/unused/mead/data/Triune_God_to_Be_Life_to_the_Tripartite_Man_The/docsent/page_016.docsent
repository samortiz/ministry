   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Through the Resurrection of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Peter 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the writings of the Apostle Peter, there are many hidden riches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1:3, Peter said that we were regenerated through the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But in verse 23 of the same chapter, Peter said that we were regenerated through the living word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It seems that there are two ways to be regenerated: through the resurrection of Christ and through the living word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although they seem to be two different ways, they are actually one way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ's resurrection is conveyed in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The living word that regenerates us is the word that conveys the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The resurrection of Christ is a fact revealed in verse 3.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through the wonderful fact of Christ's resurrection, we all were regenerated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We were regenerated by God through the resurrection of Christ; but how do we know the fact of Christ's resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We know it through the living word of God, through the word of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the preaching of the gospel, the main thing we must tell people is that Christ today is resurrected and that He is the Savior in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The resurrection of Christ is the fact, and the living word of God is the description of that fact.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These two things are actually one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without the resurrection of Christ, the gospel has no content.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But without the preaching of the gospel, the speaking of the living word that conveys the resurrection of Christ, no one would know about this resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, we must go out to reach people, to speak to people, to tell them of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more we preach, the more people will be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Making the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>the Children of God the Sons of God</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Regeneration makes the believers the children of God and the sons of God John 1:12; Heb 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Life by itself, without the action of regeneration, does not make us a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Life must pass through the action of regeneration in order to make us a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Regeneration by the divine life makes us a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, we become children of God; then we become sons of God Heb 2:10 .</S>
