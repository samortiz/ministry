   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE VISION OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY Scripture Reading: Matt 16:15-18; Eph 5:32; Phil 3:10a; Rev 1:10-13a</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapter we saw that the young people need to purpose in their heart not to be defiled by the things of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They need to flee youthful lusts and pursue Christ with their companions, "those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart" 2 Tim 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter we shall see what the Lord's recovery is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord's recovery is the recovery of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although these terms may be familiar to us, I would still encourage the young people to spend much time with their companions in groups of five to thoroughly research the truths concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Matthew 16 the Lord revealed Himself and the church to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verses 15 through 18a say, "He says to them, But you, who do you say that I am?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And Jesus answered and said to him I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord's recovery is not a recovery of doctrines such as footwashing, head covering, proper baptisms, or the bread and wine at the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is a recovery of "the Christ" and "the church."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The term recovery implies that something has been lost.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If something has not been lost, there is no need of a recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The proper revelation of the Christ and the church has been lost.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many in Christianity do not have a proper understanding of who Christ is and of what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many only know and appreciate the Jesus who is their Savior, saving them from hell to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE RECOVERY OF CHRIST The Christ</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Matthew 16:16 speaks of "the Christ, the Son of the living God."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to this verse, Christ has two main aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first is His person and the second is His work, ministry, or commission.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, He has two main titles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Christ is His title according to His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is the anglicized form of the Greek Christos, meaning the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Daniel 9:26 says, "And after the threescore and two weeks shall the anointed one be cut off" ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"The anointed one" is a translation of the Hebrew word for Messiah, the equivalent of the Greek Christos.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In God's administration, whenever God commissions someone to fulfill His purpose, He anoints that one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When God established priests, kings, and prophets, they were anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Samuel anointed David to be king 1 Sam 16:13 , and Moses anointed Aaron and his sons to be the priests Lev 8:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To be anointed is to be charged with a certain commission.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In today's terms, to be anointed is to be appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God appoints one to fulfill His commission by anointing him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In typology the anointing oil or ointment signifies God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God anoints people with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Jesus was baptized and came out of the water, the Holy Spirit came upon Him Matt 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Holy Spirit was the ointment, and the Spirit's coming upon Him was the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, in Luke 4:18 Jesus said, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the day of Pentecost before the one hundred twenty proclaimed the gospel for the fulfillment of God's commission, God poured out His ointment, His Spirit, upon them Acts 2:1-4, 14-18 , and they were all anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ means the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has anointed His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This anointing was accomplished both in eternity past before the foundation of the world and in time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In eternity past God anointed and commissioned His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God the Father was the Author, the Source, the Planner, the One who made a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God's purpose which He made in eternity past for eternity future, His eternal purpose, was to have a church to express the Triune God in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When God made this purpose, He anointed His Son, charging Him with the commission to fulfill His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is indicated by His title, the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the beginning of time, the Son of God as God's anointed One, the Christ, came to create.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Son of God accomplished the creation because as God's anointed He was charged by God to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>John 1:1 and 3 say, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For the fulfillment of His purpose, God needs a universe with a heaven and an earth with 80 many items, especially man as a vessel to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ came as God's anointed One to call the things not being into being.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Creation was the first item in God's commission which He gave to His anointed One.</S>
