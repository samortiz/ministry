Once again we would emphasize the fact that the Lord&#8217;s crucifixion signifies that sin, the world, Satan, and the old creation have all been dealt with. All this is signified by the crucified Jesus. However, the way not only includes the crucified Jesus, but also includes the resurrected Christ with His redemption.<h2 class=head2>Access in the Spirit unto the Father</h2><p>Ephesians 2:18 says, &#8220;Through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.&#8221; This verse indicates that through Christ as the way we have access in the Spirit unto the Father. When we call, &#8220;O Lord Jesus,&#8221; we have the sense that we are in the presence of God and that God is within us. Today the Triune God is the life-giving Spirit. Actually, this life-giving Spirit is the access for us to touch God and enter into Him.<h2 class=head2>A New and Living Way</h2><p>According to Hebrews 10:20, the Lord Jesus as our way into the Father is a new and living way: &#8220;By a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE REALITY</h2><p>In 14:6 the Lord also says that He is the reality. Apart from the Triune God, the entire universe is vanity, having no content, no reality. The Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-is the reality. Actually, the way is God Himself, and this way is the reality. If we were to call on a name other than that of the Lord Jesus, we would not have a way into God, because all other names are void of reality. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are immediately on the way into God because the Lord is the embodiment of the Triune God. Therefore, when we call on the name of Jesus, we receive something real into us.<p>What is the reality we receive by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus? This reality is the being and the doing of the Triune God. First, this reality is the incarnated God (John 1:1, 14). This reality is also the Son (John 8:32, 36) and the Spirit (John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 5:7). Hence, the reality is the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Furthermore, this reality includes what the Triune God has done. This is the gospel (Eph. 1:13). The reality, therefore, is the very being of the Triune God and what He has done.<p>In the universe only what God is and what God does is real. This means that the reality in the universe is God&#8217;s being and God&#8217;s doing. God&#8217;s being is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and His doing is redemption. In the gospel He is everything and has done everything necessary for us to contact Him. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we receive this universal reality.<p>The reality is actually the way, and the way is the destination. When we get on the way, we reach the destination. This means that when we receive Jesus, we have the Father. When we receive the Son as the way, we have the Father as the destination. Because the Son is the embodiment of the Father, when we call on the name of the Lord we have both the Son and the Father. This is the reality becoming the way. This is the Son with what He has done becoming our way to the Father. How can we get on this way? Simply by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. When we call on the Lord&#8217;s name, we are on the way, and we have the Father.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_147.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_149.html">Next</a> </body></html>
