   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Process 2:21-24</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we need to consider the process.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What did God do in order to produce a complement for Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1 To Become a Man Adam Created</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One day God became a man John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This man was born of a virgin in the town of Bethlehem and was named Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God becoming man was typified by the creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before creation there was no man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By God's sovereign creation a man suddenly came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Likewise, before the birth of Jesus in the manger at Bethlehem, God was only God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, through the incarnation God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This man was the real Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Adam in Genesis 2 was a photograph Rom 5:14 ; with the birth of Christ in the flesh, the real Adam came.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the Bible, Adam in the garden is called the first Adam, and the Lord Jesus as the real Adam is called the last Adam 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the last One He is the real One.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>2 To Pass Through Death Adam Sleeping</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One day the real Adam was put to sleep on the cross where He slept for six hours, from nine o'clock in the morning until three o'clock in the afternoon Mark 15:25, 33 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was signified by the phrase in Genesis 2 which said that "God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam" and that "He took one of his ribs" to build him a wife Gen 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That sleep of Adam's was a type of Christ's death on the cross for producing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the life-releasing, life-imparting, life-propagating, life-multiplying, and life-reproducing death of Christ, which is signified by a grain of wheat falling into the ground to die and to grow up in order to produce many grains John 12:24 for the making of the loaf which is the Body, the church 1 Cor 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By producing the church in this way God in Christ has been wrought into man as life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Firstly, God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then this man with the divine life and nature, was multiplied through death and resurrection into many believers who become the many members to compose the real Eve to match Him and to complement Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is through this process that God in Christ has been wrought into man with His life and nature that man in life and nature can be the same as He is in order to match Him as His complement.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>3 To Flow Out His Life Adam's Rib Taken Out</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the end of Christ's crucifixion, the Jews, who did not want the bodies of the crucified criminals to remain upon the cross on the Sabbath day, asked Pilate to have their legs broken John 19:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the soldiers came to Jesus to break His legs, they found that He had died already and that there was no need for them to break His bones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This fulfilled the scripture which said, "A bone of Him shall not be broken" John 19:32-33, 36; Exo 12:46; Num 9:12; Psa 34:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, the soldiers pierced His side and blood and water came out John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The blood was for redemption Heb 9:22; 1 Pet 1:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What does the water signify?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Exodus 17:6 we find the type of the smitten rock 1 Cor 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the rock was smitten, it was cleft, and living water came forth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jesus on the cross was smitten with the rod of Moses, that is, by the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was cleft.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His side was pierced, and water came forth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This water was the flow of His divine life signifying the life which produces the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This life was typified by the rib, a piece of bone taken out of Adam's opened side, of which Eve was produced and built.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, the bone typifies the divine life that is signified by the water flowing out of Christ's side.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>None of His bones was broken.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This signifies that His divine life cannot be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His physical life was killed, but nothing could break His divine life which flows out to produce the church.</S>
