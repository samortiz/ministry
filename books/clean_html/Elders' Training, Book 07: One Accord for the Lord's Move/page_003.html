<h2 class="head1">TAKING CARE OF THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>The practice in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery beginning from October of 1984 and starting in Taiwan was something absolutely new. I do not like to see the dear saints from the United States going to Taiwan to see something and then coming back to the United States to merely imitate or copy it. This will not work and may even damage the situation because you probably are not so clear about the Lord&rsquo;s doing. Presently, I am somewhat unhappy about the practice of the home gatherings in the United States and Canada. This practice is a mere imitation and not something carried out by seeing the vision. If you have seen a vision and act according to it, this kind of practice is valuable and worthwhile. To merely copy someone else&rsquo;s doing means nothing. I would not say you should not practice the home gatherings, but I do not believe that to merely copy or imitate would help you. Instead, you will make yourself a lifeless robot. If you mean business with the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and if you mean business with His present day, up-to-date move, you must first take care of this one thing&mdash;one accord.</p>
<p>The four Gospels tell us how the Lord spent three and a half years to teach His disciples. Much of this teaching is recorded in the Gospels, yet the Lord said in John that He had many things to say to the disciples that they could not bear, but that He would die and resurrect and come back in another form as the Spirit of reality. As the Spirit of reality, He would not only remind the disciples of what He had spoken to them, but also go on to tell them something further (John 14:16-20, 25-26; 16:12-15). In the three and a half years of His earthly ministry the Lord passed on many teachings to the disciples. Then He went away through His death and came back within three days to stay with them as the life-giving Spirit. After breathing Himself into His disciples, He stayed with them for forty days to train them to experience His invisible presence. He then ascended to the heavens, leaving the disciples on this earth. What did the one hundred twenty do? They did nothing except to pray, and the key of their prayer was the one accord (Acts 1:14).</p>
<p>In Matthew 18:19 the Lord spoke concerning two or three agreeing on something in prayer. The word &ldquo;agree&rdquo; in this verse is not as strong as the word &ldquo;one accord.&rdquo; The word in Greek for one accord, <em>homothumadon,</em> is strong and all-inclusive. <em>Homo</em> means the same and <em>thumos</em> means mind, will, purpose (soul, heart). The Chinese version of the Bible translates this word into a Chinese word meaning the same mind and the same will. In Romans 15:6, the King James Version translates this word into &ldquo;one mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the book of Acts the one hundred twenty prayed together in one mind, in the same mind, in the same will with the same purpose around and within the soul and the heart. Whenever we pray, we surely should exercise our spirit, but we also should be in the same mind and the same will with the same purpose around and within our soul and heart. This means that our entire being is involved. After the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, the one hundred twenty became the kind of persons who were in one mind, in one will, with one purpose around their soul and heart. For them to be in one accord meant that their entire beings were one. No other book of the Bible uses the word for &ldquo;one accord&rdquo; as much as Acts.</p>
<p>In Acts the three main factors for the spreading of the gospel as an impact were prayer, the Spirit, and the Word. According to the Bible and according to history these three items are the only way for the gospel to be prevailing. I spent much time to consider whether it is not beyond the teaching of the Scriptures for the church to use a church meeting hall and church personnel to open a school rather than to use our time to contact people one on one with prayer, the Spirit, and the Word, using every inch of the meeting hall in this way for the gospel. I stressed in the past that to use other ways besides prayer, the Word, and the Spirit to promote the gospel are gimmicks.</p>
<p>The one accord is the key and the life pulse of prayer, the Spirit, and the Word. You may pray much, seek the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and acquire a lot of knowledge from the Word, yet if you are short of the one accord you cannot see the blessing. I saw people who were desperate in praying, in getting the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and in receiving the Word, yet they were dissenting among themselves. There was no one accord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MORALE AND THE IMPACT</h2>
<p>From January 1, 1940 to December 31, 1942 I stayed in Chefoo, my hometown in mainland China. During that time, the Lord brought all the saints there into the one accord and there was a real revival with the real impact. In Shanghai, in Taiwan, and in Elden Hall in Los Angeles, I also saw the effectiveness of the one accord.</p>
<p>In the army the impact is the morale. What is the morale in the army? The one accord. This is why no commander of any army would allow any soldier to bring in any different thought. The soldiers all think the same thing, speak the same thing, stand for the same thing, and live for the same thing. If anyone expresses anything different and is dissenting, he will be cut off in order to keep the morale. This kind of morale cannot be seen among today&rsquo;s Christians. I can testify, though, that in Chefoo from 1940 through 1942 the morale, the impact, was there. Even the outsiders in Chefoo realized this. Some told people not to go to our meeting hall because if they were to go, they would get caught. People were also told that if they wanted to be a Christian, the best place for them to go was our meeting hall. During those years we also performed the casting out of demons; even the demons told people not to go to our meeting hall. The impact was really there.</p>
<p>Recently in Taiwan over one hundred thirty full-timers under our training were sent out. I told them something which I never told people since I came out of mainland China&mdash;to cast out demons and heal the sick. We do not promote these things, but when the morale is in us, these things will be among us as an impact. In the Acts are three items&mdash;prayer, the Spirit, and the Word, with one key&mdash;the one accord. After Acts 15, however, this word for one accord is not used again in the book of Acts. This somewhat implies that even during this period of time described in Acts, the one accord was lost. Acts 15 describes a conference of the apostles and elders held in Jerusalem to settle the trouble concerning circumcision (vv. 1-33). At the end of Acts 15 there was a dissenting between Barnabas and Paul. After this incident, I believe that the one accord to some extent was lost.</p>
<p>The first Epistle in the New Testament is Romans. After Paul talked so much doctrinally concerning the Christian life and church life, he told the believers in Rome that they needed to be &ldquo;with one accord and with one mouth...&rdquo; (15:6). One accord includes one mind, one will, and one purpose in one soul and in one heart. Then outwardly you have one mouth. Those of us who were in Los Angeles from 1963 to 1973 can recall that we were with one accord and with one mouth. Whoever came to a meeting in those years could sense and realize the impact. Because there was no dissenting or different opinion, there was the impact. Beginning in 1973, however, ambition came into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery as a poison injected into the Body, and up until today the blood has never been purified.</p>
