   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING BY THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All of you who are saved, and especially who are in the Lord's recovery, must live according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You must not live according to anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You may wonder about living according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Usually your efforts to follow the Bible come from the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you want to know what your relationship to your wife should be, you read the Bible passages that deal with that subject.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You find out that you must love your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ephesians 5:25 says so.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then you purpose in yourself to love her.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have understood the Bible according to your mind and you now attempt to fulfill it by your will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What kind of living is this?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is the living of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not evil living, but nonetheless it is not according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Your intention is good.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before you were saved, you had little love for your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She had too much to say, was always criticizing how you did things, and kept checking up on your whereabouts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Or, your wife may have been overbearing in her love for you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She may have closely supervised everything you wore, carefully watched that you took your vitamin pills, and seen to it that you did not stay up too late.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During your honeymoon you could stand it, but afterwards it became unbearable.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You came to hate her and her nagging ways.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Your dislike of her was a matter of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now that you are saved, you read your Bible regularly and try hard to obey what it says.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, you are trying to love your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This love is in your soul, just as your hatred was in your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Dear brother, you must live according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you love your wife, it must be because you are living according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Your wife may keep on nagging you, but you continue to live according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By living in the spirit you will find that you are living in the heavens, because your spirit is linked to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The spirit is the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this place nothing can disturb you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This realm is unchanging, whatever the outward circumstances are.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you live in the soul, you will change with your circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the weather is sunny, you will be cheerful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the sky is overcast, you will be sad.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>LIVING BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How can we be those who live according to the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Slow Down!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For one thing, we must not act or react in haste.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even if we are about to lose our temper, we must slow down.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first time our wife provokes us, we may be able to exercise patience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By the third time, however, all our patience is gone, and we are ready to explode.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the point when we must tell Satan to hold off for a minute or two; we need that little extra time before we give vent to our anger.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In other areas of our living also, we must not act hastily.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This applies to our talking, to the look we give others, and to the opinion we express.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why is it important for us to slow down?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are used to living in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is natural for us to be there.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our parents and our education have encouraged us to live according to the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now that we are saved, the Lord wants us to be a people living according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have little hope of changing, however, unless we slow down these spontaneous reactions and ways of looking at things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are fast, the likelihood is that we are in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are slow, we give ourselves the opportunity to turn to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Use this little time you give yourself by slowing down, to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By praying, you enter into the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There you will have a different view of the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If your wife aggravates you, your soul is filled with dislike for her.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When you are viewing her from the spirit, however, you may praise the Lord for giving you such a desirable wife.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In all these human relationships, the view from the soul is one thing and the view from the spirit another.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When you are in the soul, you are in trouble and will offend the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you turn to your spirit, however, you will immediately be preserved and will enjoy the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When you go shopping, something may catch your eye and you may feel free to buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But if you will restrain your impulse and turn to your spirit, you may find after praying a little that the article has lost its appeal and that your intention to buy it is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It looked one way to the soul, but another way to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A brother may come to talk to you about a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As you are listening, you may feel negative about what he is saying.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Inwardly, however, you remind yourself to turn to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As you remain in your spirit praying, your view of what he is saying may completely change.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many times when you are in your soul, you want to do something or go somewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Once you turn to your spirit, however, the urge is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do you want to live according to the soul or according to the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is difficult to stay all the time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Before we realize it, we have slipped out.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Suppose a brother comes to fellowship with me.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>At first I am watchful to remain in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I listen in spirit, and what I say in reply comes from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We both are greatly enjoying the fellowship together.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then in a moment of joy I fall back into my soul; unconsciously I have slipped out of my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We easily slip into our soul because it is right next to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The soul is where our person is.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God has saved us and moved us to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Though we recognize this, we still like to live in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We are like a girl who is newly married.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>She loves her husband, but she still likes to go back to her old home.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>While she is at work, she secretly slips over to her mother's for a visit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Lord wants a people who live according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is not to say that He wants us to do the right thing and refrain from doing what is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we live by the soul, no matter what good thing we do, it counts for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God has set us in our spirit and is causing us more and more to live there.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We can do this first of all by not being in a hurry.</S>
