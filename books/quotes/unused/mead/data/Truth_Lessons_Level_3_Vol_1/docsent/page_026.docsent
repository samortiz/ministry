   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Melchisedec as a type of Christ as God s High Priest, we have Sarah and Hagar as types of the two covenants which God made with His chosen people concerning their inheriting of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are signified by Abraham s wife and his concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. SARAH SYMBOLIZING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE COVENANT OF GOD S PROMISE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The two women, Abraham s wife Sarah and his concubine Hagar, recorded in Genesis 21, symbolize two covenants Gal 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One is the covenant of promise given to Abraham, which is related to the new testament, the covenant of grace; the other is the covenant of law given to Moses, which has nothing to do with the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sarah, the free woman, symbolizes the covenant of promise, and Hagar, the maidservant, the covenant of law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. God s Promise Being Fulfilled</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>by God s Grace for Those Who Inherit the Promise</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Genesis 17:15-19 shows us that God definitely promised that Abraham would have a son, Isaac, and that this son would be born of his wife, Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s promise of a seed to Abraham was altogether worked out by God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Genesis 18:14 God said to Abraham, At the appointed time I will return to you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that Isaac s birth was a birth at the appointed time, at the time of life, according to God s promise.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was not by the natural energy of Abraham and Sarah; it was the issue of the visitation of God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God s promise is fulfilled by God s grace for those who inherit the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This grace is the very Christ Himself who brought with Him God s grace John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He supplies God s chosen people with all that He is to fulfill for them God s promise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>B. Not by the Energy of Man s Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s promise is not fulfilled by the energy of man s flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When God promised that Isaac would be born of Sarah, Abraham, being old and well stricken in age, considered his body as already dead, and Sarah s womb also was deadened Gen 18:11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was only after they became nothing and were void of strength that God came in to carry out His promise by His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This shows us that it is God who promises and it is also God who fulfills what He has promised.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man s flesh is of no use at all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Abraham brought forth a seed, Ishmael, by the endeavor of the human flesh, but Ishmael was rejected by God 17:18; 21:10 and could not fulfill God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Likewise, whatever we do, whether good or bad, by the strength and ability of our natural man cannot fulfill God s promise to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God desires that we only receive His grace and cooperate with Him and not do anything by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>C. Only Those Who Are Born of God s Promise,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Who Are Born according to the Spirit,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Being Able to Inherit</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God s Promised Good Land Christ</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Genesis 21:12 God said to Abraham, For in Isaac shall your seed be called.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Isaac was born of the free woman, Sarah, through promise.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that he was born through God s power in grace, which is implied in God s promise Gal 4:23 ; that is, he was born according to God s Spirit of life v. 29 . Only the children of promise were accounted as Abraham s seed Rom 9:8 , and only they could inherit the good land that God had promised to Abraham for the accomplishment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The good land, which is a type of the all-inclusive Christ, was given by God as an inheritance to His children of promise, in which and by which they might live to defeat God s enemy, to gain the kingdom for God, to build God s dwelling place, and to express God s glory.</S>
