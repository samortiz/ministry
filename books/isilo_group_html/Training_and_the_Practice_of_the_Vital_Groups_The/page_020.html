I have already released many messages concerning the God-ordained way with the vital groups, so I am now burdened to speak something that will help us be brought into the actual practice of the vital groups. We may have the terms God-ordained way and vital groups, but do we really walk in the way ordained by God? Are we really vital? We do not want mere terminology but the actual experience of being vital persons in the God-ordained way.<p>In these days I feel that we are short of prayer. When we come together, we should have the burden to pray much. If we had the spirit of prayer and the burden of prayer, nothing would be able to stop us. We should pray, &#8220;Lord, we hate these three enemies. We hate deadness, lukewarmness, and barrenness.&#8221; We may be in the recovery, but we are dead, lukewarm, and barren. I would like to hear us pray, &#8220;Lord, give me the burden to bear fruit. Give me the utterance and the boldness in speaking for You.&#8221; We need this kind of desperate prayer.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Training and the Practice of the Vital Groups &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
