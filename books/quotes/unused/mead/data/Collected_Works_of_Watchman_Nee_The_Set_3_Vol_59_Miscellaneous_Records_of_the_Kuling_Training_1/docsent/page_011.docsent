   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Easy for the Emotion to Be Touched</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and to Express Itself</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Second, the emotions of those who are broken in their outer man are subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is easy for their spirit to break out in weeping, and easy for it to break out in rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Emotions occupy a great part of a person's outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After the outer man is broken, the emotion becomes obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A man can weep and laugh without putting up much resistance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The distance between his spirit and the outside world becomes very short.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who find it difficult to express sentiments are unbroken.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When God created the universe, He exclaimed that everything was good even on the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is full of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some people, however, are like rocks when they hear others talk; they are void of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is because their emotion is not broken.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a result, they cannot use their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A person whose emotion is broken is easily touched by many things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He also can easily express himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His emotions express themselves instantly, quickly, congenially, and easily.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Mind Being Calm and Available</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Third, the mind of a broken person is subdued as well.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Originally, a man's mind is centered around himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the outer man is unbroken, the mind tends to revolve around itself, and the spirit cannot make use of it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Under normal circumstances, when the outer man is broken, the mind will facilitate the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The mind is merely an instrument; it should always remain calm and be under the spirit's control.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the spirit has a burden, the mind should find the words to discharge the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A broken man is always ready in his mind; his mind is always ready to cooperate with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When something happens to him, he does not turn to his mind, but to his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only after he has exercised his spirit will he use his mind to deal with the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His mind is a servant, an instrument, that has been made available to the spirit's employ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Easy for the Spirit to Be Released</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After the faculties in our soul the mind, emotion, and will are broken, we have a share in the work, and we have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A man who is dealt with by God has a proper word within and adequate thoughts without.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His various sentiments are expressed in a proper way, and he has a pliable yet strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When these things are in place, he has no trouble releasing his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the spirit within needs to be released, his outer man obeys.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He speaks when he needs to speak, laughs when he needs to laugh, weeps when he needs to weep, and makes decisions when he needs to make decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In whatever his inner man wants to do, his outer man cooperates.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way he becomes a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We fellowship with God with our spirit, and we also fellowship with the brothers and sisters with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is Spirit, and as Spirit, He is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Man also has a spirit, and he fellowships with God with his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A man can fellowship with God with his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, the shell outside his spirit, his outer man, can prevent him from loving God and communicating with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only those whose outer man is broken can release their spirit easily.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only they can fellowship with God and approach God in an intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A person whose outer man is broken is very approachable to men, but those whose outer man is not broken have a constant barrier between them and others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The greatest hindrance to our spirit's fellowship, both with God and with man, is the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do we not feel the resistance the outer man gives to us?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes we feel that it is hard to speak something to certain people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We know that something is wrong and that we should say something.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But we dare not say it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Perhaps there is resistance in the other party, but often the resistance is with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have a shell around us, and we cannot push our spirit out.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are too aloof.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We cannot approach men.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Perhaps others are waiting for us to say a word to them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Yet our spirit is clogged up; it cannot speak.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once our outer man is broken, we become approachable.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once the outer man is broken, all the barriers between us and others are removed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It becomes easy for us to reach the outside world, and it is easy to release the power within us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God's work is not in the principle of removing the "glove" but in the principle of breaking the "glove."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the way for the hand to come out and be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is how the cross deals with the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is also how the spirit becomes approachable to men.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is no shell with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the reason He is so approachable to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Once a man's outer shell is broken, he becomes very approachable to others, and the power within him comes out easily.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When spiritual power is released, the distance between men is shortened, and there is no need to go through many steps for the spirit to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Such a person is transparent; there is nothing in his outer man that resists his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only such a one is qualified to work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If a man is broken by God and his spirit is free to contact men, any subsequent resistance is not from him but from others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A broken man can release his spirit in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If he is smitten by God in a deep way, he can release his spirit quite readily.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He does not have to pray to release his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He can release it anywhere and at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the secret of God's ministry today.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is a ministry that basically issues from within.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It has nothing to do with man's work, but with God's own work within man.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The fundamental experience of a minister of the word is the breaking of his outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Spirit's operation can be seen every day, everywhere, and at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He is breaking our outer man continually.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God's life is powerful within us, but we must be broken before this power can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Spirit is working all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is foolish to look for discipline from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We only need to submit to it and to give ourselves to God's breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The outer man must be separated from the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Once the two are separated, the spirit can be released at will.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If our outer man is not broken and its growth is unchecked, great havoc will be done to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The wanton growth of the outer man is like the invasion of cancerous cells in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When a man cuts himself by accident, cells around the wound grow and quickly seal up the wound.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But if the cells continue to grow after the wound is healed, this inordinate growth becomes a cancerous growth.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Cancer occurs when some cells break away from the normal law of the body and grow independently.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>They become a center to themselves and refuse to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Such cells are completely out of control.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>There is no way to deal with them except to cut them off.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Under normal circumstances every cell in the body is defined and governed by definite laws of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Cancerous cells, however, differ from the rest of the body in that they have their own law.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Wherever cancer hides, cells grow in a way that is detrimental to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The whole body normally joins together to fight diseases, but with cancer, the whole body joins together to feed the illness and to help its growth and expansion.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The result is destruction to the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Our outer man is like a cancer cell; it has become a second center, a separate area of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Some people are cancerous in that the more we feed them with spiritual things, the more arrogant they become.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Some people are full of opinions; they can even be given the name of Opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Their entire being is an aggregate of opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Worse still, they are unwilling to subject themselves to dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>These ones become cancers in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The more spiritual experiences they have, the more they remain in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Cancer areas are centers of division.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Cancer cells absorb and expand to build up their own centers.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Our outer man is a cancer to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We must deal with it severely.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We have to remove it, cut it out, and reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We have to deal with the outer man like dealing with cancer.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The Separation of the Inner Man from the Outer Man</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>God destroys and breaks down our outer man in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>First, He deals with it by the rebukes from the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>When the Lord cursed the fig tree, it wilted.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>No matter how strong we are, as soon as the Lord takes hold of us in His mercy, He rebukes us through the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Such strong words will shatter our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This kind of ministry of the word is not an ordinary ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>It does not scratch us politely in insignificant areas; rather, it overpowers us.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>We hope that the church will have many such ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Second, He breaks down our outer man through the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>The expression the discipline of the Holy Spirit is our invention.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>It means the operation of the Holy Spirit through His ordering of our outward environment.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>The Holy Spirit works within us as well as in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>For example, Brother Chow has a big problem with his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>It is not easy to touch it unless our brother first puts himself under the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>If our brother hands himself over to God, God will work on him through the Holy Spirit and will put him to death through the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>The Holy Spirit will coordinate His inward operation with His outward discipline and bring him through.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>A person must pass through such experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>God will not let him go.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>There must be a fundamental breaking experience.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Then this experience should be followed by the Spirit's continual discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>This is how the stubborn outer man is defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>This work is seen all too rarely in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Every brother and sister has to be open to advice and exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>We have to ask God for grace to receive rebukes from others.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>If anyone is angry at a rebuke, we should ask him whether he is living on this earth for his own "face" or for God to have a way through him.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>The work of the Holy Spirit is like the work of the duck farmers in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Ducks like to roam freely, and the farmers have to goad them with a rod before they fall into line.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>The Lord has been disciplining some people in many ways for years, yet they are still turning around in circles.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>We should not be like dumb ducks.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>We have to take lessons from the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>After we learn our lessons, we will be able to deal with the brothers and sisters, and we will be able to preach the gospel and serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>When our outer man and inner man are separated, we will be able to keep outward things separate from the inner man; they will not be able to affect the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>We will be able to effectively convey the things in our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>We will have the ministry and the supply, and the power within us will be released.</S>
