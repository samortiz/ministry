   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Mustard Seed Growing Greater</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Than the Herbs and Becoming a Tree</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 32 says that after the mustard seed has grown, It is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church, which is the embodiment of the kingdom, should be like an herb to produce food, but it became a tree, a lodging place for birds, having its nature and function changed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is against the law of God s creation, that every plant must be after its kind Gen 1:11-12.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This happened when Constantine the Great mixed the church with the world in the first part of the fourth century.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He brought thousands of false believers into Christianity, making it Christendom, no longer the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, this third parable corresponds to the third of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the church in Pergamos 2:12-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The mustard is an annual herb, whereas the tree is a perennial plant.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard, sojourning on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But with its nature changed, the church became deeply rooted and settled in the earth as a tree, flourishing with its enterprises as the branches to lodge many evil persons and things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This has formed the outward organization of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For a mustard seed to become a tree is a violation of the principle ordained by God in His creation for living matter that every plant must be according to its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is what is referred to in Genesis 1, where we are told that every life grows according to its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A peach grows after the peach kind and an apple after the apple kind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This principle applies not only to plant life, but also to animal life and even to human life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every type of life must develop according to its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A cow must be a cow, a donkey must be a donkey, and a horse must be a horse.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A mule is an example of an animal not according to its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A mule is neither a horse nor a donkey; it is a hybrid between a horse and donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a certain form of vegetable or plant life is not according to its kind, it will be abnormal and against the principle ordained by God in His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In keeping with this principle, a mustard must be according to a mustard, and a tree must be according to a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is abnormal for a mustard to break God s principle and become a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But by growing into a tree, the mustard herb breaks this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This kind of growth is abnormal, a violation of God s regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose human life developed without any regulation, and some Chinese grew into oxen, some Japanese grew into horses, and some Americans grew into elephants.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How grotesque this would be!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thank God that in His creation He has put a governing principle into every type of life!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, when the Lord sowed the seed of a mustard herb, this herb grew into a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How abnormal is such a development!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I was young, I read some books which said that this big tree was something positive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But this tree, although very large, is not positive at all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose a man grew into an elephant.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Would this be positive or negative?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all would be terrified of such an abnormal development.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today s Christendom is huge and devilishly abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not only a tree, but a great tree.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By this we see that not only the nature of the constituent of the kingdom has been changed, but that the size of the kingdom has become abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If an herb is to be good for food, it should not grow too large.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When an herb grows abnormally large, it is no longer tender, delicious, or good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In His economy God intends that His children be like wheat or mustard, the smaller and the more tender, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, we should be annuals like wheat and mustard, neither of which remains more than a year.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church people must be annuals, not perennials.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not be rooted deeply into the earth for a long period of time, for the Lord s intention is that we be sojourners on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As long as we are annuals like wheat and herbs, we shall produce the best foodstuff, grain to make loaves of bread and mustard to match the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This will afford others excellent food for their nourishment and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, the enemy has made the mustard a perennial tree that does not produce any foodstuff.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>D. The Birds of Heaven Coming and Roosting</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>in the Branches of the Tree</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verse 32 also says that the birds of heaven come and roost in the branches of this tree.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Instead of producing foodstuff, this tree is a roost for birds.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because the birds in the first parable signify the evil one, Satan vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>4, 19 , the birds of heaven in verse 32 must refer to Satan s evil spirits with the evil persons and things motivated by them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They lodge in the branches of the great tree, that is, in the enterprises of Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The birds refer to the evil one and to evil persons, evil matters, and evil things in short to all evil pertaining to the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In today s Christendom, there are many evil persons, evil things, and evil matters.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christendom has become a big tree producing no fruit, but having become a lodging place for so many evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When this parable was spoken by the Lord, it was prophecy; but today it has become history.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the Vatican we see the fulfillment of this parable.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Vatican is even an independent country, formed by an agreement between Mussolini and the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From that time onward, the Vatican and various nations of the world have exchanged ambassadors.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is a further indication that the Christian religion has become a big tree.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Today there are approximately eight hundred million Catholics in the world, perhaps one fourth of the world s population, under the authority of the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Such a large number of people is under the papal system.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although Christianity has become a big tree, in Luke 12 the Lord Jesus called His church the little flock.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should not be in the big tree, but remain in the little flock.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you visit the Vatican, you will see that it is a huge tree, a lodging place filled with so many birds.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The same thing is found in the Catholic churches in the United States and in the large denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the Catholic Church and in the denominations it is difficult to find a grain of wheat or a mustard seed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Instead of food, there is lodging for the birds.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is today s situation, the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
