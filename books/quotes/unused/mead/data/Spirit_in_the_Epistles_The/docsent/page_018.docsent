   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE GALATIANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The sequence of the books of the Bible is very meaningful, and we believe it is the arrangement of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Romans we see how the Spirit of sonship carries out a sanctifying work in us so that we may have the image of God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then 1 Corinthians tells us how this Spirit is building us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The building Spirit carries out a building work in us mainly by transforming us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, 2 Corinthians goes on to show how the transforming Spirit is doing a transforming work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a general outline.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then from Galatians to Philemon we see a more detailed explanation of how we can become sons of God, how the Son of God can be wrought into us, how we can live by the Son of God, and how we can become the Body of Christ, thus completely living in the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It pleased God to reveal His Son in me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Gal 1:15-16</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first concept given to us in Galatians is that it pleased God to reveal His Son in us, to put His Son in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For I through law have died to law that I might live to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2:19-20</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What these two verses mean is that the Son of God is in me, the faith of the Son of God is in me, and I live by the faith of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Chapter one says it pleases God to put His Son in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Chapter two says the Son of God has not only been put in us, but He is also living in us, and we are living by His faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>4:19</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The above three passages are the basic thoughts in the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First, the Son of God is revealed in us and is put in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second, the Son of God lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Third, the Son of God is being formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Being put in us is the first step, living in us is the continuation, and being formed in us is the result.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How is this matter being accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is altogether accomplished in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now. v. 29</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we have the matter of being born according to the Spirit, which means the same thing as being born of the Spirit in John 3.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under law, that He might redeem those under law that we might receive the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Gal 4:4-6</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The gospel preached in Christianity always contains an inaccurate concept, that is, that Christ has redeemed us out of the law for us to enjoy the blessing of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, Galatians 4 does not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, it says that God has redeemed us out of the law that we may receive the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The central purpose of Christ's redemption is not for us to enjoy the blessing of going to heaven but for us to receive the sonship and become sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, the Spirit of the Son here is somewhat different from the Spirit of sonship in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here it is the Spirit of Christ as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whereas Galatians 4:29 says, "Born according to the Spirit," here in 4:6 it says that God has sent "the Spirit of His Son" into our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This only I wish to learn from you, Did you receive the Spirit out of the works of law or out of the hearing of faith?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Are you so foolish?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>3:2-3</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He therefore who bountifully supplies to you the Spirit and does works of power among you, does He do it out of the works of law or out of the hearing of faith? v. 5</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles out of faith, announced the gospel beforehand to Abraham: "In you shall all the nations be blessed." v. 8</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, "Cursed is every one hanging on a tree"; in order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>13-14</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The blessing which God intended to give to Abraham was the promise of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many Christians do not see this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They think that the gospel is for the forgiveness of sins, which surely is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Gospels, however, the principal blessing is the life-giving Spirit whom God intended to give us according to what He had planned and ordained in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, in time, God promised Abraham, saying that in his seed, who is Christ, all the nations would be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I have never read a spiritual book or heard a message saying that this blessing is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was not until over ten years ago, one morning when I came to this passage in my studying of the Bible, my eyes were opened by God to see that this blessing is the promise of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This Spirit comprises the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Not only so, this Spirit also includes the human element, the effectiveness of Christ's death, and the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This Spirit is truly the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many Christians consider the Holy Spirit to be very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There were even theological debates on whether or not the Holy Spirit is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the early days, the general concept was that the Holy Spirit was merely a power, an agent.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Later, advancement in theology led to the discovery of the Holy Spirit as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today we must see that the Holy Spirit is not only a person, but that He also incorporates the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Moreover, He is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He has the elements of human living, the effectiveness of death, and the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Spirit, therefore, is exceedingly rich.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Galatians 3:5 shows that God is supplying, not just giving, the Spirit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To supply means to meet our need continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God not only gives us the Holy Spirit; He supplies to us the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This Spirit is the blessing which God planned and prepared throughout the ages for us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When you have this Spirit, you have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When you have this Spirit, you have redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Comfort, peace, and power all are in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Do not misunderstand me, but even forgiveness of sins is in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I hope that here I can give you a simple yet deep impression.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This Spirit is a tremendous Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All that God is and all that Christ has accomplished, obtained, and attained are in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When we believe the gospel, God puts this Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When this Spirit comes in, forgiveness of sins, redemption, justification, peace, life, comfort, power, and light come in. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit come in, and even the effectiveness of the death of Christ, which solves all our problems, and the power of resurrection come in. Hence, this is an all-effective dose.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He can handle your every problem and supply your every need.</S>
