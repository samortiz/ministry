   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>BEING CONFORMED TO THE DEATH OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>BY THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF HIS SUFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Philippians 3:10 the apostle Paul said that he desired to be conformed to the death of Christ by the power of His resurrection in the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Who can say what the conformation to the death of Christ and what the power of Christ's resurrection are?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ's death and resurrection are great mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Recently, I received some news about a sister who passed through certain sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we consider the issues which she is facing in her spiritual life, this will help us to realize what it means to be conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This sister was forced to resign from her job because the work she was doing had a harmful effect on her health.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After her resignation, she considered that she should use some of her savings to start a business.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She saw an advertisement in the newspaper from a man who was looking for an investor for his business.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This sister and her husband were convinced by this man to invest their money in this business.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They put all of their savings into that man's hands.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, he cheated them and they lost all of their money.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result of what happened to her, this sister became very bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, she wondered about the Lord's faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She said that for many years she prayed every day and honestly trusted in the Lord for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She wondered why the Lord did not help her since she had prayed so much and had so much trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She said that she had dedicated her time to study the Bible with the help of the Life-studies and the books we have published.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since she gave herself to the Lord in this way, she wondered why the Lord did not do anything for her and why the Lord would not protect her.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She lost her health, her job, and then her savings even though she had prayed and trusted the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She pointed out that in one of Brother Nee's books, he said that the Lord does not care whether we are successful or mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What the Lord desires is to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She asked if this meant that the Lord wanted us to neglect all the practical matters and only take care of God's desire to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She said that she had been dedicating herself and her time to reading the Bible and the publications of the ministry every day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She was wondering how her spiritual seeking and her care for practical matters could be reconciled.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It seemed to her that she trusted in the Lord to no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What could she tell her children about this?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this message I would like to address these issues.</S>
