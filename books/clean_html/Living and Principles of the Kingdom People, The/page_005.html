<h2 class="head2">Being Merciful</h2>
<p>The second specific condition of the heart is to be merciful. Verse 7 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy.&rdquo; To hunger and thirst for righteousness is toward one&rsquo;s self. Being merciful is our attitude toward others. When most people learn to restrict themselves righteously, they inevitably make the same, if not more stringent, demands on others. However, the Lord said that a person living in the kingdom of the heavens is full of mercy toward others while being righteous toward himself.</p>
<p>Mercy accommodates people more than grace. A person&rsquo;s situation may be so low that he is not worthy of grace. He needs mercy to accommodate him. For example, to give money to a friend is grace, but to give money to a beggar is mercy because a beggar is totally unworthy of the grace that we would give him.</p>
<p>Someone who lets the heavens rule is gracious to those who are proper and worthy of grace and also shows mercy to those who are improper and unworthy of grace. He is lenient toward others and makes no demands or requirements of them. To be righteous is to make demands and to be strict, but to be merciful is the opposite.</p>
<p>The result of being merciful toward others is that God shows mercy to us. This corresponds to verse 12 in chapter 7: &ldquo;All that you wish men would do to you, so also you do to them.&rdquo; God treats us according to how we treat others. If we have mercy on others, God will have mercy on us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Pure in Heart</h2>
<p>The third specific condition of the heart is to be pure in heart. Verse 8 of chapter 5 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.&rdquo; This condition of the heart is toward God, because it results in seeing God. Believers under the rule of the heavens are righteous toward themselves, merciful toward others, and pure toward God. Thus, these three specific conditions of the heart form one group.</p>
<p>To be pure in heart is to have a pure and single heart that loves, seeks, and hopes in nothing other than God. Such a heart is focused on God; it is not half-hearted. Such a heart is focused on only one person and has only one goal. When a heart has only God as its goal and is pure, single, and focused, it is a pure heart. Someone who has a pure heart is single toward God and wants only God; hence, his blessing is to see God. In the Bible to see is to enter in, which is to gain. Regarding any spiritual matter or experience, to see it is to enter into it and gain it. Therefore, in this verse to see God is to enter into God and to gain God.</p>
<p>To desire God is the first condition of the heart that a person living in the kingdom of the heavens should have, and seeing and gaining God are the issue of the sixth condition of his heart. Being pure in heart is the last condition in this section, because it brings a believer to the ultimate goal of his desire and pursuit.</p>
<p>However, the Lord mentioned three more blessings after being pure in heart, because the kingdom people have the inward aspect of their heart and the outward aspect of their living. The inward aspect relates to seeking and gaining God, and the outward aspect relates to walking under God&rsquo;s rule. Therefore, the Lord gave three outward conditions after the aforementioned six inward conditions of the heart.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Peacemakers</h2>
<p>The seventh condition of blessing for the kingdom people is being peacemakers. Verse 9 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God.&rdquo; The kingdom people are poor in spirit, mourn, are meek, hunger and thirst for righteousness, and are merciful. Since this is the condition of their heart, they do not cause problems with others. The kingdom people do not sow seeds of discord. Instead, the kingdom people are peacemakers; they make peace among men.</p>
<p>There is no peace in the present age. People everywhere are scheming and struggling against one another; they are backbiting and devouring one another. There is discord in every group and family. There is discord among people, and there is discord within people. There is much self-blame, self-hatred, indignation, discontentment, restlessness, and uneasiness within man&rsquo;s heart. Within man there is also the battle between reason and lust, and his conscience is full of condemnation. Man wants to do good, but he cannot stop indulging in sin. As a result, man has no peace in himself.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is no peace between man and God. Man has gone astray from God and even opposes God. Colossians 1:21 speaks of those who are alienated and enemies in their mind because of their evil works. John 3:36 says that &ldquo;the wrath of God abides upon him.&rdquo; Therefore, there is no peace between man and God.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus came to the earth as the Son of God and brought peace to man. He made peace among men and peace between man and God. He is the Peacemaker. Therefore, someone living in the kingdom of the heavens must also be one who makes peace among men. He can live in peace with all men, and he can give peace to all who contact him. The blessing for the peacemakers is to be called sons of God, because they make peace like the Son of God.</p>
<p>There are strife and discord in the church because the church lacks peacemakers. Many saints sow seeds of discord when they speak. This proves that they do not let the heavens rule. If we do not have peace with others, we cannot have peace with God. We can have peace with God only when we have peace with men. Because the Lord made peace among men and peace between man and God, we must do the same in order to be called sons of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Persecuted<br />
for the Sake of Righteousness</h2>
<p>Being peacemakers is what we do for others. Being persecuted for the sake of righteousness is what we suffer from others. It is amazing that someone living in the kingdom of the heavens is often persecuted for the sake of righteousness. Normally, a person is punished for doing evil. It does not seem possible that someone would be persecuted for the sake of righteousness. However, this is indeed the case. If we hold fast to righteousness and refuse to partake of evil or corrupt things, we will be persecuted by the world for the sake of righteousness, because the world cannot stand our righteous testimony. This is a common Christian experience.</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo; (Matt. 5:10). Those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness are blessed. If we are willing to endure loss and pain for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens, we will inherit the blessings of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Persecuted<br />
because of the Lord</h2>
<p>Verse 11 says, &ldquo;Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me.&rdquo; To be persecuted because of the Lord is higher than to be persecuted for the sake of righteousness. Confessing the Lord&rsquo;s name on every occasion, testifying that Jesus is the King of the kingdom of the heavens, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens for people to repent and come under the rule of the heavens require a believer to endure reproach, evil speaking, and persecution. However, the Lord&rsquo;s promise to such ones is, &ldquo;Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens&rdquo; (v. 12).</p>
