   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE FORTY-SEVEN FIGHTING 16 Scripture Reading: Num 35:1-34</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will consider the cities given to the Levites and the cities of refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>D. The Cities Given</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>to the Levites and the Cities of Refuge 1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Cities Given to the Levites</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Levites were not priests directly but were the serving ones of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that they served the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the priesthood, or in the ministry of the priests, there were many business affairs that required the service of the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Levites, therefore, were a tribe separated to these business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As such a separated tribe, the Levites were not given a portion of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, God ordained that cities with their suburbs should be given to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>a. Forty-eight Cities Given to the Levites</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Forty-eight cities from the inheritance of the possession of the sons of Israel were to be given to the Levites for them to dwell in vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>7, 2a .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Forty-eight is a meaningful number.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to its spiritual significance, this number can be composed in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first way is six multiplied by eight.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The number six denotes man, who was created by God on the sixth day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God spent six days in creating the old creation, and man was the completion of God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The number eight signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The eighth day, the day after the Sabbath, was the beginning of a new week.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The man who was created on the sixth day became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, man has been saved in resurrection and into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The forty-eight cities given to the Levites signify the natural man, who became fallen, being brought into resurrection through the Levitical service.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Levitical service was a service to the priesthood, and the goal of the priesthood was to bring fallen man back to God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The number of cities given to the Levites thus signifies the purpose of the Levitical service.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The number forty-eight is also composed of four multiplied by twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Like the number six, the number four also signifies man as God's creature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Twelve is the number of perfection and completion in God's eternal administration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, the number forty-eight as composed of four multiplied by twelve indicates that man, created by God, will be perfected and completed in the eternal administration of God.</S>
