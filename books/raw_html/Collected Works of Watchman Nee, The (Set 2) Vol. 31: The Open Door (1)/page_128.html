<h2 class="head2">Jin-Hwa, Chekiang Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings to the brothers and sisters meeting in the Lord's name in X:</p><p>Although I have never met you, we are connected because of the Lord Jesus' precious blood, so I dare to write this letter and tell you of my news to comfort the hearts of the brothers and sisters who are concerned. I left Nanking with my mother and brother last August 25. We have been taking refuge in Jin-Hwa, Chekiang, for seven months now. We were blessed by God's great grace and are very safe. In the past few months, I have deeply felt the pain of severed fellowship with the brothers and sisters. Praise and thank our dear Father. He is with us always and everywhere. He has not left us orphans but leads us in His love. A month ago my mother and I went to stay with my aunt and uncle in Tang-Si. My uncle is a pastor in the Baptist Church there. He is a brother who loves the Lord and is regenerated with His life. We gain something every Lord's Day in the services. I received two copies of the fourth issue of The Open Door. I was very comforted to read the news of the work and the brothers and sisters in all the localities. Please continue to send two copies of every issue. I am sending X dollars for the cost of printing The Christian in the future. I am also sending X dollars in postage stamps for use in sending out The Open Door. Peace and joy in the Lord.</p><p>Your sister in the Lord,<br />Yang Wen-jeng<br />March 25<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Greetings in the Lord to Brother Chou:</p><p>My mother and I have not tasted the Lord's table in the eight months since we have been here. Our hearts are really panting like deer thirsting for water. We have been earnestly asking the Father to give us a taste of His table so that we may worship God in one accord with the brothers and sisters. It seems as if the Lord has answered our cries. My brother sent a letter from Shanghai recently, saying that he wanted us to come to Shanghai. However, the road is very dangerous, and he is afraid that it will not be convenient for two women to travel without accompaniment. If this is the Lord's answer to our prayer, He will protect us for His name's sake. We have nothing to fear. We have not decided when we will leave for Shanghai. We are still praying. Thank God. My younger brother has finished college and is now working in the accounting office of Guang-Hua University in Szechuan. I have not heard any news concerning Brother Tang, and I am very worried about him. I ask the God who does not fail and loves to give grace to bless his whole family as well as the brothers and sisters in San-Chiao-Bu. May the Lord send His angels to encamp around them. How is Sister Chou Ming-hsien? Do you have any news of the Yuan sisters, An-hsi, Ruth, and Shun-ying? If you know anything about them, please tell me. May you have peace and joy. My mother greets you.</p><p>Your sister in the Lord,<br />Yang Wen-jeng<br />April 13</p>
