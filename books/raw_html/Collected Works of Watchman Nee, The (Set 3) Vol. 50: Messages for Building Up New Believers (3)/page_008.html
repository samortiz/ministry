<h2 class="head2">I. Not Doing What the Gentiles<br />Consider to Be Improper</h2><p>Ninth, we should not take up any recreation that is improper in the eyes of the Gentiles. This does not mean that we can do anything that the Gentiles consider to be proper. These are the two principles in dealing with the Gentiles. We may not necessarily do what they approve of, but we certainly will not do anything that they do not approve of. Are you clear? There are many kinds of entertainment which the Gentiles approve of, but we cannot be involved in them. They approve of movie-going, gambling, and dancing. These are their basic kinds of entertainment, but we do not approve of them. Of course, we would never do any of the things which the Gentiles themselves disapprove of.</p><p>It is not worthwhile for us to argue with people about our recreation. Some people in certain places think that ball games are not permissible. Our testimony is for the Lord, not for a ball game. Our preaching does not testify of a ball game. It is not necessary for us to bear witness for a ball game. Our standard must not be lower than the Gentiles' standard. Unbelievers in some places may think that chess is improper. In principle, both the game of chess and the game of "Go" (a board game) are proper, but these things are not our testimony. We do not need to waste our time giving a sermon on chess. We can play it, and we can give it up. Our testimony is for the Lord, not for upholding these minor things. Do not argue with the unbelievers over these minor things. We may do many of the things which they approve of, and we will not do any of the things they do not approve of.</p><p>For example, in certain places fishing may be considered improper. We must accept their view and stop fishing. Our testimony is Christ, not fishing. We have sacrificed everything for the Lord. What is this little recreation to us? We must not give anyone any uneasy feeling because of our recreation. Wherever we are, we should not do what others consider to be wrong. Our standard must not be lower than the Gentiles' standard, especially when it comes to the matter of recreation.</p><p>It is foolish for some to argue with others over their recreation. I know of Western missionaries who had bad relationships with the natives just because they wanted to have their own kind of recreation. It is foolish to damage the Lord's work for the sake of a little recreation. We must pay attention to the major issues and be liberal about the other matters. Some brothers have to work among the Muslims, who do not eat pork. When they are among them, they may want to eat pork openly because they think that it is all right for Christians to eat pork. But pork is forbidden in that place. If they eat pork, they will not be able to work among the people at all. In order to take care of the work, we must not come into conflict with others over these small matters.</p><p>Today some may want to go to the province of Sikang. Fishing is unheard of in Sikang. The people there have never fished in their whole lives. It is wrong for you to insist on fishing and thus develop friction with the local brothers. Some British missionaries went to India and irritated the Indians over matters of recreation. It is not worthwhile to do this.</p><p>I have laid these nine principles before you. We must deal with them carefully. The usual kinds of entertainment that the Gentiles commonly speak of are out of the question here. These kinds of recreation include three main categories: dancing, gambling, and movie-going. They are entirely out of the question for us. We are burdened to only present these nine principles on the positive side. We must not sacrifice these nine principles.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. PROPER RECREATION<br />NOT AFFECTING SPIRITUALITY</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Hopkins's Rabbits and Small Prints</h2><p>Finally, let me tell you a simple story. The Keswick Convention is a big gathering in England, a somewhat international conference. Every year approximately five or six thousand people from all over the world gather there for a week. I think that God has greatly used these conferences. Andrew Murray and F. B. Meyer, both of whom had a deep knowledge of the Lord, have been among the speakers at these conferences. During this period of time, Stock Meyer was in Germany, Melton was in France, Andrew Murray was in Holland, and Evan Hopkins was in England. Hopkins was known as the Theologian of Keswick. He was the first person to see the truth of the believers' crucifixion with Christ. He was the husband of Hannah Whitall Smith, the author of The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life. Mrs. Penn-Lewis would not have been able to propagate the truth of crucifixion with Christ without the help of Hopkins, because Britain could not quite accept a female preaching. Hopkins was a very proper person before the Lord. Yet he had a hobby; he loved to draw whenever he was free. At first he drew serious subjects. Later when he had a granddaughter, he began to draw rabbits for her. When he came back from giving a sermon, he would draw rabbits for his granddaughter. During his lifetime, he drew thousands of rabbits. Later some publishers put out a book on Hopkins's rabbits. Hopkins was an intelligent man. He made the face of every rabbit look different. He also liked to print fine calligraphy. He wrote the whole of the Lord's prayer on a shilling note. I am not saying that you should imitate him. I am merely saying this to show you that recreation does not affect one's spirituality. On the contrary, one touches the human element of a person through his hobbies. Please remember that God's servants are not staid people; that is Catholicism, not Christianity. Christians are plain, simple, and natural people.</p><h2 class="head2">B. George Müller Praying for Woolen Yarn<br />on Behalf of a Little Girl</h2><p>George Müller was a person who was experienced in prayer. Once a girl named Abigail asked him to pray for colored woolen yarn. He prayed about this and she received the yarn. The girl grew up to become one of the best Christians in England. In reading her biography, one is impressed by the lessons she learned in the Lord. Recreation will not drag a person down if it is done properly. If you keep the proper principle of recreation before the Lord, recreation will uplift you and restore your body and mind to proper health.</p>
