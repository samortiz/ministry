<p>God possesses another element, which is death. He has experienced death. Although death could not hold Him or keep Him, the element of death was added to Him when He passed through death. Some saints might react to this statement. They might say, &ldquo;How can the element of death be in the ever-living God? This kind of speaking is dangerous.&rdquo; Please do not misunderstand the meaning of these words. There is good death and bad death. We know that without the Lord&rsquo;s death, there would not be a way for us to be saved. The Lord&rsquo;s death is a great salvation, a great door, to us. Satan had trapped us in Adam&rsquo;s sin, but the Lord&rsquo;s death opened a door for us and released us from sin. Hence, His death is a good death. Moreover, His good death puts to death and terminates not only our old creation but also Satan, the world, and all things other than God. We praise the Lord that the element of death is in God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Element of Resurrection</h2>
<p>The fifth element is resurrection. The Lord Jesus died and also resurrected. He manifested life in death. Hence, He is not only life, but even more He is resurrection. In John 18 and 19 the Lord was seized, judged, and nailed to the cross. These situations of death manifested that He is life. It seemed as though Satan put Him to death, but actually He laid down His life (10:18). Most people do not die willingly; they are dragged into it, and they have to die. Only the Lord Jesus was not dragged into death; rather, He walked into death. When He was about to be seized, He said, &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; and the people who came to seize Him drew back and fell to the ground (18:5-6). Nevertheless, He still went with them. This shows that He walked into death. He did not seem to feel the threatening attack of death.</p>
<p>After being seized, He was taken to be judged. However, He was not the person being judged; rather, those who judged Him were being judged by Him. By standing before them, it was manifested that He was the Judge. The judgment of death manifested His death-overcoming life. This shows that He is life in death. Then He was crucified. Death by crucifixion is the most cruel punishment. The pain one experiences in crucifixion is beyond description. However, by enduring such pain, the Lord manifested that He is life and that He could not be subdued by the pain of death. While He was being crucified, He still cared for His mother and said to her, &ldquo;Behold, your son,&rdquo; and then He said to John, &ldquo;Behold, your mother&rdquo; (19:26-27). From these situations we can see that although death tried its best to destroy Him, it could not subdue Him. His life in such death situations can be likened to a flame of fire in the midst of ice cubes; not only are the ice cubes unable to quench the fire, but the ice cubes are melted by the fire. This is similar to life being manifested in death.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s life is so strong that He was not afraid of death but was able to resurrect from death. Resurrection is stronger than life. Resurrection is life breaking forth from death. Nothing can hold Him, because He is resurrection. When He resurrected, He broke through Hades, death, the tomb, and every bondage. Hence, the element of resurrection was added to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Element of Man Entering into God</h2>
<p>When the Lord resurrected from death, He brought man into glory; that is, He brought man into God. He is the glorious and exalted God. When He became a man, that is, when the Word became flesh, He brought His glory into lowly man. He had the appearance of a Nazarene, a carpenter, and a man from a poor family. His visage was marred, and He had no attracting form nor majesty. People thought that He was nearing the age of fifty when He was only in His thirties (Isa. 52:14; 53:2; John 8:57). He was a lowly man. If we were to describe Jesus the Nazarene, we would call Him lowly.</p>
<p>However, glory was hidden in His lowliness. When the Lord became flesh and brought glory into lowly humanity, He did not lose His glory. Do not think that He was merely a Nazarene and the son of a carpenter without majesty. In His inner being there was glory. One day He was on the mountain and was transfigured; His inner being came forth, and the disciples saw Him enveloped in glory (Matt. 17:2). However, this glory was revealed only for a short while; then it was hidden again. This was God entering into man and glory being brought into lowliness.</p>
<p>Then the Lord Jesus was resurrected. In His resurrection He brought man into God; that is, He brought lowliness into glory. His incarnation brought glory into lowliness, and His death and resurrection brought lowliness into glory. He brought man into God. When Stephen was martyred, he saw the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing there (Acts 7:56). At that time a man, the resurrected Lord Jesus, was in the heavens. He is in the heavens with His humanity. He brought man into God and lowliness into glory. Today there is a man in the glory. Everything is glorious. Hence, the resurrected Lord has the element of man entering into God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
