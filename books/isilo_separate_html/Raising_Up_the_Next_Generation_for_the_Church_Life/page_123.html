THE WORLD, SATAN, AND THE SELF</h2>
<p>This mingling of the Triune God is in you, in me, and in every saint. Moreover, the common and unique life which is in all the millions of believers has mingled us all into one. This is the oneness of the Body. This oneness has nullified all of our old creation and the natural man. This is accomplished by the Father&rsquo;s name and the Father&rsquo;s life. This oneness has also sanctified us from the Satan-ensnared world and has freed us from the world and Satan. This is the effect of the Father&rsquo;s word of reality. Finally, this oneness will deliver us from the self so that there will be only God, and the splendid glory of divinity will be expressed. (<em>The Oneness and the One Accord according to the Lord&rsquo;s Aspiration and the Body Life and Service according to His Pleasure,</em> pp. 25-26)</p>

<p> If we would be under the Lord&rsquo;s commanded blessing of life, we must be on the ground of oneness. Dissenting ones may claim to have the commanded blessing, but actually they do not have it. (<em>The Genuine Ground of Oneness,</em> pp. 24-25)</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING TRUE ONENESS<br />
AND PRESERVING IT</h2>
<p>The oneness about which we have been speaking is the precious ointment upon Christ the Head and the refreshing dew that descends upon the mountains of Zion. It makes a tremendous difference whether we remain in this oneness or forsake it. Christians today feel free to come and go because they do not see this genuine oneness. They do not have the preserving and keeping element the oneness affords. In His recovery the Lord has shown us that real oneness is the mingling of the processed Triune God with His chosen people. On the one hand, the processed God is the compound, all-inclusive Spirit that anoints us and &ldquo;paints&rdquo; us day by day. On the other hand, the processed God is the life supply for our enjoyment. Under this anointing oil and watering dew we experience true oneness. As long as we remain in the experience of the ointment and the dew, it is not possible for us to be divided. Rather, we are preserved in oneness. This is the meaning of Paul&rsquo;s word in Ephesians 4:3 about endeavoring to keep the oneness of the Spirit. Actually, this oneness is simply the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit Himself. We guard and preserve this oneness by remaining under the anointing oil and the watering dew. (<em>The Genuine Ground of Oneness,</em> p. 96)</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO BUILD UP SUCH A BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Our work must be a work that builds up such a Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12, 16). This will change our idea. This will change our view. If you have such a view, you cannot carry out any piece of work that is not a part of the Body of Christ. (<em>The Practical Way to Live a Life according to the High Peak of the Divine Revelation in the Holy Scriptures,</em> p. 63)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
IS NOT OF HUMAN WORK,<br />
NOR IS IT THE FORMING TOGETHER OF A GROUP<br />
OF PEOPLE BY MAN&rsquo;S NATURAL WAY</h2>
<p>According to Ephesians chapter 4, the issue of the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of the believers is the building up of the Body of Christ. This building is not of human work, nor is it a forming together of a group of people by man&rsquo;s natural way. Hence, it has nothing to do with man&rsquo;s work, effort, ways, ideas, moral teachings, philosophy, or any religious system or activities. God&rsquo;s eternal economy is to obtain the Body of Christ. Any work outside of this is not on the central lane of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</p>
<p>Most of the work in today&rsquo;s Christianity is human work, is natural, and has nothing to do with the building up of the Body of Christ. Some people may say that Christianity also preaches the gospel and saves sinners. However, preaching the gospel and saving sinners are not simple matters; they involve many important matters. Christianity preaches the gospel by human work, human effort, human doing; but Paul preached the gospel by supplying the person being saved by him with the Spirit of God, so that within him he might have God, the life of God, and also Christ. (<em>The Issue of the Union of the Consummated Spirit of the Triune God and the Regenerated Spirit of the Believers,</em> p. 49)</p>
<p> * * *</p>
<p>Such a building up of the Body of Christ is formed by organic growth, not organized by human work. All those who are not in life, not walking according to the union of the two spirits, are not in the building up of the Body of Christ. We need to see this vision clearly. The Body of Christ is absolutely not built up by using man&rsquo;s natural methods or the organization of human work. The building up of the Body of Christ can be attained only through the co-living and co-walking of the Spirit of God with the spirit of man in the believers in their experience of the co-death and co-resurrection with Christ and their growing up into the Head, Christ, in all things. The Body of Christ, which is altogether organic, does not allow anything of human work. We need to see this vision clearly so that we can build up the Body of Christ organically. (<em>The Issue of the Union of the Consummated Spirit of the Triune God and the Regenerated Spirit of the Believers,</em> p. 69)</p>

<p>We should not have the thought that we can do a particular work according to our way in the recovery. We may be very gifted and have a large capacity to work out something. But what we work out may be the same as worldly people carrying out a certain enterprise. We have to realize that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there is only one work. (<em>Elders&rsquo; Training, Book 10: The Eldership and the God-ordained Way (2),</em> p. 118)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIQUE GOAL OF THE CHRISTIAN WORK</h2>
<p>According to the entire revelation of the New Testament, the unique goal of the Christian work should be the New Jerusalem, which is the ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MAIN CAUSE OF THE CHURCH&rsquo;S DEGRADATION</h2>
<p>The degradation of the church is mainly due to the fact that nearly all the Christian workers are distracted to take many things other than the New Jerusalem as their goal.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OVERCOMING EVERYTHING THAT REPLACES<br />
THE NEW JERUSALEM AS OUR GOAL</h2>
<p> Hence, under the degradation of the church, to be an overcomer answering the Lord&rsquo;s call needs us to overcome not only the negative things but even more the positive things that replace the New Jerusalem as the goal.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN OVERCOMER&rsquo;S GOAL</h2>
<p>An overcomer&rsquo;s goal should be uniquely and ultimately the goal of God&rsquo;s eternal economy, that is, the New Jerusalem. (<em>The Vital Groups,</em> p. 131)</p>
<h2 class="head1">BROTHER LEE&rsquo;S FELLOWSHIP ON APRIL 6, 1997</h2>
<p>The following is Brother Lee&rsquo;s fellowship given on April 6, 1997:</p>
<p>The co-workers must see that we should do only one work, which is to make God&rsquo;s chosen people regenerated ones, sanctified ones, renewed ones&mdash;the new man&mdash;transformed ones, conformed ones&mdash;those conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God&mdash;and glorified ones. All those who will be in the New Jerusalem are this kind of people.</p>
<p class="indent1">Specifically, God proceeds step by step to make a chosen one of God a person who is regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God, and even glorified by God. In this way, we go up level by level until we reach the highest point, where we become the same. There is no more flesh and no more natural being. All are in the spirit. All are the kingdom of the heavens, and all are beings of the New Jerusalem. This is the highest point. If you understand this, you can explain it to the brothers and sisters, and you can ask them to speak the same. (<em>The Ministry,</em> vol. 1, no. 1, October 1997, p. 49)</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_122.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
