	 <h2 class="head1">RESTORING A BROTHER IN A SPIRIT OF MEEKNESS<br />
AND SOWING TO THE SPIRIT<br />
TO REAP A HARVEST OF ETERNAL LIFE</h2>
<p>The first major item mentioned in Galatians 6 is the human spirit. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness.&rdquo; The most important matter in restoring a fallen brother is that we do it in our spirit. It is not adequate merely to use our good heart or our mind, emotions, and will. We must restore our brother in a spirit of meekness. Our human spirit is the proper organ with which to care for the brothers.</p>
<p>Following this, verses 7 and 8 say, &ldquo;Do not be deceived: God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap. For he who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life.&rdquo; Paul refers to our actions, walk, and living as our sowing. Day after day and hour by hour, the things we do and the way we live are a sowing. We must be careful concerning our sowing. If we sow unto our flesh, we will reap corruption of the flesh, but if we sow unto the Spirit, we will of the Spirit reap eternal life.</p>
<p>As we have seen, in chapter 5 the Spirit is the One who dwells in and mingles with our regenerated spirit. This Spirit in our spirit is versus the flesh, and the flesh is versus the Spirit (vv. 16-18, 25). Following this, 6:1 speaks of a spirit of meekness, indicating that the emphasis in the latter chapter is our human spirit, which is indwelt by and mingled with the Holy Spirit. In the mingled spirit, it is our human spirit that takes the initiative. If we sow to our flesh, that is, walk according to the flesh, we will reap corruption, but if we sow to the Spirit by walking according to our mingled spirit, we will reap eternal life.</p>
<p>The way we talk to the brothers and sisters is an example of sowing. To speak with a brother in a fleshly way is to sow to the flesh. If we do this, we will reap corruption. Gossiping is a very corrupting factor in human society. Although speaking about others in a loose manner passes corrupting &ldquo;germs&rdquo; from one person to another, as fallen human beings, we are accustomed to doing this. Because of this, there is the possibility of gossiping even in the church life, which is the real social and communal life. To do this is to sow to the flesh, causing ourselves, others, and the whole church to be corrupted. It is good to communicate with other brothers and even other churches, but we must be careful not to spread deadening and corrupting germs by speaking with one another according to the flesh. We must be careful to sow only to the spirit. Then we can be assured that we will reap the eternal, divine, uncreated life as our harvest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING CRUCIFIED TO THE WORLD OF CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>In verse 1 of chapter 6, Paul speaks of our human spirit as the proper organ for serving the Lord by restoring a fallen brother, and in verse 8 he speaks of sowing to the mingled spirit. Following this, Paul points out that circumcision, a strong ordinance of the Judaistic religion, is merely a good show in the flesh. Verses 12 and 13 say, &ldquo;As many as desire to make a good show in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, but only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. For neither do they that become circumcised keep the law themselves, but they desire you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.&rdquo; In principle, all religious ordinances are shows in the flesh, such as the wearing of brightly colored robes by a choir and the singing of solos by specially talented persons. We must condemn all fleshly shows.</p>
<p>Then in verse 14 Paul says, &ldquo;Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.&rdquo; For many centuries most Christian teachers have not understood the proper meaning of <em>the world</em> in this verse, supposing that it refers to the secular world. According to the context of Galatians, <em>world</em> refers to the religious world. Both verses 13 and 15 deal with circumcision, indicating that the &ldquo;world&rdquo; mentioned between these two verses is religion. Circumcision, as an ordinance of the Jewish religion, has been crucified on the cross, and we have been crucified to it. We have nothing to do with this religious world. This matches 1:4, which says that Christ &ldquo;gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age.&rdquo; An age is a part of the world, which is the satanic system. Between us and religion is the cross. Religion as a world has been crucified to us, and we have been crucified to religion. In today&rsquo;s terms we may say that Christianity as a world is crucified to us, and we to the world of Christianity. I was born and raised in the world of Christianity. Even before I believed in the Lord Jesus, I contended for Christianity against Buddhism. Christianity was a true world to me. However, one day I said good-bye to that religious world. The religious world was crucified to me, and I to that world.</p>
