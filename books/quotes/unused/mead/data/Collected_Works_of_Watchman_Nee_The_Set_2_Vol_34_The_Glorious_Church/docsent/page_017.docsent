   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If we look at the type in Genesis 2, we can also see the relationship between the Body and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eve was made out of Adam's rib, so she was the body of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since a portion of Adam's body was used to make Eve, her position was the body of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But after Eve was made, God brought her to Adam, and she became the bride of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the relationship between the Body and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When reference is made to Eve coming out of Adam, it means that she is the body of Adam; but when Eve was brought to Adam and became his help meet; she became Adam's bride.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That which was out of Adam was the body of Adam, and that which was brought to Adam was his bride.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only that which came out of Adam could become the help meet of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whatever was not out of Adam could never be his help meet.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, when all the birds of the air were brought to him, Adam did not take any of them as his help meet, for they were not out of him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When all the cattle were brought to him, Adam did not take any of them, because they also were not out of him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was the same with all the beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their origin was not right.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since they were not out of Adam, they could not be his help meet.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Who then could be the help meet of Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eve could!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eve was brought to Adam just as the birds of the air, the cattle of the field, and the beasts were brought.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, there was a basic difference between Eve and them; they were not out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since Eve was the only one who came out from Adam, she alone was qualified to be his bride.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Coming out from him, she was brought back to him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whatever comes out from him is his body; whatever is brought back to him is his bride.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only that which comes out of Christ can return to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That which does not come out from Christ can never return to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only that which comes from heaven can return to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we have not come down from heaven, we will not be able to return to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Home is the place of our origin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we say that we are going home, we mean that we are returning to the place from which we have come.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only that which is from heaven can return to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only that which was from Adam could return to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Adam could receive only that which was out of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was a type showing that Christ will receive only that which is out of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only those who come out from Christ can return to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only those who receive life from Him can be received by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are many people who feel that they should offer all that they are and all that they have for the Lord's use.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But God cannot accept anything which is offered from a human source.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God cannot take or use anything which comes out from man himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Among all Christians, especially among those who are quite zealous, a serious mistake is often made.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They think that everything will be fine as long as they offer themselves, their abilities, their talents, and all they have to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But we must remember that Christ will accept only that which comes out of Himself; He will not accept anything which comes out of man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You may say, "Among the apostles, was there not a Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Was he not well educated?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Was he not a man of great intelligence?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But we must remember the words that Paul spoke about himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling; and my speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power" 1 Cor 2:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We thank God that intelligent and eloquent men can come into the church, but their natural, original intelligence and their natural, original eloquence are of no spiritual use in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the church only one thing is recognized that which comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only that which is out of Christ can return to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The material for the building of such a bride is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The matter we need to attend to is this: only that which is out of Christ can be of any value and spiritual use in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God never uses the old creation to construct the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Neither does God use that which is of man to construct that which is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He can never, never use fleshly things to produce something spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord Jesus said, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit" John 3:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Would it be possible for that which is born of the flesh to become spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"That which is born of the flesh is flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All problems issue from the matter of source.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we want to know whether the result will be spiritual, we need only ask whether the source is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord Jesus said, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We cannot use anything of the flesh to produce something of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A message which issues from thoughts only produces thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Work done by stirring up the emotion only produces emotional stimulation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only work from the spirit produces the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The question is not whether the goal or the purpose is right, but what the process is.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Man considers that as long as the goal is right, everything else is right.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But God not only asks if the goal is right, He also asks how we do it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Someone may say, "I am for the Lord, and the work I am doing is for the church the work of saving souls, spiritual work, the work of extending the heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I have given all my ability and intelligence to it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Isn't this good?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In spite of this, man's natural ability and intelligence that which has not been dealt with by the cross are of no spiritual use.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord said, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh" v. 6a .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Thus, it is not only necessary to have a spiritual purpose, but the process must also be of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The method must be of the spirit, and the man himself must be one who is of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Only that which is from the Holy Spirit can be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Only that which was out of Adam could return to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>First it must be Adam's body, and then it could be Adam's bride.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>First we must be the Body of Christ, and then we can be brought back to be the Bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We hope that we may touch some spiritual reality in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We need to see what God is really after.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He requires that everything be out of Christ, that everyone be born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Every Christian, therefore, must pursue the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we do not seek the life of the Body, we cannot seek the life of the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We should never think that it does not matter much whether we experience the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must realize that if we have the life of the Body today, we will have the life of the Bride in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we live vaguely and aimlessly today, we will never know the life of the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Every Christian must know the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the sight of God, we must seek after this.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We cannot just live as individuals; we must walk together with other children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>A Christian must see that he is a member of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He is not simply one Christian among many, but he is also a member.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He must live as a member with many other Christians, having a mutual, Body-relatedness with them.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we really know the life of the Body, we will see that a Christian cannot live one day without the Lord Jesus, and neither can he live one day without other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Without the Lord Jesus he cannot exist, and without other Christians he cannot exist.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God is after a Body, not many single, isolated Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>God desires a whole Eve, not a hand here and a foot there.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He must obtain Eve as a whole being; then she will be of use to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>He does not want one who is disabled.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He wants a new man, a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>For this reason all division and individualism must be eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The matter of division is not merely something outward it is a problem of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Martin Luther said that the greatest pope does not live in Rome but right in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We must realize that the greatest hindrance to God's will is not outward divisions but ourselves, as individual persons, who do not know the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>At this point we need two different revelations: first, to see that the Body is one, and second, to see that we are part of it, that we are members of this Body.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>When we see that the Body is one, we will never dare to be divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When we see that as members we are but a portion of the whole Body, we will never dare to justify ourselves, or consider that, as single members, we could be a whole unit.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Only the whole Body together can be a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We ourselves as members are too small, too insufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Oh, may God deliver us from being individualists.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Then we may become those who are useful to Him.</S>
