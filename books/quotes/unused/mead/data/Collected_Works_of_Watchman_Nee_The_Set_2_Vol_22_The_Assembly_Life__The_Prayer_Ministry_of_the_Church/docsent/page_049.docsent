   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT BABBLING EMPTY WORDS AS THE GENTILES DO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord taught us not only to shut ourselves up in secret when we pray; He also taught us not to "babble empty words as the Gentiles do; for they suppose that in their multiplicity of words they will be heard."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The expression "multiplicity of words" in Greek is used to describe the monotonous and repetitious sound that a stammering person makes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some people repeat the same words monotonously in their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This kind of prayer has sound only; it has no meaning whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you stand beside such a person and listen to his prayer, it is as if you are standing by a stream listening to the repetitious and monotonous sound of water tumbling against the rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is like standing on a pebbled street and listening to the repetitious and monotonous sound of wheels rolling across pebbles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They repeat the same words over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They suppose that their prayers will be heard through much repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But this kind of prayer is useless; it is not at all effective, and we should not pray in that kind of way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brothers and sisters, your prayers should not be sound only, which do not have meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The prayers of many people in the prayer meeting are meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you do not say Amen when they pray, they condemn you for not being one with them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if you say Amen to their prayer, they will repeat the same words over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They do not pray to fulfill some goals but to generate some commotion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Their prayers are not for the purpose of releasing the burden but for finishing up their speech.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many prayers are offered as a result of man's influence, and many words are uttered which are beyond one's desires.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These prayers are like the sound of a stream tumbling against the rocks; they are also like the sound of wheels rolling over pebbles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This kind of prayer has sound only, and it is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not be like those who pray this way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Therefore do not be like them, for your Father knows the things that you have need of before you ask Him."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shows us that whether or not our prayers will be answered depends on our attitude before God; it also depends on our need.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether or not prayers are answered depends not on the multiplicity of our words.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we pray for what we do not need, we will not be heard even if we have more words.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If our asking is not out of necessity, it is greed and vain asking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is happy to give us what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But He does not want to satisfy the desires that our self craves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some have said that since God knows what we need, we do not have to ask anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a foolish word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The purpose of our prayer is not to inform God of something but to show Him our trust, our faith, our dependence, and our wish.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, it is right that we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But when we pray, our desire should exceed our words, and our faith should exceed our words.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"PRAY IN THIS WAY"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now let us consider the prayer that the Lord taught.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This prayer is commonly called the Lord's Prayer, but this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This prayer is not the Lord's own prayer; it is a prayer that the Lord was teaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Luke 11 points this out clearly vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should learn carefully from this prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord said, "You then pray in this way."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He did not say to pray with these words.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If He had, all we would have to do is repeat these words every time we prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No, this is not what the Lord meant.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord meant that we should pray in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, the Lord was teaching us how to pray; He was not teaching us to imitate His words, but to pray in His way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since the beginning of the world, God has been listening to man's prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Generation after generation and age after age, men have been praying to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But it is hard to find some whose prayers are to the point.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many people pay attention to their needs; they do not pay attention to God's needs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is why the Lord opened His mouth and told us to "pray in this way."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To "pray in this way" is something very significant, great, and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brothers and sisters, if we want to learn to pray at all, we have to learn to "pray in this way."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This was the first time since God came down to earth to become a man that He told us how to pray and how to pray in a concise way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord told us that we have to pray to "our Father who is in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"Father" is a title, a new name by which man addresses God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Prior to this, man called God "the Almighty," "the Most High," "the living God," or "Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No one dared to call God the "Father."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This was the first time the word "Father" was used.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This shows us clearly that this prayer is for saved ones, those who have eternal life already.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When a man is saved, he can call God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only those who are begotten of God are the children of God, and only they can call God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This prayer is directed toward "our Father who is in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How sweet this is and what a great comfort it is.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Originally, only our Lord Jesus could call God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But in these verses, He instructed us to call God our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is a great revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If God had not loved us and given us His only begotten Son, how could we call God our Father?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Thank God that His Son has died and risen for us so that we can become God's children and receive a new position.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>From now on we can pray to our Father who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How intimate, free, and uplifting this is.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>May the Spirit of the Lord teach us more and more to know that God is our Father and to believe that the Father is loving and patient.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Not only does He want to hear our prayer; He also wants us to share the joy of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This prayer can be divided into three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The first section has to do with the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is a prayer with three desires concerning God Matt 6:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The second section has to do with us; it is our request for God's protection vv.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>11-13a .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The third section is our declaration; it is our praise to God v. 13b . Let us consider the prayer section by section.</S>
