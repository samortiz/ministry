   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Provisions in the Environment</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The environment is often the best instrument for the manifestation of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This does not refer to man's reactions of approval or disapproval.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It refers to God's provisions in our personal environment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may walk in God's will and still encounter misunderstandings and oppositions from men.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Human opposition is not a circumstantial indicator for us to stop doing a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Did not the apostles in the first churches find themselves opposed by many people?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Were they not imprisoned often?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Their environment indeed was against them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet did they not walk according to God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They said, "It is necessary to obey God rather than men" Acts 5:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They obeyed God and were walking according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why we say that the environment manifests God's will; we are not saying that everyone in our environment will always agree with what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are saying that God makes "provisions" in our environment for us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If everyone opposes our work, it is all right, because that may be an instigation from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Beyond men, God abides above all the circumstances and makes personal provisions for us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If God has called us to His work, He will certainly make provision for all our needs, so that we will have the physical strength as well as the financial means to accomplish the work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sometimes He will even send angels to help us and facilitate our journey.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's hand is often manifested through the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is always behind the daily events around us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A mature Christian can often see the turning of God's hand in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is the God behind all causes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is the source of everything and the destiny of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a believer has learned to seek after God's will in the environment, he is blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A believer who has consecrated himself should, on the one hand, oppose everything that is from Satan, and should, on the other hand, accept his environment and consider it to be from God and part of God's provision.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If God has not allowed it, we know that nothing can come upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can see this in the book of Job Although Satan was the source of all woes, God was behind Satan and restraining him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Satan was limited by God in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Bible we find that God's hand is sovereignly controlling and moving behind many events.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is true not only with big events, but with small events as well.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is the God of the great things, and He is also the God of the small things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a believer's hairs are numbered, is there anything else that cannot be in God's hand?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Blessed are those who know Romans 8:28: "And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, after a believer has the prompting of the Holy Spirit and the teaching of the Bible, he should still consider God's provisions in his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If God wants him to do a certain thing, He will surely give him the opportunity, time, and strength both physical and spiritual to do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If he needs a co-worker, God will provide one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He will fully provide everything that he needs.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jehovah will provide!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Gen 22:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are truly walking in God's will, we will see many "coincidences" and many "accidental things" coming across our way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, these are not "coincidences" and "accidents," but God's provisions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God puts all these matters together, and He helps and supplies us according to our need.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who are truly walking according to His will need not struggle for outward things, because God causes all things to be the platform upon which He accomplishes His work for His servants and His maids.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although there may be oppositions, God will provide for all the needs.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God uses the above three things to manifest Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every time God guides His children, He uses these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moreover, these three things give the same testimony as to whether or not our acts are according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Holy Spirit, the Bible, and the environment do not contradict one another.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If there are contradictions, we can be assured that it is not God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In doing anything, we must remember these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes there are special circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There may be two opposing thoughts in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It seems that doing a certain thing is God's will, and not doing it is also God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is difficult to decide which is right and which is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The teaching of the Bible does not forbid us from doing it or not doing it, and it is hard to decide what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The provisions in the environment are conducive both for doing and not doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All three factors have an ambivalent weight.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Under such circumstances, the best thing to do is to adopt a stand against Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we honestly desire to do God's will, we should resolve at such a time to have a firm attitude, to agree with everything that comes from God, and to oppose everything that is from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although we may not know as yet what is of God and what is not of God, we can adopt the attitude that we want everything that is from God and refuse everything that is not from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We can pray, "God!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I want what You want.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I do not want what You do not want.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Please prove to me what is of You and what is not of You."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we are truly after God's will, He will soon show us what is of Him and what is not of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He will make us clear.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We cannot emphasize this matter enough because it is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Sometimes Satan will try to confuse us and make us lost.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we continue to oppose Satan, and stand with the Father's will, sooner or later all the confusion will be dispersed.</S>
