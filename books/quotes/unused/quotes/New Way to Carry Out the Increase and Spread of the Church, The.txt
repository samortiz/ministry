Within these twenty-four years that the recovery has been in the United States, many crucial truths have been revealed to us
In the first twelve years of the Lord's recovery in the United States from 1962 to 1974, our rate of increase was quite promising
Since 1922 on mainland China there has always been a battle fought for the truth because we would not compromise
On the day of Pentecost, three thousand new ones were brought into the church life, and the same day they began to meet in the homes
At the beginning of the church life in Acts the believers also met in the temple, but that was something temporary
There are two categories of the way to meet-one is to have home meetings and the other is to have big meetings
Through all the years of having mostly big meetings, by 1984 the church in Taipei had only eleven thousand left
There are many established local churches on this earth, and the cargo, the merchandise, of the Lord's precious truths is with us
In the same way we must honestly testify that our storehouses are full of food which can meet the need of the present world
Now we have printed Life-study Messages covering every book of the New Testament in addition to Genesis and Exodus in the Old Testament
When we are going to knock on people's doors we must learn one thing-we are not going out to invite people to our meeting
If you go to visit some saints who have been absent from the meeting for five years, you can go to them and have a meeting in their home
In the past we had big gospel meetings with gospel campaigns and conferences, but very few were really caught by the Lord
Now we found out that it is so easy to knock on the doors and establish a home meeting in another person's home
In Taipei we scheduled that from 1985, within five years five hundred new full-timers would be produced every year
We supplied all the full-timers to go out to baptize people, but thus far we have not seen one coming to the church meetings
When you sow you apparently lose something, but your labor needs a period of time for the fruit of it to be seen
It takes time for real flowers to grow into many blossoms, but factories can produce artificial flowers overnight by the thousands
At one time He fed five thousand , and at another time He fed four thousand , not including the women and children
The Lord sowed Himself into thousands of people, but eventually in Acts there were only one hundred and twenty in the upper room
Let Him enlighten you so your entire being will be brought fully into light; let Him shine in you, upon you, over you, and through you
Acts 4:31 says that after praying the believers were all filled with the Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness
You may speak two sentences of greetings, and then tell them you want to present the gospel or the truth to them
The more you speak your own word, the more impact you will lose because your contacts do not know who you are or what your status is
When you go out you must have a Recovery Version and the rainbow booklets which contain a slightly edited version of the Lifestudy Messages
Most people will be polite to you since you are so polite to them, going to visit them voluntarily and showing them a book
If you ask them to read one paragraph of The Mystery of Human Life with you, they would say that it is very good after reading it
If she asked her children whether or not they wanted to eat something or drink something, they might say no most of the time
After they pray and have been given the assurance that the Lord Jesus lives in them, you need to say, 'Let us be baptized'
According to our experience in Taipei, by using these principles the saints were successful eighty percent of the time
Sometimes the wife would even tell the husband to be baptized even though she has not yet decided to be baptized
After you preach the gospel to a person, after he believes and is baptized, and after some prayer, this false one becomes a real believer
After you direct someone to be baptized, take the chance to make an appointment with them for the next meeting
Some of the homes that you visit will have already been prepared by the Lord just as the Lord prepared the house of Cornelius
From the time that you knock on the door until you make an appointment for another meeting should take about twenty minutes
If there were one hundred saints in your locality willing to practice this, you could have seven hundred new ones after one year
We all need to take the charge in stanza three of this hymn to rise up and strike the holy bargain-the fragment for the whole
According to our past study and experience, if you would knock on people's doors in this way, you will not be altogether rejected
Do not forget that to knock on people's doors is not simply to gain individual persons but to gain home after home
The home which you gain may have only three persons, but after a number of weeks their relatives, in-laws, and friends will come in
In your first contact you must grasp the time and seize the opportunity to make an appointment for the next meeting
From the second time you go to visit them you must begin to do one wonderful thing, that is, to set up a meeting in their home
To set up meetings in the homes of the new contacts we must first learn to use the Recovery Version and our publications
Whether you use the Recovery Version first or the other publications first depends upon the present situation and atmosphere
Whatever is printed surely is something better than the word out of our mouth because it has been thoroughly considered
Everyone on this earth knows that the Bible is the highest book, regardless of whether they are believers or unbelievers
When you present people the Recovery Version of the New Testament, read one verse to them with one of the notes
You must learn to know all these verses with wonderful notes such as these, which are very attractive to the seeking ones
After two doors they met a woman who had begun to doubt the inerrancy of the Word due to the three missing generations in Matthew 1
They had no answers as to why the three generations in 1 Chronicles 3:11-12 were omitted from the genealogy in Matthew 1
As a result of these brothers reading this note to this seeker, she bought two Recovery Versions and her entire home was gained by the Lord
When you are received into a home through some questions and a short talk, you may realize that these ones are Christians
Become familiar with the text of the Bible and with the notes in the Recovery Version that help to open up the Bible
You also need to know the contents of the small booklets, especially the booklet entitled The Mystery of Human Life
When you talk to a particular person, you may have the realization that the last key would be very good for him
There the Lord Jesus met the two disciples going to Emmaus and 'interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself'
In Acts 8:26-39 the eunuch from Ethiopia was reading Isaiah 53 but did not know what it meant until Philip explained to him what was there
Many Bible students would rather skip over this portion of the Word, but these notes bring us into its real significance
Thank the Lord that through the notes to the Recovery Version and through the Life-study Messages the New Testament has been expounded
You may close the deal with a prayer, with an appreciation of the Lord Jesus, or with the knowledge of God's salvation
Do not think that because a certain one was baptized by you that you may go on right away to tell him something else
You may sing poorly, but if you sing in life, you will stir up people's interest to consider the spiritual things
The worst thing that could happen is that in your visit you would have too much talk without the spirit of prayer
Do not make a schedule for the home meeting-when to sing a hymn, when to pray, when to talk, and when to read the books
If in a home a young girl or boy would sing what they heard you sing, take the opportunity to follow their lead
The meeting will begin, and the child will be stirred up with an interest to participate in the activities of the meeting
When they do something, confirm that it is right and tell them that all the meetings will be their responsibility
For going into the homes of the new contacts to set up meetings, you need four items: the Word, the Spirit, singing, and praying
A meeting could always be stirred up or carried on by the Word of God, by the Spirit, by your singing, and also by your praying
In a month you will knock on about twenty-five doors and according to the rate of one out of twenty-five doors, you will gain one home
Around the globe in different countries, there are more than six hundred churches comprising over one hundred and twenty thousand saints
Out of one hundred and twenty thousand saints, there should be six thousand full-timers going out to knock on doors
It is not too much to say that with sixty thousand saints and six thousand full-timers, we could get about two million a year
The elders should take the lead as the head sheep to go out and should not merely sit in the church service office
You have to take the lead to go out to knock on the doors, not only on Saturday or the Lord's day but every day
In the evenings, you would meet the gentlemen and in the mornings you would meet the ladies, especially the elderly ladies
You will gain many of them and much prayer will be offered by these ladies for their sons, grandsons, and relatives
Regardless of how short a time you have been in the recovery, you should have realized that the main item is life
Now, however, we have Life-study Messages on the entire New Testament and a Recovery Version of the New Testament
Most of the churches, especially those in Taiwan and in the United States, have been fully and strongly established
You have to believe that once you baptize a person, that person should have tasted the good taste of God's word
After this prayer, with a little amount of training to pray, open to the first page and ask the new contact to read with you
At every stress of an important or crucial point, you should pray together-only two or three sentences of prayer
You will impress them with the crucial points and also train them to pray, even to mingle their prayer with the word
If there is some time left, you could go back to pray-read the main verses quoted in the lesson in order to impress them with such verses
The full-timers as well as all of the saints have to learn the songs, the hymns, the gospel songs, and the gospel hymns
While you are helping the new ones to pray along with the lesson, you must take the lead to train them in their prayer to confess their sins
It may be that the Holy Spirit will lead you at the opening of the meeting to nourish them or you may take the lead to confess your sins
Leading them to pray along with the lesson by confessing their sins that they may be filled with the Spirit involves the Spirit
If you can handle the word, touch the Spirit, know how to sing, and know how to pray, then you will have a good meeting
If you continue to visit one home and establish a meeting full of nourishment, after five times that home will love you
If you would gain homes in this way the Lord will gain something and His recovery will be increasing and spreading
Even the more, on the day of Pentecost three thousand were added and right away began to meet in their homes, from home to home
Every brother or sister who would go out to knock on doors for the gospel could establish a home meeting every four weeks
If within the coming year you would have a seventy-five percent increase in your locality, would you not be happy?
We should not invite people to our feast; we should bring our food to their home and put it on their dining table
We go out not just to preach the gospel; we go out to command the demons to leave and to command people to believe
Throughout our many years in this work, both in the Far East and in the United States, our going out sometimes produced little result
Since we have begun to go out in the new way of knocking on doors to establish home meetings, many people have opened to us
We may love the Lord and His recovery, yet could we be for the Lord's recovery and not care to see the increase and spread of the church?
The way to have the increase and spread is by going to knock on doors, door-to-door, with boldness, with faith, and full of confidence
It is not that you invite them to come to your meeting, but it should be that they would invite you to go to their meeting
You could tell them that Matthew 4:4 tells us that the word of God is our food, and that Jeremiah 15:16 tells us to eat the word
In one visit simply spend the entire time leading them to learn how to call on the name of the Lord and how to pray-read the word
The new converts should learn to masticate the word by pray-reading the Bible verses quoted in our publications
By this way you will 'kill two birds with one stone'-this prayer touches the Word, and this prayer also touches the Spirit
Also, we should lead them to share with the others in the meeting what they have received from the word of God
By doing this, after three to five months, they will be so acquainted with the way to have a living home meeting
Every weekend you should go out to get new homes, but on the week days you have to go out to visit the homes you have gained
The Bible tells sinners to repent and be baptized , and to believe and be baptized , but you must take care of the ones baptized by you
They must keep going out to knock on doors, but at the same time each of the three should take care of one home
While you are going out to knock on doors, you have to work with the others who do not have the burden to go out
When you have a home that you need to take care of, you can ask a certain brother or sister to go with you to help you
If you would learn all these things and practice all these things, you could take care of a home for six or seven weeks
On the one hand, we must get new homes, but on the other hand, we must produce more saints to take care of the new homes
At that time everyone will love the homes because they will realize that in the homes they could better render their service to the Lord
The new way will open the door and bring in a new way of service, which will require all the saints to rise up and do something
In order to carry out the Lord's new move, we have to be careful not to put the new wine into the old wineskins
Oldness means opaqueness opaqueness means darkness darkness means death death means killing and killing means to bring everything to naught
In everything involved with the church life including the forming of teams to visit others we should not have personal preference or choice
In anything regarding the church life or the church service, once personal preference comes in, that damages everything
If we are going to be successful in this new way to knock on people's doors, we must drop our personal feeling, our personal preference
We should pray, 'Lord, we are all in the church, and the church is now picking up the new way to go out to knock on people's doors
My burden is to help us to realize the Lord's new move, but even in forming the teams for visiting, we may do this in an altogether old way
We cannot change the truth, the divine revelation in the Bible, but we can improve our way to practice the Lord's recovery
When Barnabas and Saul of Tarsus were sent out to the nations, they were fasting and praying with three others
The proper way for the church to carry out this new way for the Lord's spread is that the elders must take the lead
The elders should take the lead not to rule over the saints or to give commands or instructions, telling people to do things
You may feel that to go out according to the Spirit is one thing, and to go out by the elders forming the teams is another thing
There is nothing in the Bible to indicate that sisters can baptize people, so the brothers have to bear the burden to baptize
A certain group could be composed of an older brother, a middle-aged sister, and a younger sister who is only sixteen or seventeen years old
In life, in spirit, and even in knowing the Word, this younger sister may be stronger than the older brother and the middle-aged sister
When the elders arrange the teams, they should realize that the proper speaking person should be this younger sister
The younger sister should be bold, the older brother should give in, and the middle-aged sister should understand the situation
According to the Spirit's leading, the elders need to consider the practical and particular situation of the saints
If none of the three has a car, the elders should rearrange the group so that one person in the group has a car
One of them may have a car, and they all may be in the same neighborhood, yet each one of them may not be skilled in speaking to others
What the elders should charge each team to do before going out, is to have at least fifteen minutes to pray together
You must have a time to pray yourself into the spirit, to pray to have the impact, to pray to have the faith with boldness
While Jesus was living on the earth, He performed many miracles, but John uses the word signs instead of miracles
John 2 tells us that the Lord Jesus would not entrust Himself to the persons who believed in His name because of the signs which He did
Nicodemus came to Jesus not because he saw the miracles so the Lord went further went deeper to touch the inner life to touch regeneration
The points in this booklet with the thought of four keys to unlock the mystery of human life is altogether new
The more you explain, the more you speak, the more you try to convince him, the more he would not be convinced
Even in the preaching of the gospel it works in this way-the more you talk, the more you drive people away from you
You may contact a man who tells you that he is not clear about the Bible and that he wants to study the Bible more before he will believe
Many have expressed their different opinions concerning Christianity and have said they would not believe in the Lord
Regardless of what they would say, they would still ask this person to read a page of The Mystery of Human Life
The Lord told them Do not work for the food which perishes but for the food which abides to eternal life which the Son of Man shall give you
He spoke about the eternal life, the bread out of heaven , the living bread , the bread of life , and the bread of God
If you would bring Him into baptism and he would call on the name of the Lord, he would complete the steps for salvation
After he is baptized, you need to go to visit him regularly so that the life within him can grow, develop, blossom, and bear fruit
If you bring people in through blessings, through miracles, or through happiness, later it would be hard for you to turn them to the spirit
May all of us rise up and exercise our spirit to form the visiting teams and to practice the new way of gospel preaching
