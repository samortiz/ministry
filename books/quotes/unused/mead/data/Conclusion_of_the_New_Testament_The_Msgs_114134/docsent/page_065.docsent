   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By Receiving the Spirit of God</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The believers in Christ are made a new creation not only by being regenerated but also by receiving the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit of God is God Himself for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God the Father is the source, God the Son is the course, and God the Spirit is the application.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the Spirit of God is God reaching us and applied to us as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Regarding the Spirit of God, we need to realize that the Spirit of God is actually God Himself reaching us and being applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Galatians 3:2 speaks of receiving the Spirit: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through hearing the gospel, we have believed in Christ, but we have received the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The One who was crucified for us was Christ, but the One who enters us is the Spirit, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The believers receive this Spirit by the hearing of faith, not by the works of law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We believe in the crucified and resurrected Christ, but we receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The title of the One in whom we believe is Christ, not the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, when we believe in Christ, we receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is the One who was crucified for the accomplishment of redemption and who was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, we believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when He comes into us, He comes in as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, as believers, we have received the Spirit, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the all-inclusive and ultimate blessing of the gospel Gal 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>1 The Essential Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In being made a new creation, the believers have received the essential Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here the word essential refers to existence, to being, and to life for existence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To receive the essential Spirit is to receive the Spirit as life for our spiritual being, existence, and living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have received the Spirit essentially for our spiritual existence as regenerated believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>2 The Spirit of Life</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, we have received the Spirit as the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit is not only the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b but also the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Greek word for life in Romans 8:2, zoe, denotes God s life, the divine, uncreated, eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit is the Spirit of such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit of life is the reality of life, for this Spirit contains the element of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually, the Spirit Himself is life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the way to have the divine life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Life belongs to the Spirit, and the Spirit is of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Spirit and life are one, for we cannot separate life from the Spirit, nor the Spirit from life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By receiving the Spirit as the Spirit of life we have been made a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>3 To Seal Them</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Spirit has come into us to seal us Eph 1:13; 4:30; 2 Cor 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be sealed with the Holy Spirit means to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out and to indicate that we belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God s image signified by the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This seal indicates that God is our owner and that we belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Spirit as the seal of God upon us bears the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This implies that the seal of the Holy Spirit is the expression of God and brings God s image into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we bear the Holy Spirit as the seal of God upon us, we bear the image of God and the expression of God.</S>
