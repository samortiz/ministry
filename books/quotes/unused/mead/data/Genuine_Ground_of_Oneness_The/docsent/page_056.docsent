   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE RECOVERY AND TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE GROUND OF ONENESS Scripture Reading: Ezra 1:1-11; 2:1-2; 3:1-6, 8-13; 6:14-18; 7:6-9; 8:28-30; 9:1-7; 10:1; Psa 126:1-6; Isa 35:10; 51:11</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing chapter we saw that the high places caused the damage and the loss of the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before Solomon and Jeroboam set up the high places, the children of Israel had been preserved in oneness by the temple in Jerusalem, the unique place of God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the time of the annual feasts, God's people gathered together in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As they ascended Mount Zion, they even chanted the words of Psalm 133: "How good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in oneness."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, to indulge his lust, Solomon took the lead to build high places.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These high places damaged the genuine oneness of God's people, for they hindered many from going up to Jerusalem to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some might have gone to the high places under the pretense of worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, in the high places there were idols.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, in order to carry out his ambition, Jeroboam also set up high places.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are told that high places were set up on every high hill and under every green tree.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates how widespread and common they were.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A PICTURE OF TODAY'S SITUATION</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The high places were the source of all manner of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since the high places signify division, this indicates that division is a source of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The high places came in through man's flesh and ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Solomon set up high places because of lust, whereas Jeroboam did so because of ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, lust and ambition were the main factors of the building of the high places.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In today's terms, division is the result of the flesh and of ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Christianity today there are "high places" everywhere, for Christianity is filled with divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All these "high places" are elevations where something other than Christ is exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By this we see that the situation of today's Christianity is a definite fulfillment of the type in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Firstly, the oneness of God's people was damaged by the high places.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This damage provoked God to wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Unable to tolerate the situation, He sent the Assyrian army to invade the northern kingdom of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Israel's experience should have been a warning to Judah, the southern kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nevertheless, those in Judah went on worshipping at the high places.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although some were carried away to Egypt by Pharaoh-nechoh, the people refused to heed even this warning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, the Babylonian army not only conquered the land of Judah, but also destroyed the temple and carried away a large number of people to captivity in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, the vessels of the temple were taken to Babylon and put in the house of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, the ground of oneness was not only damaged, but fully lost.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a picture of the situation among today's Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The denominations and independent groups are "high places," divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In each of these "high places" something other than Christ is exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even very good and spiritual things are elevated and used to cause division.</S>
