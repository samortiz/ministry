<p>Chapter VI, Section III says that Mary is a Messenger of peace, that she is a "Peace-maker between Sinners and God....Many times we receive answer to our prayer quicker by invoking Mary's name than by invoking Jesus' name....She is our salvation, our life, our hope, our counselor, our hiding place, and our trust." The book mentions a story: A little bird was once taught to say the words "sea gulls" and was told that these words mean "all hail Mary." One day a large fowl preyed on the little bird. The little bird cried "sea gulls," and the large fowl dropped dead immediately. The book then explains by saying that even a senseless bird can receive answer and deliverance through calling on Mary's name. If a man calls on her name, he surely will be saved. The book also says that even the heretics at times cannot help but cry to Mary for hope. It says that everyone who holds any office in the holy Catholic Church should raise his voice every day to call on the name of Mary because she is the hope of all men.</p><p>In Chapter III Section I, it says that the Bible teaches us that in His love, the Father gave us the Son to die for us. One saint said that we can say the same thing about Mary. Liguori said that Mary is the savior of sinners, that beside her there is no salvation. He described an imaginary scenario: a man heavily laden with sin saw two ladders hanging from heaven. One was red, with the Lord standing on top of it. The other was white, with the most holy mother standing on top of it. The man climbed up the red ladder. When he saw the angry face at the top of the ladder, he fell down. In his despair he heard a voice that said, "Try the other ladder." He did as he was told and was surprised to find that it was very easy to climb up. On top of that ladder the blessed Mary was waiting for him, ushering him into heaven, and presenting him to Christ. What a great joke!</p><p>One Roman Catholic said, "Who are the saved ones? Who are those who are reigning in heaven? They are those for whom the merciful Queen has made supplications." He went on to explain that Proverbs 8:15 speaks of Mary when it says, "By me kings reign/And rulers decree justice." Through her intercession the soul can reign and take control of one's own lust and can thus be qualified to reign in heaven. In summary, heaven is run by Mary and its gates are opened according to her will. This is the "glories of Mary." The book even claims that it is through God's will that the heaven, the earth, and the lights were created, but it is through Mary's will that God became a man to be like us. Roman Catholics believe that the virgin Mary has become the mother of God and has been uplifted to the same status as God in His Godhead. They have almost replaced all the works of the Lord by Mary. They teach that no one can be saved apart from Mary. One of them was even so foolish as to say that God ordains that no grace be dispensed unless it be dispensed through the hand of Mary.</p><p>From such a heresy, one can see how fallen Roman Catholicism has become. We have to show new ones what Mary said in Luke 1:46-47 in regards to herself, "My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has exulted in God my Savior." Mary's soul magnified the Lord. She needed the Savior just as we do. We can only come to God through the Lord Jesus. In effect, the Catholic Church has made the Lord the Father and Mary the Son. In reality a man passes through the Son to go to the Father. The entire gospel has been scrambled by the Roman Catholic Church. The Lord says that He is the way and the truth. He is the door of the sheep. Today the Lord is sitting on the throne of grace. But the Catholic Church has put Mary on the throne, and, as such, the Lord has to step down from His own throne. This is heresy. Romish heresy centers around Mary. It demands that men worship Mary, and it proclaims that this worship is our rightful duty!</p><h2 class="head1">THE HERESY OF OTHER FORMS OF IDOLATRY</h2><p>Once a friend of D. M. Panton went to Rome and saw many people worshipping before Mary. Some say that the Lord is in charge of our salvation, while Mary is in charge of our intercession. This means they have usurped the Lord's place and given it to Mary. The truth is that the Lord is our only Savior before God and the only One who can intercede for us. In Rome idol worship can be found in countless numbers of places. Men worship the statue of Mary and the statue of the Father. On the Father's statue is the inscription: "This is God, the Almighty and the Eternal." There are statues for the Son, statues for the twelve apostles, for the saints, and for many believers. Worshippers can worship these images. They teach that there are two qualifications for a saint to be worshipped. First, he must have performed miracles, and second, he must have lived a holy and godly life. These saints are said to have accumulated enough merit to have a surplus of merit. They can exercise their power to bestow on us their surplus. This is the reason we should worship them. It is amazing that heresies such as these and many others can be accepted and believed by so many!</p><p>During the thirteenth century, a very famous man in the Catholic Church by the name of Thomas Aquinas said in his books that the saints have accumulated excess merits. They are compassionate, and they can channel these merits wherever they want under the church's direction. Of course, such boundless merits can also be shared partly by the believers to meet their needs. Such merits can take care of our sins; they also have the power to save us from such sins. Those who say such things are indeed ignorant of the Lord. They do not realize that no sin is so great that the Lord cannot forgive, and no sin needs the aid of the so-called saints. Is there any grace which we are not qualified to receive, and which we need to seek help from Mary? Do not forget that the cup of Catholicism is full of abominations.</p>
