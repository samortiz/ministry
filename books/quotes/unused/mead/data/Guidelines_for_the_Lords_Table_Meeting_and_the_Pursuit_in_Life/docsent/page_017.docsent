   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Using Utterances of Poetic Quality</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Fourth, as a rule, all of our prayers should contain utterances of poetic quality.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should pray with words that bear a poetic character; it is not good to pray with words that are too plain.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, the Canaanite woman cried out to the Lord Jesus: Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Matt 15:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Her prayer has a poetic nature as evidenced by the utterances Have mercy on me and Son of David.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She came to ask the Son of David to heal her daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without the poetic characteristic, she might have asked the Lord in a rough way, Just heal my daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This kind of prayer is not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She might have also said, Jesus, my daughter is ill.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Go quickly and heal her!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This would make her sound like a bandit who always speaks rudely to coerce people to do something, saying, You do this!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, although she was a Canaanite woman, when she came to pray before the Lord Jesus, her prayer was poetic: Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>My daughter suffers terribly from demon possession v. 22 . Her utterances are refined and pleasant to the ears.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, there is a great deal for us to learn regarding prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus was even more poetic in His reply.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was not like us; we might have said directly, Go away; I cannot heal your daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord did not do this; rather, He replied in a mild way, It is not good to take the children s bread and throw it to the little dogs v. 26 . The word dogs implies many things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Canaanite woman s answer was very proper: Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters table v. 27 . The conversation between her and the Lord contains numerous poetic utterances.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no direct mention of the daughter s problem, yet the purpose of the entire conversation is for the daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is being poetic.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord s response is also very poetic.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He did not say, These Gentiles do not know God; even the children of Israel do not have such faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, He said, Great is your faith!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Be it done to you as you wish v. 28 . The Lord s response is as poetic as the Canaanite woman s prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, Jacob s blessing of his sons Gen 49:1-28 , Moses blessing of the children of Israel Deut 33 , and the prayer of Samuel s mother 1 Sam 2:1-10 are passages in the Old Testament that are rich in poetic qualities.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These qualities are especially evident in the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, Psalm 51 is David s psalm of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He said, Therefore You are righteous when You speak; / You are clear when You judge...</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>/ Purge my sin with hyssop, and I will be clean; / Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow...</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>/ Create in me a clean heart, O God, / And renew a steadfast spirit within me vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>4-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the surface, these expressions seem to be very plain, but in actuality they possess rich poetic qualities.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I hope that we will all pay attention to this matter and will be exercised in it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is full of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A person with much feeling tends to be poetic in utterance, whereas a person with little feeling tends to be rough in his expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more a person touches God, the richer his feeling will be, and consequently, the more poetic his utterances will be.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, do not think that merely being poetic is good enough; the most important thing concerning prayer is that it should touch people s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more we are in the spirit, the more feeling we have; the less we are in the spirit, the less feeling we have.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The outward feeling of man is shallow; the inward feeling of man is deep.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The spirit of man is the deepest part of man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more we pray by the spirit, the more feeling we will have, and consequently, our utterances will be more poetic.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moreover, the more poetic our utterances are, the more we can touch the feelings of others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If our prayer is full of poetical utterance, it is easier for us to touch the spirit and the feeling of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if we use fancy words merely for the sake of being poetic, it will be ineffective and worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In our service to God, we must learn to be keen and tender in our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not use common and rough expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although our prayers are neither poems nor psalms of praise, through them we can touch the Lord who has the most feeling and who is the most exalted and glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, when we come before the Lord to speak to Him, our utterances should be full of poetic qualities and rich in feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Bringing the Saints into the Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Fifth, our prayers should not only move forward and upward, they should also bring the atmosphere of the meeting to the subject of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For example, the first section of the Lord s table meeting is for the breaking of the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After a few hymns and prayers, we should bring the meeting toward the bread and the cup, to the feeling of breaking the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, some prayers do not turn our feeling to the Lord s table but rather draw our feeling further away from it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Suppose the atmosphere at the Lord s table is that the Lord died and shed His blood for us, yet a brother prays in tears, O Lord, no one but You can understand the hardship we suffer on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot say that such a prayer is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, this prayer merely takes us to a Roman execution place to see the persecution of Christians; it does not show us the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If our spirit is focused on the bread and the cup and a prayer is offered regarding the Lord s suffering on earth, a brother should follow the prayer and the atmosphere of the meeting to select Hymns, #226, For the bread and for the wine, / For the pledge that seals Him mine, / For the words of love divine, / We give Thee thanks, O Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This will bring us into the feeling of the bread and the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we come to the fourth stanza, we should all stand up and prepare for the breaking of the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After singing, someone should offer a prayer of blessing to receive the bread and the cup from the Lord s hand.</S>
