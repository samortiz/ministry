This is a great topic, but it is good to have this basic lesson to give the new ones and young ones a general knowledge of this important yet greatly missed point in the Bible. In these lessons as well as in the other lessons, I am presenting some basic points to you for your further study and development.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. ITS CREATION</H2><P>If we are going to see the human spirit, we have to see its source, its creation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By Jehovah God Breathing<br>the Breath of Life into Man</H2><P>Genesis 1:1 says that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. In this verse the title for God is Elohim. It is not until chapter two that Jehovah is used as a title for God. Genesis 2:7 says that Jehovah God breathed the breath of life into man. God as Elohim was mainly related to the creation of the universe. But God in His title of Jehovah is mainly related to His relationship with man. Jehovah is a title for God in His contact with man. In Genesis 2 this title is used especially when it mentions that God created a spirit in man by breathing the breath of life into man.</P><P>Job 33:4 says, "The Spirit of God has made me, / And the breath of the Almighty has enlivened me." The breath of life here is called the breath of the Almighty. We cannot say, however, that this breath is the life of God or the Spirit of God. The most we can say according to the Bible is that it is the breath of life, the breath of the Almighty. Thus, it is very close to God's life and very close to God's Spirit.</P><P>Some Bible teachers wrongly consider that this breath of life is something directly of God's life and of God's Spirit. It might be that they think that this is the same breathing that the Lord Jesus did in John 20:22 when He breathed the Holy Spirit into the disciples. But the following chapters and books of the Bible clearly reveal that although man at that time had the breath of life, he did not have God's life or God's Spirit. What was breathed into man was just the breath of life, but we must be clear that it is very close to the life of God and very close to the Spirit of God.</P><P>The creation of man's spirit was not like the creation of his body. Man's body was formed from the dust of the earth, having nothing to do with God's life or with God's Spirit. It was formed of physical, material dust. But the material for the creation of man's spirit, the breath of life, is very close to the life of God and to the Spirit of God. This indicates strongly that this organ of the human being is not for material things nor for psychological things. This organ is for the divine life and the divine Spirit.</P><P>The human life with the human spirit is very similar to God's life and God's Spirit because two lives must be very similar for them to be grafted into one. When man's body was formed with dust, there was no life in man. When the breath of life was breathed into that form of dust, man became a living soul. Man became something with life, and that life came from God's breath of life. Job 33:4 says that the breath of the Almighty enlivened man. This is similar to Genesis 2:7. This shows us that man was created by God with a life and a spirit which are very close to the divine life and the divine Spirit. Man is similar to God in this way so that he can be grafted into God in the divine life.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_076.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_078.html">Next</a> </body></html>
