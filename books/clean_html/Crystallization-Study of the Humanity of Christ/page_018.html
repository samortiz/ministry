<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. Still Having the Resurrected Flesh and Bones after His Resurrection</H2><P>After His resurrection Christ showed His disciples that He still had the resurrected flesh and bones (Luke 24:39; Acts 2:31) of God's new creation (whereas in His incarnation He became the flesh of God's old creation), which will be His body of glory when He comes back (Phil. 3:21). In the night of His resurrection, Christ came back to the disciples. The disciples thought He was a spirit or a ghost. However, He told them to touch Him. This was not His original flesh, but the resurrected flesh and bones of God's new creation. His physical body was of God's old creation. His resurrected body is of God's new creation. His resurrected body will be His body of glory when He returns. At that time we also will be transfigured to be the same in body as He is, that is, we will be conformed to the body of His glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B.
