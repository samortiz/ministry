The third lesson book showed us the Holy Spirit and the human spirit, how the two are mingled, and how to live by the mingled spirit
The major portion of this lesson book reveals the Bible's content, including the main topics and the content of each book
Finally, this book shows us what our proper attitude toward the Bible should be and how we may enjoy the Bible for our Christian life
In the past two thousand years, Christians all acknowledge that no one can truly know the Lord without knowing the Bible
The spiritual inheritances God has given us are the Spirit which cannot be seen and the Bible which can be seen
Among Christians throughout the ages, some have leaned toward the Spirit within which has resulted in great errors
In other words, if there were only the Spirit within and not the Bible without, man would easily commit errors
If there are only the tracks without, but not the fuel within, the train may be on the right track, but it cannot move
For a train to run, and to do so smoothly, there must be the coordination of two aspects: the inner aspect and the outer aspect
We must understand properly the letter of the Bible and must properly use our spirit to sense the spiritual meaning in the Bible
To read the Bible well, we must train our mind for this and, perhaps even the more, exercise our spirit for this
In contrast, some people do not understand electricity at all, yet their bodies have actually contacted electricity
They are able to contact electricity because electricity is there, and because their bodies are not insulated from it
For our mind to understand the Bible is one thing, and for our spirit to touch it, to contact it, is quite another
It is not sufficient merely to understand the Bible with the mind; we must also contact and touch the Bible with the spirit
While we need to touch and contact the Bible with the spirit, it is also necessary to have the understanding in the mind
We must realize that the reason we want the mind to understand the Bible is so that our spirit can contact and touch its words
If there is a person here who is illiterate, and he opens up the Bible to read it, how can his spirit be touched?
He must at least be able to identify the words in the Bible before he can read it and be touched by it in his spirit
Of course, there are certain passages, such as John 3:16, which present no technical difficulty in their wording
In the same principle, the words in the Bible may be quite common, yet they are very specific and contain many particular terms
If we have not been properly trained in these specific terms and technical matters, we will have a hard time understanding as we read
He told us that the words he spoke were the speaking of the Spirit of God through him, and that it was God's word that was in his tongue
Not only the Holy Spirit spoke through him, but also God's word was in his tongue and was spoken from his mouth
Since the day you heard the gospel until now, how many times have you been moved by the Holy Spirit apart from God's word?
Although you are moved by the Holy Spirit, it is hard to separate the Holy Spirit from the word in these cases
It is hard for you to say whether you are moved by the word or by the Holy Spirit, because at such times the Holy Spirit is in the word
The Spirit gives us life and the Bible gives us stability; we need both to be proper Christians and to grow in life
After we begin our Christian life through regeneration, the Bible becomes our spiritual milk and bread of life for us to grow in the Lord
Although Greek was commonly used throughout the Roman Empire, the Jews nevertheless still used Aramaic among themselves
If there were some in the synagogues who did not understand Hebrew, there would be someone to translate it into Aramaic
Many historians have postulated that the language used by the Lord Jesus to speak with the people daily was probably Aramaic, not Hebrew
The words that He spoke in Mark 5:41, 'Talitha koum,' and in Mark 15:34, 'Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani,' were all Aramaic
The book of Ruth is connected to the preceding book of Judges and the following books of Samuel in history and in time
From chapter twenty-five on, the rest of 1 Samuel and the whole book of 2 Samuel were surely not written by him
It is hard for Bible scholars to ascertain who was the author of Kings, but some think that Jeremiah was the author
Probably Mordecai was the author, because in 9:20 and 23 it is mentioned that Mordecai recorded the happenings then
Among the Psalms there are some that do not mention any author, but the authorship of most of them is identified
In addition to these, there are quite a few that were clearly written by David, even though the author was not clearly stated
The sons of Korah are plural in number in the manuscript, and this may therefore refer to more than one person
Bible scholars admit that this Korah is the Korah recorded in Numbers 16 as the one leading the rebellion against God
If Job was written by Elihu, and if more than one of the sons of Korah wrote, then there were more than thirty-two authors
Among them, all except Elihu, the probable Gentile author, and Agur and Lemuel, whose tribal sources are unknown, were Israelites
There were scholars, religious persons, politicians, military leaders, kings, priests, prophets, common people, shepherds, and farmers
Peter was also a fisherman without much education, but he was called by the Lord to become the first of the twelve apostles
As to the places where the books were written, some were written in the wilderness; some, in a palace; some, on an island; and some, in jail
It only needs to grow up gradually, to bloom, and to bear fruit; spontaneously men will recognize what kind of tree it is
After Ezra there was a group of scribes among the Jews called 'The Great Synagogue' who continued with this compiling and ascertaining work
We want to inhale every line and eat every word so that we may become His corporate expression, having His authority to bring in His kingdom
Within this subject, there are four persons: the first is God, the second is Satan, the third is man, and the fourth is Christ
In the past, when Christians spoke about Christ, they only spoke of redemption; the matter of building has always been overlooked or missed
On the other hand, it also says that though man may 'destroy this temple,' Christ will 'raise it up' in three days
When we speak of Christ, we should not merely see Him as the redeeming One, but we must also see Him as the building One
Satan was proud and rebelled against God; he maliciously damaged God's creation and caused man to fall and to be lost
The Bible not only reveals Christ Himself; it also reveals the bride and the Body of Christ, which is the church
In the Bible there is the story of God contacting man through Christ, but there is also man occupying a very important position
For this reason, the first scene presented to us in the Old Testament is the story of a man seeking for a wife
Not only does John introduce the Lord Jesus as the redeeming Lamb, but he also introduces Him as the Bridegroom who has the bride
All the redeemed people and the Redeemer become one as the mystery of the universe, which is Christ and the church
If we take away Christ from the Bible, the Bible will become an empty book, like an empty vessel without its content
At the same time, no one can know Christ well without knowing the Bible, because the Bible is the explanation of Christ
By dividing the prophets according to the time of captivity, there are these three categories of books of the prophets
If we also consider Lamentations a book of the prophets, there are seventeen books of the prophets from Isaiah to Malachi
Some have grouped the longer books of the prophets as major prophets, and the shorter books of the prophets as the minor prophets
The four Gospels cover the experiences of the Lord Jesus on earth together with the experiences of His disciples in following Him
Next, we develop some spiritual experiences during the course of the history, and then there is the hope and the anticipation for the future
There are many facts and experiences, and then at the end, there is an expectation and a hope, which is the return of the Lord Jesus
In the original Hebrew Old Testament, these books were together as entire books without the distinctions of first and second books
The usual order is as follows: Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi
Two thousand years later, God sent His Son Jesus Christ to the world, who shed His blood on the cross and enacted the new covenant
Strictly speaking, the old covenant does not cover the entire period of the Old Testament, from Genesis to Malachi
Unlike the old covenant, which became old and decrepit and was abolished , the new covenant is eternally effective
Grace is the Triune God processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to become everything to us
The new covenant does not require man to keep the law; rather, it deals with man according to grace, which is God as everything to man
The New Testament shows us very clearly that God does not require man to work; God requires man only to believe
The fourteen books of the Apocrypha were added in by the Roman Catholic Church arbitrarily and cannot be trusted
Since the completion of the Bible, there have been some false revelations written by men trying to deceive the people of God
Although the Jehovah's Witnesses use a version of the Bible, they have modified some parts to agree with their heretical teachings
Without the proper translations, the Bible can neither be correctly presented to us nor properly understood by us
It is a Latin version translated from the Septuagint Version of the Old Testament and the original Greek manuscript of the New Testament
1611, fifty-four scholars translated the Old Testament and New Testament into the best English version of that time
From 1870 to 1885, about one hundred scholars from England and America revised the Authorized Version and called it the Revised Version
When these scholars were revising the Authorized Version, some of the suggested revisions by the American scholars were not accepted
According to the 1990 Scripture Language Report published by the United Bible Societies , the Bible has been translated into 1,946 languages
The translators did not compromise the true understanding for traditional teachings or for cultural preferences
They endeavored to provide the most accurate translation so that man may know the truth according to God's divine revelation
Some translators have tried to please the readers by publishing paraphrased Bibles, yet they compromise the truth
These footnotes open the Word to the readers to enlighten them, causing them to know the truth and to experience life
The Recovery Version gives many references in the margins to help readers find supporting verses for their study
They will not only get the knowledge of the Word, they will also get nourished with the Word to experience life and grow in life
Finally, after another five hundred years of extensive study and research, most of the Bible has been opened to us in the Lord's recovery
By believing and receiving Christ, man may come back to God to be filled up with God and express God as one corporate man
We believe not because of outward proof but because of a living touch with God the Spirit by praying in our spirit with the Word
He added up the numbers of every word in the Old Testament and discovered that the sum of every word is divisible by seven
There is no country throughout human history that has ever had a set of laws as good as the set given in the Bible
The earliest prophecy of Christ's coming was spoken by God to Adam in Genesis 3:15 immediately after the fall of man
Except for His second coming, all the other prophecies concerning Christ were fulfilled about two thousand years ago
The nation of Israel was reformed in 1948, about 2,600 years after she had been conquered by the Babylonian army
At a time when the city seemed invincible the Bible prophesied concerning its destruction because of the sinful practices of its inhabitants
After years of being washed by rain, the bare rock appeared and fishermen used it as a place for spreading their nets
Tyre was completely eliminated from the face of the earth; yet, after passing through much affliction, as prophesied, Sidon still exists
The limited space of this lesson does not allow us to enumerate the many biblical prophecies which have been fulfilled
The native pointed to his stomach and said, 'If it were not because of this book, you would be in here by now'
The Bible is definitely a book of love, a book of salvation, yet there has been much opposition to the Bible and persecution of its readers
When theories are modified to match what the Bible says, they become correct, and there is no need to improve them any further
Some even thought that the earth was held up by four big turtles; others thought that it was held up by a giant called Atlas
They took these theories so seriously that anyone who insisted that the earth was round was considered a heretic and burned at the stake
Before the telescope was invented, Kepler, a famous astronomer from Germany, said that there were a total of 1,005 stars
Abraham's grandchild, Israel, with his descendants, seventy in all, went down to Egypt in search of food and eventually grew into a nation
Finally, under the leading of Joshua and the assistance of Caleb, they entered into the good land that God had promised Abraham
They set up two other worshipping centers, Dan and Bethel, outside of God's chosen place for worship, Jerusalem
These two actions were very evil in God's eyes and offended Him, causing Him to temporarily give the people up
Before the Lord was crucified, He prophesied in Matthew 24:2 that not one stone of the temple would be left upon another
It usually takes about five hundred years for a people to lose their identity after their country is destroyed
The Bible also prophesied that 'Jerusalem will be trampled by the nations until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled'
It was dangerous to have a Bible around; nevertheless, people would not part with their Bibles even at the risk of severe persecution
As the whole family watched nervously, he sat down on that very chair to think about where it could possibly be hidden
When she heard that the 'Fathers' were at the door, she wrapped her Bible with the dough that she was kneading
He not only believed that the Old Testament was the Word of God, He was on the earth to fulfill what was written
People might not believe the author of a book if he were to say in the last chapter of his book that the foregoing chapters were true
Time after time, the writers of the Bible would quote the previous books and then record additional revelation from God
There are manuscripts, documents, and letters from ancient times that tell us that the Bible we have today is accurate
The Codex Sinaiticus, or Sinaitic Manuscript, was copied on over one hundred sheep skins, probably in the fourth century
One believer during the end of the second century quoted over 2,500 verses from the New Testament in his books
According to history, there were believers who had moved to those caves to escape the sinfulness of the cities
They tell about Abraham's sixth great-grandfather Heber, Noah's ark during the flood, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and Jerusalem
The archaeologists found writings concerning many things recorded in the Bible that had not yet been recorded in history books
If it weren't for the war, the believers living in caves near Jerusalem would not have hidden them in the caves
As it was, these precious manuscripts were stored so well that they could be preserved until their discovery almost two thousand years later
Because the Bible is so long, it is helpful to know the key topics of the Bible in order to better understand what you are reading
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
By having the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, we are enjoying the grace of Christ coming out from the love of God
Matthew 1:21 says, 'And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins'
The third matter the Lord will perform when He returns is that He will judge all the living unbelieving nations
On the cross, Christ destroyed the Devil, who has the might of death, and released us from the slavery of death
When we see, believe, and receive the truth concerning God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the cross of Christ, we are set free to enjoy Him
If you took away God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the cross of Christ from the Bible, the Bible would be an empty book
Man has the desire to have love, light, holiness, and righteousness, and these virtues are sometimes expressed in his behavior
Before God was incarnated to be a man, He appeared frequently to people in the Old Testament in the form of a man
In order to give man an opportunity to choose, God put the tree of knowledge of good and evil beside the tree of life
The tree of life denotes God as the source of life; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as the source of death
He tempted man to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and caused man to have an illegal union with him
The reason Eve was tempted by the serpent was that she assumed the headship, made the decision on her own, and fell into Satan's snare
Even before she ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, she was already ensnared by the evil one
Whenever we assume the headship in dealing with any situation, denying the headship of God and of Christ, we will surely be deceived
The best way to resist temptation is to call on the Lord Jesus, who is our Head, and pray-read His word whenever temptation comes
Whenever man does not use his spirit to contact God he bypasses God and puts God aside consequently he falls into the hand of the evil one
In our daily living, we should use our spirit first, and then let our spirit direct our soul, which, in turn, directs our body
Eventually, her mind was fully occupied by the evil one after she ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
The third result was that man's spirit was deadened, becoming insulated from God and losing its function toward God
Because of one man's sin, all of creation is subjected to vanity, groaning and travailing under the slavery of corruption
He will become a vagabond wandering on the earth, and he was cast out of the presence of God, unable to see God's face
The fourth step of the fall of man instigated by Satan was the open rebellion against God and His authority collectively
Although these four steps of the fall took place in Genesis, their effect remained throughout the Bible and is still with man today
At the time of man's fall, God promised that Christ would come of a woman to destroy Satan, the one who deceived and damaged man
In Matthew 25:46, those among the nations who are judged by the Lord Jesus to be 'sheep' will enter into eternal life in the kingdom age
The church is the Body with Christ as the Head it is constituted for Christ in His life and Spirit with all those who have believed into Him
Ephesians 5:25 says, 'Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her'
On the one hand, this house refers to God's dwelling place, and on the other hand, it refers to God's family, God's household
God is living, and the church as His house is also living, having the life of God, living, residing, and resting with God
Without Him, the universe is vain and empty; yet all His reality is being supported and upheld by the church, which is His living house
If this crystallized product is merely a physical city, it would seem to be too low and would not have any spiritual value
Ezekiel 28:12-14 says, 'Thus saith the Lord God; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty
He must have been the highest archangel because Michael the archangel did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him
Through the church's executing work, the Devil will be cast to the earth, and his angels will be cast out with him

These two were used by God to deliver his people from Haman's wicked plot to kill all the Jews in the kingdom of Ahasuerus
There are five books in the Bible considered to be poetry: Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs
The central thought: God allows Satan to attack godly people so that they may have deeper experiences and visions
We may not understand why certain things happen, but we believe 'that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God'
They tried to comfort Job during his suffering, but, because they did not know God's will, they could only offer their opinions

Of the fifty without a heading, a few are written by David, such as: Psalm 2 , Psalm 95 , Psalm 96 , and Psalm 105
Most of the psalms were probably written in Israel, except Psalm 90, which was written by Moses in the wilderness
, and the last one was probably Psalm 137, which was written after the children of Israel had been taken into captivity
The Psalms leads us into the Holy of Holies for us to fellowship with God through prayers, aspirations, meditations, desires, and praises
According to spiritual experience, they show us the ascending steps of the experiences of Christ and the church
Just as David is the most important contributing author of the Psalms, Solomon is the most significant author of Proverbs
The background: Proverbs have existed from the most ancient times, and they were especially popular in the East
Often one brief and weighty, powerful proverb became a person's motto, affecting his manner of living for his entire life
Human philosophy, science, common sense, comprehension, discernment, and aptitude are not what is meant by 'wisdom'
We, the New Testament believers, are more blessed than they, because we simply need to believe in the Lord Jesus
Whoever has the Lord Jesus has that 'wisdom,' because He is God's wisdom , and He has become wisdom to us from God
The sections: Proverbs is primarily composed of stand-alone golden verses, not necessarily related to the ones before and after
In the Bible no other person meets all the above qualifications except Solomon therefore no one else could possibly have written this book
The background: The Holy Spirit selected Solomon to write this book because he had been through a time of failure
One could say that no other person under the sun was more qualified to seek after earthly education, renown, enjoyment, and pleasure
We can also say that there is no other person under the sun more qualified to write the book of Ecclesiastes than Solomon
Ecclesiastes tells us that if man abandons God and seeks anything under the sun, the result is 'vanity of vanities, all is vanity'
The result is the Body of Christ, the bride of Christ ready to be raptured into the wedding feast with the Lord
In Ephraim, Baalhaman, Solomon had a vineyard which he gave to a family of the people of Ephraim to take care of

The subject: The Old Testament age of the law ends with a curse, and the New Testament age of grace dawns with the introduction of Christ
We know that this book was written to the common Jewish people because it gives no explanation of the Jewish customs and holidays
The content of 13:2 proves that it was written before the destruction of the holy temple, possibly after the death of the apostle Paul
The book of Mark explains many Jewish names, customs, and holidays ; this proves that it was written to the Gentiles, particularly to Romans
The subject: the gospel of redemption-proving that Jesus Christ is the Man-Savior living a life in the highest standard of morality
It was written to all Jewish and Gentile believers; we know this because of the explanations in 1:38; 5:2; and 19:13
The subject: the gospel of life-proving that Jesus Christ is the God-Savior coming as life to bring about God's enlargement
Before His death His body in the flesh was the temple, and after His resurrection His resurrected body remained the temple of God

Any one of us, filled with the Spirit, may continue Acts by propagating Christ to the people around us for the producing of the church
The subject: The gospel of God makes sinners His sons, to become the Body of Christ, manifested in the local churches
Keep this one point in mind: that the gospel in Romans concerns Christ as the Spirit in us after His resurrection
If we only have the gospel concerning Christ as in the first four books of the New Testament, our gospel is too objective
Our Christ is not merely the Christ in the flesh after incarnation and before resurrection, the Christ who was among His disciples
Though John chapters 14 and 15 revealed that Christ will be in His believers, yet that was not fulfilled before His resurrection
The book of Romans is the gospel of Christ after His resurrection, showing also that He is now the subjective Savior in His believers
He had been sent out as the apostle to the Gentiles fourteen years before he wrote it , and he had been called eleven years before that
The recipients were the saints-the church in Corinth, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place

After writing 1 Corinthians, Paul was concerned about how the believers at Corinth would react to his discipline
Because of his deep concern, he was eagerly awaiting Titus to bring him news of the response of the Corinthians to his first Epistle
As we read chapter seven, we can touch the feeling in Paul's spirit, a feeling of deep concern for the church in Corinth
The writer, the place, and the time: This book was written by the apostle Paul to the churches of Galatia around A
The writer, the place, and the time: This book was written by the apostle Paul to 'the saints who are in Ephesus' about A
The subject: the church-the mystery of Christ, the Body of Christ, to be the fullness of Christ and become the fullness of God
The subject: the experience of Christ-taking Christ as our living, our pattern, our goal, our power, and our secret
The writer, the place, and the time: This book was written by the apostle Paul and Timothy the brother to the saints in Colosse
The background: The vital point concerning the background of the book of Colossians is that culture had been brought into the church life
To a large extent, Christ as the unique element in the church life was being replaced by various aspects of this mixed culture
The writer, the place, and the time: This book was written by Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians around A
The subject: a holy life for the church life-serving the living God, having a sanctified human living, and awaiting the coming of the Lord
The sections 1 introduction 2 the content encouragement and correction concerning the holy life for the church life and 3 conclusion
The background: At this point we need to see something concerning the grouping and the timing of Paul's Epistles
Although Philemon is grouped with 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, it was actually written earlier, during Paul's first imprisonment
Paul was imprisoned the first time because of the Jews, not because of persecution carried out by the Roman Empire
We know from Acts that Paul appealed to Caesar and this caused him to be sent to Rome, where he was imprisoned
In chapter four he indicates to his dear child Timothy that he was ready to depart, to be martyred, to be poured out as a drink offering
When Gods dispensation is put together with these four matters we see that 1 Timothy does in fact reveal Gods economy concerning the church
The background: When Paul wrote to Philemon, Philemon was in Colosse and Paul was far away, a prisoner in Rome
The fact that there were churches in Rome and in Colosse indicates that the churches as the expression of the Body of Christ are universal
Even during the comparatively short time of thirty years, churches had been established not only in Judea, but also in the Gentile world
The sections 1 introduction 2 a slave reborn to be a brother 3 a brother recommended for the acceptance of the new man and 4 conclusion
Because it is not easy to find evidence that James left Jerusalem at any time, it was probably written in Jerusalem
A brother may easily become angry with his sibling, or a sister may not have the proper attitude toward her mother
He also asked Paul to perform a Nazarite vow in a purification rite for seven days and to pay for several others who could not afford it
We need to explain carefully what is our attitude toward the inspiration of the Scriptures in relation to the book of James
We need to be clear that God's New Testament way is for us to believe into Christ and to enjoy the dispensing of life
The standard of our morality must be high; yet, the living is not a result of our trying to fulfill the law of the Old Testament

The sections: 1) introduction , 2) hospitality to the traveling workers , 3) imitation not of the evil but of the good , and 4) conclusion
Revelation is also the conclusion of the New Testament, which is composed of the Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation
As the last book of the Bible, Revelation is the conclusion, completion, and consummation of the entire divine revelation, the whole Bible
Most of the things covered in this book are not absolutely new, but refer back to the foregoing books of the Bible
If a train has no railroad tracks to run on, not only will it be unable to run smoothly, but it will also be without protection
If one studies the Bible and expounds it blindly and carelessly, the result will be inconceivable and even dangerous
It is very dangerous for a person to judge according to what he thinks and to interpret according to what he perceives
If we want to study the Bible properly and understand it accurately, there must be the restrictive interpretation
If we want a restrictive exposition of the Bible, we need to find out the principles and laws of Bible interpretation
We have to grasp firmly the fact that when God inspired men to write the Bible, He used words that are fully comprehensible to man
No matter how difficult or out of place a literal interpretation appears to us, we have to adhere strictly to the literal meaning
Some could have turned to a spiritual interpretation, suggesting that the virgin could mean something else rather than an actual virgin
Again the book of Zechariah in the Old Testament prophesied that the Lord Jesus would enter Jerusalem the last time on a colt
Only when a literal interpretation of a prophecy or parable leads to absurdities or improprieties can we interpret them spiritually
We cannot interpret a sentence, a verse, or a section of the Bible spiritually for the first part and literally for the second part
If one would interpret the Spirit in the second part literally, he must interpret the water in the first part literally also
Since one cannot interpret the Spirit spiritually, neither can he interpret the water spiritually; it must be interpreted literally
For the different parts within a same passage, either they must all be interpreted literally, or they must all be interpreted spiritually
In interpreting the Bible we have to pay attention to one more thing one portion of the Word is not sufficient to represent the whole truth
The devil argued that He could jump from the top of the temple and would not be hurt because there is such a promise in the Old Testament
When the Lord heard that, He answered right away, 'Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God'
If the devil cannot stop someone from following the Bible, he will cause that one to quote the Bible in an isolated way
In a similar way, the exposition of any single verse cannot be based on its own context; instead it must be based on the whole Bible
The Lord says Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has anything against you and so on
The Jews offered their gift at the altar then for the purpose of drawing nigh to God and fellowshipping with Him
We cannot teach people to go to the altar to offer gifts now just because the Lord Jesus has spoken such a word
We must see that we cannot neglect the background; if we do, we will not understand the exact meaning of the Bible
It is true that God spoke of keeping the Sabbath, but this is a matter in the dispensation of the law and not in the dispensation of grace
In the same principle, God promised His chosen people in the Old Testament that they would prosper and enlarge their territory on the earth
Even the clothing worn by their priests and their rituals of worship are all a borrowing of the principle of the Old Testament
In the Bible, there are at least these three kinds of people to whom God speaks His words: the Jews, the nations, and the church
They point out the Jewish background of the words in Matthew saying that the Lord Jesus was clearly referring to offering gifts at the altar
The Lord also said that when one encounters the great tribulation, he should pray that his flight may not be on a Sabbath
If it were so, this would be very serious, because the whole book of Matthew would no longer be our inheritance
The kingdom people not only include the saved ones among the Jews, but they also include the converted ones from among the nations
In studying the Bible, before we make a decision on an interpretation, we must first ascertain the person to whom a word is spoken
There are also some types that are objects, such as the lamb typifying Christ and the brass serpent also typifying Christ
In the Old Testament, many persons, events, and objects are types, but it is not up to us to decide whether or not they are types
At the most, we can only borrow these persons, events, and objects as illustrations and use them to explain the truths in the New Testament
There were two men, Joshua and Caleb, who believed the word of God and went in even though there were giants in the good land
Galatians 3:2 and 5 tell us that we receive the Spirit and the Lord supplies to us the Spirit by the hearing of faith

The interpretation began with the Trinity and Christology and has continued until the recent revelation of the New Jerusalem
The church must be built with the truth and constituted with the truth; then she can be the pillar and base of the truth
Ephesians 4:15 tells us that we need to hold to truth in love in order to grow up into Christ the Head in all things
Merely studying and knowing the truth is not enough; we need to apply the truth in our daily Christian life and in the church life
Getting saved is not enough; we need the full knowledge of the truth, the complete realization of the divine realities embodied in the Word
They may excuse themselves and say that it is not possible to practice what is in the Bible or that what is in the Bible is for the future
We need to call on the Lord, pray, and pray-read every morning so that we may be revived and enlightened by the Lord
We must use our time and energy wisely to study the truth for ourselves, for preaching to the unbelievers, and for the church
It is for nourishing our inner man through the understanding of our rational mind, and it is assimilated by our mental faculties
Most of us may not be able to read the New Testament as frequently as he did, but we can at least read through it once a year
As we pray, the Lord may expose our shortcomings through His word; then, when we confess, He will forgive and cleanse us
If we do not understand the footnotes in the Recovery Version, then we should refer to the corresponding sections in the Life-study Messages
We would find that there are 114 verses in the Old Testament and 108 verses in the New Testament listed under 'truth'
The title and the subtitles are there to guide you in studying the verses; therefore, you must know how they relate
Read the text of the message section by section and underline the crucial points related to the title or corresponding subtitle
Go to the Lord with these points in confession and in fellowship that He may fill you with His Spirit to renew your mind
If you have any questions or difficulties while studying, be sure to fellowship with the elders and serving ones
If you can memorize one key verse from every chapter, you will have a rich reserve to draw upon when you speak
All of us in the Lord's recovery have to speak Christ in our daily life to our parents, our children, our cousins, and our in-laws
The apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 14:1, 'Desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy'
In verses 3 and 4, he said, 'He who prophesies speaks to men for building up and encouragement and consolation
Through the speaking of the Lord's word, the riches of Christ are released and are dispensed into all the attendants
Our studying is not only for ourselves but for preaching the gospel to produce members for the Body of Christ and to build up the church
Whenever you feel depressed, think evil thoughts, or are tempted to do something not of the Lord, pull out your card and pray-read
