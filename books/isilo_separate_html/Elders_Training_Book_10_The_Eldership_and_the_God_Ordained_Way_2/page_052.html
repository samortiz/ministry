THE TEST OF A FACTIOUS, SECTARIAN MAN&#151;<br>TITUS 3:10-11</H2><P>We should refuse such a one after a first and second admonition, knowing that such a one has been perverted and sins, being self-condemned. To refuse such a one is to exercise to quarantine him. When a believer is divisive, factious, sectarian, he becomes contagious; therefore, we need to refuse him, that is, to quarantine him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXII. THE TEST OF ANYONE<br>AMONG THE BELIEVERS BEING LED ASTRAY<br>FROM THE TRUTH&#151;<br>JAMES 5:19-20</H2><P>Someone should turn him back, knowing that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save his soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins. This is to restore from his sins a brother who is erring in the truth. To do this requires love, spirituality, and adequate knowledge.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXIII. THE TEST OF FALSE TEACHERS<br>AMONG THE BELIEVERS WHO SECRETLY BRING IN<br>DESTRUCTIVE HERESIES, EVEN DENYING THE<br>MASTER WHO BOUGHT THEM, AND MANY FOLLOWING<br>THEIR LICENTIOUSNESS, BECAUSE OF WHOM<br>THE WAY OF THE TRUTH WILL BE REVILED;<br>BY COVETOUSNESS WITH FABRICATED WORDS<br>THEY MAKE MERCHANDISE OF THE BELIEVERS&#151;<br>2 PETER 2:1-3</H2><P>The false teachers in this case were heretics in the ancient time, like today's modernists. For them the judgment of old is not idle, and their destruction does not slumber. The believers should take Noah, a herald of righteousness, and righteous Lot as examples (vv. 5, 7). In a situation of destructive heresies, we should learn how to follow the faithful saints who stand fast in the truth against any kind of heresies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXIV. THE TEST OF MOCKERS MOCKING<br>ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN LUSTS, SAYING,<br>"WHERE IS THE PROMISE OF HIS COMING?"&#151;<br>2 PETER 3:3-4</H2><P>The truth is hidden from the heretical mockers by their own willfulness (v. 5a). Because they are willfully ignorant, the truth in the word of God spoken by the prophets in the Scriptures is covered from their sight. Therefore, Peter reminded the believers to remember the word of God spoken by the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament apostles (vv. 1-2, 5b, 7). This indicates that to take care of such a case of heresy, we need to help the believers to hold to the holy Word.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> </body></html>
