   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FACT THE MYSTERY OF GOD S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In addition to having a spirit of wisdom and revelation, we must also deal with the eyes of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here the first thing to consider is the fact, which is the mystery of God s will 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the illustration given above, the factory represents the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In like manner the mystery of God s will is the fact we need to see.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE REVELATION THE OPENING OF THE VEIL</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although the fact may exist, there must still be the revelation, the opening of the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is a fact that the factory exists, but the doors must be opened to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the opening of the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>V. THE EYES OF OUR HEART</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE SPIRITUAL FACULTY TO SEE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although we may have the fact and the opening of the veil, we also need eyes with which to see.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may have the mystery of God s will and the revelation, but we still need eyes, the spiritual faculty to see Acts 26:18; Rev 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The eyes we are talking about are, of course, the spiritual eyes, the eyes of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Revelation 3:18 the Lord Jesus said, I counsel you to buy from Me...eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need eyesalve to restore sight to our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today there is no problem with the fact, for the Bible is filled with facts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, there is no problem with revelation, with the opening of the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is gracious to us, and His Word is continually open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The main problem is with our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A. An Open Spirit with a Purified Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to have eyes to see, we need an open spirit with a purified conscience Matt 5:3; Heb 9:14; 10:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not close your spirit keep it open.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, our conscience must be purified not only by the sprinkling of the redeeming blood of Christ, but also by our confession and dealing with our sins, offenses, mistakes, and errors.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must be clear in our conscience, which is the main part of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If our conscience is opaque, our spirit will not be able to see.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>B. A Pure Heart</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We also need a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Word says, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God Matt 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many cannot see God or receive the revelation of spiritual things because their heart is not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we would have a pure heart, we must deal with our whole heart, that is, with all the parts that compose our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A Sober Mind</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to have a pure heart, we need a sober mind 2 Tim 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some saints are rather confused in their minds, unable to classify anything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To them the letters b and d are about the same.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As they read the Bible, Galatians and Colossians appear to them the same.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They do not have a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A Loving Emotion</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although our mind should be cold, the colder the better, our emotion should be hot.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to have seeing eyes, we need a loving emotion John 14:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If our mind is hot, it will not be sober.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our problem is that we are either hot in both mind and emotion or cold in both.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is easy for the sisters to be hot and for the brothers to be cold.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But we all need to be cold in our mind and hot in our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A Submissive Will</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Finally, a pure heart requires a submissive will John 7:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If our will is to be submissive, it must be soft.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I have learned from experience that if we have a pure heart with a sober mind, a loving emotion, a submissive will, and an open spirit with a pure conscience, our eyes will be able to see.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our spirit must be open and our conscience void of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Along with this our heart must have a cold and sober mind, a hot and loving emotion, and a soft and submissive will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we have such a spirit and heart, the eyes of our heart will be able to see.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whenever we apply eyesalve to our eyes, the salve opens our spirit, purifies our conscience, cools our hot mind, stirs our cold emotion, and subdues our stubborn will.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When all this takes place, our eyes are healed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To be healed is to have these five aspects of our being dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we do not have an open spirit, a purified conscience, a sober mind, a loving emotion, and a submissive will, we shall not see anything, although we may sit through many conferences and trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may learn doctrines, but we shall not see anything in the way of a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>THE LIGHT THE ENLIGHTENING BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We may have the fact, the revelation, and the sight, but still be unable to see because we do not have light.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, we also need to be enlightened by God 1 John 1:5, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Not until light comes in addition to the fact, the revelation, and the sight do we have the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>THE VISION THE SEEING</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The vision is the sum of four things: the fact, the revelation, the sight, and the light.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Many Christians read Ephesians again and again without seeing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To them, Ephesians is a closed book.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They do not have the inner sight to see anything within the black and white letters of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some may have the sight, but not the light.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>By experience, we can testify that Ephesians is filled with spiritual facts.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It reveals the mystery of the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If, as we read this book, our condition is normal and proper, the veils will be opened, the light will come, and we shall see a vision of God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If the divine light does not come, we need to pray more, asking the Lord to grant us light.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Eventually, the light will shine and we shall see a vision of what is contained in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As we have pointed out, there is no problem with the fact or with the opening of the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Also, God is gracious to grant us the light.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>What we especially need today are the eyes to see.</S>
