<h2 class="head2">Swatow</h2><p>Enclosed please find X dollars. Please use it for the Lord's work and for the brothers and sisters in difficulty. Everything is calm. All the Christians are preserved and at peace in the Lord. Please do not worry, but do not forget to ask the Lord to preserve us in prayer, amen.</p><p>Brothers Chai Gi-chen, Hsie Tse-shun, and Chen Fang-ching</p><p>August 29</p><h2 class="head2">Taishan, Kwangtung Province</h2><p>Honorable Brother Lan in the Lord:</p><p>The Lord has led Brothers Philip Luan and Chen Ju-yien here to Taishan. In the near future we will have gospel meetings and Bible study meetings. They are still praying as to how long they will work here. Brother Luan's health has been weak. However, since his arrival in Taishan, he has felt quite comfortable. The Lord willing, he may rest quietly in Taishan for a while before visiting the brothers and sisters in Kwangsi. Peace to you.</p><p>Brothers Chai Zhi-yun and Hsu Bo-ying, August 18</p><h2 class="head2">Hong Kong</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Brother Tsi-yi in the Lord:</p><p>A meeting place for the church is a problem. The landlord decided to take back his house, and we were forced to move out. Thank and praise God that He prepared a place for us. On August 1 we moved to 39 Shek-Kip-Mei Street, Second Floor. In the future any news of the churches and any correspondence between the brothers and sisters should be directed to Hong Kong, P. O. Box 1664. The work here goes on as usual: On Tuesday night we preach the gospel, on Wednesday night we have a Bible study, on Friday night we have our prayer meeting, on Saturday we have a perfecting meeting, and on the Lord's Day morning we preach the gospel. Recently in Emmanuel Bookroom, we had meetings on Thursday and Friday evening and on the Lord's Day morning. There is a good opportunity there, and the emphasis has been the Swatowese population and those living in the area who can speak Mandarin. The nature of the meetings is teaching and gospel preaching. The work here was under Brother Luan. Now that he has left Hong Kong, the work has been passed on to the local brothers. Please remember us before the Lord. Peace to you in the Lord. Greetings to the brothers and sisters remaining in Hankow.</p><p>A weak brother in the Lord,<br />Ho Nai-yee, August 5</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Brother K. H. Weigh:</p><p>The work here has been taken up mostly by the local brothers. However, since the introduction of the new principle, we have learned one lesson. Brother Luan said that the book Rethinking Our Work (The Normal Christian Church Life) is a very good book. But we should not neglect the fact that this book concerns only the line of Paul, not the line of Peter in Jerusalem or the line of John in Asia. If we practice according to the principle of the book, it creates a great problem between the work of the local church and the work of the workers. There is no way to separate these two kinds of work. This is the experience we have learned in the past. We have often neglected the Lord's work and the Lord's workers. May the Lord grant us grace and mercy. The brothers here are quite burdened for the work in K'un-ming and Sikang. We pray about it all the time in our prayers. We hope that you can give us reports frequently and publish news of the work in K'un-ming in The Open Door so that the brothers and sisters can pray according to the needs. May the Lord be with you, amen.</p><p>Your brother, Ho Nai-yee, August 10</p>
