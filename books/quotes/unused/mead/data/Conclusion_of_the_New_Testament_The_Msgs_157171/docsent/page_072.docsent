   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Running the Course of the Race</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The believers also experience the dispensing of the processed Triune God by running the course of the race.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1 Corinthians 9:24 Paul says, "Do you not know that those who run in a race-course all run, but one receives the prize?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>So run, that you may lay hold."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This verse reveals that the believers are runners in a race.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Christian life is a race that we must run successfully.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The prize is a reward as an incentive; to "lay hold" is to obtain the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First Corinthians 9 reveals that the Christian course involves the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To preach the gospel is to dispense Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By dispensing Christ into those who are receptive to our preaching we run the Christian course.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, because many believers today are not running the race, we need Paul's word, "So run, that you may lay hold."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To run in a race-course is to labor, but to receive the prize is to have enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we preach the gospel today, we are running the course.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But to receive a reward, a prize, at the coming of the Lord Jesus is to have a particular enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hebrews 12:1 says, "Therefore let us also, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, putting off every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, run with endurance the race which is set before us."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The race we are running is actually Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus said, "I am the way" John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A race is a way, a course.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because Christ is the way, He is also the race.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The race we are running is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our way is our race.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These are not two things, one the way and the other the race.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No, the way we are walking is the race we are running.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, Christ, who is the way, is the race.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As believers, we should not stand still in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even walking in Christ is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must run the race.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not take the time to consider or look around, to stand still or walk slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to run the race, which is Christ Himself as our way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although Christ is our way, we should not take this way as a way; rather, we should take the way as a race to run.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 2 Timothy 4:7b Paul could declare, "I have finished the course."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul began to run the course of the heavenly race after he was taken possession of by the Lord, and he continually ran Phil 3:12-14 that he might finish it Acts 20:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then at the end he triumphantly proclaimed, "I have finished the course."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this he will receive from the Lord a reward the crown of righteousness 2 Tim 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>1 To Obtain the Prize the Incorruptible Crown</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because the Christian life is a race, the believers must run the race to win the prize 1 Cor 9:24 , which is not salvation in a common sense Eph 2:8; 1 Cor 3:15 but a reward in a special sense Heb 10:35; 1 Cor 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The prize we win for running the race is an incorruptible crown 1 Cor 9:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The prize in 1 Corinthians 9:24 is a reward as an incentive, and this reward is an incorruptible crown, which the Lord will award His overcoming saints who win the race.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This reward is in addition to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eternal salvation is by faith, having nothing to do with our work Eph 2:8-9 , whereas reward is for our work after we are saved 1 Cor 3:8, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may not receive a reward but rather suffer loss, even though we are saved, because we are void of the work which the Lord would approve 1 Cor 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The reward will be given to us according to our works at the Lord's coming back Matt 16:27; Rev 22:12; 1 Cor 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It will be decided by the judgment seat of Christ 2 Cor 5:10 and enjoyed in the coming kingdom Matt 25:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Apostle Paul strived to gain the reward 1 Cor 9:24-27; Phil 3:13-14; 2 Tim 4:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We, the believers in Christ, have all received His salvation through faith in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This has been settled once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But whether we shall be rewarded by the Lord depends on how we run the race.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In 1 Corinthians 9 Paul was running the race.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Philippians, one of his last Epistles, he was still running 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was not until the last moment of his running, in 2 Timothy 4:6-8, that Paul had the assurance that he would be rewarded by the Lord at His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>With this reward in view, Paul charged the believers to run the race so that they may obtain the reward, the prize, an incorruptible crown.</S>
