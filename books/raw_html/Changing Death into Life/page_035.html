        <h2 class="head1">THE LORD JESUS BEING THE &ldquo;I AM&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; How can the Lord Jesus deliver man from sin? How can He deliver man from death? This is a great mystery. In John 8 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins.&rdquo; In the following verse the Jews asked, &ldquo;Who are You?&rdquo; (vv. 24-25). The Lord Jesus can deliver man from sin and from death because He is the I am.</p>
<p>What does <em>I am</em> mean? In order to understand this, we must look at the Old Testament. In the Old Testament, God is often called by two names, <em>God</em> and <em>Jehovah.God</em> emphasizes His being the mighty Creator. <em>Jehovah</em> means &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; and it speaks of God&rsquo;s relationship with man. When God reveals this name to man, He tells man that He is everything to man; He can meet all man&rsquo;s needs. Whatever man needs, He is. Therefore, in the Old Testament the name <em>Jehovah</em> is often followed by a secondary name to form a compound name, such as Jehovah-shalom (meaning &ldquo;I am peace&rdquo;) (Judg. 6:24), Jehovah-jireh (meaning &ldquo;I will provide&rdquo;) (Gen. 22:14), and Jehovah-nissi (meaning &ldquo;I am your banner&rdquo;) (Exo. 17:15). In other words, if man needs peace, God is peace; if man needs a supply, God is the provision; and if man needs victory, God is the banner that gives man victory. God has a relationship with man because He is everything to man in such a way.</p>
<p>This is what Jehovah means by &ldquo;I am&rdquo; (3:14). The Lord Jesus is Jehovah who has a relationship with man. Therefore, Abraham exulted to see Him, and before Abraham came into being, He was. Jesus is the God, the &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; who became flesh to become man&rsquo;s everything. He is the great &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; the all-inclusive &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; who can meet all man&rsquo;s needs. By His name He tells us that He is everything to us; He is all that we need. If we are thirsty and need living water, He is the living water. If we are hungry and need spiritual food, He is the spiritual food. If we are in darkness and need light, He is light. If we are sick and need healing, He is healing. If we are under the bondage of sin and need a Savior, He is the Savior. If we are afraid of death and need life, He is life. Whatever we need, He is. His name is &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; He has given us His name. There is a blank after the &ldquo;I am&rdquo; for us to fill in. This is like a blank check for us to write any amount according to our need. By faith we can write what we need after the &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; Whatever we fill out by faith, He is. As much as our faith can fill out is what He will be to us. Only such a Savior, the &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; is the need of the sinful. Only such a Savior, the &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; can solve the problem of man&rsquo;s sin. Only such a Savior, the &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; can save man from sin and death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD JESUS<br />
BEING THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the light of the world. Before the Lord Jesus said that He is the &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am the light of the world&rdquo; (John 8:12). His being the light of the world is related to man&rsquo;s sin. John 8 is concerning the need of the sinful and how the Lord Jesus meets this need to save man from sin. The Lord Jesus saves man from sin by being light, because all who are in sin are in darkness. Darkness has blinded man so that he cannot see the defilement and dreadfulness of sin. Hence, man cannot and will not come out of sin.</p>
<p>The scribes and the Pharisees saw only the sins of others, and they were determined to condemn others. They did not know their own deceit, malice, and hypocrisy. They were in darkness and could not receive the Lord Jesus as the Savior to save them from sin.</p>
<p>This is the situation today. Man&rsquo;s heart is becoming increasingly evil and morally depraved. People argue that they live by their conscience but refuse to believe in the Lord Jesus. People sin, commit evil, live in debauchery, and are utterly corrupt, but they do not feel a need for a Savior to deliver them. Even if they are exhorted to turn to the Savior, they are unwilling to take Him, because darkness has blinded them in sin. The Bible says, &ldquo;The god of this age [the devil] has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ...might not shine on them&rdquo; (2 Cor. 4:4).</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to be delivered from sin, a person needs to be delivered from darkness. Only light can deliver people from darkness. People of the world cannot be delivered from darkness, because they do not have light. Without light, a person walks and lives in darkness. The Lord Jesus declared, &ldquo;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness&rdquo; (John 8:12). The only way to no longer walk in darkness or no longer live in sin is by following Him and receiving Him as the light of the world. This is the way to be delivered from darkness and sin.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the light of the world, and those who follow Him shall have the light of life (v. 12). Therefore, He is the light of life. This light is not the light of the sun, the moon, or a lamp shining on us. This light is His life entering into us and shining and inwardly illuminating us.</p>
<p>Concerning the Lord Jesus, John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; The eternal life of God was hidden in the Lord Jesus. When this life enters into us, it manifests a shining function. This shining function is light. This light is of life and is an operation of life; thus, it is called the light of life. When the light of life shines in us, we are brought out of darkness and hence out of sin.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus does not save us outwardly by religious regulations or ordinances; He saves us by the light of life. The Lord does not save us by teachings, by the restriction of religion, or by religious regulations and ordinances; He saves us by the illumination of the light of life. He is life, and when He enters into us, He becomes our light of life. The illumination of this light causes us to no longer sin and to no longer want to sin. The illumination of the light of life delivers us from sin.</p>
<p>Before we were saved, we were in darkness. At that time the more we sinned, the more we enjoyed sinning. For example, the more we quarreled with people, the more energetic we became and the more we thought that we were right. That was to live in darkness and to not see our own mistakes. However, after we believe in the Lord Jesus and receive Him as the light of life, this light illuminates us from within when we want to quarrel with people. In this way our anger is subdued, and we can no longer quarrel with people. We are delivered from other sins in this same way. Christianity cannot deliver us from sins, and neither can Christian teachings, regulations, or ordinances deliver us from sins. Only the illumination of Christ&rsquo;s life can deliver us from sins. If we believe in the Lord Jesus, He as light will save us from every sin and enable us to live a life in the light. The salvation of the Lord Jesus is not from without but from within; it is not objective but subjective. It is the light of life that saves us inwardly from darkness and sin.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO BE SAVED BY THE LORD JESUS</h2>
<p>How can you be saved by the Lord Jesus? It is very simple. There are only three steps.</p>
<p>You must confess that you are sinful. You are a sinful person who should be condemned to perish.</p>
<p>You must believe in the Lord Jesus as the &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; He is Jehovah who has a relationship with man and who wants to be man&rsquo;s everything. He is God, and He is the Savior who has come to be your life. He shed His blood and died on the cross on your behalf so that your sins might be forgiven. Now He wants to enter into you to be your life, your light of life, in order to inwardly illuminate you. When you believe in Him and receive Him, you will be saved by Him from sin.</p>
<p>From the moment that you believe in the Lord Jesus, you should follow Him. He said, &ldquo;He who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life&rdquo; (8:12). Therefore, after you believe in the Lord Jesus, you still must follow Him. The succeeding verses explain that to follow Him is to keep His word, to accept His truth. This means that you should hear and obey His inward speaking and that you should receive the direction and leading that the light of life gives you in all things. In this way your sins will be forgiven, and the light of life will illuminate your life, dispel your darkness, and rescue you from sin. Then you will live in His life, and you will be saved from sin and death. Let us sing a hymn:</p>
<p class="hymn-verse">Once I was bound by sin&rsquo;s galling fetters,<br />
Chained like a slave I struggled in vain;<br />
But I received a glorious freedom,<br />
When Jesus broke my fetters in twain.</p>
<p class="hymn-chorus"> Glorious freedom, wonderful freedom,<br />
 No more in chains of sin I repine!<br />
 Jesus the glorious Emancipator,<br />
 Now and forever He shall be mine.</p>
<p class="hymn-verse">Freedom from all the carnal affections,<br />
Freedom from envy, hatred and strife;<br />
Freedom from vain and worldly ambitions,<br />
Freedom from all that saddened my life.</p>
<p class="hymn-verse">Freedom from pride and all sinful follies,<br />
Freedom from love and glitter of gold;<br />
Freedom from evil temper and anger,<br />
Glorious freedom, rapture untold.</p>
<p class="hymn-verse">Freedom from fear with all of its torments,<br />
Freedom from care with all of its pain;<br />
Freedom in Christ my blessed Redeemer,<br />
He who has rent my fetters in twain.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
