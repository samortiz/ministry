To Enjoy Jehovah in Christ,<br>the Servant of Jehovah,<br>as the Eternal Light in the New Jerusalem</H2><P>In the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:23) Israel will enjoy Jehovah in Christ, the Servant of Jehovah, as the eternal light (Isa. 60:19-22). Verses 19 through 21 say, "You will no longer have the sun for your light by day, / Nor for brightness will the moon give you light; / But Jehovah will be an eternal light to you, / And your God your beauty. / Your sun will no longer go down, / Nor will your moon withdraw; / For Jehovah will be an eternal light to you, / And the days of your mourning will be ended. / Then all of your people will be righteous; / They will possess the land forever, / The branch of My planting, / The works of My hands, / That I may be beautified." Israel will have something brighter than the sun and the moon, for they will have Jehovah as an eternal light to them.</P><P>Verse 21 says that God will be beautified in Israel. Many translations say glorified, but beautified is a more accurate rendering of the Hebrew word. Restored Israel will be God's beautification. In the restoration Israel will be glorified and beautified and thus become God's beautification. God will be beautified by the restored and beautified Israel.</P><P>In chapters fifty-nine and sixty, Christ is unveiled as our Redeemer. Having passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, He is now the saving One, saving His people from their sins and iniquities and becoming their light and glory. By putting Himself into us as the Spirit and the word, He becomes our beauty, brightness, and splendor. By means of the life-giving Spirit and the word, which is the embodiment of Christ, we receive the divine dispensing. The more He dispenses Himself into us as life and everything to us, the more we become bright, beautiful, and glorious. This is Christ becoming our light and glory. Eventually, we will become God's glory and beauty. He becomes our beauty so that we may become His beauty. In this way God and His chosen people are glorified and beautified in mutuality.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_148.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_150.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 149</div><br></body></html>
