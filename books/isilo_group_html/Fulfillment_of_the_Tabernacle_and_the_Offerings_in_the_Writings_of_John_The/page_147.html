This means that He has cleared away all the negative things, all the obstacles, between us and God. Now, having dealt with the negative things, the Lord Himself is our way to the Father. We simply need to enter into Him as our &#8220;Jumbo Jet,&#8221; and He will transport us to the Father. He is the way for us to enter into the Father. Through His death, Christ has cleared the path, and now He Himself becomes our way into the Father. He is the real jumbo jet that brings us safely into God. How can we go to the Father? How can we contact Him? The only way is through &#8220;Jumbo Jesus.&#8221; He, and He alone, is the way into the Father.<p>As a sign, the way indicates that sin has been dealt with, the world has been judged, Satan has been destroyed, and the old creation has been terminated. Hence, sin, the world, Satan, and the old creation are no longer obstacles that hinder us from coming to the Father. Hallelujah, Christ has cleared away every obstacle!<p>Although we may have realized in the past that the Lord Jesus is the way to the Father, we may not have realized how much is signified by Him as the way. We all need to see that the sign of the way signifies that sin, the world, Satan, and the old creation have all been dealt with and that in the Lord Jesus we have a way to reach God the Father.<p>I hope that more of our Jewish friends may see the sign of the way in 14:6. Many Jews are God-fearing people. They respect God and in a sense they also love Him. However, I believe that most Jews would tell you that they actually do not have a way to contact God. Rather, they may sense that God is far from them and that they do not have a way to come to Him. This feeling of distance is the result of sin, the world, Satan, and the old creation standing as obstacles between them and God. Although the Jewish people may fear God, respect God, and love God, they do not have a way to reach God. Neither is there a way for God to visit them. For this reason, even when they are gathering in the synagogues on the Sabbath, they may have the feeling that God is far away in the heavens and that they are on earth. Not only is there a great distance between them and God, but there are also many obstacles keeping them from contacting Him. Therefore, they do not have the sense that they are one with God and that God is one with them.<p>Our situation is very different from that of the Jews. If we want to contact God, we simply need to say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus.&#8221; By calling on the name of the Lord, we &#8220;board&#8221; the &#8220;Jumbo Jesus,&#8221; who immediately takes us to the Father. Many of us can testify that through calling on the name of the Lord we are brought into God. We also have the sense that God is in us. We know that God is in us and that we are in Him.<p>The Jews who honor God and fear Him cannot testify from their experience that they are in God and that God is in them. The reason is that they are not willing to take the &#8220;Jumbo.&#8221; Even when they are offered a free &#8220;ticket,&#8221; they are not willing to use it. The Jewish saints among us have testified that when they were in Judaism they did not enjoy God. But after they came into the church life and began to call on the name of the Lord Jesus, believing in Him, they knew that they were in God, that God was in them, and that they were one with God. This is possible only because the Lord Jesus is the new and living way into the Father (Heb. 10:19-20). Hallelujah, as soon as we board our &#8220;Jumbo Jesus,&#8221; we are one with Him and one with God. We are brought into the Father to enjoy Him. This is a fact, and this is our experience.<p>As Christians we can testify that we have God, that we enjoy God, and that God enjoys us. Oh, how much I enjoy God through the Lord Jesus as the way! The Lord has taken away sin, He has judged the world, He has destroyed Satan, and He has terminated the old creation. Now everything is clear, and there are no longer any obstacles between us and God. When we call on the Lord, we are immediately in the presence of God. We experience the fact that God is in us and that we are one with God. Then God becomes our enjoyment.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_146.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_148.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 147</div><br></body></html>
