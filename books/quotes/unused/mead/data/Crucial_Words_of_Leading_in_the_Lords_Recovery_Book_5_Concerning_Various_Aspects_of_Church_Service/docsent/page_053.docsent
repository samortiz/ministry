   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE JOY AND REWARD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Matt 19:13-15; 21:15-16; Luke 15:7, 10; 16:9; 1 Cor 9:16-17; 2 Tim 3:15; Deut 6:2, 7</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Stanza 1 of Hymns, #1068, a gospel song, says, In tenderness He sought me, / Weary and sick with sin, / And on His shoulders brought me / Into His flock again.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>/ While angels in His presence sang / Until the courts of heaven rang.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The angels sing until the courts of heaven ring because a sinner is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This sentence is based on Luke 15:10, which says, In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a good hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From the perspective of sinners, receiving God s salvation is an occasion that is full of warmth and affection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From the perspective of the angels, it is an occasion for singing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we sing this hymn, we must understand the feeling of the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL BEING THE PRINCIPLE OF INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The rejoicing of the angels shows that a person s salvation is important and that his repentance is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is possible that our feeling toward a person s repentance and salvation does not compare to the feeling of the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is also possible that the angels are jealous that the Lord did not entrust the responsibility and the blessing of preaching the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The gospel cannot be entrusted to the angels, because the basic principle of preaching the gospel involves the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God must entrust it to those who are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The angels do not have flesh and hence cannot preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the case of Peter going to the house of Cornelius to preach the gospel, an angel appeared to Cornelius and said, Now send men to Joppa and send for a certain Simon, who is surnamed Peter Acts 10:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even though an angel appeared to Cornelius and spoke to him, the angel did not have the privilege of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If I were that angel, I would have been jealous that Peter was so blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The angel did not have that privilege.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was not in the right position and therefore could not carry out that task.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All he could do was tell Cornelius to send for Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Peter had the position because he was a person in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>BEING A GREAT PRIVILEGE AND A GREAT JOY</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to see that preaching the gospel is a great privilege and a great joy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When a sinner is saved, the angels rejoice, praise, and sing in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Gospel of Luke it is mentioned twice that the angels rejoiced.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Luke 2 when the Lord Jesus was born, there was a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying, Glory in the highest places to God, and on earth peace among men of His good pleasure vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then in chapter 15, when a sinner repents, the angels rejoice vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>7, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christianity thinks that angels only sing Christmas carols on December 25, but the Gospel of Luke says that a sinner repenting can be compared to the Savior being born.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the day we were saved the Lord Jesus was born into our being, and the angels rejoiced and sang.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we go on strike and do not preach the gospel, the angels become unemployed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The angels might say, We would like to sing, but there is nothing to sing about.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have seen many people being saved and have become accustomed to it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, it seems that we are not interested, and we do not have energy for it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As a result, many saints take a leave of absence from preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They even go into hibernation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, in the matter of preaching the gospel, we have been on leave long enough.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We cannot hibernate any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now is the time to wake up.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must all awake from our hibernation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Regardless of whether we are young or old, we should rise up, preach the gospel, and rescue souls.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>LEADING AT LEAST ONE PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>TO SALVATION EVERY YEAR</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the time that we should devote ourselves to preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should consider the Lord s heart as well as the feeling of the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The angels look forward to the salvation of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are promoting every saint and every home to preach the gospel, especially to preach the gospel in the community and even to go to the countryside.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our desire is for many more people to be led to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In all of Taiwan there are at least nine to ten thousand saints who meet regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It should not be difficult for every one of these saints to lead one person to salvation each year.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all have relatives and friends, but are they all saved?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These are not harsh words.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One day the Lord will come to us and ask, Where are the ones that you led to salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Luke 19 shows that the salvation given to us by the Lord is our capital.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord has given each one of us one mina.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord said that we could give the money to the bank, and when He returns, He will collect the principle plus the interest v. 23 . Who is the bank? The bank consists of those whom we have led to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We deposit salvation into those whom we lead to salvation, and these ones become our bank.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We can continually distribute this one mina to people, and it will not be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Eventually, the one mina will gain ten minas.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we read Luke 19, we must pay attention not only to the story of Zaccheus s salvation but also to the story after Zaccheus obtained salvation; that is, we should distribute salvation to others.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this way, we can gain ten minas.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Ten minas might not represent ten; it might be a thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The number ten signifies completion.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When the Lord returns, He will settle accounts with His slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He will ask us whether we utilized His salvation to save others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our answer will determine whether we can reign with Him when He gains His kingdom and returns to establish it on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is not our imagination but a prophecy that will be fulfilled.</S>
