   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ENTRUSTED WITH GOD S RULING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Quarrels and opinions in a local church are the issue of human relationships and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, a church that is lively and in full harmony yet does not give others the sense of God s dominion and ruling may also contain only the element of man and the things of man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It may not have the element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is proper to love, but love must be with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Love without authority is either leaven or honey; it does not come from God or from God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Real love is neither leaven nor honey but salt.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the saints in a local church love one another in God, others can sense God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This can be compared to salt in the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The salt in the meal offering is something of God and of the cross; it is something eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is neither leaven, which is corruption, nor honey, which is of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Behind real love is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whoever touches such love touches authority; wherever this kind of love is, there is God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The brothers and sisters may say, We all love one another, and the church is full of love.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, if everybody is happy and loose, this kind of love may simply be of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The love that is of the spirit and that comes out of the Lord s love is the embodiment of authority; love is the embodiment of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Any proper expression in the church should also be the embodiment of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whether a church is normal or meets God s requirement can be tested by authority; it can be tested by the presence of God s authority and ruling in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When people touch the church, do they touch God s authority and sense that God is ruling and enthroned?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Or do they sense the ruling of the will of man and the things of the world?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a test to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many times man s zeal, excitement, or even man s working for the Lord is enthroned.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the church life we often touch these things instead of touching God s dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is only when we are enlightened before God that we can truly see that the church is entrusted with God s ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should allow God to rule in our work, in our love for the brothers and sisters, and in our zealousness for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is something within us that flows out from the throne in the heavens; this flow brings God s authority into us and among us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When people touch us, they should touch God s ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May we all see that this is the church; this is the proper condition of the Body of Christ on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this condition we have God s glory and image, and we can also sense God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, people may not sense God s presence when they touch zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, we may touch people who work fervently and serve diligently in the church life, yet we may not sense God s presence with them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I believe we all have had this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, whenever we touch God s authority, we immediately bow our heads and worship the Lord, saying, Lord, I worship You because You are here.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we touch authority, we touch the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Zeal cannot represent the Lord, neither is it the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should all be clear that authority not only represents the Lord, it is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The normal expression of a church involves the presence of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE LORD BEING ENTHRONED AND</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>REIGNING IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some responsible brothers may say, We are the authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This word should not be spoken lightly; those who speak in this way need to be dealt with and disciplined because they are speaking nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the revelation of the Bible, the responsible brothers in themselves are not the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When they allow God to reign in them, the God who is expressed through them is the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When they and the church in which they serve allow God to reign, the expression of God s authority is among them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Authority is nothing other than God expressed among us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Any local church that does not have the expression of God does not have authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The exercise of man s authority by organization, arrangement, or having a name or position is shameful and hypocritical.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The real authority comes when a group of God s children submit themselves under God s lordship and allow God to reign.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When God is enthroned in our midst, there is authority among us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The responsible ones in the church are deputy authorities established by the Lord, but if the Lord cannot sit on the throne and reign in a church, that church will have no authority.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There may be responsible ones, but there will not be any authority.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The real authority of the church is in God s having the position to reign in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then authority will automatically be expressed in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May the Lord give us grace so that we do not think that we have obtained the light after simply reading a message on authority or listening to a message on the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May we be inwardly touched by the Lord s grace and enlightened to see our real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How much of God s authority is truly being expressed among us?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How much of God s authority is in our meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God is asking these questions, and we also should ask ourselves these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must see this basic principle God s authority is not expressed in an individual man but in a corporate man; this man is the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must not remain in Genesis 1; we must proceed to the Gospel of Matthew to see that authority is expressed in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There must be a group of people who are saved by God to become the church entrusted with His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In other words, only a group of people who are built up as the Body of Christ can express God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The requirement of authority is on the church.</S>
