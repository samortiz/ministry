   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 9b is a word about removing the yoke from their midst, the pointing of the finger and the speaking of wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the church life today, some may gossip about others and criticize them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To do this is to point the finger at others and to put a yoke on them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some may think that they are right and others are wrong, that they are spiritual and others are not serious with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result, these ones condemn others in the church life, and their condemnation becomes a yoke on others' shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For instance, an elder may be criticized to such an extent that he does not know how to serve as an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the eyes of certain saints, he is wrong, no matter what he does.</S>
