When I read this verse as a young man, it meant nothing to me. But now I realize that this verse is very meaningful. At the end of chapter twelve, the heavenly King, having been fully rejected by the leaders of the Jewish religion, made a break with them. On that day He went out of the house and sat beside the sea. This is very significant. The house signifies the house of Israel (10:6), and the sea signifies the Gentile world (Dan. 7:3, 17; Rev. 17:15). The King’s going out of the house to sit beside the sea signifies that after His break with the Jews, He forsook the house of Israel and turned to the Gentiles. It was after this, while on the seashore, that He gave the parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom. This signifies that the mysteries of the kingdom were revealed in the church. Hence, all the parables in this chapter were spoken to His disciples, not to the Jews.</p><p>Verse 2 says that great crowds were gathered to Him. But this does not mean that all those in these great crowds became His relatives. Verse 2 also says, “He stepped into a boat and sat, and all the crowd stood on the shore.” The boat, which was in the sea but not of the sea, signifies the church, which is in the world but not of the world.</p><p>Verse 3 says, “And He spoke many things to them in parables.” He spoke these parables in the boat on the sea. Do you want to know the mysteries of the kingdom? [v. 11]. If you do, then you must leave the house and not stand on the seashore, but get into the boat close to the Lord. This is the only place where we can understand the mysteries of the kingdom.</p><p>Before we consider the parables in Matthew 13, I would like to impress you with some of the warnings found in this chapter.…The King of the heavenly kingdom used parables to reveal the things of the kingdom (v. 34) in order to make them mysteries to the opposing and rejecting Jews so that they would not understand them. From the time the King came to sow the seed until He comes back to reap the harvest, everything concerning the kingdom is a mystery to the natural mind. Only the enlightened mind of a submissive heart can understand these mysteries.</p><p>In verse 12…the words whoever has refer to the receiver and follower of the heavenly King; to such a one the revelation concerning the kingdom will be given in abundance. But the one who does not have is the opposing and rejecting Jew, from whom what the heavenly King has spoken and done will be taken away.</p><p>The reason those in that stubborn generation could not understand lay in their heart, which had become fat [v. 15]. Fat signifies the pride of having something.…That was the actual situation of the Pharisees. Because their heart had become fat, their eyes and ears were affected. They could see, but not perceive; they could hear, but not understand.
