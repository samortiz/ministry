   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONLY WORKING, NOT RETROSPECTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All things work together for good.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The orphanage has been back in Hankow for seventeen months now.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these seventeen months, I have learned many things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When my will was shaken to the point of falling and I was almost disappointed, the Lord said to me, "My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when reproved by Him."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From that time on, I dared not give up on myself or consider myself too poor to be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I went on, one step at a time, according to the light I had received.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I did not look back on the past.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am learning to have Brother Lawrence's attitude: "Only working, not retrospecting."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I do not care if things are bad or good.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lan Tsi-yi</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>August 10, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Mailing Address: P. O. Box 99, Hankow</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>LESSONS IN THE VALLEY OF SHADOW</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My heart is completely filled with happiness and rest because God is stirring within His children in His church in these days.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I give worship, blessing, and thanks to our heavenly Father, the everlasting God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He always hears man's prayers and accepts man's cries.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He forever supports those in weakness and comforts those in afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A bruised reed He will not break, and a smoking flax He will not quench.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I will now tell you a little of God's work, grace, and mercy on me in recent months.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I hope you will be able to teach and correct me in many areas so that I will not become proud or dejected.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In September of last year, God brought me into the valley of shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the beginning of October, I fell into trials.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I felt exceedingly heavy and depressed both inwardly and outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, in the deepest part of my heart, I still believed that time would bring me through.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Though I walked through the valley of the shadow of death, I feared not, because the Lord was with me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Of course, at that time I did not feel this way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While I remained in the valley of shadow, I was drawn to read the books of poetry, especially the book of Job In reading it, however, I discovered that I was short and had sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Job, who had fallen into such a serious trial, never sinned with his mouth or offended God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What about me?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I often blamed God and murmured against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sometimes I judged myself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If I had continued like that for a long time, I would have been like the Israelites who died in the wilderness; they could not enter Canaan because of their murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Later, God gradually led the brothers to pray that I would come out of the valley of shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>O dear brother, "Weeping may linger in the evening,/But a ringing shout goes up in the morning."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In May of this year, I finally came out of the valley of shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was like the bamboo shoots in spring that come out after the rain, and the honey that drips from the bees' nest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How fresh it was!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How joyful!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How sweet!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I felt that "I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the same time, I had a great inward thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>So I began to pursue.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I felt that I could not be a Christian in the way that I had been before.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I felt that being a Christian is not a matter of degree; it is a matter of the whole being becoming involved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was not a matter of being good or bad but a matter of being a model or living up to standard.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not a matter of curing a headache or a sore foot but of having a thorough examination and rooting out the source of the illness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I felt that a Christian cannot be loose in following the Lord; he must first sit down and consider the cost.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I finally felt that the first basic thing a Christian must do is consecrate his life and not be ashamed of the gospel, just as Paul did not hold on to his own life in proving the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The second matter was to stand absolutely on God's side and not to discount any of God's word at all.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Was not the first sin in the universe a twisting and discrediting of God's word?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should not just submit to God's word in principle; we should obey the clear writings too.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What do you think?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After this, I had a time like I never have had before of reading the Bible, praying, fasting, and dealing with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I thought of how desolate my many years as a Christian had been!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How poor!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have really been uselessly taking up space!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I also discovered that I had not learned any lesson during this time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I did not have a good attitude toward the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I had to ask God's forgiveness for this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When I read the first chapter of Matthew on May 26, it dawned on me that the first person mentioned was Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I felt that I should learn to give up things and be willing to consecrate myself like Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When I came to chapter two about Jesus' birth, I found how Herod's heart and even the hearts of everyone in Jerusalem were unsettled.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I said to myself, "Now I realize that wherever the gospel goes, it should unsettle men!"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May God give me a way to unsettle people when the gospel goes out from me.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I set my mind to make a gospel signboard to carry on my back.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After talking to some brothers in the university, we proceeded with it.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We made vests of white cloth, with many kinds of gospel slogans written on the front and back; we wore them in class, near the school, on the bus, and on the road back and forth between the meeting hall and the school.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we first began to wear them, we felt very embarrassed, but by the Lord's grace we told ourselves that we should not be ashamed of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This was the motivation and the beginning of our wearing the gospel vests.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Later, we marched on all the streets once or twice a week, wearing the vests and preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We did not just let the world hear it; we also let them see it.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I believe if we have three hundred people who are absolute for God and who do not care for their own lives, they will shake Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If there are three thousand people, they will shake the entire country.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If there are thirty thousand people, they will shake the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In this way the gospel will be quickly preached to the ends of the earth; it will hasten the coming of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>May God give us more people!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Have not the leading brothers said that the outward appearance of the church has been in desolation for two thousand years?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>May God give us mercy, that we would stop the desolation in this generation.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>May God quickly recover us to the original condition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>My hand is sore from writing this much, but my heart is burning and excited.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The preceding account is my small experience.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I do not hope to do anything great.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I just want to take my stand and advance the gospel "in one accord" with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If there are any errors in my letter, I hope you will feel free to correct and teach me.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
