Furthermore, in this verse the Lord said, &ldquo;Do this unto the remembrance of Me.&rdquo; Thus, it was not a remembrance of what took place in Exodus 12. Taking the bread of the Lord&rsquo;s table is done in remembrance of the Man-Savior.</p><p>Verse 20 says, &ldquo;And similarly the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is being poured out for you.&rdquo; Once again, this is not the cup of the Passover; rather, this cup is the new covenant in the Lord&rsquo;s blood.</p><p>God made a covenant with redeemed Israel in Exodus 24:3-8 (Heb. 9:18-21), which became the old testament, as a base for Him to deal with His redeemed people in the dispensation of law. The Man-Savior came to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal redemption for God&rsquo;s chosen people by His death, according to God&rsquo;s will (Heb. 10:7, 9-10), and with His blood instituted a new covenant, a better covenant (Heb. 8:6-13), which became the new testament after His resurrection (Heb. 9:16-17), as a base for God to be one with His redeemed and regenerated people in the dispensation of grace. This new covenant replaced the old covenant and simultaneously changed God&rsquo;s old dispensation to His new dispensation. The Man-Savior wanted His disciples to know this and live a life based on it and according to it after His resurrection.</p><h2 class="head1">REMEMBERING THE MAN-SAVIOR</h2><p>We have emphasized the fact that the Man-Savior instituted His supper, the Lord&rsquo;s table, after He and the disciples ate the Passover feast. He initiated His supper for His believers&rsquo; remembrance of Him to continue and replace the Passover feast, the Old Testament practice of the elect&rsquo;s remembrance of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation (Exo. 12:14; 13:3). This new practice of the New Testament is to remember the Man-Savior by eating the bread, which signifies His body given for His believers (1 Cor. 11:24), and drinking the cup, which signifies His blood shed for their sins (Matt. 26:28). The bread denotes life (John 6:35), the life of God, the eternal life, and the cup denotes blessing (1 Cor. 10:16), which is God Himself as their portion (Psa. 16:5). As sinners, their portion should have been the cup of God&rsquo;s wrath (Rev. 14:10). But the Man-Savior drank that cup for them (John 18:11), and His salvation has become their portion, the cup of salvation (Psa. 116:13) that runs over (Psa. 23:5), the content of which is God as their all-inclusive blessing. Such bread and such a cup are the constituents of the Man-Savior&rsquo;s supper, which is a table (1 Cor. 10:21), a feast, set up by Him so that His believers may remember Him by enjoying Him as such a feast. Thus they testify of His rich and marvelous salvation to the entire universe and display His redeeming and life-imparting death (1 Cor. 11:26).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_147.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_149.html">Next</a> </body></html>
