   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ERADICATION OF SINS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's salvation is different from our human concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His way is deliverance from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We think that everything would be all right if sins were uprooted from our being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But God's salvation is not the eradication of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He does not pull out our sins like uprooted trees.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The eastern mind always thinks that perfection is attained as soon as one has all sins repressed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But our person is one that loves to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It does not even want to suppress sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even when it tries grudgingly, there is no lasting result.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The way of God is not a subjugation of sin, nor is it a mortification of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is an exchange of person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The old man that was attached to sin is removed, and a new life that abhors sin is put in its place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When temptation comes, this new life naturally shuns it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this way, the body loses its function in regard to performing sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>GOD ONLY DEALS WITH THE OLD MAN</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, God's salvation is entirely different from the concepts of other religions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God does not deal with sin, nor does He touch the body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All He takes care of is the old man within.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This old man is just our life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the old man is put to death, it means that the old life is terminated, and a new life is put in its place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The two ends, sin and the body, are left untouched, but the middle agent is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sin can now no longer communicate with the body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The man that is constituted with this new life is called the new man in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When temptation comes again, the new man reacts very differently from the old one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He no longer hearkens to those lures.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He never seconds the motion of sin, and he never actuates the body to commit evil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The new man is diametrically opposed to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is deaf to the suggestion of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>UNEMPLOYED IN REGARD TO SIN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What about the body?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At this point, although the body is still willing to be a slave to sin, the power of the latter is blocked by the new man from being transmitted to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This new man no longer obeys sin or agrees with its proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Under these circumstances, the body has nothing more to do; it becomes unemployed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Formerly, my mouth constantly cursed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now it does not function that way anymore; it has lost its job.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>My hands that used to fight with others have been discouraged by the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now they no longer fight; they are likewise unemployed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My eyes, my ears, and even my whole body have become unemployed in regard to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is what the Bible means when it says, "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It clearly tells us that God deals with the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The result is that the body of sin is unemployed, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That means we will no longer come under the sway of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have nothing more to do with it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can see that the basic strategy in God's salvation is the removal of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our life is just the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In God's eyes this has to die.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If it does not die, it will produce millions of sinful offspring.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It will give birth to jealousy, pride, murder, adultery, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It has an inherent and insatiable love for sin, and no matter how much you suppress it, it will still run after sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It takes no effort for it to perform evil, but it is impossible for it to be patient, loving, and holy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is no other way for God to take but to pronounce death for this life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Its last breath has to be taken from it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It must be utterly terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When this happens sin will lose its partner forever.</S>
