   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A BOOK OF FORBEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The entire Bible reveals the divine forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may even say that the Bible is a book of forbearance and that, as revealed in the Scriptures, God Himself is forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, if you ask me to define forbearance, I would say firstly that forbearance is God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>CHRIST S FORBEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we have pointed out in foregoing messages, Christ Himself is our forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The four Gospels reveal that the Lord Jesus lived a life of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was forbearing with Judas and in His dealings with Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When He was twelve years old, He exercised forbearance toward His mother, Mary, and Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In case after case, the Lord displayed understanding, wisdom, patience, mercy, kindness, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was kind toward Judas, and with Peter He was full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>An excellent example of Christ s forbearance toward Peter is found in Matthew 17:24 and 25.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who received the half-shekel for the poll tax came to Peter and asked, Does not your teacher pay the half-shekel? v. 24 . Immediately Peter answered, Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When he came into the house, the Lord Jesus did not rebuke him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, He spoke to him in a way that was full of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, the Lord Jesus even gave Peter a means of supply to pay the poll tax.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By exercising forbearance toward Peter the Lord Jesus also taught him forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No doubt, when Peter was waiting for a fish with a shekel in its mouth, he had a good opportunity to be forbearing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In John 11 we see the Lord s forbearance with Martha and Mary, the sisters of Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead of acting in haste, when He heard that Lazarus was sick, the Lord deliberately delayed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through this delay others were exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In dealing with this situation the Lord exercised much understanding, wisdom, consideration, mercy, and kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually there was a great supply of life manifested in the resurrection of Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>PAUL S FORBEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul s life was also a testimony of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He wrote the book of Philippians from a prison in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul was suffering and, according to chapter four, he was short of supply and in want.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Among all the churches, the church in Philippi was the best in caring for Paul s needs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But for some reason, according to the Lord s sovereignty, there was a period of time when the Philippians seemingly forgot Paul and his need.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was the reason he says in 4:10, But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you caused your thinking for me to blossom anew.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This word implies that Paul had passed through a winter of suffering and that spring had come with the blossoming anew of the Philippians concern for him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But even though Paul was suffering imprisonment, persecution, attack, negligence, and the lack of supply, he still exercised forbearance and could declare, I have learned, in whatever circumstances I am, to be content.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to be in want.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I can do all things in Him who empowers me 4:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before he charged the saints to let their forbearance be known to all men, he exercised forbearance himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No doubt, Paul s forbearance was made known to those around him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was full of understanding, wisdom, considerateness, sympathy, mercy, and kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was also full of the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we read the book of Philippians carefully, we shall see that 3:17-21 is a separate section.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that, spiritually speaking, 4:1 is the continuation of 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After exhorting the saints to walk by the same rule, Paul charges them to stand firm in the Lord 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then he urges them to rejoice in the Lord v. 4 and to let their forbearance be known to all men v. 5 . Later in chapter four he testifies that he can do all things in the One who empowers him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, Paul could make his forbearance known to the saints because he was in the One who empowered him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, he was content, having learned the secret both how to be abased and how to abound.</S>
