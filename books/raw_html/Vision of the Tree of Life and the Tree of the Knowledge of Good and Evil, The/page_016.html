        <h2 class="head2">The Principle of the Ministry of the Prophets<br />
Being to Call People to Enjoy the Tree of Life</h2>
<p>A prophet breathes God, lives in God, and is joined to God. A prophet serves as God&rsquo;s spokesman and God&rsquo;s expression; hence, his words are God&rsquo;s words. A prophet&rsquo;s ministry and his words are to call people to enjoy God. A prophet tells people that God was incarnated to be a man, Immanuel, in order to bring man into the experience of enjoying God in Christ as man&rsquo;s food and man&rsquo;s life. In other words, a person who ministers as a prophet enjoys the tree of life so that he can call others and lead others to also enjoy the tree of life. May we be enlightened to see and grasp this principle. Then we will see that all the Epistles in the New Testament were written according to this principle. The writers of the New Testament Epistles were prophets; they were joined to God, filled with God, and lived in God. They breathed God, so they became His expression and His spokesmen; their words were God&rsquo;s words. The message, the ministry, of every Epistle is to lead people into enjoying God in Christ as their life.</p>
<p>If a brother who functions as God&rsquo;s mouthpiece is enlightened to see that a prophet enjoys the tree of life so that he may call others to enjoy the tree of life, he will lose his taste for other types of messages. His desire will be to speak only of Immanuel, that is, God coming in the form of food to be man&rsquo;s life. God wants to be mingled with man to become man&rsquo;s element and to be everything to man. This does not mean that we do not understand other topics but that they have become tasteless. The tree of life has become our yardstick for measuring every message. Any message that is apart from God coming to be man&rsquo;s life, Immanuel, is a wind of teaching spoken of in Ephesians 4:14. Messages that are not winds of teaching are spoken by persons who enjoy God as life, who are His expression, and who lead others to live in Christ and to enjoy Him as their life. Only such messages are called messages of life. They are spoken by persons who minister as prophets. Only such messages can give people the supply of life.</p>
<p>We must ask ourselves whether our messages are winds of teaching or messages of life. This is a serious question. Our messages may be according to the Bible, but if they cannot lead others to enjoy life, they are winds of teaching. Persons who genuinely minister as prophets, that is, who enjoy the tree of life, live in God, and allow God to fill them, will become an expression of God and will speak for God. They will bring others to enjoy God as their life because they give messages of life. All other messages are winds of teaching and are accursed.</p>
<p>Ninety-nine percent of the messages given in Christianity are concerning doing things. They are winds of teaching that lead people to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The things that God tore down in the Old Testament saints are being built up in Christianity, because there is a lack of light concerning the principle of the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>A person who desires to genuinely minister as a prophet must be delivered from the tree of knowledge and live in the tree of life. The book of Isaiah is not concerning fearing God, because Isaiah was a person who breathed God (12:4). The book of Hosea is not concerning morality, because Hosea was a man living in God (chs. 1&mdash;3). The book of Ezekiel is not concerning the law, because Ezekiel was a person living in God. He saw that men were like a pile of dry bones and that only by God breathing His breath into them can they be made alive (37:2, 5-10). The books of the prophets reveal that the prophets were delivered from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and lived in God, in the tree of life.</p>
<p>What the prophets enjoyed was a foretaste. When they were enjoying the tree of life, they prophesied concerning the coming of Christ as the reality of the tree of life. For example, Isaiah says, &ldquo;Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel&rdquo; (7:14), and &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; / And the government / Is upon His shoulder; / And His name will be called / Wonderful Counselor, / Mighty God, / Eternal Father, / Prince of Peace&rdquo; (9:6). On the one hand, the Old Testament prophets enjoyed the anticipated tree of life, and on the other hand, they prophesied that Christ would come as the reality of the tree of life. In principle, we are doing the same today; however, we are not in the prophecy but in the reality. The line of the tree of life is seen in the Old Testament prophets, and it is the principle of the ministry of the New Testament prophets.</p>

            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
