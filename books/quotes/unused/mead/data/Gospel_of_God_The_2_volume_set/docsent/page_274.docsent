   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This is a heifer, a female cow, signifying that this sacrifice was offered up for believers.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is red.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That means it is offered up for the redemption of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Bible, red signifies the redemption of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every time the Bible mentions scarlet or red, it implies sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The woman in Revelation 18 rides on a scarlet beast and wears a scarlet robe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These refer to her sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Numbers 19:4 tells us what happens after the heifer is slaughtered.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"And Eleazar the priest shall take some of her blood with his finger, and shall sprinkle some of her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The priest did not do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He only sprinkled some blood before God in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows us that the death of the Lord Jesus has satisfied the requirements of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The blood was not sprinkled on the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was sprinkled directly before the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The tabernacle is the place where God met with the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is a type of the fellowship between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Where God's tabernacle is, there God is also.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is the tabernacle; He is God living among men.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is full of God's grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He tabernacled among us John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How can we have fellowship?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There must be the blood, that is, sin must be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If there is no blood, man cannot come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are only two ways for man to come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Either he comes without sin, or he comes with the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you are without sin, you can come to God in bold strides, and He can do nothing to you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if you have sin, there must be the shedding of the blood Heb 9:22 , because God must judge sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If sin is not judged, man cannot have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God cannot overlook man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God cannot let man's sins go by.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If man has sin, he must come to God with the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is a judging God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without passing through judgment, sin cannot be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Judgment demands the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, there must be the shedding of the blood before fellowship can be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The blood was sprinkled seven times.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Seven signifies perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The death of the Lord Jesus has satisfied God; His blood is sufficient to wash away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here all the problems are completely solved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's righteous requirements are met.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God said that the work is done.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the work of the Lord Jesus on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It has been done once and is forever finished.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no need for another red heifer to die.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is good enough for one red heifer to die.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the first part of this offering we see that the sprinkling of the blood signifies that the problem of the sinner is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This part of the offering is the same as all the other offerings in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are all just the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now we have to consider the second part of the offering, which shows us what is to be done for the sins of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Numbers 19:5 says, "And the heifer shall be burned in his sight."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is most unique, for the heifer was not simply burned, but "her skin, her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall be burned; and the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet, and cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God judged sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After a little of the blood was sprinkled, the rest of the blood was poured into the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then the whole heifer was also cast into the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The priest burned the whole heifer skin, flesh, blood, dung, and all.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In addition, cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet were all cast into the midst of the burning.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In verse 9 we are told what happened after the heifer was burned: "A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and place them outside the camp in a clean place; and they shall be kept for the assembly of the sons of Israel for the water for impurity; it is a purification of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After the heifer was slaughtered, the blood was applied.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But after the heifer was burned and became ashes, the ashes were to be applied.</S>
