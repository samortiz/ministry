<p class="bold">WEEK 8 — DAY 4</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 12:9-10, 13-14, 18, 20-21</h2><p>9 &nbsp;And departing from there, He came into their synagogue.</p> <p class="bold">10 &nbsp;And behold, a man who had a withered hand was there. And they asked Him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath? so that they might accuse Him.</p><p class="bold">13 &nbsp;Then He said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And he stretched it out and it was restored, as sound as the other.</p><p>14 &nbsp;But the Pharisees, going out, took counsel against Him as to how they might destroy Him.</p><p class="bold">18 &nbsp;“Behold, My Servant whom I have chosen, My Beloved in whom My soul has found delight. I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will announce justice to the Gentiles.</p><p class="bold">20 &nbsp;A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench until He brings forth justice unto victory.</p><p>21 &nbsp;And in His name will the Gentiles hope.”</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>After winning the case with the Pharisees, the Lord Jesus came into their synagogue. This took place on another Sabbath day (Luke 6:6).…In the synagogue was a man with a withered hand. When the Pharisees inquired of the Lord whether it was lawful to heal on the Sabbath, He said to them, “What man will there be among you who will have one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out? Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! So then it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath” (vv. 11-12). [Following this], the Lord gave the man the word, “Stretch out your hand.” In the Lord’s word was the enlivening life. By stretching out his hand,…his withered hand was restored by the life in this word.</p><p>Leading the disciples into the grainfields [v. 1] indicates that the Lord cares for Himself as the Head of the Body. As the Head, He is everything—the real David, the greater temple, and the Lord of the Sabbath. Restoring the withered hand signifies that He cares for His members. He healed a man’s withered hand, likening this man to a sheep. The hand is a member of the body, and the sheep is a member of the flock. The Lord would do anything for the healing of His members, for the rescue of His fallen sheep.…He does not care for the Sabbath. He cares only for His headship and for the members of His Body.</p><p>In the eyes of the religious Pharisees, for the Lord to break the Sabbath was to destroy God’s covenant with the nation of Israel, that is, to destroy the relationship between God and Israel. Hence, they took counsel against Him, as to how they might destroy Him.…They were absolutely blinded, veiled, covered, by their religion.…At this point, 12:14, the rejection of Christ by religion reaches its peak.</p><p>[Verse 18] indicates clearly that because of the Jew’s rejection, the heavenly King with His heavenly kingdom would turn to the Gentiles, and the Gentiles would receive Him and trust in Him (v. 21).</p><p>While He was being rejected and opposed, He was still full of mercy [v. 20]. The Jews were accustomed to making flutes of reeds. When a reed was bruised, they broke it. Also they made torches out of flax, which can burn oil. When the oil ran out, the flax smoked, and they quenched it. Some of the Lord’s people are like the bruised reed that cannot give a musical sound; others are like the smoking flax that cannot give a shining light. Yet the Lord will not break the bruised ones or quench the smoking ones.</p><p>This portion of the Word reveals that, on the one hand, the Lord is bold and that, on the other hand, He is merciful.…Do not think that in chapter twelve the Lord was defeated.…He was not defeated; He was establishing His kingdom.…This is the way the kingdom of the heavens is built. It is built through being attacked, persecuted, and criticized.
