<h1 class=series>AN OPENING WORD TO THE FULL-TIME TRAINEES CONCERNING REGULATIONS AND OPINIONS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO</h1><h1 class=title>OLDNESS AND OPINIONS VERSUS REVELATION AND OBEDIENCE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Acts 10:9-16; 18:24-28; 19:1-5; 1 Cor. 16:12; Acts 15:36-41</h1><p>In the previous message, we saw that life grows by regulation toward maturity and function. We all have to realize that the proper regulation comes from revelation, and this kind of regulation that comes from revelation always brings us into the proper obedience. Regulation comes from revelation, and revelation brings us into obedience. Only one kind of obedience can be counted worthy in the eyes of God, and that is the obedience that comes out of revelation (cf. Acts 26:19).<p>Let us consider the case of Saul of Tarsus, who became the apostle Paul. He was a strong character. It was not so easy to bring him to the right track. The proper obedience is to get on the right track. When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, he got on the right track, and that was his obedience. His obedience was not through man’s doing, teaching, exhortation, or advice but through the heavenly revelation. On the way to Damascus, he was met by the Lord, and he not only heard but also saw something (Acts 9:1-9). He later told us in Galatians that at that time a revelation came to him to reveal God’s Son into him (1:16). He did not just experience a kind of outward view, but something got into him as an inner revelation that knocked him down, that subdued him, that restricted him and got him on the right track.<p>In this message I want to talk with you about oldness and opinions versus revelation and obedience. Throughout my many years in the Lord’s service, in the Lord’s ministry, I have seen many cases of oldness and even more cases of opinion. In the church life among the saints, opinions are more prevalent than oldness. Oldness is terrible, but opinions are much more common among human beings. Every human being is a constitution of opinions. All of us were born sinful and have been constituted with opinions. Even though it has been a while since you have been regenerated, your constitution still is probably full of opinions.<h2 class=head1>THE TROUBLE WITH ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA</h2><p>The book of Acts tells us that the early church passed through a number of troubles. The first trouble the church faced was the falsehood of a couple, Ananias and Sapphira (5:1-11). They lied to the Holy Spirit, to the church, and to Peter. They were judged for this sin.<h2 class=head1>THE TROUBLE CAUSED BY LANGUAGE DIFFERENCES</h2><p>The second trouble was due to the matter of language. Some Jews who spoke Greek, the Hellenistic Jews, began to murmur (6:1). This trouble was caused by language differences.<h2 class=head1>THE TROUBLE OF PETER’S OLDNESS</h2><p>The third trouble was with Peter due to his oldness. He was the top one used by the Lord at his time, and he was the leading one both in the church life and in the ministry. He was such a wonderful person. But when we read chapter ten of Acts, we realize that Peter was somewhat short, and his shortage was due to his oldness. He was holding on to his old understanding of God’s way because he was born, raised up, and taught as a Jew.<p>As Peter was praying, a trance came upon him and he saw a vision of a great sheet descending from heaven, full of unclean animals (vv. 9-12). A voice came to him, saying, “Rise up, Peter; slay and eat!” (v. 13). This was not a voice that came from Hades. It was a voice that came from the heavens. No doubt, Peter realized it was the voice of the Lord. But he still dared to tell the Lord something vice versa. He was so bold to talk to the Lord in a debating way. The Lord said, “Slay and eat” and he said, “By no means, Lord” (v. 14). Peter was a bold one, but he was not bold in the right thing. The Lord spoke this to him three times, but he did not let the Lord get through. He was stubborn in his oldness.<p>Without such a record in Acts 10, you could not imagine that Peter would be like this. He loved the Lord to the uttermost. We should not forget that when he was debating with the Lord, he was not doing anything sinful. He was on the housetop praying. As such a godly person who was so much in the spirit, he was exercising to contact the Lord. He was in such a good condition and atmosphere, yet there was the disobedience with him due to his oldness.
