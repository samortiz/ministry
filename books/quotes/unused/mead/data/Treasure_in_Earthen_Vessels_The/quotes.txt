[1]  "For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of our affliction which befell us in Asia, that we were excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living.
[2]  As we read 2 Corinthians carefully before God, we seem to meet two persons Paul in himself and Paul in Christ.
[3]  If we summarized Paul's message in this book, we could cover everything with his words in chapter four, "We have this treasure in earthen vessels."
[4]  In chapter one we see this treasure being put into the earthen vessel.
[5]  After reading these words before God, we spontaneously will see under His enlightenment that the earthen vessel does not hinder the treasure from shining.
[6]  Here we meet an earthen vessel, but the special characteristic of this earthen vessel is that a treasure has been put into it.
[7]  I do not know what this thorn was, but I know this thorn made Paul weak.
[8]  Before God, I confessed that I had been empowered, but I was angry because I did not know the reason God was treating me this way.
[9]  I dare not say that I was never tempted again, but praise God, from that matter I discovered God has other ways to meet our needs.
[10]  As soon as I met her, I knew that she had a quick disposition.
[11]  Finally, I would like to say that I especially thank God because no human weakness can limit God's power.
[12]  We tend to think that if there is sorrow, there should not be joy; if there are tears, there should not be praise; if there is weakness, there should not be power; if there is pressing on every side, there should be constriction; if there is casting down, there should be destruction; and if there are doubts, we should be unable to believe.
[13]  God wants us to arrive at the point where we see that everything human is just an earthen vessel to contain God's treasure.
