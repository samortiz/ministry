   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Excessive Withdrawal</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not Knowing the Power of Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nevertheless, it is of no benefit to merely realize that we are incapable in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The most important thing is to know the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God wanted Moses to know that it was God who had made man's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God encouraged him again, but Moses again refused.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Exodus 4:13 says, "And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When God heard these words, He was angry with Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While it is important to not have any self-confidence and self-trust God treasures this attitude and leads us to this attitude , we will still not please God if we stop at this and refuse to trust in Him further.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many times we need to be careful not to go from one extreme to the other.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If God has promised us the gift of speaking, and we still hesitate, we offend God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to watch out for a withdrawal that goes beyond humility and a timidity that goes beyond carefulness; we have to be careful or in the process of giving up our trust in ourselves, we will also give up our trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God brings us through death in order that we may be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Death is not the goal; resurrection is the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is useless to remain in death without being resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moses not only wanted to hide himself, but he had become sluggish.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He even thought that it was better for God not to send him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brothers, it is good that we realize our own weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if our weakness takes away our faith in God's strengthening, this knowledge of ourselves is harmful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Excessive consideration of our weakness is as likely to take us away from our trust in God as excessive consideration of our power.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many retreats and withdrawals are not signs of spiritual humility, but are timidity and laziness caused by our introspection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must be strengthened by His power on the positive side to become strong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers, in spiritual work, the most important thing is to be sent by God in a very clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus did not come to earth by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible says that He was sent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was the Father who sent the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At present, God's work is being ruined by too many volunteers who have not been sent by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God is not pleased with anyone who is not sent by Him and who works on his own.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God does not like man acting recklessly on his own.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Recklessness and rebellion belong to the same kind of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When a command is issued and we fail to carry it out, it is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When a command is not issued and we recklessly go ahead, that is also sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moses did not ask for this assignment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He did not want to go, but God kept ordering him to go.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One time I heard a Western missionary say that if we cannot cease working for God, God cannot use us to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we can cease working for Him, He can use us to save others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am not saying that man can be saved without God preaching the gospel through other men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if a work is not of God's will, we should stop it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not save anyone rather than act recklessly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we have not received God's command, we should remain quiet and motionless.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only such persons can be sent by God to gain others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today the church is suffering much damage not because of the outsiders' opposition or the unbelievers' damage, but because of the presumptuous actions of those who consider themselves orthodox in faith but who have acted without God's direction or command.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a result, what they have done has no spiritual reality or value at all.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The work which God never sent us to do or commanded us to do is like the house built on the sand; it is just gilded with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This work will temporarily stand and shine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, when it appears before the throne of judgment, it will vanish away.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only those works which are done as a result of closely following God's command will be of any use.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Receiving Circumcision</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Later Moses stopped saying anything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But he had to demonstrate that he had completely given up that which was of the flesh and of the natural man and that he had delivered these completely to death before he could save the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, we see that when Moses was on the way Jehovah sought to slay him Exo 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because Moses did not have the mark of the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Moses and his son had not received circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They were just like the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He was about to begin God's work, but he was still like the uncircumcised Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, God could not allow him to save the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God sought to slay him just to let him see that God's work cannot be done by uncircumcised people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then they were circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After this was done, the Lord allowed Moses to begin to save the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Later when the children of Israel arrived at the first station in Canaan, they also received circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What is the meaning of circumcision?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Please read Colossians 2:11.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>"In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This tells us clearly that circumcision means nothing other than the putting off of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What is the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The flesh is nothing but the natural abilities we acquired at our birth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord tells us, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Everything we possess before regeneration is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Everything we have after regeneration by the Holy Spirit is of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Natural eloquence, power, wisdom, intelligence, and good works are all of the flesh and of lust.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should cut off all of our natural talents by the cross of Christ, whether they are eloquence, wisdom, or power; they must all be cut away.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the circumcision spoken of in Colossians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The work of God can be done only by those who have been slain by God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There is no place for the flesh before God but death.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Those who follow the flesh are the ones that God wants to slay.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God's work requires that man die.</S>
