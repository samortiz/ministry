   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Afterward, He lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He first lived in a poor carpenter s family in Nazareth for thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When He was thirty years old, He came out of Nazareth and began to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>While He was working as a carpenter, He was found in the likeness of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Philippians 2 says that He became in the likeness of men and was found in fashion as a man vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When He was found by people as a man, He had the likeness not of an angel but of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Passing through Death</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then He passed through the process of death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The process of the death of the Lord Jesus is special.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not die on the cross in a common way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His way of passing through death was a very special process.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the book of Colossians, while He was passing through death, there was a spiritual warfare at the cross Col 2:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While His flesh was being put to death there, His Spirit was still working there 1 Pet 3:18b-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then He entered into Hades, passed through Hades, and came out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When He was passing through Hades, He remained for a period of time to carry out His work there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Afterward, He came out of Hades and out of the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Entering into Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When He came out of the tomb, He did not come out hastily.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, He came out gracefully, taking off and folding in an orderly way the linen cloths He wore in His burial.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the morning of His resurrection, the disciples went into the tomb and saw that the handkerchief and cloths were lying there in an orderly manner John 20:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This proves that He went out of the tomb calmly and gently.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He came out from death and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After He entered into resurrection, He was still in the midst of the disciples and stayed on the earth for forty days and nights.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In these forty days and nights He was within them and moved with them, yet they did not realize it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At that time the Lord s presence with the disciples was sometimes visible and sometimes invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was sometimes manifested and sometimes hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When He was manifested, the disciples felt that He had come.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When He hid Himself, the disciples said that He had gone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In fact, He had neither come nor gone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was simply there, allowing them to see Him in one instance and hiding Himself in another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When two sorrowful disciples were talking on their way to Emmaus, the Lord Jesus also joined them and went along with them, asking them what they were talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These two disciples condemned Him and said, Do You alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem and not know the things which have taken place in it in these days?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jesus said to them, What things?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They began speaking with one another and enjoyed it very much.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, these two disciples were not able to recognize that this person was the Lord Jesus Luke 24:13-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord put Himself before their eyes but did not manifest who He was.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They continued walking until they drew near to the village where they were going, and He acted as though He would go farther.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They constrained Him to stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As they were about to eat, they passed the loaf to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Lord Jesus broke the loaf, the eyes of the two disciples were opened and they recognized that He was the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When they did not recognize the Lord, He was there.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As soon as they recognized Him, He disappeared from them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The two disciples were no longer interested in eating but rushed back to Jerusalem where they found the eleven apostles and those with them assembled together.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They began to fellowship with the disciples the things which had occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In fact, what the disciples saw was even more than what the two disciples had seen.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As they were speaking these things, the Lord Jesus appeared again and stood in their midst and said to them, Peace to you vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>28-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the condition of the Lord in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today the Lord and we have the same relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes He is manifested and sometimes He is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sometimes we feel that the Lord is truly with us, but sometimes we feel that we do not know where He has gone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It seems that although our circumstances are very difficult, He is not with us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our situations are difficult, yet He does not appear to care.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nevertheless, when we feel that the Lord no longer cares for us, He appears again suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the Lord Jesus in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>THE TRIUNE GOD BEING PROCESSED</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>TO ENTER INTO MEN TO BE THEIR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our God is the God who put on humanity so that divinity could be mingled with humanity as one.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In addition, He completed the experience of human living, accomplished an all-inclusive death, and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is hard to tell whether such a One is physical or spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You may say that He is spiritual, but He could be touched by the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the other hand, you may say that He is physical, but He was able to enter into a room where the doors were shut.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After His resurrection He became such a mysterious One.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now He has put Himself into His words so that the gospel we preach and every sentence we speak is He Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is in the words which we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When these words are spoken and when they touch the spirit of a person, this person is enlightened to say, Lord Jesus, and He enters into him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Such entering is the entering of the Triune God, the entering of God yet man, who completed human living, passed through death, and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He enters into man with His human living, death, resurrection, His divinity, and His humanity, to be man s life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we go to lead a home meeting, it is a joyful matter if the new ones are kept and stabilized.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, this is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we are not able to bring them into the fellowship of life, what we do is simply a work of human affiliation, a work of dealing with people s emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When we lead them in the home meetings, they enjoy it very much, and when we visit their homes, they welcome us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All this is very good, but it is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We need to bring them into the Triune God who dwells in them so that they may have the fellowship of life with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Merely having contact with us is not enough; they must also contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Merely having fellowship with us is not adequate; they must also fellowship directly with God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is not adequate if we are the only one who fellowships with them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must bring God along with us so that they know that there is a Triune God in us and on us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Moreover, this God is also in them, so they can fellowship with such a One in life in their daily living not only when we are there but even when we are not.</S>
