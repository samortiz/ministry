Then the Spirit is the realization of the Son for the Son to reach us and enter into us. The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit. Now the Spirit reaches us and enters into us. When the Spirit enters into us, the Son is here and the Father is here. All three are here within us. The Spirit is within us as the realization of the Son, who is the embodiment of the Father.</P><P>As such a Spirit, He was not there before Christ's resurrection. In John 7:38-39 the Lord said, "He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified." At that time the Spirit was not yet. The Spirit of God was there from the very beginning (Gen. 1:1-2), but the Spirit as the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9), the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19), was not yet at the time the Lord spoke this word, because He was not yet glorified. Jesus was glorified when He was resurrected (Luke 24:26). The Spirit of God was there in creation, but before Christ's resurrection, the Spirit was not there yet because Christ was not glorified in His resurrection. This indicates that after Christ's resurrection, the Spirit is here.</P><P>God the Spirit in eternity past was merely divine. In eternity past, He did not have humanity within Him. He was only God, but not yet man. When He created the earth and man, He was merely God. Within Him there was no humanity. At the time of the incarnation, God entered into humanity and mingled Himself with humanity. He remained in a virgin's womb for nine months and was born as Jesus, a God-man. That little infant lying in the manger (Luke 2:12) was God and man. He was not only divine but also human.</P><P>When He became thirty years old, He came out to minister. He was a wonderful person who astounded those around Him. They wondered how He could have such wisdom and perform such works of power. They asked, "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us? And they were stumbled in Him" (Mark 6:3). He was wonderful in His dual life and nature. He had both the divine life and the human life. He had both the divine nature and the human nature. He was divinely human and humanly divine. He lived as a God-man. He wept, and He was hungry and thirsty. He felt what we as men feel, but He also was divine. Christ was a wonderful person on this earth, but He is not merely historical. He is living in us today as the One who is divinely human.</P><P>The biography of Christ actually starts from eternity past where He was merely divine. He, as the unique God, created billions of items with man as the center of His creation. He created man in His own image with the intention that someday He would come into this man to be man's content and man's life. But after the creation of man, He waited for about four thousand years to become a man.</P><P>About two thousand years after God's creation of man, He gave Abraham a promise, telling Abraham that his seed would be a blessing to all the earth (Gen. 12:3; 17:7-8, 19). This promise to Abraham was fulfilled in Himself, the real seed of Abraham (Gal. 3:16). He was telling Abraham that one day He would come as Abraham's seed. He would come to be born of Abraham's descendant to be a man. Thus, in incarnation He entered into man and put humanity on as a garment. From that day He has been wearing humanity and will wear humanity for eternity. Divinity wears humanity.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
