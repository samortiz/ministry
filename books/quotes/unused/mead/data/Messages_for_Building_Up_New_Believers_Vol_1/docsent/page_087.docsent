   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FAITH-PRODUCING PRAISE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 106:12 is a very precious word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then they believed His words; / They sang His praise.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was the condition of the children of Israel in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They believed, and they sang.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They believed, so they praised.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Praise has a basic ingredient faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You cannot praise vainly with the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You cannot say in a flippant way, I thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You must believe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only after you have believed can you praise.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When you have some problems or when you are sorrowful, you pray, and as you pray, a kind of faith rises up in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At that moment you open your mouth to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the living way, but do not do this in a light manner.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a man is faced with a problem, he should pray.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But as soon as he finds a little faith, as soon as he begins to believe in God and in His greatness, power, compassion, glory, and manifestation of His glory, he should begin to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a man acquires faith but does not follow it up with praise, he will soon find that his faith is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are saying this from our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once you have faith within, you should praise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you do not praise, you will lose your faith after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may have faith now.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But after a while, you will lose that faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we must learn to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must learn to utter words of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to open our mouths to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should have not only a mind to praise but also actual audible words of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have to praise God in the face of all your problems and in the face of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You should say, O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I praise You!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do this until you turn from having no feeling to having feeling, or from having a feeble feeling to a strong feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do this until you turn from little faith to full faith.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once God s glory fills your eyes, you can believe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once His glory fills your spirit, you can praise.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You have to see that God is above everything and is worthy of your praise.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you praise, Satan flees away.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes we need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But when our prayer reaches the point where we have faith and assurance, we know that the Lord has answered our prayer, and we should praise: Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I thank You!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I praise You!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This matter is already settled!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not wait for the matter to be over before you praise.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to praise as soon as we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not wait until the enemy runs away to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to sing to chase him away.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to learn to praise by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we praise Him in faith, the enemy will be defeated and driven away.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to believe before we can praise.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First we believe and praise, and then we will experience victory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>OBEDIENCE BRINGING IN PRAISE</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our problems mainly fall within two categories.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The first category is problems arising from the environment and the affairs around us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This was Jehoshaphat s problem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The way to overcome this kind of problem is by praise.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The second category is the problems within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Words may hurt us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Others may offend, persecute, mistreat, oppose, hate us for no reason, or slander us without any basis.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We may find these things unbearable, and we cannot get over them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These problems have to do with our personal victory.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A brother may say something which is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A sister may treat you in an unreasonable way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You may find it almost impossible to overcome these things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Your whole being may struggle, complain, and cry for justice.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You may find it difficult to forgive or pardon others.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is hard for you to overcome your feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You are wronged, slandered, persecuted, and you cannot get over it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Prayer does not help much.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You want to fight and struggle against it, but you cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The more you try to shake off this burden, the worse you become.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You find it hard to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Please remember that when you suffer great personal hardship and severe injustice, it is not the time for you to pray, but the time for you to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You should bow your head and say to the Lord, I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You are never wrong in what You do.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I accept all these things from Your hands.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If you do this, all your problems will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Victory has nothing to do with struggling with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It has nothing to do with trying to forgive others or striving to pardon others with one s own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Victory comes when one bows his head and praises the Lord: I praise You for Your way.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Your arrangement is always good.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Whatever You do is right.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When you praise the Lord this way, your spirit will soar above your problems; it will soar above your inner wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Those who are wounded in their feelings are short of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If you can praise the Lord, your hurt will turn into praise.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Your spirit will transcend to the heights, and you will say to God, I thank and praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You are never wrong in all Your ways.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is the pathway we should take before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Leave everything behind.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>What a glory this is.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is truly a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The Christian life soars through praises.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>To praise is to transcend everything to touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This was the pathway our Lord Jesus took when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We should take the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We should not murmur against heaven when we are under trials.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We should soar above the trials.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Once we praise, we are above the trials.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The more others try to put us down, the more we should rise up before the Lord and say, I thank You and praise You!</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Learn to accept everything.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Learn to know that He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Learn to know the works of His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Nothing can ripen and mature a man like sacrifices of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We need to learn not only to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit but also to praise the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We need to learn not only to accept but also to glory in the Lord s dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We need to learn not only to accept the Lord s chastisement but also to accept it willingly with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If we do this, a clear and glorious door will be opened to us.</S>
