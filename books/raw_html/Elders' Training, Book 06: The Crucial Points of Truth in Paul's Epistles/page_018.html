<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CRUCIAL POINTS<br />
OF THE TRUTH IN GALATIANS</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will cover the crucial points of the truth in Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the Galatians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT EVIL AGE</h2>
<p>In 1:4 Paul says that Christ &ldquo;gave Himself for our sins, that He might rescue us out of the present evil age.&rdquo; The crucial point in this verse is the present evil age. Although this point has been covered in a clear way in the Life-study of Galatians and in the footnotes of the Recovery Version, I would like to briefly cover it again. At Paul&rsquo;s time, a kind of evil age was prevailing which Paul called the present evil age. An age is a part, a section, or an aspect of the world as the system of Satan, which is used by him to usurp and occupy people and keep them away from God and His purpose. The present evil age here, according to the contents of this book, refers to the religious world, the religious course of the world, the Jewish religion. This is confirmed by 6:14-15, where circumcision is considered a part of the world&mdash;the religious world which, to the Apostle Paul, is crucified. Here the apostle emphasizes that the purpose of Christ giving Himself for our sins was to rescue us, to pluck us, out of the Jewish religion, the present evil age. This is to release God&rsquo;s chosen people from the custody of the law (3:23), to bring them out of the sheepfold (John 10:1, 3), according to the will of God. Thus, in his opening word, Paul indicates what he is going to deal with, that is, to rescue the churches which were distracted by Judaism with its law and to bring them back to the grace of the gospel.</p>
<p>While the Lord Jesus was on this earth, the Jewish religion was exposed to the uttermost that it was an evil age. If the Jewish religion had not been such an evil age, how could its leaders have put the Lord Jesus on the cross? To crucify Jesus was absolutely more than an evil thing. His crucifixion exposed the Jewish religion to be the present evil age. This matter was not merely individual but involved a generation. An age refers to one aspect of the world. The world is composed of many ages, while a generation refers to the people, to the Jews. Therefore, on the day of Pentecost in Acts 2:40, Peter, at the conclusion of his message, does not say be saved from God&rsquo;s condemnation or from eternal perdition, but be saved from this crooked generation! This refers to the perverted Jews in this age, who rejected God&rsquo;s Christ (Acts 2:36) and whose religion was considered by God as the present evil age. The Jews themselves cannot be separated from the Jewish religion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF GOD&rsquo;S SON IN US</h2>
<p>Another crucial point in chapter one of Galatians is the revelation of God&rsquo;s Son in us (1:16). This point implies that Christ is versus religion, tradition, and law. The Son of God as the embodiment and expression of God the Father (John 1:18; 14:9-11; Heb. 1:3) is life to us (John 10:10; 1 John 5:12; Col. 3:4). God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life (John 17:3; 3:16), and become the sons of God (John 1:12; Gal. 4:5-6). As the Son of the living God (Matt. 16:16), He is far superior to Judaism and its tradition (vv. 13-14). The Judaizers bewitched the Galatians so that they considered the ordinances of the law above the Son of the living God. Hence, the apostle, in the opening of this Epistle, testified that he had been deeply involved and far advanced in that realm. God, however, had rescued him out of that course of the world, which was evil in God&rsquo;s eyes, by revealing His Son in him. In his experience, he realized that there was no comparison between the Son of the living God and Judaism with its dead traditions from his fathers.</p>
<p>Christ being versus religion, tradition, and law can be fully applied to our present situation. In a very positive sense, in the eyes of God today&rsquo;s religion is an evil age, a crooked generation. Yet in such an evil age, Christ is being revealed in us. Therefore, this revealed Christ is versus religion, tradition, regulations, rules, and ordinances. God&rsquo;s revealing of His Son to us is in us, not outwardly but inwardly: not by an outward vision but by an inward seeing. This is not an objective revelation but a subjective one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>In chapter two there is a crucial point in verse 5&mdash;the truth of the gospel. Paul was strong against the Judaizers who made circumcision a condition for salvation. To such ones Paul &ldquo;yielded in subjection not even for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might remain with you&rdquo; (2:5). We have to spend some time to pick up all the related points to be able to present this item of the gospel to others as basic knowledge. In 2:5 and 14 Paul speaks of the truth of the gospel. The word truth in these verses does not mean the doctrine or teaching of the gospel; it denotes the reality of the gospel. Although Galatians is a short book, it affords us a complete revelation of the reality of the gospel in certain basic principles.</p>
<p>The first principle of the truth of the gospel is that fallen man cannot be justified by works of law (2:16, 3:11). On the contrary, we are justified by faith in Christ. Faith in Christ denotes an organic union through believing. There is only one term or condition of the gospel, that is, to believe in the Lord Jesus. Besides believing in Him there should be no other condition, no other term. You need to spend some time to study and to make an outline of this portion of the Word related to the truth of the gospel.</p>
