   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>For God s Expression</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Third, man was made to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Image and likeness both denote expression.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When God created man in His image and after His likeness, He did not put the divine life into him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The divine life was not imparted to the created man until Jesus came and died and was resurrected for us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now whosoever believes in Him has eternal life John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we have the Son, we have this divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not have the Son, we do not have this life 1 John 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God s life did not enter the created man until the accomplishment of Christ s full redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of Three Parts</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God created man with the intention that one day He would enter into man and that man would be able to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Romans 9 reveals that the man created by God is a vessel, intended to contain something.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Just as a cup is a vessel to hold water, so man was made as a vessel to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Genesis 2:7 tells us how God made man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, He made man s body from the dust of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then He breathed the breath of life into the nostrils of this body of dust, and man became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here in this one verse there is the body, the soul, and the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Hebrew word for breath in Genesis 2:7 is translated spirit in Proverbs 20:27, which says, The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah lit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>. This indicates that the very breath of life breathed into Adam was the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Two materials, then, were used to form man: the dust and the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The dust became the body, and the breath of life became the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When these two things came together, a by-product came out: the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, Paul tells us in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 that a human being is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Genesis 1 tells us that God created man in His own image, after His likeness; this was so that he could contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A container must be in the shape of the thing it will contain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If something is square, you would not make a round container for it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If something is round, you would not make a square container for it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The shape of the container is made according to the shape of its contents.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man was made in the image and likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Genesis 1 tells us that everything created brought forth after its kind vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>11-12, 21, 24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The apple tree brings forth after its kind, and the tiger after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man was made after God s kind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If two trees are grafted together, they must be of the same kind; otherwise, the grafting will not take.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man is of the same kind as God!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because we were created after God s kind, with the intention that we would be grafted together with God, this grafting will take and we can be made one with God.</S>
