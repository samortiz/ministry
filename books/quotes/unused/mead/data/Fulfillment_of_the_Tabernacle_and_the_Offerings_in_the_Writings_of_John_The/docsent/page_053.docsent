   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Pneumatic Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The all-inclusive Spirit, the immeasurable Spirit, is also the pneumatic Christ 2 Cor 3:6, 17-18; Rom 8:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I did not originate this term.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It has been used by others, including one writer in Kittel's Theological Dictionary of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we describe the Christ who lived on earth, we may speak of Christ in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The term "pneumatic Christ" refers to Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Due to the traditional teaching concerning the Trinity, some regard the Spirit as a person separate from Christ and then go on to speak of Christ being in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although it is commonly understood that the phrase "Christ in the flesh" refers to Christ Himself while He was on earth, not many understand the term "Christ in the Spirit" to mean that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This has made it necessary for certain teachers to adopt the term "pneumatic Christ" to denote the Christ who is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because of the influence of tradition, if we speak of Christ in the Spirit, others may think that Christ is separate from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They do not realize that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word "pneumatic" means spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, if we use the term "spiritual Christ" instead of "pneumatic Christ," there may be misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nowhere in the New Testament are we told that Christ, or the Son, is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible does say that the Father is in the Son and that the Son is in the Father John 17:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in the New Testament we do not have the thought that Christ is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, the New Testament reveals that the resurrected Christ became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, "The Lord is the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the pneumatic Christ, the very Christ who in resurrection has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In recent years I have read a number of books that point out that in Christian experience the resurrected Christ is identical to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is not a matter of theological doctrine; it is a matter of spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The immeasurable Spirit is actually the application of the unlimited Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the unlimited Christ is applied to us, appreciated by us, and enjoyed by us, He is the immeasurable Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, this immeasurable Spirit is the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE ETERNAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In chapter three of John eternal life is mentioned three times vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>15, 16, 36 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eternal life is the divine life, the life of the eternal God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This life is eternal in time, space, essence, function, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This eternal life is the very essence of the Triune God becoming the element of the universal increase of Christ, which is the eternal expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I would encourage you to dwell on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eternal life is the essence of the Triune God becoming the element of the church, the bride, and the bride is the universal increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For eternity this will be the expression of the Triune God.</S>
