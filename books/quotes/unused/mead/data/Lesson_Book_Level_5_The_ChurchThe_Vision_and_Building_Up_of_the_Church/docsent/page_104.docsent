   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SIZE OF CHURCH MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's ordained way for Christian meetings is to have two different sizes of meetings: small and large.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The smaller size is to be held or practiced in the believers' homes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not despise the small meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You may meet with your family or with a few other brothers or sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Apparently, such a small meeting seems insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But you have to realize that human society is composed of small homes with small families.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A community or society of millions of people comes from small families.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No human society can be built up without the small families in their small homes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In human society big gatherings are not held that regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead the husband, wife, and children come together in their own home every day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If every family is strong, the community and society will be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A. In the Believers' Homes</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The believers first met in the homes beginning on the day of Pentecost Acts 2:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Three thousand met from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Greek indicates that they met according to houses, which means that every house had a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There was a meeting in every new believer's house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This could only happen by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, there were many calling on the name of the Lord Acts 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the home meetings, according to Acts 2:46 and 5:42, they were preaching the gospel, teaching the truth, breaking bread to remember the Lord, and prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The saints around the time of Pentecost broke bread every day, that is, they had the remembrance of the Lord by practicing the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The saints also prayed in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Acts 12:12 tells us that when Peter was released from prison, he went to the house of Mary where a group of saints were praying.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Meeting in the believers' homes is for all the members of Christ to function.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In any big meeting it is hard for the saints to function.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But in a small meeting with four or five, or two or three, even a small boy or girl could function.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He or she could say, "The Lord Jesus loves me, and it is so good that I love Him.''</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a small function, but do not despise it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Matthew 18:20, in speaking about Christian gatherings, the Lord Jesus used the number of two or three: "For where two or three are gathered together into My name, there I am in their midst.''</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Two or three is a precious number in the Bible, and should be the starting number of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the church becomes big through the home meetings, the big meetings will be meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when the church does not have anything and expects to have a big meeting, that big meeting may be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To start the church life from a small meeting of two or three is best.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>B. In a Larger Meeting Place</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church should also have large meetings in a larger place for the whole church to come together l Cor.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There are two kinds of meetings: small meetings in the homes of the believers and large meetings in a larger meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These large meetings should not be held often.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To have these larger meetings should not be a constant practice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you practice the large meetings constantly, you will deaden the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You must learn to have the two kinds of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God's design of our body is symmetrical.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have two ears, two eyes, two nostrils, two lips, two shoulders, two arms, two hands, two thighs, two legs, and two feet.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the one hand, we need to begin the meetings in small homes; on the other hand, when the need arises we should hold large meetings in a larger meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the larger meeting place, we should not have any definite speaker with all the congregation listening to this speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must kill this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In such a meeting all the attendants should participate in the building up of the church through their functions l Cor.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>14:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we come together one may have a revelation, another may have a hymn, another one may have a teaching, and others may have another portion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everyone can and should have something of Christ for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all need to have something so that we can function in the meetings for the building up of the church.</S>
