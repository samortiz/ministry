   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE SIXTY-FIVE THE PROPAGATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ASIA MINOR AND EUROPE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PAUL S COMPANY 31 Scripture Reading: Acts 25:1-27</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the last four chapters of Acts, chapters twenty-five through twenty-eight, Paul defends himself twice.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, he defends himself before Festus 25:6-8 , and then before Agrippa 26:1-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Following his defense before Agrippa, Paul makes his fourth journey 27:1 28:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In these chapters we have a picture of people in three kinds of situations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have a picture of the Jewish religionists, the Roman politicians, and those in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE JEWISH RELIGIONISTS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us first consider the portrait of the Jewish religionists.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Judaism was formed according to God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, the Jewish religion was according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Jewish religionists had the holy Bible, the holy land, the holy city, the holy temple, the holy priesthood, and all the other holy things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, what these religious people did as recorded in the book of Acts was absolutely not of God but of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Acts 25:1-3 says, Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And the chief priests and leading men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they kept entreating him, asking for a favor against him, so that he might summon him to Jerusalem, setting an ambush to do away with him on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here we see that the Jews wanted to set up an ambush in order to kill Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, the Jewish religionists lied and exercised hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With them there was nothing holy or righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With them there was nothing that could be counted as being for God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this religion we cannot see anything spiritual or divine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the contrary, what was practiced among the Jewish religionists in the case of Paul was not only fleshly and sinful but even devilish and hellish.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The source of what they did was the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE ROMAN POLITICIANS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Acts we also have a portrait of the Roman politicians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In particular, we have an account concerning the commander, Felix, Festus, and Agrippa.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The higher the Roman politicians were, the more corrupt they were.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Felix was more corrupt than the commander, Festus was more corrupt than Felix, and Agrippa was more corrupt than Festus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the record in the holy Word, in the Roman political circle there was much corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we have pointed out, along with the Hebrew religion and Greek culture, Roman politics was one of the three elements that composed western culture.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But according to Acts, Roman politics was corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Acts 24:24 speaks of Felix and Drusilla his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Drusilla was a daughter of King Herod Agrippa.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Felix became enamored of her and persuaded her to forsake her husband and marry him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This shows the intemperance and corruption of Felix, a Roman politician.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Felix s corruption is also seen in his sending for Paul frequently in the hope that money would be given him by Paul 24:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Acts 25:13 speaks of Agrippa and Bernice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Bernice was a sister of Drusilla, the wife of Felix.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She was also a sister of Agrippa, with whom she lived incestuously.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This may be the reason that in 25:13 Bernice is not identified as being Agrippa s wife.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Roman politics certainly was dark and corrupt, full of sexual immorality and the love of money.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The record in Acts exposes the corruption of the Roman politicians.</S>
