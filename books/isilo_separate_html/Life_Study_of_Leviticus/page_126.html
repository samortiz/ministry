In Terms of Typology:</h2><h2 class=head3>1. Christ Divides the Hoof and Chews the Cud</h2><p>Christ divides the hoof and chews the cud (v. 3). When Christ walked on earth, His hooves were fully divided, and He chewed the cud. He was full of discernment, and He received the word of God with much reconsideration.<h2 class=head3>2. Christ Has Fins and Scales</h2><p>Christ has fins (v. 9). When He was on earth, He could move freely without being caught by worldly things. Christ also has scales (v. 9). Because of these scales, He could withstand the influence of the corrupted world.<h2 class=head3>3. Christ Has Jointed Legs above the Feet and Leaps on the Ground</h2><p>Christ has jointed legs above the feet and leaps on the ground (v. 21). Therefore, when He was on earth, He could live and move in a life that was above the world, and He could keep Himself from the world.<h2 class=head3>4. Christ Is a Spring or a Cistern That Holds Living Water</h2><p>Christ is a spring or cistern that holds living water (v. 36). He is the spring of the living Spirit of God, and He is also the holder of this living Spirit.<h2 class=head3>5. Christ Is a Seed for Sowing</h2><p>Christ is a seed for sowing (v. 37). This is clearly revealed in the New Testament.<h2 class=head2>D. Christ Is the Supply in Our Daily Life in Every Aspect</h2><p>Even such a chapter as Leviticus 11 is full of Christ. He is the supply in our daily life in every aspect. As the reality of all the positive things in the whole universe (Col. 2:17), He is all the clean living creatures. The clean living creatures that walk on earth, live in the water, and fly in the air are all types of Christ. Christ is the One who can soar in the air and live in salt water. Furthermore, all the offerings in chapters one through seven also typify Christ. In the sight of God, He is all the offerings. As long as we have Christ, we have the proper thing to contact, to eat, and to digest. In every way, He is our life supply. He is even our cleanness.<h2 class=head2>E. Only Christ Is Able to Keep Us Holy, as God Is Holy</h2><p>&#8220;I am Jehovah your God; you shall therefore sanctify yourselves and be holy, for I am holy....For I am Jehovah, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt to be your God; you shall therefore be holy, for I am holy&#8221; (vv. 44-45). Only Christ is able to keep us holy, as God is holy.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_125.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_127.html">Next</a> </body></html>
