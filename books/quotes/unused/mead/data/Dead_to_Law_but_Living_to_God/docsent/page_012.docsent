   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ALL THINGS OUTSIDE OF CHRIST BEING RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What then is religion?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In brief, anything that is outside of Christ yet appears to be rendering worship to God is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Anything that is not Christ yet teaches people the teachings of God is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the universe, only Christ Himself is not religion; only Christ Himself is the salvation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is religion?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Religion is any kind of worship and any kind of work outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If our worship to God is not related to Christ, is not mingled with Christ, and is not Christ doing it with us from within, then it is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>REAL SALVATION AND WORSHIP BEING CHRIST MINGLED WITH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then, what is the salvation of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And what is real worship to God?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The salvation of Christ is Christ mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The real worship to God is the Christ who is in us, who puts us upon Himself, and who fills us with Himself, worshipping God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this worship we are mingled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this worship Christ is there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This worship not only comes from Christ but also contains Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is in this worship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is mingled with us, He fills us with Himself, and He puts us upon Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To illustrate, we may say that a cup of tea is water, and we may also say that it is tea.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since tea has been blended into the water, the water is no longer pure water but tea-water.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The true Christian living is also like this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A Christian still conducts himself as a man, but he has Christ mingled with him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although a cup of tea is water, the element of tea has been added into the water; hence, if someone drinks this cup of water again, the taste will be different because the element of tea has been added into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SALVATION AND RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Please remember that a Christian is a person who has Christ mingled with him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ has entered into this person to be his center, his goal, his content, and his everything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is within him living out a mingled living, a mingled human life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is in his worship, his conduct, his humility, and his love toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes we may meet someone who is so proper and upright and who is a genuinely good person, but in him we cannot sense Christ or taste God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Other times we may meet someone, and as soon as we contact him, we touch Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That person is not only good and proper; he is more than good and proper.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Within him there is an element which is not found in others and which is hard to describe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the salvation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ being mingled with man is the salvation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Worship without Christ and improved behavior without Christ are religion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Worship with Christ mingled within and improved behavior with Christ mingled within are the salvation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we can discern this matter, we are blessed.</S>
