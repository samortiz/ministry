   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BODY FUNCTIONING UNDER THE HEADSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The divine administration is carried out by means of the church under the headship of Christ and of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Under this headship, the members of the body function with their gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the operation which carries out God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This can be done only in resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the realm of the divine administration first we have the headship, then the body, then the functions of the members by the gifts, and then resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Resurrection is Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This Spirit, the reality of the resurrected Christ, is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before His crucifixion and resurrection, the Lord Jesus said to Martha, I am the resurrection and the life John 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Resurrection, therefore, is a living Person, the wonderful Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this resurrection the Body functions under the headship to carry out God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The last matter dealt with in 1 Corinthians is the collection for the needy saints.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As Paul says, the offerings were given on the first day of every week.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first day of the week, the Lord s day, was a sign, a symbol, of the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, was a sign of God as the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now the first day is a sign that the Triune God has been processed in resurrection to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today our God is not the God of the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That is the Jewish God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our God is the God of the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that He is God not only in creation, but, much more, He is God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now we have God not only in creation, but also in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God in creation is for our worship, but God in resurrection is not only for worship, but also for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Jews know only how to worship God as the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, we enjoy our Triune God as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The God in resurrection is for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everything we do in the church life in principle must be on the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that everything must be done in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we live Christ and enjoy Him, experiencing Him, every day He will be resurrection to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then every day will be the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first day does not symbolize a day; it symbolizes the Triune God who, having been processed, has become an enjoyable, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now we may enjoy this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By enjoying the Spirit we are on the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is for God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I can testify that in my experience I am in the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am in resurrection enjoying the all-inclusive Spirit, the One who is the processed God to be my portion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hallelujah for such a portion!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In our meetings we may now carry out the divine administration in resurrection on the first day of the week, participating in the processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever I come to this point, inwardly I am beside myself with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Praise the Lord for the marvelous revelation in 1 Corinthians!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE NEED OF A PATTERN</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First Corinthians is a book that speaks of living Christ for the church, a book that tells us how to live Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Throughout the centuries, the Lord s people have not realized that 1 Corinthians tells us to live Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Believers have not had this language because they have not had the spiritual experience that gives rise to it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Language with its words and terms meets the needs of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, many years ago there was not such a word as computer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But after the invention of a computer, there was the need for a term to describe it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hallelujah for our new spiritual experience!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to this experience we need to live Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I can testify that my entire being is occupied with this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I do not have room for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every one of my messages issues from this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Outwardly I may do many different things, but inwardly I am always occupied with living Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I can testify that before giving this message, I was not clear what I should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I prayed like this: Lord, we are open to You.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have made no decision concerning this message.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Lord, we don t know what You want us to say.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Lead us and guide us, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Infuse us with Your thought and feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then deep within I began to sense that I should speak on the subject of a pattern of living Christ for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have emphasized that 1 Corinthians reveals that we should live Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But it is in 2 Corinthians that we have the pattern of living Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The wonderful and marvelous revelation in 1 Corinthians needs the pattern presented in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, after the first Epistle, Paul wrote the second Epistle for the purpose of showing the believers at Corinth a pattern of one who lives Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the following message we shall consider the details of this pattern.</S>
