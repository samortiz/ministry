	 <h2 class="head2">I. Receiving the Great Reward<br />
Which Is in the Heavens</h2>
<p>The overcomers will enjoy the great reward which is in the heavens. In Matthew 5:11-12 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me. Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.&rdquo; This reward is great and is in the heavens. Hebrews 10:35 says, &ldquo;Do not cast away therefore your boldness, which has great reward.&rdquo; The reward spoken of here is the kingdom reward to be given to the overcomers for their enjoyment in the coming kingdom, not in this age. Today in the church life the kingdom is an exercise. If the believers are faithful in the kingdom exercise today and do not cast away their boldness, they will be rewarded with the kingdom as an enjoyment in the coming age.</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Becoming the New Jerusalem <br />
in the Millennium</h2>
<p>Finally, the overcomers in the church will become the New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom. Revelation 3:12 reveals that the overcomers will be pillars built into the temple of God. Because they are built into God&rsquo;s building, they shall by no means go out anymore. That the name of God (God Himself), the name of the New Jerusalem (the city itself), and the Lord&rsquo;s new name (the Lord Himself) are written upon the overcomers indicates that the overcomers are possessed by God, by the New Jerusalem, and by the Lord. This also shows that what God is, the nature of the New Jerusalem, and the person of the Lord have all been wrought into the overcomers as a prize to them in the millennial kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The Christian life plus the church life is an overcoming life. Overcoming begins when people believe into the Lord. Through their faith in the Son of God and the overcoming life in them, the believers can live an overcoming life. According to the prophecies in the New Testament, the overcomers will be rewarded by the Lord in the kingdom age. They will reign with Christ in the millennium and receive the crown of righteousness, the unfading crown of glory, the crown of life, and the incorruptible crown. They will sit with Christ on the throne and have authority to rule over the nations. They will also gain their souls, enjoy the salvation of their souls, and share in the joy of their Master. They will participate in the kingdom feast with the overcoming saints in the Old Testament, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The Lord will set them over all His possessions. They will also inherit the kingdom of Christ and of God, be glorified with Christ, and inherit the eternal life. They will be the first people to receive the full enjoyment of eternal life. Their names remain in the book of life, they will not be hurt of the second death, and they will eat of the tree of life in the Paradise of God. The overcomers will also shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Because they are faithful in the kingdom exercise and do not cast away their boldness, they will receive the great reward which is in the heavens. Eventually, they will become the New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom. What God is, the nature of the New Jerusalem, and the person of the Lord will be fully wrought into the overcomers as a prize to them in the millennium.</p>
