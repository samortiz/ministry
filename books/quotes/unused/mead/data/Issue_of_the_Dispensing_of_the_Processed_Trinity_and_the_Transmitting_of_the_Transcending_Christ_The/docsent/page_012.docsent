   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Transforming Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After regeneration, the next step of the Spirit's sanctification is His transforming sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This takes place in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our regenerated spirit has never been a problem to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our problems always come from two sources: our soul comprising our mind, emotion, and will and our body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our untransformed mind, emotion, and will give us much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Following the regeneration of the sanctifying Spirit in our spirit, the sanctifying Spirit carries out His continuous sanctification to transform us in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We were regenerated, sanctified unto God, in our spirit, but we need the sanctifying Spirit's further work to sanctify our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the transforming sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This transformation implies renewing and conformation to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While the sanctifying Spirit works to sanctify us, we are being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second Corinthians 3:18 tells us clearly that transformation is by the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a strong proof that the Spirit's transformation is His work to keep sanctifying us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 12:2 says that we are to be transformed by the renewing of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The transformation of the sanctifying Spirit first renews our troublesome mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For us to be transformed, we need some new element added into us to carry away our old element and replace us with the new element.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a kind of metabolism which results in a metabolic change within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, we become another person in our thinking, in our feelings, and in our intentions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible says we are being transformed from the old man into the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a further step of the sanctifying Spirit, the transforming sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we have the seeking sanctification, the regenerating sanctification, and the transforming sanctification, which includes the renewing and the conforming to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Glorifying Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our full transformation will one day consummate in our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That will be the work of the sanctifying Spirit to glorify us in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Another thing that bothers us besides our soul is our poor, vile body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Lust, weakness, sickness, and death are present in our corrupted body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our body is really vile, but one day we will be glorified and transfigured in our body Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our spirit has been regenerated, our soul is being transformed, and our body will be transfigured, changed into a glorious body with no more lust, weakness, sickness, or death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the glorifying sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When all these four steps of the divine sanctification seeking sanctification, regenerating sanctification, transforming sanctification, and glorifying sanctification take place, we will be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will be qualified to meet the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By that time we will be able to shout, "We have been fully sanctified!"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today we are like a butterfly who is still in the cocoon.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually, we will come out of the cocoon.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We will not walk on this earth; we will fly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the consummating sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now we have seen the proper teaching of the New Testament concerning sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sanctification is the hinge of God's carrying out of His eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The sanctifying Spirit in God's sanctification first sought us out and then regenerated us, making us sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a cat begets kittens, those kittens are baby cats.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the same way, God begot us to make us the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To make us the sons of God is to make us "baby gods," having God's life and nature but not His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In life, in nature, and in expression we are the same as He is, because we are born of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, we are not only the children of God, we are not only the sons of God, we are not only the heirs of God, but we are also the "baby gods."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The kittens, the baby cats, are surely cats because they are according to the cats' kind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God created everything according to its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Man, however, was created according to God's kind because he was created in God's image Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Later, we men were born of God, not only bearing God's image but also having God's life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, we become God in life and in nature, but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is what the sonship means.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now we can see the intrinsic significance of Ephesians 1:4-5.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God chose us to be holy, predestinating us unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God dispensed Himself into His chosen people so that His chosen people could be holy as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our being made holy results in our being made sons of God, making us God in life and in nature, but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The carrying out of God's eternal economy is hinged on the divine sanctification unto for sonship.</S>
