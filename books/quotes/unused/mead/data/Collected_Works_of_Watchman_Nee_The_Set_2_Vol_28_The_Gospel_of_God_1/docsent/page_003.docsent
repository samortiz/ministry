   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE SIN, SINS, AND THE SINNER THE NATURE OF THIS MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TEACHING OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Tonight we begin a series of Bible-study meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But before we begin, I would like to first say a few words concerning the nature of these meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I do not know if there are some here who are with us for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some who come for the first time find it very hard to locate our address.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many have complained that the street we are on is difficult to locate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some have even said that though they were actually sitting here, they did not know how to leave from here after the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They did not know which way to turn to get to that auto shop they saw as they came here, and they did not know how to walk from there to the tram stop or to the bus stop.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though they were here, they were not sure of and could hardly remember the way they came.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the case with many Christians in their Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you ask them if they have believed in the Lord, they will say yes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if you ask them how they have believed, they will say that they are not sure.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are not clear at all about the way they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The meetings that we are having now are not revival or gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And while the subject of these meetings is the gospel, they are not gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are not preaching the gospel this time; instead, we are teaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why do we need to teach the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many have been saved and have become Christians, but they still do not know how they have become Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What we are doing today is telling people how they have become Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, we are telling them that they turned south from Aiwenyi Road and walked straight ahead to that auto shop they saw, that they turned from there to Wen-teh Lane where we are now, took a few steps from there to the window of our meeting hall, turned at the entrance of our hall and walked to a trash can by the door of the meeting hall, and then entered into the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This time we are not persuading people to come in; rather, we are telling them how to come in.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If there are some sitting here who have not believed in the Lord, they may be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What we are doing this time is showing those who have believed how they have believed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some brothers and sisters may be very clear about the gospel; they may already know what we are speaking about.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But I hope that the Lord would bless us and grant us new light.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You must be clear that these meetings are Bible-study meetings and are meant for those who have believed but do not know how they have believed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This time I am not trying to encourage you or revive you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am merely pointing out the direction to you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In other words, in these meetings I am nothing more than a tour guide.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>SIN, SINS, AND THE SINNER</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I will begin with a very basic foundation concerning the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet I hope that in every meeting we will advance a little.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this first meeting, our subject is one which most people do not like to hear about, but one which is unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our subject in this meeting is sin, sins, and sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Bible pays much attention to the matter of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only when we are clear about sin can we understand salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we want to know about the gospel of God and the salvation of God, we must first know what sin is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must firstly see how sin has affected us and how we have become sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only then will we be clear about what God's salvation is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We will first consider the ABCs.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to see what sin is, what sins are, and who is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SIN AND SINS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can easily tell the difference between sin and sins: sin is singular, and sins are plural.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, we need to distinguish between sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you cannot differentiate between the two, it will be impossible for you to be clear about your salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If someone is not clear about the difference between sin and sins, even if he is saved, his salvation is probably an unclear one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What is sin according to the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What are sins?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Let me give a brief definition first.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sin refers to that power within us that motivates us to commit sinful acts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sins, on the other hand, refer to the particular individual sinful acts that we commit outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I do not like to use terms such as "original sin," "the root of sin," "the source of sin," or the like.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These are terms created by theologians and are unnecessary for us now.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We will remain simple and consider this matter from our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We know that there is something within us that motivates and forces us to have certain spontaneous inclinations; it compels us toward the way of lust and passion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to the Bible this something is sin Rom 7:8, 16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But not only is there this sin within us that forces and compels us, there are also the individual sinful acts, the sins, which are committed outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the Bible sins are related to our conduct, while sin is related to our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sins are that which are committed by the hands, the feet, the heart, and even the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Paul refers to this when he speaks of the practices of the body Rom 8:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But what is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sin is a law that controls our members Rom 7:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is something within us that compels us to sin, to commit evil, and this something is sin.</S>
