   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW WERE MEN SAVED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If the blood of bulls and goats was not able to remove sin, as we mentioned earlier, how then were those in the Old Testament saved?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man had sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, only a man could accomplish the redemption of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although the animals were innocent, and although they were without blemish, they could not redeem man from his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why then did God promise in Leviticus 17 that the blood of creatures was able to redeem one from sin?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There must be some very profound meaning here.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The things of the law "are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ" Col 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the sacrifices and the offerings in the Old Testament all refer to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although Christ had not yet died at the time of the first covenant, God intended that all the sacrifices offered at that time be a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their death was taken as the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through the blood of many animals, God saw the blood of His beloved Son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through many bulls and goats, He saw "the Lamb of God."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through the many sacrifices, He saw the substitutional death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When He accepted those offerings, it was as if He was accepting the merit of the death of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because of this, man was redeemed from his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God reckoned the innocent bulls and goats as His dear Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, He could forgive the sinners based upon the sacrifices they offered.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every time the offerings were slaughtered, they spoke of the coming sacrifice of the Son of God as the sin offering on Golgotha and of His accomplishment of the eternal work of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because the Lord is a man, He is able to redeem man from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because He is God, He is able to redeem all men, past and present, from their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who offered the sacrifices in the Old Testament, consciously or unconsciously, believed in a coming crucified Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All their sacrifices were to turn them to the coming Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although the Lord Jesus was not yet born at that time, faith did not look at what could be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, it looked at what could not be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Faith saw a vicarious Savior from afar and trusted in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the time came, the Son of God came and died for men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What had only been a matter of faith then became a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>HOW ARE MEN SAVED IN THE NEW TESTAMENT?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We know that we are in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How are we saved in this age?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ has died and salvation is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we believe in the Lord Jesus, which means that by faith we receive Him as the Savior, we will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some have a hard time understanding how Christ could have died for them before they were even born.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Indeed this presents a problem to the physical senses.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet to faith, this is a glorious truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, we must realize that time cannot restrict God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To us mortals, a few decades is a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But our God is an eternal God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To Him, even a thousand years do not mean much.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although time can restrict us, it cannot restrict Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, even though we believe in a Lord who died once for us many years ago, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible says that the Lord Jesus offered up Himself once and accomplished the work of redemption Heb 7:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why He can transcend time to redeem those who were thousands of years before Him as well as those who are thousands of years after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not only can He redeem those thousands of years after Him; if, unfortunately, the world goes on for millions of years more, His redemption will still be effective.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once He finished His work, it was accomplished forever.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a sinner desires to be saved now, the Lord does not need to die for him again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This one only needs to accept the merit of the Lord's one offering, and he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our faith is not restricted by time either.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Faith can lead one into the reality of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As men in the Old Testament looked to a coming Savior and were saved, in the same way we look to a past Savior and are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The fact that the matter is past does not mean that it is over.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, it means that it is done.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The men in the Old Testament looked forward.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We at the present time look backward.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Faith caused those in the Old Testament to accept a coming Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Will not our faith cause us to accept a past Savior?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In reading Hebrews 9:12-15 it would be very meaningful if we link together the three "eternals" in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord accomplished an eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By offering up Himself to God through the eternal Spirit, we have obtained an eternal inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, whenever men believe in Him, they receive this redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We ought to realize that the worth of the cross is not determined by man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Rather, it is determined by God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God considers the redemption of the cross as eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, we sinners who have no righteousness of our own should acknowledge God's word as true and should act according to His word and believe in the cross of His Son and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>THE TIMELESSNESS OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the most crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Although the Bible says that the Lord Jesus offered up the sacrifice for sins once, it points out that "having offered one sacrifice for sins, He sat down forever..."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Heb 10:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The word "one" means that the Lord's sacrifice for sins was perfect; He only needed to redeem man from sins once.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, this sacrifice for sins is forever.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is an eternal sacrifice for sins!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This means that not only is the effect of this sacrifice for sins eternal, but the sacrifice itself is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Although Christ has resurrected and is living forever, it seems that His cross continues to exist!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>May we realize the timelessness of the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is not a past event of nineteen hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It remains fresh today.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Revelation 13:8 says, "The Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Our Lord is the slain Lamb from the foundation of the world until now and forever.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>To Him, the cross is not merely an event of a certain time, on a certain date of a certain month of a certain year.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Rather, it is something that has existed since the foundation of the world until now.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When He created man, He foreknew the price of the coming redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He created man with His power.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the same way He redeemed man with His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is as if He was crucified from the beginning when He created man.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>For thousands of years He suffered the prolonged suffering of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The one death on Golgotha merely signified the grief God's Spirit had borne for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What grace this is!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>What wonder this is!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We have no words to express the meaning of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Before the Lord Jesus left heaven, and while He was still in glory, He knew the suffering of the cross already.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He knew during the thousands of years before He came.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He knew this at the time of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Since eternity past, the cross has been in God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When we consider how in eternity past God knew that He was to create man and that man would become fallen, we realize how His heart, humanly speaking, must have grieved over it.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Because He so loved men, He ordained before the foundation of the world that Christ would die on our behalf 1 Pet 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Although Christ only appeared once in the last times for our sins, through His love for the world He has been grieving and aching since the foundation of the world, as if He has been crucified a thousand times already!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>What a pity that many people are now still grieving Him, as if crucifying Him afresh.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>When we realize such love of His, we cannot help but marvel and stand in awe before Him!</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is God's heart!</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If we realize this, will we not love God all the more?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Hence, humanly speaking, those in the Old Testament believed in a coming cross, while those in the New Testament believe in a past cross.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Actually, there is no distinction of time and period.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The cross of the Old Testament is a present one, and the cross of the New Testament is also a present one.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>May the Lord open our eyes to see that the cross is timeless.</S>
