   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 the Lord Jesus charges the saints to be overcomers 2:7b, 11b, 17b, 26-28; 3:5, 12, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To overcome in these chapters does not mean to overcome sin, the world, the flesh, the self, and even Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, according to the context of these chapters, to overcome is to overcome the degradation of the church. a Overcoming the Degradation of the Church</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The reason we need to be overcomers is that the church has become degraded.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Revelation 2:7b the Lord says, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this epistle, addressed to the church in Ephesus, to overcome means to recover our first love toward the Lord v. 4 and to hate the works of the Nicolaitans v. 6 , the hierarchy which the Lord hates.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 2:11b the Lord says to the church in Smyrna, "He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death."</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 2:17b the Lord says to those in Pergamos, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To overcome here means specifically to overcome the church's union with the world, the teaching of idolatry and fornication v. 14 , and the teaching of the hierarchy v. 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 2:26-28 we have the Lord's word to the church in Thyatira: "He who overcomes, and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations, and he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father; and I will give him the morning star."</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, to overcome in the epistle to the church in Thyatira is to overcome Catholicism, to overcome the apostate Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 3:5 the Lord says to the church in Sardis, "He who overcomes, he shall be clothed in white garments, and I will by no means erase his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels."</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The recovered church has already gained the crown v. 11 . However, if those in the recovered church do not hold fast what they have in the Lord's recovery until the Lord comes back, their crown may be taken away by someone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, to overcome here means to hold fast what we have in the recovered church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Finally, in the last of the seven epistles, the epistle to the church in Laodicea, which prefigures the degraded recovered church, the Lord says, "He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne" 3:21 .</S>
