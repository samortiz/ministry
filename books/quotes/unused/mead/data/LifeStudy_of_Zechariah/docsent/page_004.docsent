   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE PROPHETS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ISAIAH, DANIEL, AND ZECHARIAH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to make a comparison between the three prophets, Isaiah, Daniel, and Zechariah, in two matters: in God's economy toward His chosen people and in Christ for the people of His concern.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. In God's Economy toward His Chosen People 1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Isaiah</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Concerning God's economy toward His chosen people, Isaiah reveals that all the nations are for God's chosen people either positively or negatively.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's real concern is for Israel, and all the nations are utilized by God for Israel's benefit, both positively and negatively.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar was used in a negative way, whereas Medo-Persia under Cyrus was used in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Cyrus was chosen by God and was His delight.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God regarded him as the shepherd of His people in their captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Daniel</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Daniel all the nations are sovereignly under God's heavenly ruling for Israel to be God's witness and testimony on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Satan used Nebuchadnezzar to destroy Judah and to carry the Jews into captivity in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Satan's intention was to end God's testimony on earth with all His witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But he did not realize that among these captives God had four young overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whatever Satan would do, these overcomers had a way to counter it and annul it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They overcame the demonic diet, the devilish blinding, and the seduction of idol worship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All of Satan's devices merely resulted in God's testimony being strengthened and uplifted through His young overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, the authority to govern the land of Babylon was in the hands of Daniel and his three companions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Zechariah</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Zechariah all the nations' dealings with Israel are for Israel to experience Christ in their ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's concern for Israel is seen in His dealings with all the nations.</S>
