<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class="title">SPIRITUAL JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h1 class="title">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 30, 1948</h1><p>In the last chapter we saw the importance of judgment. In this chapter we will consider the importance of exercising our spiritual senses. In contacting others, we have to give them a chance to speak, and we have to learn to discern with our spirit. If a man does not open his mouth, it is hard to know him. It is rare that one can know others without first listening to them. Perhaps he can get an idea of the general nature of their spirit, but he will not be able to comprehend anything with understanding. Sometimes we know a person's spirit is wrong, but we cannot say how it is wrong. In The Character of the Lord's Worker, we pointed out that a worker must learn to listen; he must develop a habit before the Lord of listening to others. Even when others are pretending or drifting aimlessly, he still has to listen. If he does not develop a habit of listening to others, he cuts off all means of knowing them. We can know others only through listening to their words. We cannot force them to open their mouth, but once they do, God will provide us the opportunity to know them. The more talkative a person is, the easier it is to know him.</p><p>When others speak, we have to touch their spirit with our spirit. In the last chapter we spoke of five principles in judgment. Based on these five principles, we have to sense and know men by our spirit. A man's spirit is expressed through his speaking. His speaking can never hide his spirit. As soon as he opens his mouth, his spirit comes out. When a man speaks, we have to listen to him on the one hand and touch him with our spirit on the other hand. The way a man speaks tells us about his spirit, and a man's spirit tells us what kind of person he is. This is a fact. Therefore, when others speak, our spirit must be unoccupied, open, and pliable so that we can have a proper impression of others. In listening to others and in touching their spirit with our spirit, we have to pay attention to a few conditions.</p><h2 class="head1">SEVEN CONDITIONS OF MAN</h2><h2 class="head2">A Proper Spirit</h2><p>When we listen to others and try to sense their spirit, we first have to find out whether or not they have a proper spirit. If our spirit is open, we will easily form an impression of them. Based on this impression, we will know within whether or not their spirit is proper. Some people are proper in words and wrong in motive. Some people are full of love in their speaking yet full of hatred in their spirit. Some people talk about gentleness with their mouth yet demonstrate nothing but stubbornness in their spirit. A man's motive can be different from his words, yet his spirit will always become manifest when his words are released. Please remember that the Lord said, "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks" (Matt. 12:34). A man's words cannot be bridled by his will absolutely; sooner or later they will betray his spirit. A man's own words will always betray his true condition. His words cannot hide his spirit. Sooner or later his "speech" will betray him. A Galilean can hide his identity if he does not open his mouth. But as soon as he opens his mouth, his speech will betray him, and others will recognize him (Mark 14:70). A man cannot suppress and lock up his spirit forever. Some are proud, jealous, or bitter at heart. Their spirit is abnormal. We should not listen just to their words and overlook their spirit. We should not believe the things they say during those moments when their will is in control. The words that they utter when their will is in control do not represent the true picture; they do not represent their very person. Only their spirit can represent their very person. This is very basic knowledge. The real condition of a man is the condition that is expressed when his spirit is released; it is not judged by the words he says when his will is in control. Many people are often deceived because they cannot distinguish words from the spirit. No matter what others say about a man's motive, we have to check his spirit. Absalom was right in the things he said, but his spirit was wrong. His spirit was a rebellious spirit. We have to learn to touch others' spirit. This is the only way to know men, and this is the only way to test the trustworthiness of their word.</p>
