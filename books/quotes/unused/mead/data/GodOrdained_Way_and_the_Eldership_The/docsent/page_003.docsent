   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONTACTING PEOPLE BY OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DIRECTLY, PERSONALLY, AND CONTINUALLY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO BEAR REMAINING FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now I want to come to my point.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you would receive mercy from the Lord to live Him, to live for Him, and to preach Him to gain sinners for Him, just do it yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do not trust in any preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not expect to get help from any speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Just gain people for the Lord yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Surely you can save one person within one year.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am burdened that we have a breakthrough in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am looking to the Lord that each one of you would make a decision to get one person saved for the church life every year.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the natural realm, it is normal for people to have children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But today for us Christians who love the Lord, it seems difficult to bring forth a spiritual child.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord told us in John 15 that He is the vine and we are the branches v. 5 . He appointed us to go and bring forth remaining fruit v. 16 . We all should desire fruit that remains.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In these recent years, we have stressed the truth concerning fruit bearing in John 15 again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may have prayed, "Lord, we hate barrenness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We want to bear much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the bringing forth of fruit among us has not entered into the God-ordained, practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are still mostly in the natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may wonder what the God-ordained, practical way is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to realize that as believers, we must and we should bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to bring forth children.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we must gain a certain amount of skill in bringing forth fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to learn how to bear fruit and to practice fruit bearing continually.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As believers, as members of Christ, and as branches of the vine, we must bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord said that if any branch did not bear fruit, it would be cut off John 15:2a, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be cut off is not to suffer eternal perdition but to lose the enjoyment of Christ in the organic union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is serious not to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many of us, however, do not have a serious consideration about our barrenness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some brothers and sisters have been faithful in the recovery and for the recovery for many years, but I have observed that they have not borne fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They love the church, they are for the church, and they support the church financially, but they are not bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They should realize that not to bear fruit is a serious thing before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord wants us to have a spiritual life in the church, to go to the meetings, to worship Him, and to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But what is all this for?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If all the saints in the church were like this, yet no one bore any fruit, the church would eventually die out.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the people of a nation did not bear children, the nation would eventually become extinct.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The most basic, crucial, and vital thing is for us to bring forth children.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By His mercy, I have found out that to bring forth spiritual children, you must make a serious decision to contact people directly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not trust in preachers and in preaching meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Just trust in your direct, personal, continual contact with people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I assure you that if you make such a decision, you will at least bring two people to the Lord yearly.</S>
