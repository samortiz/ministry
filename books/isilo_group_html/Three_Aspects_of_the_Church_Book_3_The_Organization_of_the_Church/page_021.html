of the Elders and Deacons</h2>
<h2 class="head4">Submitting to the Authority of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>There are several high spiritual requirements related to the offices in the church. The first requirement is that the appointing one must be in the Holy Spirit. If he is not in the Holy Spirit, even if he were the top apostle, he should not appoint elders. This is the requirement on the side of the appointing one. As for the appointed ones, that is, the elders and deacons, there are also spiritual requirements. In making an appointment, an apostle should not consider a person&rsquo;s position, reputation, ability, or wealth; instead, he should consider whether or not this person submits to the authority of the Head, that is, the authority of the Holy Spirit. To appoint an elder based on his position, reputation, ability, and wealth is certainly of men and not of God. In the church the appointing of an elder should always be a fearful matter. Position, reputation, ability, and wealth should never be considered; rather, all these matters must be put aside.</p>
<p>In order for one to be an overseer or an elder, the prerequisite is that he submit to the authority of the Head. If he does not submit to the authority of God, no one should put the responsibility for a local church into his hands. This is equivalent to asking Saul to be king instead of letting Jehovah God be King (1 Sam. 8&mdash;10). This is not acceptable. Biblical knowledge, ability to serve, and capability in handling matters are not the qualifications of an elder. Eldership is the first office in a local church. In the appointment of an elder, the first matter to be settled is whether or not a person submits to the authority of God.</p>
<p>I was not clear about this matter twenty years ago, but now the Lord has made us clear. To be an elder in the church is a matter of authority. Until the matter of authority is established and settled within a person, he cannot be an elder in the church. In Matthew 8 the centurion knew that he was a man under authority, that he was under some and that others were under him (v. 9). Only a person who knew and submitted to authority could be a centurion. Likewise, only one who knows the authority of God can be an elder. Consider the example of David. He could manage God&rsquo;s house because he was a man according to God&rsquo;s heart; he allowed God to reign through him and by him. The thing we fear the most is that an elder would be like Saul, who reigned by himself and set God aside.</p>
<p>Do not think that David&rsquo;s honoring of Saul as God&rsquo;s anointed meant that Saul was proper before God. This was not the case. Similarly, an elder should not think that his position is proper simply because the saints regard him as an elder. Actually, the saints may regard him as an elder in the church because they have personally learned from God to submit to authority. Their regarding him as an elder does not vindicate him. On his side, an elder must be clear that he is under the authority of God. On the side of the appointing one, he should observe the one being appointed to see if he is under the authority of God and if the matter of authority has been settled within him.</p>
<p>No one who disobeys the authority of God can be God&rsquo;s deputy authority. No one who disobeys the authority of God can exercise God&rsquo;s authority in the church as an apostle and appoint elders. Whenever we consider the matter of authority in others, the Holy Spirit also checks with us to see if the matter of authority is settled in us. Hence, we have to see that the matter of office in the church is altogether a matter of authority. For example, when an apostle is about to appoint an elder, the first thing he needs to consider is whether the matter of authority is settled in the one being considered for appointment. As the apostle considers this person, the Holy Spirit will also ask him if the matter of authority is settled within him. If the matter of authority is not settled within an apostle, he certainly is not qualified to consider whether it is settled in others. The government of the church is God&rsquo;s government; that is, it is under the authority of the Holy Spirit. If no one in the church submits to the authority of the Holy Spirit, it will be impossible to have elders and unnecessary to appoint some. To do so would only produce a few more Sauls. Hence, a strict requirement in regard to the appointing of elders is that the one being appointed must submit to the authority of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Experienced in Life</h2>
<p>Another basic requirement for elders is related to the matter of life. The designation <em>elder</em> implies life. One who is not sufficiently mature in life cannot be an elder, because to be an elder is a matter of life. One who is older surely has a considerable measure of life. When the apostles appoint an elder, they should first consider his condition before God with regard to authority; second, they should consider his condition in life. Strictly speaking, an elder is not the result of an appointment but is produced by growth in life.</p>
<p>Our eyes must be opened to see that education, ability, reputation, position, and wealth are not qualifications to be considered in the appointment of elders. Whenever the apostles take these things into consideration in their appointing of elders, this indicates that the church has degraded and is no longer under the authority of the Holy Spirit. In appointing elders, an apostle should consider only two principal matters: authority and life. However, the degree to which an elder should be experienced in life is not absolute but relative. A person may be qualified to be an elder in a small local church, one that is newly raised up, but he may not be qualified to be an elder in a larger church, one that has more experience in life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 3, The Organization of the Church &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
