<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. JEHOVAH'S JUDGMENT ON ASSYRIA</H2><P>In 10:5-34 we also see Jehovah's judgment on Assyria.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah's Judgment<br>on the Haughtiness of the King of Assyria</H2><P>Verses 5 through 19 and 28 through 34 speak of Jehovah's judgment on the haughtiness of the king of Assyria.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Assyria, the Rod of Jehovah's Anger</H2><P>Although Assyria was the rod of Jehovah's anger, He pronounced woe to Assyria. "Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger!/The staff which is in their hand is My indignation. / Against a profane nation I send them out/And against the people of My overflowing wrath I command them,/To make spoil of the spoil and to prey on the prey,/To make them a trampling ground, like street mire" (vv. 5-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Assyria Not Thinking So,<br>and Their Heart Not Conceiving It So</H2><P>Assyria, however, did not think it so, and their heart did not conceive it so (v. 7a). Rather, destroying was in their heart, and the cutting down of no few nations (vv. 7b-11). This means that because Israel had become corrupt, God used Assyria as a rod and a staff to judge Israel. But Assyria, overstretching beyond the limitation, did not think of the matter in this way, nor did their heart conceive it in this way. Assyria therefore acted excessively.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Jehovah Punishing the Fruit<br>of the King of Assyria's Haughtiness<br>of Heart and the Glory of His Haughty Eyes</H2><P>Verses 13 and 14 expose the haughtiness of the king of Assyria. Verse 12 reveals that this haughtiness would be punished by Jehovah. "When the Lord has completed all His work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, He says, I will punish the fruit of the king of Assyria's haughtiness of heart and the glory of his haughty eyes."</P>
