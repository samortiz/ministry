   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A VALUABLE SECRET</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In all my experience in the local churches throughout the years, I have learned a secret.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the early years when different ones came to complain regarding something in the local churches, I would always listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then I would go to the elders to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The elders, then, would be unhappy with me and say that it was too easy for me to listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the brothers came to complain about the sisters, I would say something to the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then the sisters would be unhappy with me and say that it was too easy for me to listen to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Likewise, when the sisters complained about the brothers, I would say something to the brothers, and they would say it was too easy for me to listen to the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Finally, I learned the lesson and the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This secret really solved many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When someone came to me, complaining about what the elders had done I would answer them in this way: "Probably you are right.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why don't you go and tell them yourself."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They would immediately answer that they could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then I told them, "If you say it, you must also be willing to do it."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This solved many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One day a brother told me that the men's restroom was not clean.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I asked him, "Why don't you clean it?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Another brother spoke to me regarding the lack of anyone from the church standing on the street to distribute tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I told him to go and do it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, the brothers began to learn that if they spoke to me about anything, I would tell them to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a good secret and solves many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It also stops many from being critical.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not complain about the leading ones or about this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You must put the burden upon yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church can only be built up by you directly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You are the direct builder.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not think if a certain brother came, he would help you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If he is a proper prophet, he will charge you to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more the real prophet comes, the more burden you will have.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The prophets do not come to release your burden, but to increase your burden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Be strong and work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not return to the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the war ended in 1945, all the brothers from the interior of mainland China returned to Nanking, the capital, and invited me to their place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They were so happy that I had come, but I told them, "Brothers do not be so happy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I did not come to release your burden, but to put the burden upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have come with a heavy burden, but I plan to put it on your shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The longer I stay, the more my burden will be reduced and your burden will be increased.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After a certain period of time, I will have no burden and you will be fully burdened."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That was in 1946.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The next year I was fully released and departed; all the burden was left with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The next time they wrote me to come and help, I told them to do it themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all must realize that the building of the local churches is not in the hands of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the prophets did was strengthen the priesthood, the kingship, and all the people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"O Zerubbabel, O Joshua, and all ye people, be strong and work!"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is all the prophets did.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You must never put the building up of the local church upon others' shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You must bear it yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>CONSIDER YOUR WAYS</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The second thing that the prophet Haggai told them was to consider their ways.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages, earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Consider your ways.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Why? saith the Lord of hosts.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house" Hag 1:6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then the Lord said, "And I called for a drought" Hag 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord called for dryness upon all things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whatever they did, they had the sense that it was so dry.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Look at today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is so much labor they sow the seed, they try to eat and drink, they try to clothe people, they try to earn something, but eventually they get nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In most Christian work today there is a sense of drought.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All their preaching and teaching is dried up.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Their prayer meetings, their reading of the Bible, and all other kinds of meetings are so dry.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is simply because they have neglected the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In 1954, after we had been on the island of Taiwan for about four or five years, an American missionary came to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We were preaching the gospel, and he had visited all of the halls.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At that time, we had only about five or six halls in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He was so surprised to see that every hall was full and overflowing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The people were even crowded outside the halls.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He asked, "Please tell me your secret.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>How do you bring so many people in?"</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then he went on to explain that only a few weeks ago, they had a gospel campaign with a famous preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They put an advertisement in the newspapers in huge characters, announcing the preacher of world fame who was coming to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Yet they drew only a handful of people.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He said that when he asked our people in the different halls who was going to speak that night, they did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He was really perplexed.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He asked, "How could you have such a large crowd, and yet your people did not know who was going to speak?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Tell me your secret."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I said, "Brother, it is really difficult for me to tell you the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you want to learn this secret, you must come and stay with us for two years.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then you will know."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Why have they sown so much, yet they bring in so little?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They have Bible study after Bible study and revival after revival, yet they are still so dry and unsatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>"Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the summer of 1968, over one hundred and forty brothers and sisters went from the United States to visit the churches in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>One night the church in Taipei had a baptism for about four hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>During the baptism, an American missionary came to the hall and began to speak with some of the American brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He told how the missionaries had worn out the soles of their shoes toiling in Taipei, but with little fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He was very bitter toward the church in Taipei because they had so many.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He even claimed that many of those who were being baptized were probably the result of missionaries' work.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But I told the brothers that if he could point out one of the four hundred who were baptized who had first been contacted by them before coming to us, I would lose the case.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He was very bitter because they had worked so hard, and yet had nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It was simply because they labored for their own work and not for the Lord's house.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The secret is the local church!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The secret is the building up of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is the building up of the house of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is not only true with spiritual things, but with material things as well.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I am fully assured that if we mean business for the Lord's recovery, the Lord will grant much blessing, even materially.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If we are on the proper ground and mean business with the Lord for His recovery, the dew will fall from heaven when we are in need.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Whatever we do, far from being dry, there will be an abundance of water.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>There will be not only dew, but a river.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>There will be real blessing both spiritually and materially.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Wherever I go I am always asked these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>First, "In what way do we meet?"</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I always tell them to come and see.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Second, "Where is your headquarters?"</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I always tell them we do not have any headquarters, unless it is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Then they always ask, "How do you raise your money?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>With such a large work, there is the need of much money.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>How do you get it?"</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>I tell them, "Yes, we do spend much money, but we do not have any way to raise it."</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>There is really no way, and we never talk about money.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>I do not like to talk about money, I like to speak about Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>But, praise the Lord, we have never lacked money!</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>"The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts" Hag 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>If we are only for the building up of the Lord's house, everything is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>When we began to publish the hymnal, we did not even have one dollar in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Eventually, we put in more than 31,000 for its printing.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>When we began we did not realize it would cost nearly so much, but praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>We never had any lack.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>And now we have such a good hymnal for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>If we are going to work for the Lord, the most blessed place to work is in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Just a little sowing brings in so much.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>By just a little eating and drinking, we are filled.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Just five loaves and two fish feed 5,000, with an abundance left over.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Brothers, this is the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>If we are for His building, all He is and all He has is available for us.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Really, it is not for us; it is for His purpose of building up the house of the Lord, the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Praise the Lord!</S>
