   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DOCTRINE OF REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is the word of the forerunner.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But what about Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What did He say?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We admit that in the Bible there are a few basic doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, regeneration is one of the basic truths.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Buddhism and Mohammedanism also talk about regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In their teachings they teach that whatever is past is considered as dead yesterday, and whatever is hereafter is considered as born today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But what did Jesus say about regeneration?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us look at the record of John 3.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This one came to Him by night" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1-2a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nicodemus was a ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was also a learned and aged person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He came to Jesus to discuss some problems with Him, and Jesus brought up the matter of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God" v. 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Jesus showed Nicodemus the matter of regeneration, telling him that he needed to be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After Nicodemus heard this, he was confounded.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He wondered how an old man could be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Did that mean that he had to go into his mother's womb and come out again?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jesus told him that this is not a birth of the flesh, but a birth of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a man is not born of the Spirit, even if he could go into his mother's womb again, the flesh would still beget flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only the Spirit begets spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here you can see that even in such a basic and fundamental matter, Jesus did not expound much doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He only mentioned a very simple fact the need to be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>REGENERATION IS SIMPLY BELIEVING</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No wonder Nicodemus asked, "How can these things be?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jesus told him that this is not an earthly matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is something heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That is why he could not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How can a man be born again?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"And no one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that every one who believes into Him may have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He who believes into Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>13-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is regeneration!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Jesus was saying that regeneration is not a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is believing into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To be born again is to believe into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a man does not believe into Him, he cannot be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After saying so much, it all comes back to "Him."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is our concept of regeneration?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We think that if one was a thief yesterday and returns his booty to the owner today, that this is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Or, if one thought of having a mistress yesterday, but gives up that idea today, that this is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We think that as long as we quit doing whatever was bad in the past, considering it as dead, and strive to do well hereafter, we are born again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But this is man's concept.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is not the regeneration that Christ gives.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The way of Jesus depends on whether you believe into Him or not.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He who believes into Him has eternal life!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God gave His only begotten Son that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He who believes is not condemned, but he who does not believe is condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is not a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is a matter of the person.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is a relationship between Him and man.</S>
