<p>In relation to our practice, we will fellowship concerning dividing into groups. In the past we formed groups, but we gradually stopped practicing the groups. After observing our situation and studying the practice of other Christian groups, we are clear that a local church must stress meeting in groups. The group is a basic unit.</p>
<p> A church must have groups as its foundation so that the church can take root downward. Likewise, whether or not a church stands firm also depends on the groups. Above the ground we need to raise our standard high, and we need to be rooted with a firm foundation. This foundation is the groups.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei has a total of eleven thousand saints, but only five thousand meet regularly. We need to divide these saints into four hundred groups according to where they reside. Eight or ten saints in a neighborhood should gather as a group. The groups should not be formed according to the spiritual level of the saints nor according to their age. The groups are formed solely according to the geographical location of the saints. Furthermore, once a few saints form a group, there should be no group leader or assistant group leader, nor is there a need for a responsible one or a coordinator. Everyone is equal. This practice is based on our experience. In the past when we assigned group leaders, responsible ones, and coordinators, those who were not assigned felt that they did not have any responsibility. As a result, there were distinctions when the saints functioned in the group. We have to get rid of such concepts. We need to give the saints the impression that, in the Lord&rsquo;s eyes, everyone in the group is the same. Everyone is precious and useful, and everyone should serve.</p>
<p>In order to advance the groups, we must use the serving ones in the homes, including the full-time and part-time serving ones. We need to have the manpower to advance four hundred groups. In the initial stage we do not have to spend much effort on the gospel in the community. We can wait until we have laid a good and strong foundation in the groups. Then we can preach the gospel in the communities through the groups. The manpower for the community gospel work must first be used to advance the groups.</p>
<p>According to geography, the four hundred groups can be divided into eight districts. Therefore, every district would have fifty groups, with a total of nearly six hundred saints. In the beginning we need to spend more time and invest more manpower into the groups. Our situation can be compared to an old car that has not been in operation for a long time. We are all in the car, but we have to get out and push it. This principle should be adopted in the localities, but we should not be strict in the way that we push.</p>
<p>At present fifty full-timers are assigned to five categories of the work: advancing the group meetings, preaching the gospel in the homes, preaching the gospel in the community, the campus work, and the children&rsquo;s work. If we are strict and assign ten full-timers to each category of the work, not many will be assigned to advance the groups. Therefore, we need less serving ones in the other categories. If there are fifty groups in a district, there will be a total of five to six hundred saints. We need at least fifty serving ones to advance the groups. In other words, one serving one will work with one group. Every serving one has to be in a group. Before joining the groups, the serving ones must have thorough fellowship and study how to advance the groups. They should study the situation of the meetings, the living situation of the brothers and sisters, and the spiritual level of the groups. Then they should pray together and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading to know how to enter into the groups and lead them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the Condition of the Groups</h2>
<p>We should first know the condition of the groups and then pray to seek a way to lead them. Every group may have a different condition, but in principle it is possible to find the direction to lead the saints. I can give only principles. We should seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading to fan into flame the gift that is in every member of a group. We should not expect a quick work. The first time we meet with a group, we should give the saints the opportunity to speak freely with one another in a relaxed manner. There is not the need for much prayer. If we try to bring our old way of meeting into the group, we will bring in regulations. For example, although soymilk is delicious, the more we drink it the less we enjoy it. Hence, it is better to let the members of a group feel relaxed. Please do not misunderstand me. Sometimes our piousness in the meeting is a pretense, because we are not necessarily like that in our homes. It is better to be spontaneous. In the group meeting we do not have to pretend, but neither should we be wild.</p>
<p>We can even drink tea in the group meeting so that everyone will relax. Without singing or praying, the serving one can say, &ldquo;Brothers and sisters, I thank the Lord that we can sit together. The Lord has given the church a new leading, and we have been formed into a group so that we can know one another better, have more fellowship, and can supply and support one another. When I am sick, you will know that I am sick. When you have a problem, I will know that you have a problem. We will be able to sympathize with one another and help one another.&rdquo; Such a word will help the saints not to pretend. We should keep in mind that having the group meeting is not for us to hold a large worship service in a small meeting. The group meeting is for the saints to enjoy a fresh taste. This taste will help the members of the group to relax. This can be likened to rekindling an old fire with a new flame. In such a meeting it will be easy to fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Focusing on Reality, Working Aggressively,<br />
and Not Being Anxious</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the meeting it is best not to speak too much concerning spiritual matters. We have released many messages. The saints are well fed. They are stout and strong, and there are many things stored within them. Instead of giving them more doctrine or spiritual material, we should give them more reality and an opportunity to speak. We can tell the saints, &ldquo;The arrangement in the group meeting is different from the arrangement in the past. There is no group leader or coordinator. We all share responsibility for the meeting, and the meetings will not always be in the same home.&rdquo; Then the saints will be enlivened, the group meeting will be enjoyable, and they will be willing to come again. They might even bring someone to the next meeting. After the saints feel comfortable with the group meeting, we can begin to restore the dormant saints. In brief, the group meeting is the starting point to form a river out of dew. Eventually, there will be a river flowing among us.</p>
<p>We must pray diligently for this matter. In particular, all those who are prepared to serve full time must assist the elders to promote the small groups. The other areas of our work can temporarily slow down. We must remember not to turn the atmosphere in the group meeting into an atmosphere of a small worship service. That is organization. We must be organic. In our service and our work we should always remember to be aggressive but not anxious. It is good if we can achieve something today, and it is also good if we can achieve it tomorrow. We should not be overly concerned with time. However, we must be aggressive and not be loose. This is a principle for receiving the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_079.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_081.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 3: The Future of the Lord's Recovery and the Building Up of the Organic Service &nbsp; pg 80</div><br></body></html>
