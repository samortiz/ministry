[1]  Ezekiel 44:11, 15-16 says, "Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them....But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord God: they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge."
[2]  We must see clearly that outwardly there may not be much difference between ministering to the house and ministering to the Lord.
[3]  When you rise up early in the morning to minister to the brothers and sisters, do you say, "O Lord, today I am doing this once again for Your sake"?
[4]  I can tell you frankly that he is not doing this for the Lord because many times he is not able to do the things he does not like, even though the Lord really wants him to.
[5]  Brothers and sisters, please remember that ministering to the Lord is much deeper than leading men to the Lord.
[6]  Ministering to the Lord is one step further than leading men to the Lord and leading believers to consecrate themselves to the Lord.
[7]  For this reason, we must pray to God to grace us that we may know what it is to minister to God and to the house.
[8]  Many like to exercise their muscles outside because by killing cattle and sheep, they can exercise their strength and fleshly energy.
[9]  However, if you ask them to go to a quiet, solitary place where no one can see them, they are not able to do this.
[10]  Brothers, we cannot find a genuine servant of God or true minister to the Lord who does not minister in this way.
[11]  The basis for the ministry to the Lord, the basic requirement for ministering to the Lord, is to draw near to the Lord.
[12]  It means to wait for a command, to wait upon the Lord to speak His will.
[13]  Similarly, everyone who does not know how to stand before the Lord will surely not be able to minister to Him.
[14]  All those who would come before God to minister to Him must answer to God's holiness, righteousness, and even His glory.
[15]  The entire Bible, both the Old Testament and the New Testament, focuses on these three things: God's holiness, God's righteousness, and God's glory.
[16]  God's glory refers to God Himself; God's holiness refers to His nature; and God's righteousness refers to His way.
[17]  In other words, God's way is righteous, God's nature is holy, and God Himself is glory.
[18]  Every time we come before God, we must first realize how we are able to stand before God.
[19]  If we want to minister before God, we need to draw near to Him, stand before Him, and wait for His will.
[20]  We have only two positions here: one is that we are dead and have dropped everything of the old creation; the other is that we are resurrected and are serving God, learning to stand before Him, listening to His order, and waiting in His presence to minister to Him.
[21]  Those who ministered to God before Him had to be clothed with linen garments, linen bonnets on their heads, and linen breeches on their loins.
[22]  There was no way for God to ask all the Levites to come.
[23]  Because when the children of Israel turned against the ways of the Lord and forsook Him, the sons of Zadok kept the charge of the sanctuary.
[24]  Brothers and sisters, I stand in the presence of God to beg you all; God is seeking those who will fully minister to Him.
[25]  It is one thing to know about the veil; we should minister to the Lord in the sanctuary.
[26]  But beyond the veil, there is another matter which is just as important: "Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach" Heb 13:13 .
[27]  Not only do we need to minister to God in the sanctuary, but we also need to go outside the camp.
[28]  It is only when we have left the camp to minister to the Lord that He will speak and lead; at other times, He will not speak.
