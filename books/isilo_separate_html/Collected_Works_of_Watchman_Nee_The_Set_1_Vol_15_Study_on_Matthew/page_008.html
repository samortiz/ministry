This causes people to stand in the position of sinners. Regret is linked to confession, for when a person recognizes his position, spontaneously he will confess his sins. Baptism signifies death and resurrection. When John was asking people to be baptized, he was telling them, in effect, that they ought to die and be resurrected. John told people to believe in the One who was coming. Therefore, John's work was for the preaching of the gospel and not for the kingdom of Messiah. John used the word "kingdom" only once (Matt. 3:2). Furthermore, he did not say that the Lord would be King. He said that the Lord is the rising sun, the Bridegroom, the Lamb, and the One who baptizes people in the Holy Spirit. For the Lord to be the Lamb and to baptize people in the Holy Spirit, He needed to die and be resurrected. The baptism ministered by John shows forth the things to be accomplished. This shows us that when the Lord came the first time, it was absolutely not for the establishing of the kingdom of Messiah. In Acts 15:13-16 we can see that verse 14 refers to the church; "after these things" in verse 16 means after the church in verse 14; "the tabernacle" denotes the kingdom of Messiah; and "a people" denotes the church. This shows that it was not until after the church that the kingdom of Messiah, the tabernacle of David which has fallen, will be established.</P><P>In Acts 11 Peter acknowledged that the gospel began with John the Baptist, and in Acts 13 Paul also acknowledged the same thing. Apollos did not have a thorough knowledge concerning this. He knew only the first part, which was the baptism of John, but he did not know concerning the things that the Lord had already acknowledged. Therefore, Priscilla and Aquila took him to themselves to help him.</P><P>John's purpose was for people to believe in the One coming after him. He preached the gospel (Acts. 19:4), except that he preached it before the Lord's death. Therefore, after the Lord accomplished redemption, what John preached had to be repeated. Peter and Paul did not overturn John's work.</P><P>Luke 3:7-14:This group of people had repented and sought to flee from the coming wrath. Therefore, in verses 11-14 John could tell them what they should do. In the four Gospels, John the Baptist was the only one who preached the substitutionary death of Christ.</P><P>Verse 1:"Now in those days John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judea." The emphasis of the Lord's work is different from the emphasis of John's work. John stressed repentance because he came to prepare the way of the Lord. Therefore, he stood in a position against the world.</P><P>John took the wilderness as his home and the city as his inn, whereas the Lord took the city as His home and the wilderness as His inn. John came that people might weep, whereas the Lord came that people may dance (Matt. 11:16-19). A complete salvation is first to weep and then to dance. In other words, repent and believe. John caused people to weep; therefore, it was as if he put on sackcloth in mourning. On the other hand, the Lord causes people to dance; He provides the music. The position in which John stood demonstrates that the people in the world are not right. John preached first in the wilderness of Judea because salvation is of the Jews (John 4:22).</P><P>Verse 2:"And saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near." That the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near is a fact; therefore, men should repent. It does not say that you repent and then the kingdom of the heavens will draw near. Heavens in Greek is in the plural number; hence, it is the kingdom of the heavens. Why is it not the kingdom of heaven, but the kingdom of the heavens? It is because before the Lord died, and while Satan was in the air, there was never a kingdom that was ruled by the heavens. Only the kingdom that was brought in by God, being different from the kingdoms on the earth, is a spiritual kingdom that can be in fellowship with God.</P><P>Verse 3:"For this is he who was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, `A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.'" Although John the Baptist was a prophet, he did not prophesy. Although he was the greatest among the prophets, he did not show off his greatness. He was merely a voice of man.</P><P>Why is the quotation in Luke 3:4-6 longer than that in Matthew 3:3? Because the Gospel of Matthew was written to the Jews, it mentions more of the things related to the Jews. Like Matthew, the Gospel of Luke also preaches Jesus Christ, but it mentions more concerning the things related to the Gentiles.</P><P>Verse 4:"Now this John had his garment of camel's hair and a leather girdle around his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey." The focus of John's message was to make people repent. Therefore, he stood in a position against the people of the world. His food and clothing were all different from those of the people of the world. However, today's Christians should not imitate John. Concerning all the things on the human side, we should not be too different from the people of the world (this is not to say that Christians should be fashioned according to the world); the Lord behaved in the same way as men (Matt. 11:19).</P><P>Verses 5-6:"At that time Jerusalem and all Judea and all the surrounding region of the Jordan went out to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins." This kind of baptism was not found in the Old Testament. The baptisms mentioned in Hebrews 6 refer to the washings in the Old Testament. John's baptism was to lead people to believe in the One coming after him. At that time baptism was a personal act; so also confession was a personal act. We should not use Matthew 3:6 as a basis for making confession of sins in public.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
