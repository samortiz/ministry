<p>Acts 1:8, a very brief yet all-inclusive verse, says, &ldquo;But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.&rdquo; We have to thank the Lord that the Holy Spirit has come upon us already. Now our need is to seek the very experience of this. Verse 8 does not say that &ldquo;you shall be my preachers,&rdquo; but that &ldquo;you shall be my witnesses.&rdquo; You may preach something which you have never seen or experienced, but to witness is to be an eyewitness. You have seen the things, experienced the things, tasted the things, and enjoyed the things. All the full-timers need to be helped to know the Lord Jesus, to experience the all-inclusive Christ. Then they can go out to be His witnesses, not merely the preachers. Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the remotest part of the earth is a good sequence and corresponds to our neighborhood, the surrounding places, the places at a distance, and the farthest places.</p>
<p>We must stress very much that every church must be a gospel-spreading and truth-teaching church. This is our commission. Every church and every saint should be such a one. Every full-timer, including the job-dropping one and the money-making one, must be one who preaches the gospel and teaches the truth in his neighborhood, among his relatives, classmates, schoolmates, friends, and colleagues. Our Jerusalem is in our town, in our city, in our village. Then we go out to the surrounding places; then we go out to places at a distance; then we would even go to other states and other countries, even to the remotest part of the earth. We must have such a spirit!</p>
<p>By seeing this we all could realize we are far behind. Therefore, we have to endeavor to stir up all the churches to be this kind of church and all the saints to be this kind of person. By what way? By being in one accord. All the saints in one locality are in one accord, all the churches in one country are in one accord, and all the churches in all of the countries around the globe should just be in one accord. We should have this one accord. We must claim this, insist this, and require this. We do not agree that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there would be another accord. It should just be in one accord, not by gimmicks but by prayer to receive more power of the Spirit. Our trust is in the Spirit and the Word.</p>
<p>We must stir up every saint, whether job-dropping or money-making, to be such persons who preach the gospel and teach the truth, regardless of how busy they are. Regardless of how busy you might be as perhaps a bank manager, you still have the time to talk to your neighbors, your colleagues, your friends, relatives, in-laws, and cousins. There are a lot of persons in your &ldquo;Jerusalem.&rdquo; We have to train the saints, to remind them again and again, not just once for all. Preaching the gospel and teaching the truth includes the one accord, much prayer, the power of the Spirit, and all the riches of the holy Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE PROPER LEADING<br />
IN THE ONE BIBLICAL WAY</h2>
<p>I hate to see the repetition of Christianity in the recovery. We should drop the different ways and different practices and take one way, the biblical way. This way is the way which is fully revealed and given as a pattern in the New Testament. This is why I have the boldness to tell you that this is the proper leading, because this is the way revealed and illustrated in the New Testament.</p>
<p>In 1950 Brother Nee brought a big revival to Hong Kong, and he asked me to be there. One morning in the conference of all the elders and co-workers during the time of revival he brought me in and gave a word purposely, saying, &ldquo;Witness, according to the authority the Lord has given you, make arrangement for all the services of the elders, the deacons, and the co-workers.&rdquo; After saying this, he stopped. Shortly after this, he left. That was the way he did things. Then one night he came back and he asked me to give a testimony. I said, &ldquo;No. As long as your presence is here, I quit. If you do not say anything, I will not say anything. If you sit there, I will sit there. If you want me to say something, you leave. Your presence is first.&rdquo; I fully realized that in one car there cannot be two drivers. Who should be first? The first should be first. I was not first. I knew where I was and who I was. Today the problem among us is that most do not know where they are and who they are. We must hate that we would repeat the poor history of Christianity.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> </body></html>
