   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE THE SECOND FALL OF MAN 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to the last two verses of Genesis 4.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that nearly every item found in the first chapters of Genesis is a seed that is developed in the following books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although Genesis 4:25-26 is such a brief portion of the Word, it contains a very significant seed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, before we consider this seed, we need to cover some other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Way to Escape</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first fall of man occurred in Genesis 3, and the second fall in Genesis 4.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen that the way to escape from the first fall is to believe in the seed of the woman, that is, the Lord Jesus, and to take God's way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, as a result of this fall, Satan is within our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was the main cause of the second fall.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is the way of escape from this second fall?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>a. Not Presumptuous according to</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One's Own Concept</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to escape from the second fall of man we must be careful of being presumptuous.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What does it mean to be presumptuous?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It means to do good, to worship God, and to serve God according to our human concept and not according to God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have seen this illustrated in the case of Cain 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Doing anything of ourselves, regardless of how good it is according to our own concept, is presumptuous and is one with the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As fallen man with Satan in our nature, we must reject anything that originates with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must do everything according to the way revealed by God that we may be kept from the Devil and from the furtherance of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Living for God and Worshipping Him</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>according to His Way</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, if we want to escape the second fall of man, we must live for God and worship God according to His way, as Abel did 4:2, 4; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>3:21; Heb 11:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the negative side, we should not be presumptuous; on the positive side, we should live for God and worship Him according to His revelation and in His way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not only to live for God and to worship God, but to do so according to the way of God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must remain in God's way that we may be kept from any further fall.</S>
