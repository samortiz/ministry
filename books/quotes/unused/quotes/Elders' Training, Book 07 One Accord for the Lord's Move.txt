It is not true to say that some of the practices in the New Testament are not according to the revelation concerning the church
In the book of Revelation there are no elders in the churches; rather, there are the messengers who are the stars
It was under the leadership of Brother Watchman Nee on mainland China for the first thirty years, from 1922 to 1952
We should pay attention to the way revealed in Revelation where there are only messengers or stars and no elders
The practice in the Lord's recovery beginning from October of 1984 and starting in Taiwan was something absolutely new
As the Spirit of reality He would not only remind the disciples of what He had spoken to them but also go on to tell them something further
After breathing Himself into His disciples, He stayed with them for forty days to train them to experience His invisible presence
The Chinese version of the Bible translates this word into a Chinese word meaning the same mind and the same will
In Acts the three main factors for the spreading of the gospel as an impact were prayer, the Spirit, and the Word
According to the Bible and according to history these three items are the only way for the gospel to be prevailing
During that time, the Lord brought all the saints there into the one accord and there was a real revival with the real impact
The soldiers all think the same thing, speak the same thing, stand for the same thing, and live for the same thing
People were also told that if they wanted to be a Christian, the best place for them to go was our meeting hall
During those years we also performed the casting out of demons; even the demons told people not to go to our meeting hall
Acts 15 describes a conference of the apostles and elders held in Jerusalem to settle the trouble concerning circumcision
Those of us who were in Los Angeles from 1963 to 1973 can recall that we were with one accord and with one mouth
The people who received the recovery, who received Brother Nee's teaching, would carry out what he taught in their own way
From 1922 to 1942 in mainland China there was 'the one car' of the Lord's recovery, yet there were different drivers
From the fall of 1946 to the spring of 1949, for two and a half years, the whole situation in Shanghai was under my driving
The Lord was going on in those two and a half years and there was a revival which brought Brother Nee back to the ministry
Austin-Sparks from England to render us more spirituality, and his coming brought in a big factor of dissension
The saints knocked on the door of a nearby house, thinking that this might be a house of somebody who would listen to the gospel
There are also now over one hundred and thirty new full-timers in Taipei and most of them are college graduates
The fact that we need to be asked by someone in the church meeting to read the Scriptures is not a good indication
In the new move which is the up-to-date move of the Lord, we like to go back one thousand percent to the Bible
For one person to say that he is of Paul and another to say that he is of Apollos indicates that they are not speaking the same thing
Without the one accord you are altogether not qualified to do anything in the Lord's new start of His new move
The Lords church His Body His testimony has been altogether cut into pieces by the Christians through the centuries not being in one accord
We have many good teachings, we have the ground of the church, and we have all the divine provisions, but our morale is a problem
Philippians tells us that this matter starts from our spirit , yet we must realize we are not persons of spirit only
Otherwise, we will repeat the pitiful history of Christianity by being another group of Christians repeating the same kind of disaccord
Not only in Acts but also throughout the entire New Testament prayer the Spirit and the Word were used for the carrying out of Gods economy
The substances which constitute the unique way for the Lord's move are prayer and the Spirit, which result in the Word
Finally, chapter nineteen is the end of another section, telling us that 'the word of the Lord grew mightily and was strong'
Peter probably did not have a share, as we do, in the fourteen Epistles written by Paul and in the book of Revelation written by John
In John 16 the Lord told Peter and all his companions that He had many things to say to them which they could not have borne at that time
Mostly, the Holy Spirit spoke in continuation of the Lord Jesus through Paul on the New Testament economy of God
Peter with all his companions had to pick up mainly what was recorded in the Gospels, but today we have to pick up much more
We have to pick up the words of the Lord from the four Gospels and especially from the fourteen Epistles of the Apostle Paul
The four Gospels show us the Head, while Paul's fourteen Epistles show us the Body and reveal the Head to us in an even deeper way
Because we are living in the Body today under the direction of Christ as our living Head, these fourteen Epistles are more crucial to us
Even when they were out preaching the gospel to the villages, they still spent the first half of the day praying together in the Word
They did not have much knowledge and only were concerned with ethics and with doing something to make a living
Within them there is a desire to know the deeper truths, the real meaning of this universe, the real meaning and reason of human life
To many of them the philosophical teachings of Confucius are much better than the mere preaching of going to heaven or hell
When our young people went to them, the people in the villages were so impressed that they were college graduates
We have a proper translation of the New Testament with notes that open up the text, many booklets for distribution and many truths to speak
Open to Genesis 12 and read to them God's promise to Abraham that in his seed all the nations of the earth would be blessed
Your preaching of the high gospel will be very convincing and will gain the respect, the regard, of the one to whom you are speaking
There are thousands of Chinese families in many major cities in the United States who would be open to our visitation
Even though many brothers have a job, they can still use their evenings and weekends to visit these families door to door
To go to visit them in prayer by being prepared with the holy Word and filled with the Spirit will be very prevailing
To use the church meeting hall for a school or as a center to care for children will bring a lot of complications to the hall
In the New Testament there is only this one unique way constituted with these three substances-prayer, the Spirit, and the Word
Whatever you do by prayer, whatever you do to get the Spirit, and whatever you do to take the Word, no one would dissent with
No one however would have different opinions concerning prayer concerning the Spirit and concerning taking the Word and preaching the Word
If you are going to be married, you must take God's ordained way with the principle of marriage of one husband and one wife
To use other ways to preach the gospel or to carry the church on might be profitable, but that is the short-cut way
We should not use anything other than prayer, the Word, and the Spirit to carry on the gospel or the church life
We have to spend much time to get into the Word; we have to get ourselves saturated, constituted, and even soaked with the holy Word
You may be dirty, never dealt with, proud, criticizing others, offending your wife, despising the elders, and rebelling against the church
You should be one with the church, one with your co-workers, one with all the brothers, and one with all the sisters
One of them Hymn 501 in our hymnal O glorious Christ Savior mine is actually much better in Chinese because nearly every line is poetic
The verses listed above show us a oneness in seven aspects: teaching, practice, thinking, speaking, essence, appearance, and expression
Among the many denominations and groups in Christianity, none would dare to say that they have two Gods, two Lords, or two Spirits
According to the Bible, we can only recognize that there is one church, with one testimony by one recovery today
They may feel that this is not workable in such a democratic age, especially in a country like the United States
The Americans practice democracy and grow up in an environment where nearly everybody expresses his own feeling
The last three items we need to be one in practically are related to the golden lampstands in Revelation 1:11-12
The specific, particular characteristics of the apostate church in Thyatira were Jezebel, idol worship, fornication, and adultery
The characteristic of the church in Sardis was deadness , and the characteristic of the church in Laodicea was lukewarmness
If you believe the Bible you have to admit that we should be one in teaching practice thinking speaking essence appearance and expression
There is not a verse in the Bible that even gives us a small hint that allows the churches to have different appearances
Some may say that God does not care for the appearance, but Paul tells us to abstain from the appearance, from the form, of evil
God not only cares for the essential and substantial reality of the lampstand but also for its shape, its form
From the very beginning of the Lord's recovery in mainland China, Brother Nee declared that the Bible with its sixty-six books was our creed
What kind of expression do the brothers from Germany, England, Brazil, and Taiwan see when they come to the churches in the United States?
If they do not, we are not properly compressed into the golden lampstands because all seven lampstands bear one, unique expression
The work of the Lord's recovery, though, on the island of Taiwan has been solidly founded and very much blessed by the Lord
The three thousand who were added to the church on the day of Pentecost continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching
The Lord's word in John 16 tells us that He would have more to speak when He came back as the Spirit of reality
After the final writing of John the Apostle, the book of Revelation, the entire divine revelation had been completed
Only the book of Revelation declares this because this was the Lord Jesus' declaration at the very end of His holy, divine revelation
After its completion, the Lord Jesus, the One who was qualified to open the scroll of the new covenant , declares that this is the end
Romans 16:17 tells us that some 'make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned'
Be cautious of anyone who would cause you to practice in a way that is contrary to the teaching of the apostles
Any stress or emphasis on things other than these major items in the central lane have to be considered as different teachings
If you read 1 Timothy 1 carefully, you can realize that what was condemned by the apostle as different teachings was not altogether heresy
We should not ignore them, but if we are taking care of the apostles' teaching, they should not be the emphasis of our teaching
If anyone of us would stress something based upon the Scripture, yet other than what the Lord stressed, that would be a different teaching
If we are teaching things other than what the New Testament stresses we are teaching differently and it will be hard for us to be really one
The very contents of the New Testament Bible is the very contents of God's New Testament economy as the faith in which we have our belief
If you would be carried about by the winds of teaching, this indicates that you are still a babe according to Ephesians 4:14
We have to keep the principle of one teaching, not my teaching nor your teaching but the teaching of the apostles
The sign of the lampstands in Revelation 1:11-12 shows us that the churches need to be one in essence, appearance, and expression
While He was walking on this earth, His very essence within was the Son of God and His appearance outwardly was the Son of Man
The local church's appearance should be uniquely the form, the style, and the shape of the Lord Jesus, the unique Son of Man
Our expression must be the shining of the sevenfold, intensified Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God
The points listed above are not my teaching but the teaching of the Bible in the New Testament, the teaching of God's New Testament economy
Some left the recovery as gentlemen because they felt they could not take this way and made it clear that they wanted to take another way
All the Bible references for these points indicate that this is not my view teaching or opinion but simply my quotation from the divine Word
Acts 15:1-2 shows us that there was a big problem, a big disturbance involving the Judaic practice of circumcision
Paul, however, realized that this was not the right way, so he, Barnabas, and certain others went to Jerusalem
Paul went to Jerusalem to have a conference with all the concerned parties-the apostles, the elders, and the church in Jerusalem
For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who proclaim him in the synagogues, being read every Sabbath'
In James' concluding word he took care of three main items of Judaism-the law of Moses, the synagogue, and the Sabbath
It is altogether not right to have a different practice in the Lord's recovery, to have different lines for the saints to go on
You may train the saints in your locality with two lines, but are you sure they will remain in your locality forever?
Acts 15:31 tells us that when the decree was read by the church in Antioch, 'they rejoiced at the consolation'
They could have felt not to read Paul's letter to Colosse but could have been happy to receive Paul's letter to them
There is no excuse whatsoever for a church to be different in any positive thing or in any positive way from the other churches
All the churches should be identical, and all the churches should follow the apostles' leading as indicated in the four points above
Peter declared to the Jews on the day of Pentecost 'that God has made Him both Lord and Christ-this Jesus whom you crucified'
Although the ascended Christ is the Lord of the believers, in practice there must be some kind of physical leading that people can see
In the last sixteen chapters of Acts, from chapter thirteen to chapter twenty-eight, is the second section of the Lord's work
The New Testament shows us that the Lord's move on this earth was always with two leaders-the Apostle Peter and the Apostle Paul
What is the factor that decides who the leading one is in a certain period of time that all the believers have to follow?
Some believe that 'orthodox doctrine' is only the teachings Jesus Christ gave to the twelve Apostles while He was on this earth
Of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, fourteen Epistles were written by Paul, who was not one among the twelve Apostles
In John 16:12-15 the Lord told the disciples that He had many things to tell them that they could not bear then
The Spirit of truth would come and bring them into the realization of those things, disclosing to them whatever He had received of the Lord
All that the Father is and has is embodied in the Son , and all that the Son is and has is received by the Spirit
All things of the Father are Thine; All Thou art in Spirit is mine; The Spirit makes Thee real to me, That Thou experienced might be
Peter and John were unable to apprehend what the Lord mentioned in John 16:12-15, so the Lord did not tell them these things in details
Paul could not have rendered the believers the proper leading unless he had had the full knowledge of the mystery of the faith
If you are going to be an apostle, you should be above the deacons in your knowledge of the mystery of the faith
Whether or not you are an apostle as the leader in the Lord's work does not depend upon who you are or upon your being sent
Peter did not have as full of a realization of John 16:14-15 regarding the transmission of the divine Trinity as Paul did
Who knows the revelation concerning God's New Testament economy in Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Hebrews?
At the day of Pentecost Peter was qualified to tell people all the teachings the Lord Jesus gave to them while He was on this earth
Is it in the Orthodox church the Catholic church the Protestant denominations the state churches the private churches or the free groups
His present speaking is not concerning presbytery, baptism by immersion, tongue-speaking, gifts, healings, or evangelical movements
Peter was surely the apostle as the leader of the Lord's move at the day of Pentecost because he was a person who knew God's speaking
Whoever has God's speaking concerning the entire teaching of God's New Testament economy are the leading ones in His move
These leading ones, though, cannot add anything to the teaching of God's New Testament economy, as revealed in the Scriptures
It was in the book of Revelation that the Lord as the unique, divine Writer declared that no one can add anything or take away anything
Today's leading apostles should be the ones who only know the full contents of this divine New Testament economy
In the New Testament, Paul, through whom the word was completed, did his best to restrict the speaking in tongues and never promoted it
Restricting the speaking in tongues, as the Apostle Paul did, is different from opposing or stopping the speaking in tongues
Our preaching of the gospel of the Lord Jesus must be restricted within four things-the one accord, prayer, the Spirit, and the Word
To bring in any gimmick besides these four items is something beyond the teaching of God's New Testament economy
The practice of the Baptist churches went beyond this teaching and produced a great denomination with many small divisions
The Baptists themselves are divided into different groups such as the Southern Baptists and the American Baptists
My point is that we should not bring any practice into the church life in a solid and definite way which is not in the Bible
In 2 Timothy 2:15 Paul tells Timothy that he has to learn how to cut straight the word of the truth, how to teach the word properly
To cut straight the word means to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion
If anyone does not follow Christ according to the teaching of the New Testament economy, no one among us should follow him
He was resurrected to be the firstborn of God and the life-giving Spirit to release the divine life to impart Himself into us
In Pauls word to the Corinthians in 1 Corinthians 148 he was referring to the matter of speaking in tongues with a definite interpretation
He said that if there is not a definite interpretation of a persons tonguespeaking this is like sounding the trumpet with an uncertain sound
We may think that these are small things which are not related to the Lord's Person, to His deity, to His divinity, or to His Godhead
Some of the so-called workers, the leading ones, like to think that they can take another line, not following the one line in the ministry
They may consider this and speaking in tongues without a definite interpretation small matters which we do not need to pay attention to
We have to have our loins girded with Christ , and we have to wear Christ as a pair of shoes for our standing to fight the battle
In modern history there have been two world wars, but we must realize that the church today is undertaking a universal war
Most of their study is confined to a single galaxy, but many, many millions of galaxies and beyond form the space in which we are fighting
In his talk concerning the interpretation of tongues, he used an illustration-the sounding of a trumpet for the battle
In the United States there are close to one hundred churches, and the number of saints has increased at a very low rate
On the other hand, some other Christian groups, especially in the Far East, have gone up very much in number in recent years
Whether or not a certain church takes the ministry does not decide whether that church is a genuine local church
The title of this message does not say 'no uncertain sounding of the trumpet in the Lord's recovery' but 'in the Lord's ministry'
The citizens of the United States may say many things to criticize the government and the commander in chief of the Armed Forces
All the saints who have left the denominations, the divisive sects, and stand on the proper ground are a local church in their locality
To say that the ministry cannot depend upon a certain church does not mean that that church has been cut off from being a local church
For this reason, this ministry cannot allow anyone to pretend to be in it and yet still say something different
Paul never tried to force all the churches to follow him in his ministry, but Paul surely had a ministry for the churches
At Pentecost the current began to flow out of Jerusalem through Judea, through Samaria, and went up to Antioch
On the way of their first journey however the Spirit records that Paul began to take the lead and the Spirit began to refer to Saul as Paul
From this point on Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, took the lead in the apostolic ministry all the way, and Barnabas accepted that
Right after that solution was made as a decree to all the churches, there was a contention between Barnabas and Saul
They did not separate from each other because of a different opinion concerning the faith or concerning the headship of Christ
To us that is a small thing, but after Barnabas left Paul with Mark there is no more record of him in the Lord's move in the book of Acts
There is no hint that Apollos intended to carry on another flow, but whatever he was and whatever he did gave people a different impression
When Gideon was called to take the army to fight the battle for Jehovah, the Lord told him that he had too many
You may be a member of a local church and yet have nothing to do with the ministry to fight the battle for the Lord's interest on this earth
If you are only for your part of the world this may disappoint you, but if you are for the Lord's recovery you'll say, 'Amen'!
It is clear in the New Testament that Paul was taking the lead in the Lord's New Testament ministry on the earth at that time
He surely worked for the Lord's recovery, and he has made a good, proper, and adequate foundation for this recovery
Many of you who have given up high degrees and high positions for the Lord's recovery have to be faithful to your sacrifice
If you build with the transformed precious materials-gold, silver, and precious stones-you will receive a reward
If you build with other categories of material-wood, grass, and stubble-that will be burnt and you will lose your reward
To be saved through fire is to be saved through a certain kind of burning purification, a certain kind of purging
If we eat the bread and drink the cup at the Lord's table in an unworthy manner, we eat and drink judgment to ourselves
The Lord firstly disciplined the ones who participated in His table in an unworthy manner so that they were weak physically
The way you build must be the way in life, and the materials with which you build have to be the substances of life plus transformation
When you come to the Lord's table, you touch the Lord's Body, the mystical Body of Christ, which is the temple of God
Do not think that your getting the flu is merely a physical matter due to the fact that everyone is getting it
Whatever happens to us must remind us that we should go to Him to be enlightened, to be exposed, to be tested, to be examined
The Lord Jesus told us clearly in Matthew 24 and 25 that if the servants are slothful, He will punish them when He returns
If we are unfaithful, at the judgment seat of Christ, the Lord will make the decision to cut us off from this attachment with Him
God needs to perfect some of the nations to be transferred into the new earth to be the people on the new earth for eternity
Through the time of the millennium, God will prepare or perfect these three kinds of people for His new universe
We can realize this matter, though, by inference from Paul's mentioning of the uncertain sound of the trumpet for the battle
Surely the battle implies an army, and in an army there is the need of a general to command the army, to direct the army to fight
On the one hand, Paul was very bold toward the Corinthians in dealing with divisions in the first four chapters
Regardless of how humble he was in writing this portion of the Word, when he came to chapter three he admitted that he was the planter
A wise master builder is an architect who designs the building, and after designing he superintends and oversees the construction work
For you to give your opinion concerning what direction the car should take causes trouble, bothers people, and makes people unhappy
You have to be contented with the portion the Lord has given you with thanksgivings, realizing that you can only do that much
Do you have the ability to watch over, to oversee, the entire work in the Lord's recovery concerning His New Testament economy?
These categories of material are natural and worldly, having nothing to do with growth, life, and transformation
Paul said that they were still babes, behaving, acting, and touching the church affairs altogether in the flesh
To criticize or condemn others carelessly is to destroy the temple, not discerning the Body, and will cause one to suffer loss
As a plant you need to grow, and through growth you will have transformation to become the precious material for God's building
You would never use anything of your natural life or worldly ability-wood, grass, or stubble-to build the church
Nor would you touch the Body the church of Christ the temple of God carelessly to suffer destruction spiritually soulishly or physically
After giving such a design, after laying such a foundation, he is now superintending to see how the building is going on
Because of your not seeing, some of you have been ambitious to be something and have tried to have another line in the Lord's recovery
Anything that we do, teach, or practice must be absolutely according to the holy Word, which is God's completed revelation
The Holy Spirit was involved, not in the outward, objective creation but in the inward, subjective incarnation
To carry out the divine conception of Jesus there was the need of two essences-the divine essence and the human essence
On the day of His resurrection in the evening, He breathed Himself into His disciples for them to receive the Holy Breath, the Holy Spirit
He charged them to go and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
After this He ascended to the heavens, fully accomplishing the very process for the Triune God to go through to be the consummated Spirit
The Holy Spirit is the power, the means, and the factor for God's move on this earth, but that is just on one side
If there had been no one accord on the earth in Acts 1, the powerful and dynamic Spirit could have never been poured out
After this pouring out, they remained and continued in this one accord along with the three thousand saved on the day of Pentecost
Romans is a book on the principles of the Christian life and the church life, yet in 15:6 it charges us with the same thing-one accord
Any society, group, or movement needs this one accord that comes out of the same kind of thought, the same kind of knowledge
Chapters one through twelve are the first section, and chapters thirteen through twenty-eight are the second section
Paul, a younger apostle, rebuked Peter to his face, pointing out Peter's hypocrisy in remaining in the old dispensation
As a result, Peter made a big mistake, nearly leading the entire church to go astray from God's New Testament economy
The Catholic teaching is that Peter was the successor of Christ, and as His successor he could never have made a mistake
One great mistake was a decree saying that Mary, the so-called 'holy mother,' the 'mother of God,' was sinless!
Barnabas was the brother who brought Paul into practical fellowship with the disciples in Jerusalem and who brought Paul into the ministry
After returning to Antioch and encouraging the saints with the solution to this problem, they prepared to go out on their second journey
Barnabas was older than Paul, more qualified and experienced, and the one who brought Paul into the fellowship and the ministry
Surely we would have taken the opinion from the one who was older more experienced and from the one who brought the other into the ministry
Peter was in the leadership in the first section of the Acts, and Paul was in another leadership in the second section of Acts
Paul also said in 1 Corinthians 3 that he was a wise master builder who had laid a unique foundation which no one else was able to lay
One thousand Apolloses could do this, but the foundation was unique and was laid by a unique leader-Paul as the wise master builder
He was a planter, and Apollos was not; and he was the unique wise architect who gave the design and who superintended the building work
His leadership was altogether based upon his divine revelation because in the divine revelation the design can be seen
In the Lord's move on this earth from Acts through Hebrews, there was one teaching and one leadership based upon this one teaching
In the first twelve chapters of Acts was the teaching given by Peter, and the leadership was based upon his teaching
In the last sixteen chapters of Acts was the teaching and the revelation of Paul, and the leadership was based upon his teaching
Some have said that there is no need to go to Brother Lee because he always answers the same way-'Go to the Lord and pray'
In the Acts and the Epistles Paul told Timothy and his other coworkers to go to certain places to remain in other places and to come to him
On the one hand, control is practiced along with hierarchy, especially in Catholicism with the pope as the highest authority
If they had not accepted his ministry, they would have had to go to the teachings of the denominations, and they were tired of that
The recovery in mainland China from 1922 to 1949 was very prevailing in teaching in the divine revelation but not so prevailing in practice
The churches in mainland China accepted the same ministry and received the same kind of teaching, yet in practice they were all different
The Brethren taught this based upon the fact that the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 are all different
They did not see the light that the seven churches were different, not in their testimony, but in their degradation
Brother Nee stayed away from his ministry until the revival that started in Chefoo in 1940 was brought over to Shanghai in 1947
About thirty to forty co-workers and leading ones from nearby cities were attending the meetings of the revival
After the first morning of fellowship, a sister took the lead to say, 'Brother Nee, since we heard this, why don't we practice it'?
Within this period of time our number increased from about four hundred to forty thousand, a hundredfold increase
Ninety percent of the new believers among us did not turn this way from Christianity but were typical Gentiles
If a local church did not take this new way and we stopped recognizing it as a local church, this would be sectarian
In the Old Testament there was a judge whose name was Gideon, and he took only three hundred to form an army to fight the battle
What we are burdened to do is to sound a trumpet, letting the children of God know what the Lord is doing today
The Lord is calling His dear saints, who would be willing to be brought back to the one accord, to fight the battle
Even if you earned two million dollars a year, you should not spend more than what is required for the need of your actual living
With your pure conscience and the indwelling Spirit you should regulate yourself to be a money-making full-timer
There is no hint in the New Testament telling us that in the Lord's move there could or should be more than one leadership
You also must study a person's background, his history, his doings, and his teachings to discern his qualifications for taking the lead
Asia was a province of the Roman Empire in Asia Minor, far away from Rome where Paul, who was in prison, was writing his Epistle to Timothy
Among the churches in Asia was the church in Ephesus, which was fully established by Paul's ministry as recorded in Acts 19
They received the gospel, the teaching, the edification, and the establishment from the ministry of the Apostle Paul
Because they turned away from Paul's ministry, the churches in Asia declined into a situation full of degradation
The degradation of the churches in Asia as recorded in Revelation 2 and 3 was due to their turning away from the proper ministry
Within thirty years after Paul's final Epistle to Timothy, these churches had reached such a point of degradation
Although they were weak, the Lord still appraised them highly, telling them that they had a little power and that they had kept the word
To turn away from the proper teaching is a terrible thing that will result in degradation and in picking up other teachings
