<h1 class="title">THE PRACTICE OF<br />
THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>The previous chapters cover five points related to the organization of the church. Having seen these five basic points clearly, we now come to the practice related to the organization of the church. Although it may seem that we are studying merely external matters, these matters are very much related to our service and life. Some people think that it is sufficient to be spiritual and that there is no need to study in-depth the outward matters such as the organization of the church. This may sound reasonable, but the attitude is wrong. Those who neglect the organization of the church will surely suffer loss in their service and spiritual life.</p>
<p>Even though the Bible does not contain a charter for the organization of the church, it does contain the fact of the organization of the church. Human beings are not born with a list of rules and regulations; nevertheless, because we are living persons, we naturally have certain laws and principles operating within us. Only man-made organizations require rules and regulations. Since the church is a living entity, the Bible does not contain outward rules related to its organization. Although there are no organizational regulations concerning the church, we should study it in the same way that medical people study a human body.</p>
<p>Although we cannot set up rules for the composition of the body, in order to maintain its health we should know the function of each part of the body and its relationship to the other members. Not only doctors but everyone should know the structure of the human body. In the same way, every healthy Christian, not only those serving the Lord, needs to know the organization of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE CHURCH BEING<br />
GOD MINGLED WITH MAN AND MAN MINGLED WITH GOD</h2>
<p>The human body as an organization has its basic constituents, and the church as an organization also has its basic constituents. The basic constituents of the church are people who have the life of God, that is, who are God mingled with man and man mingled with God. On the one hand, from a superficial view the constituents of the church are those who have God&rsquo;s life. These are not nominal Christians, because nominal Christians are the constituents of Christendom, not the church. The deeper view is that the constituents of the church are God plus man and man plus God. If there is only man, there is no church, and if there is only God, there is also no church. The church is the mingling of both God and man. The church is constituted of God and of man; both are necessary.</p>
<p>The church is composed of two elements: God and man. Only when both elements are present and are mingled together can there be the church. When we speak of the constituents of the church, we should not speak merely of the saved ones. This is not adequate. We must have a deeper view; that is, the church is the mingling of man with God.</p>
<p>As a constituent of the church God is not merely God the Creator but more precisely God mingled with man. As a basic constituent of the church, He is God incarnated, crucified, and resurrected. After having passed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, God has two elements: divinity and humanity. Many people, when they are newly saved, believe that the Savior whom they have received is simply God. Before incarnation, God was simply God, but after the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Christ, God is in man, and man is in God. If we touch this matter in a deep and detailed way, we will see that God went through a process that involved incarnation, death, resurrection, and ascension. In brief, we need to realize that as a basic constituent of the church, God is not simply God but God mingled with man.</p>
<p>If we desire to know the organization of the church, we must realize that God and man are its basic constituents. Man is a constituent of the church. As a constituent, man cannot be removed from the church. Without man there is no church. However, if there is only man and not God, there would also be no church. If humanity was removed and only the Spirit remained, this Spirit would not be the Spirit of the God who became flesh. In order to know God, a person must know the church, and in order to know man, a proper man, he must also know the church. The church is the mingling of God and man. Man cannot be missing from any item or aspect related to the church. The church is a mingling of divinity and humanity. If we know this, many problems in the church will spontaneously disappear. We do not desire to study the mere outward appearance of the church but to discover the basic principles concerning the church.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that even the appointment of elders in the church is a matter of the mingling of God with man and of man with God. On the one hand, God works in a group of brothers and causes them to grow in life; on the other hand, God appoints them to be elders through the coordination of the apostles with the Holy Spirit (Acts 14:23; 20:28). When the apostles appoint elders, they surely need to seek the leading of the Holy Spirit through prayer, but they also need to use their discernment and judgment. When it is necessary to appoint elders, the apostles need to tell the Lord, &ldquo;O Lord, You do not appoint the elders directly, but You entrust this matter to men. Nonetheless, may You be the One who makes the decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a solemn matter. Throughout the generations many activities in the church have been carried out either in one extreme or in the other. Some believers are too spiritual, and others are too rational. Any activity carried out according to either extreme is wrong. God must administrate the church through man. In the administration of the church, man must submit to the authority of God and let Him rule. If we touch the feeling of the Holy Spirit, we will see that every matter in the church is accomplished by God mingling Himself with man. The principle of the New Jerusalem is the same. In the New Jerusalem God dwells with man.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 3, The Organization of the Church &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
