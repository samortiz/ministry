<h2 class="head1">THE THREE ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Our three daily sessions will cover the church in respect to three different aspects. The first aspect concerns the spiritual aspects of the church, that is, the meaning of the church. The second aspect is the course of the church, the journey of the church, which is similar to church history. The third aspect concerns the organization of the church. Hence, these three lines include the spiritual meaning of the church, its course, and its organization.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORIGIN OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Mystery Hidden in God Who Created All Things</h2>
<p>The first spiritual aspect of the church relates to the origin of the church. From where did the church come? When did it come into being? Ephesians 3:9-11 and 1:4-6 are two important portions of the Word related to these questions. Ephesians 3:9-11 says, &ldquo;To enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout the ages, since eternity past, a mystery has been hidden in God, who created all things. The Greek word for <em>eternity</em> in this verse is related to <em>eternal</em> as in &ldquo;eternal life&rdquo; (John 3:16). This mystery has been hidden from eternity past in God who created &ldquo;all things.&rdquo; Ephesians 3:9 speaks of &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; and &ldquo;economy.&rdquo; The word <em>economy</em> is rendered as &ldquo;dispensation&rdquo; in the Chinese Union Version. &ldquo;Dispensation&rdquo; is a general translation that can also be rendered as &ldquo;management&rdquo; or &ldquo;administration.&rdquo; Here we use a better translation, &ldquo;economy,&rdquo; which denotes an arrangement, management, plan, and dispensation. This mystery is God&rsquo;s dispensation, God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Making Known the Wisdom of God<br />
through the Church</h2>
<p>Verse 10 says, &ldquo;In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church.&rdquo; The wisdom of God is made known through the church. First Corinthians 1:30 says, &ldquo;Christ...became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; Here <em>wisdom</em> is a general term that is all-inclusive. In other words, a person&rsquo;s wisdom includes everything that a person is. In the same way, God&rsquo;s wisdom includes all that God is. Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; Verse 3 says, &ldquo;In whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.&rdquo; If we put these two verses together, we will see that wisdom is not something simple but something inclusive. The mystery, this economy, is the wisdom of God, that is, all that God is, and it is expressed through the church so that the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies may know and see the wisdom of God.</p>
<p>The fact that the rulers and the authorities are in the heavenlies may cause us to consider them to be angels. However, if we read Ephesians 1, 2, and 6, we will realize that the rulers and the authorities refer to Satan and his messengers, that is, to the rebellious angels. Satan and his subordinates were originally angels who ruled and reigned for God. The dispensation of the mystery is to manifest the wisdom of God, all that God is, to the angels, especially to the rebellious ones, in order to put them to shame.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Church Being<br />
the Plan That God Made in Eternity</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:9-11 speaks first of the economy, then of the mystery, and then of the purpose, the plan, that God made. God&rsquo;s plan, that is, His purpose, is eternal; hence, it is called &ldquo;the eternal purpose.&rdquo; In verse 11, according to the Greek, <em>eternal</em> is an adjective modifying the word <em>purpose</em>. <em>Eternal</em> here has two meanings. First, in relation to time, God&rsquo;s purpose, His plan, is eternal; it is ever-existing, without beginning or end. This means that the church was in eternity past and is for eternity future. The plan is in eternity past, and the goal of the plan is for eternity future. Second, in relation to nature, God&rsquo;s plan is eternal, uncreated, and unchanging. Eternity is the nature of God. Eternity is not merely a matter of time but also a matter of nature. In other words, being eternal refers not only to time but also to nature.</p>
<p>For example, if we temporarily stay in a certain place, it is a matter not only of time but also of nature. Everything that is created is temporary. The nature of a creature is that of being temporary, whereas the nature of the Creator is eternal. These are two different natures. The eternal nature has a particular significance; that is, it is uncreated. For something to be uncreated means that it is without beginning or end, self-existing, ever-existing, and unchanging. Therefore, the fact that this plan is eternal means that it is eternal not only in time but also in nature.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:4-6 says, &ldquo;Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love, predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved.&rdquo; There are three main points in these verses: first, God&rsquo;s choosing; second, God&rsquo;s predestinating; and third, our being made holy, receiving the sonship, and being to Himself. The third point can be considered the goal of God&rsquo;s choosing and predestinating.</p>
<p>Verses 8 through 11 say, &ldquo;Which He caused to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence, making known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself, unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him; in whom also we were designated as an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One who works all things according to the counsel of His will.&rdquo; Chapter 1 speaks of God&rsquo;s choosing and predestinating; it also speaks of the goal of God&rsquo;s choosing and predestinating, which is for us to be made holy, to receive the sonship, and to be to Himself. All these points originate from His plan, His economy.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1 and 3 show that the origin of the church is God&rsquo;s eternal plan. The church did not come into being by accident but was planned by God in eternity. We should not think that the Lord saved us and gathered us together to be the church because we sinned. This thought is too low and originates from a human perspective. From God&rsquo;s perspective, in eternity, before man even sinned, He planned for the church. The church is the center of all things; the church was planned by God in eternity.</p>
<p>The church is eternal both in terms of time and nature; it is not something accidental, temporal, or coincidental. The church was planned in eternity, long before the creation of the world, before we sinned, before we were born, before we were created, and even before all creatures were created. In other words, the church was a matter in eternity before the ages. If it were not for the purpose of obtaining the church, God would not have needed the creation. God created all things in order to obtain the church. Ephesians shows this point clearly. Then in Revelation 21 and 22, the New Jerusalem speaks further regarding God&rsquo;s intention. The New Jerusalem is the church that God desires to obtain. Hence, the origin of the church is the plan that God formed in eternity.</p>
