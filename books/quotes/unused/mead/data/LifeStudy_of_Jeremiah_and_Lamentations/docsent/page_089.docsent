   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 20:11-18 we have Jeremiah's accusation against Israel and his cursing of his birthday.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His Accusation against Israel</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In his accusation against Israel, Jeremiah asked Jehovah to let him see His vengeance on Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Jeremiah was assured that Jehovah was with him like a mighty one who terrifies and that his persecutors would stumble and not prevail.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They would be greatly ashamed, having an eternal humiliation that would not be forgotten v. 11 . Then he went on to say, "Jehovah of hosts, who tries the righteous, / Who sees the inward parts and the heart, / Let me see Your vengeance on them, / For I have revealed my cause to You.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>/ Sing to Jehovah; / Praise Jehovah; / For He has delivered the soul of the poor / From the hand of the evildoers" vv.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His Cursing of His Birthday</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Immediately after accusing Israel Jeremiah cursed his birthday vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>14-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verses 14 and 15 say, "Cursed be the day / On which I was born; / Let not the day be blessed / On which my mother bore me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>/ Cursed be the man who brought good news / To my father, saying, / A male child has been born to you, / Causing him much joy."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jeremiah concluded his cursing of his birthday by saying, "Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Did I come out from the womb / To see trouble and sorrow, / That my days may be spent in shame?" v. 18 . As a man of God, Jeremiah would never curse God; neither would he curse God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But he exercised the right to curse himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why did Jeremiah curse his birthday?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The answer is that he was in a dilemma and that this dilemma forced him to curse his birthday.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jeremiah's dilemma was of three factors.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first factor was God's determination to punish Israel severely.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The second factor was Israel's evil condition, which was deserving of God's punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The third factor was Israel's rejection of Jeremiah's word and their persecution of him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because of these three factors Jeremiah had no way to go on and therefore cursed his birthday.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we consider Jeremiah's situation, we realize that to speak for God is not an easy thing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God always determines what we must speak.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we go along with Him, we will offend people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, some will defame us, speak lies about us, and even set traps to ensnare us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A faithful servant who speaks for God will always be in such a dilemma.</S>
