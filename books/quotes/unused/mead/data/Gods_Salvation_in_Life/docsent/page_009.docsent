   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We become the real Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As Christians, are we men or God?</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What we live out are the virtues as manifestations of God's attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The reason we Christians can surpass others in being loving, holy, just, and upright is not because of anything in ourselves but because God who lives in us lives out His attributes from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once His attributes are lived out from us, the divine attributes become our human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is to live Christ and to manifest Christ to take Christ as our life and live Him out as our living.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not only so, this nature of the divine life builds us together to constitute us the Body of Christ, which is His church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is regeneration, which is the first great step of God's salvation in life.</S>
