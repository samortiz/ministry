   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING IN OUR HUMAN SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Eph 1:17; 2:22; 3:5, 16; 4:23; 5:18; 6:18</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous messages we have seen that the building up of the church is God s aim and purpose, and this building is the test of our genuine spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Moreover, the building is by the growth in life and the transformation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we will consider how the building up of the church is absolutely in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The human spirit is mentioned in each of the six chapters of Ephesians, which is a book on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This proves that our spirit is strongly related to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to have a practical church life, we must know our human spirit, and we must be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE HUMAN SPIRIT IN THE BOOK OF EPHESIANS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ephesians 1:17 says, That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The spirit mentioned here is not the Holy Spirit; it is our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to practice the church life, we need an enlightened human spirit, one that is full of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we will be able to see the spiritual and heavenly things not in the mind, in the soul, or even in the heart but in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 22 of chapter 2 says, In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Again, spirit here is not the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not logical to say that the Holy Spirit is the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit is not the dwelling place but the Dweller.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The habitation, the dwelling place, of God is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 5 of chapter 3 says, Which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Spirit here is the human spirit of the apostles and prophets, a spirit regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It can be considered the mingled spirit, the human spirit mingled with God s Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such a mingled spirit is the means by which the New Testament revelation concerning Christ and the church is revealed to the apostles and prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need the same kind of spirit to see such a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 16 says, That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The inner man is our regenerated human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our regenerated spirit needs to be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The issue of the strengthening of our spirit is that Christ makes His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The heart is mainly the soul, being composed of the mind, emotion, will, and the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When our spirit is strengthened, Christ takes over our soul to make it His home.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only our spirit but also our soul becomes His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ came into our spirit as only a small seed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, our spirit is somewhat weak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, every descendant of Adam, the unbelievers and the believers alike, is strong in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The spirit of the unbelievers is deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The spirit of the believers has been made alive, renewed, and regenerated, but it is still too weak.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is difficult to practice the church life if our spirit remains weak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That is why the apostle Paul, after he released the vision of the church, bowed his knees to pray specifically that we may be strengthened into our inner man, that we would be strong in our spirit, not in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we are strong in our spirit, Christ who is in our spirit has the ground and the opportunity to spread from our spirit to take over our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then our whole being with all our inward parts mind, emotion, will, and conscience will be possessed by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ will make His home in our heart and occupy our entire inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 19 concludes, That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because all the fullness of God dwells in Christ Col 2:9 , and Christ possesses our whole being to make His home there, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that we will be fully mingled with God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This experience in the spirit is necessary for us to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ephesians 4:23 says, That you be renewed in the spirit of your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When our spirit is strengthened, Christ spreads from our spirit into our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At that point the spirit subdues and possesses the mind, and the mind comes under the rule, the control, of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way the spirit becomes the spirit of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 23 is between verses 22 and 24.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verse 22 speaks of putting off the old man, and verse 24 of putting on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The secret to putting off the old man and putting on the new man is to be renewed in the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verse 18 of chapter 5 says, Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to the Greek text, there is no article before spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Strictly speaking, this verse speaks of being filled not with the Spirit but in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 18 presents a contrast between the body and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To be drunk with wine is to be filled in the body, but to be filled in spirit is to be filled with Christ, who is all that God is, the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should no longer be filled in our body by drinking wine.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Instead, we need to drink Christ as the fullness of God for the filling of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all need to be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verse 18 of chapter 6 says, Praying at every time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Again, the Greek text has no article before spirit, indicating the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to pray at every time not only with words but in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our prayer must be something of God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To pray merely with words from the mind is to pray by ourselves, which is not a genuine prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, when we pray in the spirit, we have a genuine prayer, and Christ prays within us.</S>
