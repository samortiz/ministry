<h2 class=head2>The Relationship between the Church and Life</h2><p>We also need to see the relationship between the church and life. First, the church has been regenerated by God and possesses the regenerated life. The church is of life because every member of the church has been regenerated by God. When I was young, at least two books told me that regeneration is simply a renewal, that “everything in the past died yesterday, and everything henceforth is born today.” I could not accept this saying. In 1954, I came across a book by Brother T. Austin-Sparks, in which he said that regeneration is to have God’s life in addition to our human life. That was the day I became truly clear about what regeneration is. Regeneration is to receive another life, God’s zoe life, in addition to man’s psuche life.<p>If we do not have Christ as God’s life, we do not have life. Therefore, 1 John 5:12 says, “He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.” Since the Son of God is this zoe life (John 11:25; 14:6; Col. 3:4), once we have the zoe life, we are regenerated. Being born from our mother’s womb was our first birth for us to receive the psuche life, which is the human life. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were born of God. That was our regeneration for us to receive the zoe life, which is the life of God. Hence, the church is out of the zoe life.<p>Second, the church grows in life. The matter of growth is mentioned many times in the New Testament, such as arriving at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13), the growth of the Body (v. 16), and growing with the growth of God (Col. 2:19). All these refer to the growth of the zoe life in us. When the life of God grows in us, we grow in this life unto maturity and arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.<p>Third, the church is transformed in life. When life grows, there is transformation. When a flower blossoms, that is its transformation. Initially, flower seeds are not pretty, but the more they grow, the better they look and the more they are transformed to be beautiful. Children grow and change daily so that they become bigger and more mature. To become grown-up is to be changed. In the zoe life, we do not grow worse or change for the worse. Rather, we grow stronger and become newer, even rejuvenated. Therefore, we are born of life, grow in life, and are transformed in life.<p>Fourth, the church is built in life. Without the zoe life, there is no building of the church. The natural human life, being divisive and individualistic, does not care for building. However, the zoe life likes the building. Only the zoe life can cause us to be built together.<p>Furthermore, the church is unique in the universe, though it also appears in localities. Although there is one church in each locality, there is still only one church. Therefore, the contents of the church are Christ, the Spirit, and life, and the appearance of the church is one church in one locality. If we truly love the Lord, we must grow in life, live by the Spirit, and live in Christ. Eventually, we are manifested as the church in every locality to be the expression of the Triune God as the shining golden lampstands, the ultimate consummation of which is the New Jerusalem. All the above items comprise the church.
