<h2 class="head1">JOHN&rsquo;S TESTIMONY BEING<br />
A REVELATION OF THE LAMB AND THE DOVE</h2>
<p>When John the Baptist came out to testify of the Lord Jesus, it was in the midst of a background full of religious concepts. Of all the people around the Lord Jesus, only John the Baptist, who was sent by God, had revelation; everyone else was full of religious concepts based on their religious background in Judaism. All those who came to the Lord Jesus, whether to contact Him, inquire of Him, or even to follow Him, were under the influence of deep religious concepts. These people surrounded the Lord Jesus, and with this religious background, there was a strong religious element in their response to the Lord.</p>
<p>According to their religious concepts, the Jews were expecting a Messiah to come to receive the kingdom and to be a King to restore the nation of Israel. They also were looking for a Prophet to perform miracles, as Moses did to rescue God&rsquo;s people, or to be as powerful as Elijah. At a minimum, they were looking for a great Rabbi, a great Teacher, to come and teach them. However, their most earnest hope was for the Messiah to come and be the King of Israel so that the Israelites might break away from the iron rod of the Roman Empire, escaping from the domination of Rome and obtaining their freedom. When people went to see the Lord Jesus, whether they were leaders in the Jewish religion or lowly people, they were full of these religious expectations.</p>
<p>However, in the midst of this religious atmosphere, John the Baptist&rsquo;s twofold testimony was full of revelation. While everyone was looking for the Messiah, the King of Israel, the Prophet, Elijah, or a Rabbi, John the Baptist cried out, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; (John 1:29). John&rsquo;s testimony differed greatly from the concept of others, who were hoping that the Lord was the Messiah, the Prophet, or Elijah. He testified that the Lord Jesus came to the earth to be the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world. Not only so, he also testified, &ldquo;I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him. And I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (vv. 32-33). John saw the Holy Spirit descending upon the Lord Jesus as a dove. Therefore, he testified that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God (v. 34), who came to give people the Holy Spirit in order for them to receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In John&rsquo;s two simple testimonies, we see two signs&mdash;the Lamb and the dove. The Lamb indicates that Christ takes away our sin, and the dove indicates that He gives us the Holy Spirit. The Lamb of God takes away something negative, whereas the dove imparts something positive. The Lamb takes away our sin, and the dove supplies the Holy Spirit, who is God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAMB AND THE DOVE COVERING<br />
THE ENTIRE REVELATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>John the Baptist&rsquo;s twofold testimony covers matters not only in the Gospel of John but also in John&rsquo;s Epistles, in the other Gospels, and even in the entire New Testament. The entire New Testament speaks of the Lord Jesus as the Lamb with the Spirit as a dove. He is the Lamb, who takes away the sin of the world and thus removes the barrier of sin between man and God. Whenever we speak of the Lamb, we must consider the cross. The story of the Lamb is the story of the cross. Our sins were taken away by the Lamb at the cross. When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He solved not only the problem of sin but also the problems related to the world, Satan, the flesh, and the self. All the problems between us and God were solved by the Lord Jesus as the Lamb of God on the cross. The New Testament repeatedly, thoroughly, and from many directions speaks of the Lord Jesus as the Lamb of God, who died on the cross and shed His blood for our redemption, solving all the problems between us and God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the Holy Spirit is not separate from the Lord (Matt. 1:20, Luke 4:1), the Lord gives the Holy Spirit to the believers and baptizes the believers in the Holy Spirit (1 John 3:24; 4:13; John 1:33). Thus, He causes the Holy Spirit to enter into man and causes man to enter into the Holy Spirit. As a result, man is inwardly and outwardly filled with the Holy Spirit, mingled with the Holy Spirit, and fully immersed in the Holy Spirit. When a person is immersed in and mingled with the Holy Spirit in this way, he is mingled with God as one. In the New Testament there are many places that speak of the dove&mdash;the Holy Spirit. If we removed the Lamb, the cross, the blood, the death of Christ, and the Holy Spirit from the New Testament, there would not be much content left. John the Baptist&rsquo;s twofold testimony covers nearly all the testimony of the New Testament.</p>
<p>The original intention of God and the focus of His work in the New Testament age concern His Son being the Lamb with the dove. As the Lamb, He takes away the sin of the world, removes the barrier of sin between God and man, and solves man&rsquo;s problems before God. The Lamb on the cross is a great termination. As the Lamb with the Holy Spirit as a dove, the Lord gives man the Holy Spirit and mingles man with the Holy Spirit. These two aspects of God&rsquo;s work accomplish His eternal desire. This is God&rsquo;s revelation.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life and Building in the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 38</div><br></body></html>
