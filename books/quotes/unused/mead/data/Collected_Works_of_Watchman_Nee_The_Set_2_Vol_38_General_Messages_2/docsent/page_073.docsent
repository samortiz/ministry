   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAYING ON OF HANDS FOR THE GIFT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul said to Timothy, "For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands" 2 Tim 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that the gift which Timothy had received at the time of the laying on of hands needed to be revived and rekindled.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Timothy 4:14 says, "Do not neglect the gift which is in you, which was given to you by means of prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we see that the gift was given by the apostle with the presbytery by means of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They ushered Timothy into the Body through the laying on of hands, while the anointing bestowed the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>While they laid their hands on Timothy and prayed for him, God gave one of them a prayer of prophecy, which foretold the kind of person that Timothy would be.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This prayer governed the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When an experienced person lays his hands on others, his prayer will become the characteristic of the life of those on whom he lays his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the authority of the Head dispensing the proper gift through the laying on of hands of the representative members.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who receive the laying on of hands should realize that from that day on they can no longer trust in themselves and no longer be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are a part of the Body, and they can no longer seek their own benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even if they seek after spiritual things, they have to seek them for the sake of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thereafter, the Lord can use them or others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When other members are used, they are no longer envious.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many people work in an individualistic way, and they pursue in an individualistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to ask God to deliver us from these things in the same way that we asked Him to deliver us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>PRAYER WITH THE ANOINTING OF OIL</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>James 5:14 says, "Is anyone among you ill?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This must be read in conjunction with 1 Corinthians 11:29-31: "For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not discern the body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because of this many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if we discerned ourselves, we would not be judged."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some become sick because they have acted contrary to physiological laws, while others become sick because they have acted contrary to the law in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a Christian does not discern the Body and does not act according to the rule of the Body, he will surely become weak and sick.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This kind of sickness requires the elders' attention.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The elders are appointed by God in a local church as representative members; they represent the Body of Christ in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They should come and anoint the sick with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Psalm 133:2 says, "It is like the fine oil upon the head/That ran down upon the beard,/Upon Aaron's beard,/That ran down to the hem of his garments."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The ointment was poured on Aaron's head, and it ran down from his head to his garments.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's ointment is on Christ's head; it is an ointment which the Holy Spirit gives to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christians receive their ointment by coming under Christ the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What does it mean for a sick man to ask the elders to pray for him?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose a man is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can understand his sickness by looking at the medicine prescribed to him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the elders are asked to come and anoint a sick man with oil, it means that he has detached himself from the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a Christian maintains his proper standing as a member, he will not lose his anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He becomes sick because he has not discerned the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The elders should bring the sick ones under the Head and recover them to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you live in the Body, you will not lose your anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you leave the Body, you either become sick or you die.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers and sisters, everything will be well if you really see the life of the Body and live in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The sickness in James 5 is a special kind of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We know that it is a special sickness and not an ordinary one because verse 15 says, "And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What kind of sin did he commit?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The sin he committed must have been the sin of being detached from the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If his sin were a personal sin, he would only need the blood, and he would be forgiven when he confessed to men and dealt with the sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There would be no need to ask the elders to come and anoint him with oil before he could be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The anointing of the elders cannot remove sin; only the blood can wash us of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yet verse 15 says that if he sins, his sins will be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This forgiveness comes from the prayer of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, the sin in this verse is different from ordinary sins.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This sin is the sin of walking contrary to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This sin cannot be forgiven if one just prays to God; the elders need to pray for him before he can be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He has to look to others for this forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verse 16 is even more peculiar: "Therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another that you may be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The petition of a righteous man avails much in its working."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This verse says that we should confess our sins to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to confess our sins to one another because something is wrong in the Body of Christ, and the mutual confession of sins is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The sick have to confess to the elders, and the elders have to confess to the sick.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This shows that when one member is in trouble, the whole Body is responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If one member who has been healthy in all respects suddenly becomes sick, the elders have to take responsibility for it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It may be that the elders have been lacking in love.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It may be that the elders have been negligent in care.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, the elders have to confess these sins.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As for the sick, they have to confess the sin of acting independently and the sin of detaching themselves from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Not only do we have to confess our sins to one another, but we also have to pray for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Praying for one another is asking that the elders pray for the sick ones and that the sick ones pray for the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hence, there is always the need for love and humility in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If a person is detached from the Body, he will incur spiritual sickness as well as physical sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Whenever he is detached from the Body, he loses the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those who are outside the Body need to realize the importance of returning to the Body and coming under the anointing.</S>
