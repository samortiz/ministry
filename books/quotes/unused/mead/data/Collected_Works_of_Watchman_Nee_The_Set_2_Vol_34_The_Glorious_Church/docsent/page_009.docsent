   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S REST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In all six days of God's work of creation, His creation of man was distinct.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All His work throughout the six days was for this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His real aim was to create man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to do this, God first had to repair the ruined earth and heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Genesis 2:4 says, "These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"The heavens and the earth" refer to the creation in the beginning, since at that time it was the heavens that were first formed and then the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the second part, "in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens," refers to His repair and restoration work, since in this work the earth was cared for first and then the heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After God restored the ruined earth and heaven, He created the man of His design.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the sixth day, there was the seventh day; on this day God rested from all His work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rest comes after work: work must be first, and then rest may follow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, work must be completed to entire satisfaction before there can be any rest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the work has not been done completely and satisfactorily, there can never be any rest to the mind or heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not, therefore, esteem lightly the fact that God rested after six days of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For God to rest is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was necessary for Him to have gained a certain objective before He could rest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How great the power must be which moved such a Creator God to rest!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To cause such a God, who plans so much and who is full of life, to enter into rest requires the greatest strength.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Genesis 2 shows us that God rested on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How is it that God could rest?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The end of Genesis 1 records that it was because "God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good" v. 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God rested on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before the seventh day, He had work to do, and prior to His work, He had a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Romans 11 speaks of the mind of the Lord and His judgments and ways.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ephesians 1 speaks of the mystery of His will, His good pleasure, and His foreordained purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Ephesians 3 also speaks of His foreordained purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From these Scriptures we gather that God is not only a God who works, but a God who purposes and plans.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When He delighted to work, He proceeded to work; He worked because He wished to work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When He found satisfaction with His work, He rested.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we desire to know God's will, His plan, His good pleasure, and His purpose, we have only to look at that which caused Him to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we see that God rests in a certain thing, then we may know that is something He was originally after.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man too cannot rest in that which does not satisfy him; he must gain what he is after and then he will have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must not regard this rest lightly, for its meaning is very great.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God did not rest in the first six days, but He rested in the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His rest reveals that God accomplished His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He did something which made Him rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, He could rest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must note the word "behold" in Genesis 1:31.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What is its meaning?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we have purchased a certain object with which we are particularly satisfied, we turn it around with pleasure and look it over well.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is what it means to behold.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God did not just casually "look" upon all that He had made and see that it was good.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rather, He "beheld" everything which He had made and saw that it was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to take note that God was there at the creation "beholding" what He had made.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The word "rested" is the declaration that God was satisfied, that God delighted in what He had done; it proclaims that God's purpose was attained and His good pleasure was accomplished to the fullest.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His work was perfected to such an extent that it could not have been made better.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this reason God commanded the Israelites to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God was after something.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God was seeking something to satisfy Himself, and He attained it; therefore, He rested.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the meaning of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not that man should purchase fewer things or walk less miles.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Sabbath tells us that God had a heart's desire, a requirement to satisfy Himself, and a work had to be done to fulfill His heart's desire and demand.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since God has obtained what He was after, He is at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not a matter of a particular day.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Sabbath tells us that God has fulfilled His plan, attained His goal, and satisfied His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God is One who demands satisfaction, and He is also One who can be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After God has what He desires, He rests.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What then brought rest to God?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What was it that gave Him such satisfaction?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>During the six days of creation there were light, air, grass, herbs, and trees; there were the sun, the moon, and the stars; there were fish, birds, cattle, creeping things, and beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But in all these God did not find rest.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Finally there was man, and God rested from all His work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All of the creation before man was preparatory.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All of God's expectations were focused upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When God gained a man, He was satisfied and He rested.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Let us read Genesis 1:27-28 again: "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now read Genesis 1:31 with Genesis 2:3: "And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good....And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God had a purpose, and this purpose was to gain man man with authority to rule over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only the realization of this purpose could satisfy God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If this could be obtained, all would be well.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>On the sixth day God's purpose was achieved.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good...and he rested on the seventh day from all his work."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God's purpose and expectation were attained; He could stop and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God's rest was based upon man who would rule.</S>
