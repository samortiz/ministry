   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE GOSPEL BEING OUR LIVING Scripture Reading: Rom 1:14-16; 1 Cor 9:16-17; John 15:1-8, 16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that Christ is our life, the truth is our freedom, and the church of the living God is our house.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we want to see the gospel as our living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are many ways to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The best way is to sing hymns to people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The young brothers and sisters can use the hymns to preach the gospel to their schoolmates.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This kind of hymn singing should be informal.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the young people preach the gospel by singing hymns, their joy will touch their classmates, and when they sing to their classmates a second time, their classmates will easily believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since the gospel is our living, we should pay attention to and practice several things related to preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A BURDEN BEING CRUCIAL</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>IN ORDER TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we preach the gospel, it is crucial that we have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul was a person who preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Romans 1:14 he said, I am debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This verse speaks of owing a debt, which is a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Burdens differ in size, but a debt is a heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we owe others much money, this will continually be a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We will think about the debt when we are studying and working and even when we are sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, as soon as we pay our debts, this burden will be removed from us, and we will immediately feel lighter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was Paul s feeling toward preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He said that he was a debtor not only to individuals but also to the Jews and the Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was a debtor to different races, and he was a debtor to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This shows that Paul had a large capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The young saints should preach the gospel at school because they feel the burden of a gospel debt to their schoolmates.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of course, the capacity of the young people may not be as large as Paul s capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, they may not owe all their schoolmates a debt.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nevertheless, they owe a debt to their classmates and especially to the person who sits next to them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as we are alive, we will always be indebted to a few persons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We bear the burden of this debt every day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CULTIVATING A GOSPEL SPIRIT THROUGH PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After we have a burden for the gospel, we need a gospel spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even though a gospel spirit initially comes from a burden, there is still the need of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should pray about the gospel debts that we owe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The best way is to make a list of our classmates at the beginning of the semester and pray for them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we pray, we should seek the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord may give us a burden to pray specifically for certain classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more we pray for our classmates the better.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our prayer can be compared to placing a piece of paper on a balance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paper is light and does not weigh much.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, if we pray every day in the morning and in the evening, we will soon place several hundred pieces of paper on the balance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This will eventually be heavier than any weight on the other side of the balance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brother George M ller ran an orphanage, and he testified that he prayed for many people by name.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By the time he died, everyone whom he had prayed for by name was saved, except for one person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, this person was saved shortly after Brother M ller s death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>LEARNING TO BE THICK-SKINNED</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We also need to learn to be thick-skinned when we preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a person is not thick-skinned, his words cannot move others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, few people are thick-skinned by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to practice in order to become thick-skinned.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am thick-skinned because I have practiced for sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I was in primary school the first time that I spoke in public.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I stood trembling before the audience and even forgot my speech.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The young people should learn to be thick-skinned.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those who are thick-skinned and crazy in spirit can preach the gospel.</S>
