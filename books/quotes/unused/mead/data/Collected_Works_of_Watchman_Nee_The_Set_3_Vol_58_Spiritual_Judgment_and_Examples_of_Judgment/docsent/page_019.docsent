   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 6 Date:June 25, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER C. L.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a non-Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the age of seventeen I heard the gospel and knew that I was a sinner destined for hell.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I called on the Lord's name and prayed to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After I prayed I felt relieved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The next day I dealt with my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I was twenty-one years old, I had a spiritual turn, and I consecrated myself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I sold my possessions, including my wedding ring, and gave up everything to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1942 I left the denominations and began to meet with brothers and sisters on the ground of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I have two questions: How does a man know whether his inner man and outer man are separated?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How can we submit to authority?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT The Breaking of Man</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our brother is a person who can easily accept God's breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A broken man will find that his mind, emotion, and will are changed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He will become different from his original natural constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A broken man is open to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God can easily come in, and his spirit can easily come out.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For the spirit to be released means that others can touch our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How can we tell when the inner man and outer man are separated from each other?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are three signs to indicate this separation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First, when the two are separate, it is easy for others to touch the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second, the mind, emotion, and will are all broken.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are no longer hardened but flow freely.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Third, it is easy to release the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is hard to point out mistakes to an unbroken man; it is hard for him to accept them as fact.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to wait until he is well disposed before he will nod his head and agree with us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some people have experienced much chastisement, yet they are not changed inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A broken man, however, easily receives others' words.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is easily touched.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a man boasts that he is not easily influenced by others, it means that he is not very broken at all.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, being broken has nothing to do with introspection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Introspection is damaging.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If my mind is obsessed with thoughts about my pulse and breathing, I am surely sick.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is useless for a man to constantly condemn himself for not being broken.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A man only needs to be concerned with one thing whether or not he has humbled himself under the mighty hand of God, submitting to God's ordering in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That is his business.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The way he is broken is not his business.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Others know whether or not he is broken, and the church also knows.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The knowledge of the degree of our brokenness belongs to the church, not to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who are always engaged in introspection are mainly unbroken.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Introspection is very unhealthy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is our job to pray for breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But it is the Lord's job to decide which way to break us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Submission to Authority</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let me say a word about the matter of authority: In speaking for God, a worker of the Lord should not ask others to listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is merely God's mouthpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If others listen to him, they are listening to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If they do not listen, they are ignoring God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We pity those who have never touched authority; they are wild and untamed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a man has never fallen on his face before God, what good does it do if others listen to him?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a man has touched God's authority, he will no longer be wild.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A man must see that no offense to authority is greater than an offense to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rebellion to authority is lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are two sins in this world which God hates: lawlessness and uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Uncleanness comes from lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Lawlessness is the root of all sin.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the past we saw the sin of uncleanness, but we did not see the sin of lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But God hates the sin of lawlessness more than the sin of uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Submission to authority is the most urgent thing that we need to see today.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Breaking deals with us as individuals, whereas submission deals with our relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rich in Thoughts</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As far as you are concerned, your power of inference is sufficient and quick.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But your thoughts still need to be enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Inference has to do with the breadth of one's thought, while thoughts has to do with the depth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A worker must be rich in thoughts, not rich in inference.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You have the adequate power of inference to be a minister of God's word, but you still need to be enriched in your thoughts.</S>
