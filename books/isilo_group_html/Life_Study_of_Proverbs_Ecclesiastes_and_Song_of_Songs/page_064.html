<P>"I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,/By the gazelles or by the hinds of the fields,/Not to rouse up or awaken my love/Until she pleases" (S.S. 2:7). Here we see that He takes care of her rest in Him.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Considering Her One Easily Stirred Up</H2>

<P>He considers her one easily stirred up (gazelles or hinds of the fields). Every lover of Christ is a person who can easily be stirred up.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Solemnly Charging the Meddling Believers</H2>

<P>He solemnly charges (adjure) the meddling believers (daughters of Jerusalem). Among the saints in the church life, there are a number of meddling brothers and sisters. They care about the things of others and not about their own need to love the Lord and to grow in the divine life. Such meddling ones are signified by the daughters of Jerusalem.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Not to Awaken Her<br>
from Her Experience of Christ in Resting in Him</H2>

<P>His charge is that no one awaken her from her present experience of Christ in resting in Him. In her Christian life she has reached the goal of resting in and experiencing Christ and being satisfied in the church life. Temporarily, Christ agrees with her situation and does not want anyone to awaken her. This is the end of the first stage of the Christian life of a lover of Christ.</P>

<P>Many of us can testify from experience that this truly is the situation. At this point we can say, "I am resting in Christ and I am enjoying Christ. I am covered by Him and I am in Him. His life is my couch, and His death and resurrection are the rafters which cover me. Here in the church life Christ's love is the banner spread over me. I am satisfied."</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Until She Feels Pleasant<br>
in Her Second Pursuit after Him</H2>

<P>He allows her to remain at rest until she feels pleasant in her second pursuit after Him (she pleases). As we will see when we come to the next section, Christ does not intend that His lover stay in this first stage. She needs to enter into the second stage of the Christian life of a lover of Christ&#151; the stage of experiencing the cross of Christ for the breaking of the self. The lover of Christ should not stay in the self, allowing the self to become the center, but should experience the breaking of the self by the cross.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs &nbsp; pg 64</div><br></body></html>
