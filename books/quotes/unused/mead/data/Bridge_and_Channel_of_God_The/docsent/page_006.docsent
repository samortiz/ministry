   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO DEAL WITH SUFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE LORD HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: As we follow the Lord, what great difficulties will we encounter in the way ahead?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: In principle, a Christian should not predict that he will have difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, once he senses that there are difficulties, he should face them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord said, Therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself; sufficient for the day is its own evil Matt 6:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Someone said, Do not borrow tomorrow s troubles for today, and do not save today s blessings for tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not make predictions, much less have expectations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You must know that all difficulties come from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When there are no difficulties, do not expect them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When difficulties come, push them away.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first step is to not hope for or expect to have difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The second step is to push them away if you can.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Never say that you welcome difficulties because you are learning the discipline of the Holy Spirit; neither should you begin to seek the Lord s way only after you have failed to reject the difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, if after hearing about the discipline of the Holy Spirit you take a rickshaw, and it costs only three dollars but the driver asks for ten, it is not right for you to give him ten.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is extorting money from you; you should speak with him according to reason.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To speak is to attempt to solve the problem; if he is reasonable and agrees to back down, you should give him three dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is wrong to expect sufferings, and it is foolish to blindly accept them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, sufferings should not be predicted or expected.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, when sufferings do come, how should we deal with them?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord said, I am the way and the reality and the life John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our way is the Lord Himself; thus, the One who deals with the sufferings should be the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no way for us to handle sufferings by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only the Lord Himself can pass through sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, if a young brother marries a sister and later cannot tolerate her, and then he comes to ask what he should do, we can only tell him, Brother, you must meet the Lord in this matter; the Lord is your way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You need to fellowship with the Lord, bring this problem to the Lord, and touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When you touch the Lord, however the Lord moves within you, move accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this way, the difficulty will pass.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the experience of encountering persecution, no two persons are alike.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One person can escape persecution, whereas another person must go through it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because the Lord s work in each one is different, the Lord s leading in each one also is different.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord may use a very wonderful way to lead someone to escape persecution, but He may use persecution to kill someone else s naturalness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord s leading is different in every person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, the way to deal with difficulties is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a difficulty were to befall you today, it would be useless to complain that it was caused by a certain person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You must submit before the Lord and say to Him, Lord, I have no choice; I have no way; I have only You.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Lord, You are my choice and my way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You desire that my weeping would be You and that my joy also would be You.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this way you will experience the Lord bringing you through.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whatever way a Christian has is simply the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord said, I am the way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is our way and He is our method.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our fear should be that we would depend on ourselves, on others, or on methods and thus break our fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Himself is the way for us to face difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>SUBMISSION BEING THE FUNCTION OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Question: We desire to submit and yet cannot submit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Exactly how can we gain the power to submit?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Answer: It is true that many times we desire to submit to the Lord and yet cannot submit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You must realize that God s life contains God s element; God s element is in God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, this life is transmitted into us through His word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God s word is the seed of life; once it comes into us, God s life comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Here we see three things: God, life, and the word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The element of God Himself is in His life, and this life is in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every time the Lord speaks to us, His word is life John 6:63 , and in this life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, whenever we receive God s word, we receive God s life with God s element.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Just as we do not have the power to do good, neither do we have the power to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In ourselves we are powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But thank the Lord that we have the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we have God s speaking, there is a power that brings us into submission.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For instance, you initially do not believe in the Lord, but one day God sends someone to say to you, You need to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once God s word is spoken, the Holy Spirit speaks God, life, and His word into you, along with repentance, faith, and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After returning home, you are compelled and driven from within to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The power to repent is not repentance; the power to repent is life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The next day the Lord s word comes again: You need to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This word compels you from within so that you cannot help but believe.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As a result, something further faith comes into you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The day after that, the word comes once again: You need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You do not want to pray, but there is a voice within you saying that you should pray.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God s word is transmitted into you by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This word, this speaking, is like a seed planted into you through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In this seed are life and God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God is in His word as a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the same principle, when you hear messages and draw near to the Lord, you hear a word from the Spirit, perhaps through the ministry of the spoken word, the Bible, a spiritual book, or a sense within.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This word within will demand something of you and at the same time supply you with power to fulfill its demand.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There are two levels to a spoken message.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>On the first level, in the minds of the listeners the speaking may be a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>On the second level, however, the speaking may be carried out with the exercise of the spirit and through the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As the brother is speaking in this way, his spirit moves so that not only his voice but also his spirit enters into people.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Once a word spoken with the spirit enters into a listener, there is always a power that enables him to submit without his own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Even if a person is stubborn, the Lord will continually work to conquer him until one day he submits.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In this submission it is God who causes man to submit, not man who submits by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>For example, I know many young brothers and sisters who were a great source of pride to their families when they entered the university.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After they believed in Jesus, however, they were inwardly compelled to consecrate themselves and give up their future.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But because they did not want to disappoint their parents, they continued to study hard.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, the compelling within occurred again and again, persuading and urging them to surrender themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>After a time, it grew even stronger until it subdued them.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They were not subdued the first year, the second year, or the third year; it was not until after they graduated from university that they were finally subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Even after they had obtained a doctoral degree, they had to yield themselves completely without any recourse.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>As another example, perhaps a message has subdued you.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You heard the speaking, and something began to happen in you that could not be removed or rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is the power of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>No one can please God, just as no one can obey the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Thank God, however, that He is the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>His life is in His word, and His word has been received by us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We may use a florist as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Suppose the florist has a pile of small, ugly seeds placed next to some brilliant, beautiful flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Everyone who looks at the flowers will ask enviously, How did you grow such flowers?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The florist would point to the ugly seeds on the side and say, Those seeds grow into such flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Every function of life is hidden within a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Every function of God s life is hidden in the word of God that enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We have no power in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>But there is power in Him who is life, and this life is in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>One day this word, like an unrefined, round, and shapeless seed, is ministered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The speaking of most ministering brothers seems to be unrefined, but what matters is whether there is life in the speaking and whether it is the word of God s life, the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If it is the word of God s life, the word of life, even if it does not seem good outwardly, all the riches of God hidden within it will one day develop and grow.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is the grace of our submission.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Some are subdued more quickly, whereas others are inclined to be slower.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Hence, God s word issues forth from some people quickly, but from others it issues forth slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Regardless of whether we are quick or slow, it will eventually issue forth from us.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>With some, however, it is as if the seed falls into rocky ground in which nothing can grow.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This proves that the spiritual power is not with us but is with the Lord Himself and the Lord s word that enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>When we hear the Lord s word, the function of life begins to take place within us.</S>
