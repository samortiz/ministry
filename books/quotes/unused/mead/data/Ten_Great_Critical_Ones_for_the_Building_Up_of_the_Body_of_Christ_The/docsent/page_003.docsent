   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for this precious hour, that You have gathered many of us from many countries.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lord, we believe there is a will in You for this gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Carry out this will among us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speak something to us that will impress us for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, give us the understanding, give us the revelation, and give us the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, speak with us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We believe that You are one spirit with us in this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Anoint all the brothers from all the countries.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, it is a lovely time that we can come together to have such a fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, help me in the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You know that I am fearful and trembling before You that I may delay You.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, save me from this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whatever You want to speak to us, speak it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Speak it freely.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Glory be to You, shame to Your enemy, and blessing to all Your Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have been considering very much what the Lord would speak to us for this time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do not want to speak anything that is not from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, the Lord reminded me of ten great, critical points in His revelation concerning our belief in Him for His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I call them the ten "ones."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Each critical point is a "one."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These first five "ones" are the one Bible, one God, one Christ, one Spirit, and one life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These five big "ones" are the factors.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then there are another five "ones": the one salvation, one living, one testimony, one Body, and one city, which is the one consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These five are the issues which are produced from the preceding five factors.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Each great "one" actually needs two conferences so that it can be covered adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a golden opportunity for me to present to you these ten great "ones."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All of you are either co-workers or elders in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this sense, you are important persons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What the Lord's recovery will be depends upon you co-workers and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, I consider what I am releasing here to be very critical.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I want to give you the proper knowledge of the ten great "ones" at this juncture.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then you will know who we are, where we are, and where we should go.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"We" means the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although we need twenty conferences to speak all these points covered by these six messages, I am taking the opportunity to present an abstract of these points.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to take these ten great "ones" back to our places to have conference after conference.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First, we must get ourselves into them and then help all the saints realize what the Lord's recovery really is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I. ONE BIBLE ONE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Upon this earth, everyone knows there is one Bible, but this one Bible is in the hands of different people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What kind of Bible people have depends upon what kind of people they are.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Jews have their Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Their Bible is just the first part of the whole Bible, so they have a Bible which is incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The orthodox Jews do not believe in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They believe that their Bible, the Old Testament, is the pure, holy Word of God and that nothing should be added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Of course, they are mistaken in what they believe.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then the Christians have their Bible, the entire Bible, but there are many divisions today among the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Brethren were raised up in the middle part of the last century and they were one, but today there are over one thousand divisions among them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nearly every division of the Brethren has "their own Bible."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that they have the same Bible with different interpretations, which have divided them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, the closed Brethren use the New Translation by John Nelson Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The open Brethren use the Newberry Bible with its marginal notes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Catholics also have their Bible, which has more than sixty-six books because they have added something.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today I would ask, "What kind of Bible do we have?"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Bible we have determines what kind of persons we are.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the divisions among the Christians came out of different interpretations of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should not have more than one Bible in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To have a proper Bible, which is really according to God's revelation, depends upon the way we understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we understand the Bible properly, we will have a proper Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible itself is never wrong, but with us it can be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In 2 Timothy 2:15 Paul said, "Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have to cut the word straightly as in carpentry.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have to interpret the written Word of God as a carpenter cutting wood.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This means to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Second Timothy 2:15 is very meaningful and should control us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There are different ways of understanding the same Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the apostle Paul was on earth, he was contending with the unbelieving Jews and correcting them by cutting the word rightly, straightly.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now we need to see how to cut the word in a straight way.</S>
