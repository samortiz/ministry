<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Coming in His Humanity to Serve</H2><P>Christ came in His humanity, not to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many (Matt. 20:28; Mark 10:45).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Giving the Food<br>Which Abides unto Eternal Life</H2><P>Christ gave, in His humanity, the food which abides unto eternal life (John 6:27, 53).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Dying in His Humanity</H2><P>Christ died in His humanity. In His death He went away from His disciples and was betrayed by one of them (Matt. 26:24; Mark 14:21; Luke 22:22, 48). As the Son of Man He was killed as John the Baptist was by the Jewish authorities (Matt. 17:12; Mark 9:12). He was delivered as the Son of Man into the hands of the chief priests and scribes and crucified by them (Matt. 17:22-23a; 20:18-19a; 26:2, 45; Mark 8:31a; 9:31a; 10:33-34a; 14:41; Luke 9:22a, 44; 18:31-33a; 24:7a). He gave His life as a ransom for many (Matt. 20:28b; Mark 10:45) and was lifted up on the cross. His being lifted up on the cross as the Son of Man was so that people may know that He is the great I Am (John 8:28) and that He may draw all men to Himself (12:32, 34). On the cross He was lifted up as a serpent, typified by the serpent lifted up by Moses (Num. 21:8-9), that everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life (John 3:14-15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Being Buried in His Humanity<br>in the Heart of the Earth</H2><P>The Son of Man was buried in His humanity in the heart of the earth three days and three nights as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish (Matt. 12:40; Luke 11:30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Resurrecting in His Humanity</H2><P>Christ resurrected in His humanity on the third day after His burial (Matt. 17:23b, 9; 20:19b; Mark 8:31b; 9:9, 31b; 10:34b; Luke 9:22b; 18:33b; 24:7b), being glorified (John 12:23; 13:31-32; 7:39; Luke 24:26).</P>
