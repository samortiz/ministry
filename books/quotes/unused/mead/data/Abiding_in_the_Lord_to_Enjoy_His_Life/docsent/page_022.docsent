   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX IN THE HOLIEST PLACE, LIVE WITHIN THE VEIL Scripture Reading: Heb 10:19-20; 4:16; 1 Cor 3:16; 1 Thes 5:23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer: O Lord, we worship You that You have gathered us before You, and we believe that You are with us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How good it is that we can be here around Your word, and by this we can draw near to You and contact You as the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>O Lord, we really thank You that, as our Savior, You died on the cross for our sins, You bore all our offenses, You were judged by God for us, and You were raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>O Lord, cleanse us with Your precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By this blood we have the boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, we have no fear within us because our conscience has been purified by being sprinkled with the precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Having peace and boldness before You, we can hear Your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, we pray that You reach every one of us and visit each one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Come into us to touch our heart again, and open up our spirit and the understanding of our mind that we may have the wisdom to understand Your word and may also have the revelation to see Your vision.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>O Lord, cause us all to be moved by You in our spirit to receive Your grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Cause us all to know You as the true and living God and as the all-inclusive Spirit, who is in our mouth and in our heart for us to contact at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, we believe that Your Spirit is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We praise You that You have made us Your temple; we are Your dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We and You as two spirits have become one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We pray that You bless us for us to have You as our life, even abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lord, grant us the utterance and give us the fresh and clear word to meet the need of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We also pray that Your word, bringing with it Your authority, Your power, and Yourself, would come to people to subdue them that they may repent to You, turn back to You, and see the corruption of the world and the vanity of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>O Lord, we also ask You to shine upon us so that we may truly know You.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even more, we ask You to bestow Your blessing upon us that we may all have life and may have it abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE HOLIEST PLACE, THE VEIL, AND THE THRONE OF GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The title of this message is In the Holiest Place, Live within the Veil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is taken from a line of the second stanza of Hymn #557 in the Chinese Hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible speaks of the Holiest Place and the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, Christians in general probably do not know the meaning of the phrase the Holiest Place.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In addition, they explain the word veil merely as a curtain used to separate spaces or things, and they know even less what within the veil refers to.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After I was saved, I was puzzled about what the Holiest Place was and what within the veil meant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I felt that it was not too hard to understand these two words Holiest and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But Holiest plus place equaling the Holiest Place referred to a location.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What kind of place was this?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, grace plus throne equaled the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What kind of throne was this?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On earth there is a great mess everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Where is the Holiest Place?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And where can the throne of grace be?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It seemed that it was not easy to find them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, I concluded that the Holiest Place and the throne of grace must be in the "heavenly hall."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, "In the Holiest Place, touch the throne of grace" must refer to our entering into the "heavenly hall."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Moreover, the expression heavenly hall is definitely found in Hebrews 9:24 in the Chinese Union Version, but in reality, heavenly hall, which is altogether a Buddhist term borrowed by the Chinese Bible translators, does not correspond with the teaching of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The term heavenly hall does not exist either in the Hebrew text of the Old Testament or in the Greek text of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to understand the meaning of these terms the Holiest Place, the throne of grace, and within the veil I went to many places to listen to sermons for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, it was not easy to hear messages concerning these things in the common Christian meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It was not until one day when I went to the meetings of a Brethren Assembly that I heard an explanation of what the Holiest Place is, what the throne of grace is, and what it is to be within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At that time, they had prayer meetings every Tuesday night.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>During the meeting, the whole congregation would kneel down and pray with loud groanings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They said that this is to "enter the Holy of Holies" and "come forward to the throne of grace."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Afterward I found out that these phrases were quoted from Hebrews 10:19-20 and 4:16.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I received a great deal of help from them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After I had had a considerable amount of experience, I gradually understood the real meaning of "entering the Holy of Holies" and "coming forward to the throne of grace."</S>
