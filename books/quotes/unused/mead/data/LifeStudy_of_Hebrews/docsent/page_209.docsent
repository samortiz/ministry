   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO LOSS OF TEMPER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Moses and Aaron were not young men.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Both of them must have been about a hundred years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to Psalm 90, which was written by Moses, the span of a human life is seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If one s health is good, he might live to be eighty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, according to Moses own writing, he should have been dead.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But he was serving God after the age of death, and Aaron was even older than he.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What was the good of their being so aged?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fact that it was not easy for them to lose their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The rebellion in Numbers 16 was serious and terrible, but it did not cause Moses to lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the rebels gathered themselves together against Moses and Aaron, Moses fell upon his face Num 16:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we shall see in the next message, God came in to judge this rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE VINDICATION OF THE PROPER LEADERSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Numbers 17 God seemed to be saying to Moses, Those sons of rebellion were fighting with you over the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Tell them that I shall do something to vindicate the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I shall show them who the real leaders are, and their mouths will be shut.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Numbers 17:2 the Lord said to Moses, Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man s name upon his rod.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A rod is a piece of dead and dried-up wood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Its nature is that of dead wood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is the function of a rod?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is to rule over others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A rod is different from a staff.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A staff is for helping and supporting those who are weak and crippled and who have difficulty standing or walking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But a rod is not for supporting; it is for ruling and beating.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the book of Proverbs, a father must use a rod to discipline his children Prov 23:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our God is very wise, and He had the best way to vindicate the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God did not argue.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, He seemed to say, Since you have been arguing about the leadership, I ask you to bring your rods in before the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You thought that you had the rods and could rule over others, and that Moses and Aaron assumed too much.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You said that since you are all the people of God you all have the same authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you have authority?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every tribe has a rod.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Bring your rods to Me and put them in front of My testimony for a night, and let us see what will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Numbers 17:5 the Lord said, And it shall come to pass, that the man s rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Twelve rods were laid up before the Lord in the tabernacle of witness Num 17:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Numbers 17:8 says, It came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This signifies that the real leadership, the real authority, is in the budding life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This life not only buds and blossoms; it yields fruit that we might feed others, not that we might beat them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although the rod is for ruling, this ruling is for feeding, not for beating.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The leadership among God s people is different from that found among the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All the Gentile kings use their rods for ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No rod among the Gentile leaders is useful for feeding, because none of their rods is living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every rod is just a piece of dead wood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only with the proper leadership among God s people is there a rod budding with resurrection life and yielding fruit to nourish others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The almond tree is the first tree in the year to blossom, blossoming in either January or February.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first fruit which comes out of a tree is the almond.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, the budding, blossoming, fruit-yielding rod signifies the resurrection life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The leadership among God s children must be Christ Himself as the resurrection life which buds, blossoms, and bears almonds to feed God s people.</S>
