   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Essential, Underlying Thought</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of 1 Corinthians</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have pointed out that the Brethren say that 1 Corinthians is merely a book on how to solve all the problems in the church while those in Pentecostalism say that 1 Corinthians is the unique book that focuses on speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Neither of these topics, however, is the essential, underlying thought of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The underlying thought of 1 Corinthians is that we have to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To have a proper meeting life, we do not just need to know Christ or to have a revelation concerning Him, to see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to eat Him and drink Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eating Jesus and drinking of Christ are the essential revelations in the book of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the summer of 1965 in Los Angeles we had a conference on the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In those messages the central thought was that God is good for food see The Tree of Life published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is edible, and Christ is our food and our drink.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The tree of life is not good for knowledge but good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must break the shell of the book of 1 Corinthians to see its essential revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The focus of this book is not to deal with all the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Corinthians shows us that we need to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Items of Christ for Our Enjoyment</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>in 1 Corinthians</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are twenty marvelous items of Christ as our enjoyment in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In chapter one Christ is our God-given portion v. 2 . God has called us into the participation of Christ, the fellowship of Christ, that is, into the enjoyment of Christ as our portion v. 9 . This is why verse 2 says that Christ is theirs and ours.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is their portion and is our portion for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is also God s power and God s wisdom to us as our righteousness concerning our past, our sanctification concerning our present, and our redemption concerning our future 1:24, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In chapter two Christ is the Lord of glory v. 8 and the deep things of God v. 10 . In chapter three He is the unique foundation of God s building v. 11 . No one can lay another foundation besides Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In chapter five Christ is our Passover feast v. 7 . He is the Passover lamb that became a feast for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A feast is not good for people to know or look at but for people to eat and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In chapter five Christ is also the feast of unleavened bread as the continuation of the Passover v. 8; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Exo 12:15-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ as the unleavened bread is good for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In chapter ten Christ is the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, and the spiritual rock, out of which flows the living water vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ as the real rock is following His believers and flowing out the living water to satisfy their thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In chapter eleven Christ is the head of every man v. 3 . In chapter twelve Christ is the Body v. 12 . How marvelous that Christ is both the Head and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are in Christ all the members of Christ become an enjoyment to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we are in Christ all of us are excellent, wonderful, and enjoyable people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In chapter fifteen Christ is the firstfruits of resurrection vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>20, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Fruit, as the issue and produce of life, is good for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is the firstfruits for us to enjoy, and He is also the second man v. 47 and the last Adam v. 45 . The first man became hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If there were only one man in this universe, we would not have any hope.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But with the second man, Christ, there is a new beginning and there is hope.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As the firstfruits, the second man, and the last Adam, Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is the first, the second, and the last.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ, being the last Adam, is the conclusion of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>With Him and in Him Adam is over.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Adam has caused us much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He brought us sin, death, the curse, sufferings, and sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But Adam is finished, concluded, with Christ because Christ is the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If Christ were not the life-giving Spirit, all that He is would have nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But as the life-giving Spirit, He makes every item of Himself so real and so practical.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Calling On the Name of the Lord to Enjoy Christ</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>as Everything for the Church Meeting Life</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By calling, O Lord Jesus, we can enjoy Him as everything, as every item in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we say O Lord Jesus, we enjoy Him as the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>O Lord Jesus we enjoy Him as the first, the second, and the last.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>O Lord Jesus we enjoy Him as food and as drink.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have to learn how to O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Calling O Lord Jesus issues in a constant, warming presence within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we call on the Lord, there is a divine presence within us, warming us and bringing us a bubbling joy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to call on the name of the Lord during every occupation, at all times, and in all places, with our mouth, in the spirit, and in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to open our mouth, exercise our spirit, and open our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To call on the name of the Lord is to experience the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The problems in the church life cannot be solved by any human methods.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Over fifty years ago I began to labor in the ministry, and often the saints came to me with problems.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Most of these problems were related to marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I thought that I could render the saints some way to solve their problems, but eventually found out that this did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>By reading the holy Word, I realized that we cannot solve any problem.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The only way to solve people s problems is to minister this enjoyable Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I began to tell people that they had to experience Christ and take Christ as their life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Although I shared these things with the saints in the 1940s, I had not seen the matter of calling on the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the years from 1966 to 1968 we began to practice pray-reading the Word and calling on the Lord s name in Elden Hall in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Elden Hall is a memorial of pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In one evening meeting, the saints pray-read the entire book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>That was marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Our meetings were filled with calling, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>One day in a meeting I stood up and told the saints that all of them could say something.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When I said this to the saints, I myself did not know what to tell them to say.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then I said, All of you can say four words.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>At that moment I did not know what four words I would tell the saints to say.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Then I said, All of you can say O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We practiced saying O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I thought that I had made a mistake in the order of these words by telling the saints to say Amen before Hallelujah instead of saying Hallelujah, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then I checked with the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Actually, the biblical way is not Hallelujah, Amen, but Amen, Hallelujah Rev 19:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In those years we sang the following song again and again:</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Now Christ is the life-giving Spirit;</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Now Christ is the Spirit today.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Now Christ is the life-giving Spirit,</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>So turn to your spirit and say</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>O Lord, Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In those days, around 1969, we were crazy in the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Every day the saints would be calling, O Lord Jesus, Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Before that time we seldom said Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Now to say Amen has become a custom among us.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Today whenever you meet a brother, you say, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This brother will respond by saying Amen to you.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Our custom of saying Amen came from the song mentioned above.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When we say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah, we have to testify that we enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>No one can deny this.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Some argued with me by saying that what we taught was merely a psychological thing.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I responded by saying, It may be psychological.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Let us try by calling O George Washington! or O Confucius!</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>When we call on these names there is no sensation of something moving within us nor is there any feeling of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>But whenever we say O Lord Jesus, something within is touching us, anointing us, and moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The feeling within is so dear, so loving, and so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In this kind of prayer there is a warming presence within us because He is living and moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When we keep our mouths shut, it is hard for Him to move in us.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>But when we say O Lord Jesus, Amen, He moves within us.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Sometimes people ask me, Brother Lee, what is your secret of health?</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>How could you live so long?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>One of the secrets is O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If you have a problem with indigestion, try calling O Lord Jesus for five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Calling will help you to digest your food.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Calling on the Lord will make you happy, will take away your burdens, and will especially take away your human anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>In human life day by day there is continuous anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Those who call O Lord Jesus again and again throughout the day do not have anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>By calling on the Lord all our anxiety will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The Lord is living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We need to open our mouth, exercise our spirit, and open our heart to release Jesus by calling on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>In this way we enjoy Him in all His marvelous aspects in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The concluding aspect in this book is that Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>When we call, O Lord Jesus, we enjoy the Triune God and all our problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>After I saw this matter, I began to minister to the saints in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The wives or the husbands came to visit me with problems, and they asked me what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>I told them that they simply needed to call, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>I charged them that they needed to learn to say, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Some asked me what they should do about their bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>I told them that when they are going to lose their temper, they should call, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>If we would call upon the Lord s name again and again, our temper would be gone and the joy would come.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We practiced calling so much nearly twenty years ago, but today we practice very little.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>In 1969 when we came to the hall, the meeting was filled with O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>But today our meetings are full of dumbness.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>May the Lord recover the O Lord Jesus among us.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>All of us have to learn to say, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>When I was a young believer, I was taught that we have to realize that we have been crucified with Christ and reckon ourselves to be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>I tried to realize that I was crucified with Christ and to reckon that I was dead with Christ, but that did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Then I found out what does work.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>What does work is to say, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>When you call on the Lord s name, you will experience His death and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>During the years around 1969 we gave many messages concerning calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Our homes should be filled with calling on the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>I hope that when we go out to baptize people and set up meetings in their homes, we will take the lead to call on the name of the Lord, leading the new ones into calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>This will strengthen, enrich, and establish the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>We all need to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>The preaching in dead letters does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>We must believe in the living Spirit, who moves when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Whenever we say Lord Jesus, we have the feeling within that the living Spirit is touching us.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>By calling on the Lord s name we enjoy all the items of what He is, and we have a stand, a ground, a base, and a strong support to come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>When we come to the meeting calling on the Lord s name, we come as a living person full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>If we are those who call on the Lord s name, there will be no need for us to try to think of what to say in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>If we open up our mouth, something of Christ will come out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>This is the way to have the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>If we all would be those who call on the name of the Lord Jesus again and again day by day, whenever we come together the meeting will be high, living, and a real exhibition of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>Hymn #864 declares in the chorus:</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>Let us exhibit Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>Let us exhibit Christ;</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>We ll bring His surplus to the church</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>And thus exhibit Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>We need to bring the surplus of Christ to every meeting in order to exhibit Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>We need to enjoy Christ in our daily life and come together to exhibit Him.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>THE MINISTERS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>IN SECOND CORINTHIANS</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>Second Corinthians, the eighth book of the New Testament, shows us the ministers of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>When we enjoy Christ in our daily life, we are constituted with His unsearchable riches.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>Thus, we become the ministers of the New Testament, who dispense the riches of Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>The Spirit, who is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God becoming a life-giving Spirit, imparts the divine life, even God Himself, into the believers and apostles, making them ministers of a new covenant, the covenant of life 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>Hence, their ministry is one constituted with the Triune God of life by His life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>All the apostles works are to carry out this unique ministry of ministering Christ to people for the building up of His Body.</S>
