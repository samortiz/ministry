 <h1 class="title">PREFACE </h1> 
 <p>Praise the Lord! You are now saved. This surely is the most important thing in your life. You have believed and are baptized. Now you have the life of God and are a beloved child of God. From now on this new life will be in you forever. It will enable you to live out a life full of grace and reality.</p>
 <p>The new life that is in you is like a seed that is sown into the ground. It has sprouted, but now it needs to grow, develop, blossom, and bear fruit before it will express all the riches of the life of God. However, this process of growth requires time and care in watering and cultivating.</p>
 <p>For this purpose we have selected the most important basic truths in the Bible and compiled them into a series of <em>New Life Lessons.</em> These lessons introduce to the new believers the keys to the Christian life and living in a simple, concise, and step-by-step way, with the intention that they will render new believers the proper guidance and help.</p>
 <p>We have the assurance that if you read through these lessons carefully and practice them diligently, you will know this new life more accurately and deeply. In this way, youwill live out a new life that is both spontaneous and overflowing, and will lay a good foundation for the future.</p>
 <p>There are ten lessons in this series of <em>New Life Lessons.</em> They are:</p>
 <p class="indent1"><strong>
 (1) Assurance of Salvation<br />
 (2) Prayer<br />
 (3) Reading the Bible<br />
 (4) Meeting<br />
 (5) Preaching the Gospel<br />
 (6) Fellowshipping with the Lord<br />
 (7) Consecration<br />
 (8) Living in the Spirit<br />
 (9) Experiencing Christ<br />
 (10) Knowing the Church</strong></p>
 <p>Every lesson is in outline form, with headings and subheadings. The content is mostly Scripture verses with simple explanations. This series of lessons may be used in new believersâ€™ meetings, and it is also quite suitable for use in small meetings or private fellowship.</p>
