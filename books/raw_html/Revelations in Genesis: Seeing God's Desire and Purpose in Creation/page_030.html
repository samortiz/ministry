        <h2 class="head2">The Matter of the Spirit</h2>
<p>The third aspect is related to our spirit. When we contact the Lord&rsquo;s word, it is not sufficient to merely have a heart and even to have a focused mind. We still must use our spirit to touch and contact the Lord&rsquo;s word. Our mind can help us understand and comprehend; however, only our spirit can truly touch God and the reality in God&rsquo;s word. Hence, we have to not only use our mind to understand but also our spirit to touch God&rsquo;s word. Only in this way can we receive the real help from the word of God. When we listen to a message, we cannot be a person without a heart for God&rsquo;s word or a person who does not use his mind to muse over God&rsquo;s word. Nevertheless, if we only have a heart and use our mind, we may understand some doctrines in our mentality, but we will not receive the real spiritual supply and help. We must use our spirit to contact God&rsquo;s word in order for His word to enter into our spirit to become our life supply.</p>
<p>If we desire to receive real help from the word of God, our heart, mind, and spirit must function together. We need to exercise our heart, mind, and spirit not only as we listen but even after listening. For example, after listening to a message, we need to turn our heart to the Lord and His word, using our mind to muse on His word and our spirit to contact the reality of the content upon which we have mused. At this time, the content of the message will enter into our spirit to become the bread of life to us so that we may receive the real help. Thus, the messages will not merely be doctrine and knowledge but a real supply of life to us.</p>
<p>For example, we have heard that God&rsquo;s eternal economy is to work Himself into us so that we can have His image to express Him on the one hand and have His authority to deal with His enemy on the other. Having understood these points, we should go to the Lord and turn our heart to Him and use our mind to muse upon them. After we have mused over each point, we will be open and readily understand the points. At this time we should use our spirit to contact the reality of what we have understood. We can do this by praying spontaneously to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I truly want Your eternal purpose to be accomplished in me. I long to be mingled with You to such an extent that I truly have Your image to express You and truly have Your authority to reign in my situations, not allowing the enemy to have any ground.&rdquo; At this time the words we have heard will not merely be doctrine; rather, they will enter into our being to become our life supply.</p>
<p>Similarly, we have heard that God&rsquo;s way to fulfill His eternal purpose is through His life: First, He created man as a vessel to receive Him. Second, He placed man in front of the tree of life in order for man to receive His life. Third, He was crucified to release His life into us so that we could become a part of Him. After hearing these points, we must have a heart that inclines to and desires these points, we need to muse over them with our mind, and we need to contact the reality of these points with our spirit. We need to realize that we have a spirit to touch and receive God, that God is life, and that we touch life when we touch God. If we touch anything apart from God, we will touch only death. At this time we will spontaneously pray, &ldquo;O Lord, I worship You that You have such a high regard for me as Your vessel. You have given me a spirit to fellowship with You, contact You, and even receive You as the Spirit. O Lord, You are life, and when I receive You, I receive life; when I touch anything apart from You, I receive only death.&rdquo; Such a prayer uses not only our mind but even more our spirit to touch the content of the words that we have heard. Those with experience can testify that when we use our spirit to touch the word, our spirit will receive the supply and be strengthened, satisfied, illuminated, refreshed, and revitalized.</p>
<p>If we receive a supply from the word of God in this way, we will surely be fresh and living when we enter into the meeting of the church. After singing the first hymn, we will immediately bubble over with a prayer: &ldquo;Lord, thank You that You made me a vessel and created a spirit in me so that I may receive You as the Spirit. Thank You that You are in me as my life. Now I am not standing in front of the tree of life, but instead, the tree of life is within me. I can draw near to You and fellowship with You in my spirit and touch You as the God of life.&rdquo; When we pray in this way, many brothers and sisters will be refreshed by us. Our prayer, like dew, will cause others to be watered and supplied. When our spirit has been supplied by contacting God&rsquo;s word, we will be inwardly fresh and living. As soon as we open our mouth to pray or to speak a few words, we will supply others in the spirit, making the entire meeting living.</p>
<p>I am concerned that when the saints listen to a message, they only nod their head but do not use their spirit. Merely nodding the head in agreement is not sufficient; we must bend our knees before God in our spirit, because God&rsquo;s word is not information or knowledge; it is the bread of life.</p>
<p>Our receiving of God&rsquo;s word may be compared to eating. There may be many varieties of food on a table, but if we use only our mentality to study and understand the vitamins and nutrients in the food, the food will not nourish us. We must use our mouth to take the food into us. Likewise, we should not come to the word of God to merely study and gain information but rather to receive the bread of life. After we understand the word with our mind, we need to use our spirit to receive and contact the word, turning it into prayer and absorbing it into us. Actually, we should do this not only when we read the Bible and listen to a message but also when we read spiritual books.</p>
<p>It is sufficient to use only our mind when we study in school, but we cannot do this when we read spiritual books. Therefore, we should not read a spiritual book too fast. After reading a portion, we should contact the word with our spirit. Then, after reading a little more, we should muse on the words again, turning them into prayer. In this way God&rsquo;s word will become a life supply in us.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
