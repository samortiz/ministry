   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION SEVEN CONCERNING SIN AND SINS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How are the words sin and sins used differently in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The difference between sin and sins is the distinction between sin in the singular and sin in the plural.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Old Testament there is no distinction between sin in the singular and sin in the plural.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, in the New Testament there is a difference, and this difference is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let us list all the occurrences of the word sin noun , in both its singular and plural forms, that are found in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the original language, sin is armatia.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sin in singular form: Matt 12:31; John 1:29; 8:34 twice , 46; 9:41 twice ; 15:22 twice , 24; 16:8, 9; 19:11; Acts 7:60; Rom 3:9, 20; 4:8; 5:12 twice , 13 twice , 20, 21; 6:1, 2, 6 twice , 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23; 7:7 twice , 8 twice , 9, 11, 13 three times , 14, 17, 20, 23, 25; 8:2, 3 three times , 10; 14:23; 1 Cor 15:56 twice ; 2 Cor 5:21 twice ; 11:7; Gal 2:17; 3:22; 2 Thes 2:3 KJV ; Heb 3:13; 4:15; 9:26, 28; 10:6, 8, 18; 11:25; 12:1, 4; 13:11; James 1:15 twice ; 2:9; 4:17; 1 Pet 2:22; 4:1; 2 Pet 2:14; 1 John 1:7, 8; 3:4 twice , 5, 8, 9; 5:16 twice , 17 twice .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sins in plural form: Matt 1:21; 3:6; 9:2, 5, 6; 26:28; Mark 1:4, 5; 2:5, 7, 9, 10; Luke 1:77; 3:3; 5:20, 21, 23, 24; 7:47, 48, 49; 11:4; 24:47; John 8:21 KJV , 24 twice ; 9:34; 20:23; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31; 10:43; 13:38; 22:16; 26:18; Rom 4:7; 7:5; 11:27; 1 Cor 15:3, 17; Gal 1:4; Eph 2:1; Col 1:14; 2:11 KJV ; 1 Thes 2:16; 1 Tim 5:22, 24; 2 Tim 3:6; Heb 1:3; 2:17; 5:1, 3; 7:27; 8:12; 9:28; 10:2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 17, 26; James 5:15, 20; 1 Pet 2:24 twice ; 3:18; 4:8; 2 Pet 1:9; 1 John 1:9 twice ; 2:2, 12; 3:5; 4:10; Rev 1:5; 18:4, 5.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After reading the many Scripture verses above, we will see how wise God was in the writing of the Bible, and we will truly say to Him, "O God!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We worship You!"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The difference between the uses of sin and sins is this: Whenever the Bible refers to man's outward sinful behavior, such as pride, envy, lying, and so forth, it uses the plural form sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The singular form, sin, in the Bible never refers to the outward sin, but it does have two different kinds of usage.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, it refers to sin as a master and power which controls or dominates.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the sin which is ordinarily referred to as the source or the root of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The phrases the source of sin or the root of sin are not scriptural, but we will borrow them for the moment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible does not mention either but rather, speaks of sin reigning and lording like a master.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Singular sin refers to the sin that dominates, drives, and causes us to commit sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Second, it refers to the whole problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever the Bible speaks of God forgiving sin, it always uses the plural form, sins, because we need to be forgiven of the sins in our outward behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The sinful nature within us cannot be resolved by forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Saying that God forgives the singular sin is incorrect, for God forgives only the plural sins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since the singular sin is the master, the power, it is not something that we are directly responsible for; therefore, it cannot be solved by forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The plural sins need forgiveness because these refer to our conduct, for which we need to bear responsibility and for which we deserve a punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, forgiveness is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All "confession of sin" in the Bible should be "confession of sins," the plural number and not the singular number.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sin in its singular form does not refer to man's behavior and, therefore, does not require confession.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The plural sins however signify man's conduct and require confession.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The death of Christ is to save us from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"You shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins" Matt 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that the Lord Jesus saves us from the sins of our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He saves us from numerous sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Lord Jesus said to the Jews, "You will die in your sins" John 8:24 , He was saying that they would die in their sins plural and not in sin singular .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible does not say that Christ died for our sin singular , but it always says that Christ died for our sins plural .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"And you, though dead in your offenses and sins" Eph 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This refers to sins plural not sin singular .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that we lived in the sins plural , such as pride, uncleanness, envy, etc. We were dead in sins plural not in sin singular .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To "take away sins" in Hebrews 10:4 refers to the taking away of sins plural .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Hebrews 10:2, "Would have no longer had the consciousness of sins" is also sins plural .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why do we no longer have consciousness of sins after the Lord's blood has cleansed our conscience?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our conscience accuses us of sins plural , specific sins, such as temper, pride, etc., before God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since the blood of the Lord Jesus has obtained for us the forgiveness of these sins, our conscience is no longer conscious of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The plural sins do exist, but the blood has dealt with them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the Lord's blood cleansed sin singular , then sin would no longer be in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For if the blood washed sin singular , it would mean that we would never again feel the power of sin, which is the power that drives us to commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is certainly not so.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The blood of the Lord Jesus has cleansed us so that our conscience is no longer conscious of our past sins.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This does not mean that we no longer have sin but that our conscience is no longer conscious of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are not condemned by our conscience, because we are cleansed by the blood.</S>
