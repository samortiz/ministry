   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through the years because of our testimony of the unsearchable riches of Christ, some Christians in the denominations have asked us, "What kind of Christ do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Is your Christ not the same as our Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Millions of Christians have Christ, but to what extent have they experienced Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we review the following items of Christ we should ask, "Have I experienced Christ in this item?"</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ in Himself is the same in nature, in essence, and in His being unlimited, unsearchable, and all-inclusive; but in the experiences of His believers, there are many different extents.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the complete God and the perfect man.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is, with the Father and the Spirit, the only God John 1:1; Rom 9:5; Heb 1:8 .</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the one hand, Christ is the Creator, but on the other hand, He is the means through which all things were created.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is not only God and man but also the first item of the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a man, He is a part of the creation, but how could He be the Firstborn?</S>
