<h2 class="head5">2) "They Removed the Roof"</h2><p>Mark 2 records four men carrying a paralytic to the Lord Jesus. Being unable to bring him to the Lord because of the crowd, they removed the roof where He was, and lowered the paralytic to the Lord (vv. 3-4). We should have an impression of this picture. Many people were surrounding the Lord. He was quite busy. But now another group lowered a paralytic from the roof! We should realize that the Lord was not just busy; He was also speaking in a borrowed place. When the roof was removed, it had to be patched later. What trouble this was! But the Lord did not say, "Do not do this again." Instead He was happy that someone would come to Him with such a big demand. It seems that the bigger the demand was, the happier He felt. This shows us what kind of Lord He is. If we do not have a clear impression of what the Lord has done, how can we say that we know Him?</p><h2 class="head5">3) "Jesus, Son of David, Have Mercy on Me!"</h2><p>As the Lord was traveling, Bartimaeus cried out, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!" (Mark 10:47). Many people rebuked him and tried to silence him. But he cried out much more. The Lord Jesus was not particularly fond of noise and excitement. Matthew 12:19 says, "He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets." This was what the Lord Jesus was like. But here was a man crying out in a loud way. He wanted the Lord to have mercy on him, and the Lord healed him. The Lord is happy to see men asking great things from Him. He wants men to open their mouths wide. He is happy to give grace in abounding measure.</p><h2 class="head5">4) "Even the Little Dogs Eat of the Crumbs<br />Which Fall from Their Masters' Table"</h2><p>The story of the Canaanite woman gives us a clear picture of this principle. The bread was for the children. Yet she said, "Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table" (Matt. 15:27). This was a request that she had no right to ask. But the Lord likes to see men asking Him in this way. He not only granted the request and healed her daughter, but He praised her for her great faith. We can find many examples like these in the Gospels. If we form the proper impressions of these things, we will know the Lord's heart through them.</p><h2 class="head5">5) "I Believe; Help My Unbelief!"</h2><p>After the Lord came down from the Mount of Transfiguration, a father brought his demon-possessed son to Him. The Lord first rebuked the man (Mark 9:14-29). He did not rebuke the leper who came to Him, and He did not rebuke the paralytic whose friends removed the roof. They were all presumptuous, yet the Lord Jesus was happy with what they did. But here the father first brought his sick son to the disciples. When they could not heal him, he brought him to the Lord. The Lord asked the father, "How long has this been happening to him?" He answered, "From childhood. And it has often thrown him both into fire and into water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us." He came to the Lord for healing, but he was not sure if the Lord could heal. He said, "If You can do anything." The Lord picked up his words and said, "If You can." Following this, He said, "All things are possible to him who believes." The Lord seemed to be saying, "Why are you asking if I can? You should realize that all things are possible to him who believes! It is not a matter of whether or not I can, but of whether you believe." We have to visualize the situation at that moment. The man came halfheartedly. He intended to come to the Lord, but he did not have the faith. He did not fully trust in the Lord's healing. In pleading for His mercy, he qualified his prayer with the words, "If You can." The Lord rebuked this word severely. He is not pleased when men ask Him for less. He is not afraid when men say to Him, "You have to do it whether or not You are willing." But the father did not say this. In effect he was saying, "If You can do it, do it. If You cannot do it, so be it. Your disciples could not do it. I will not press for anything if You cannot do it either." The Lord rebuked him, saying, "You say, If You can. All things are possible to him who believes" (v. 23). When the Lord said this, the father, "crying out...said, I believe; help my unbelief!" (v. 24). As soon as he was rebuked and his mistake was exposed, he turned and believed. He put all the responsibility on the Lord. This is a beautiful picture! The higher a man's demand is, the more the Lord is pleased with it. The less a man asks for, the less the Lord is pleased. We have to be a tender person and allow the Lord to impress these things upon us. Once we see them, we will realize that all the Gospels are filled with the Lord's glory.</p>
