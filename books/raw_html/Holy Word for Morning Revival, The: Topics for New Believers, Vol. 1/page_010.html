<p class="bold">WEEK 2 — DAY 2</p><h2 class="uhead1">Scripture Reading</h2><p class="bold">John 3:6 &nbsp;…That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</p><p class="bold">4:24 &nbsp;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.</p><p class="bold">Romans 8:16 &nbsp;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.</p><h2 class="head1">Regenerated in Our Spirit</h2><p>When a sinner repents, confesses his sins, believes in the Lord Jesus, and calls on His name, at that very moment Christ as the life-giving Spirit enters into his spirit to enliven his dead spirit, that is, to regenerate him in his spirit. Immediately such a person becomes alive, happy, and joyful.…A great change has taken place in his life. This sinner has been saved. He has been regenerated, and he is now a Christian.<sup>48</sup></p><h2 class="head1">The Divine Spirit and the Human Spirit</h2><p>In order for us to experience the Christian life, we surely need to know God, the Lord, Christ, as the Spirit. Also, we have to know that for us to enjoy this Spirit, we have a spirit within us. [Hence], the foundation of the Christian life is the Spirit with our spirit.<sup>49</sup></p><p>In the New Testament…three verses that speak of both the human spirit and the divine Spirit [are: John 3:6; 4:24, and Romans 8:16]. John 3:6 says, “That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” The first spirit in this verse is God’s Spirit, and the second is our spirit. This means that our spirit is born of God the Spirit.…The birth of the spirit in John 3:6 is not the first birth, the natural birth; it is the second birth, the spiritual birth. All the saved ones have been born twice.…The first birth, from our parents, is the birth in the flesh; the second birth, from God, is the birth in our spirit.…Hallelujah for the second birth! We are the second-birth people. Never forget the two spirits in John 3:6—the human spirit and the divine Spirit.</p><p>Another precious verse about these two spirits is John 4:24. This verse says, “God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.” Here again we see that God is a Spirit and that we have a spirit. If we would worship God, we must worship Him in our spirit. As human beings, we have many organs: eyes for seeing, ears for hearing, a mouth for speaking and eating, a nose for smelling and breathing, hands for working, and feet for walking. We also have our various inward organs, including a stomach for retaining and digesting food. In addition to all these organs, we have a spirit with which to worship God.</p><p>Man was made by God and for God. He was made to worship God, to contact God, to receive God, to retain God, and even to digest God. Your religious mentality may be offended at the thought of digesting God. Yes, we must digest God. The Lord Jesus said that He was the bread of life and that we must eat Him (John 6:35, 54-57). Jesus is edible! If we eat Him, we must also digest Him. The function of the organ of our spirit is to worship, contact, receive, retain, and digest God. We may call this organ our spiritual stomach.…This is the organ for digesting God. We need to receive God into this part of our being.</p><p>The third verse concerning the two spirits is Romans 8:16. This verse says, “The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.” Here we see that the divine Spirit witnesses with our human spirit. Many times these two spirits talk to each other. Our spirit may say, “God is my Father,” and the divine Spirit will say, “Amen.” The divine Spirit may say, “You are a child of God,” and our spirit will say, “Hallelujah!”</p><p>We all need to become thoroughly familiar with these three verses on the two spirits. Remember, in John 3:6 our spirit is born of the Spirit; in John 4:24, our spirit worships the Spirit; and in Romans 8:16, the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. These three verses are virtually all-inclusive. In John 3:6 we are reborn, in John 4:24 we digest God and enjoy Him, and in Romans 8:16 we walk with God, live by God, and are one with God in our being. This is the Christian life, the Christian living.<sup>50</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
