Everything may be all right with us now, but these problems are within us. All of us need to be warned. If we are younger ones, we should be warned of pride. If we are in middle age, we should learn to be nothing. We should not wear a "mask" in the eldership. We should be what we are. When we are older, we should remember that the problem with older people is opinion.</P><P>There are a number of brothers working with me to carry out the full-time training. Sometimes, although I have had the proper way to go on, I did not say anything. Because the brothers helping me expressed a way which was quite different from my way, I would not say a word. The frustration of opinions can be illustrated by five brothers taking one car to go to Los Angeles. The first decision they have to make is who the driver will be. If they have not been dealt with by the cross, this decision could take much time. Once this is decided upon, the driver may ask what way he should take. The opinions expressed concerning what way to take can also take much time. This waste of time hinders, frustrates, and delays them from arriving at their destination. This is why we should be exercised not to express any opinion if we are not the "driver." My point is this&#151;if the elders in the eldership are not one, sooner or later, they will "kill" themselves. This has been the situation among us in a number of places.</P><P>There may be three brothers in the eldership in a certain locality&#151;one is older, one is younger, and the other one is middle-aged. Thus, the three problems of pride, thinking that one is a hero, and opinions are all there. When these problems are present in the eldership, the eldership is finished. I would like to ask the elders if they are in oneness in their locality. Those who think they are a hero may wear a mask, feeling that they can convince everyone and subdue everyone. This is terrible. If this is the case, can the church in this locality be built up? The church is torn down by these kinds of problems.</P><P>Brothers, you need to realize that to be a person in the eldership in the Lord's recovery is a serious thing. If you are young, beware of your pride. If you are in middle age, beware of your thinking that you are the hero, the strong one among the others. If you are an older one, beware of your opinions. In the eldership there should be no pride, no thought of being a hero, and no opinions. There should be only truth, the Spirit, Christ, and the church, the Body of Christ. We do not want to know anything else.</P><P>In the past two years of the full-time training in Anaheim, I can testify that I and all the trainers did not have anything other than the truth, the Spirit, Christ, and the church, the Body of Christ. Thus, the blessing has been here. When we practice the one accord, our name will be Iddo, Berechiah, and Zechariah (Zech. 1:1), meaning that at the appointed time Jehovah blesses and Jehovah remembers. In some localities there is no blessing because some of the brothers wear a mask. They are not honest, sincere, and genuine. Do you think that the Lord will bless you and remember you if you are like this?</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Further Consideration of the Eldership, the Region of Work, and the Care for the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
