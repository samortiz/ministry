<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church as Both the Body<br>and the Bride of Christ,<br>Being the Object of Christ's Love</H2><P>The church, as both the Body and the bride of Christ, is the object of Christ's love (Eph. 5:2, 25-29). Ephesians 5:29 says, "For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church." The church is the Body of Christ. As His Body, the church becomes His counterpart, His bride.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Being the Mystery of Christ,<br>as Christ is the Mystery of God,<br>Both of Which Are the Great Mystery</H2><P>The church is also the mystery of Christ, as Christ is the mystery of God (Eph. 3:4-6; Col 2:2b). Both of these mysteries are the great mystery (Eph. 5:32). Christ is a mystery, and His mystery is the church. If we are to know the mystery of Christ, we have to know the church. The church is the mystery of Christ, just as Christ is the mystery of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Local Churches Being the Lampstands<br>(the Local Testimony) of Christ</H2><P>The local churches are the lampstands, the local testimony, of Christ (Rev. 1:11-12, 20). Each local church is a testimony of Christ in its locality. Christ is the testimony, the expression of God, and the church is the testimony, the expression of Christ. A local church is a testimony, a "photograph," of Christ. This "photograph," this picture, is better than a thousand words.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church as the Body of Christ<br>Being Uniquely One Both Universally and Locally</H2><P>The church as the Body of Christ is uniquely one both universally and locally (Eph 4:3-6). The church is one universally as the Body of Christ and one locally as the local testimony, the expression of Christ. As the local testimonies, the churches are many, but in each city there should only be one local church as Christ's unique expression in that locality. The church, both universally and locally, has only one Head. The church also has one Spirit (Eph. 4:4), that is, one life, one Lord (4:5), and one God, the Father of all (4:6).</P><P>Christ is unique and is not divided (1 Cor. 1:13a). This unique and undivided Christ, taken as the unique center among all the believers, should be the termination of all divisions. All the elders must see this. Some people say that as long as we love the Lord and live Him, we can serve Him properly regardless of what ground we stand on. To these persons, it does not mean much whether there is one church or thirty "churches" in their locality. They say that we have to exercise generality and broaden our heart. To them, as long as people love the Lord, serve the Lord, and even live the Lord, it is not wrong for them to meet in their own way. What would you say to them? Paul says, "Has Christ been divided?" (1 Cor. 1:13a). There is no need to speak too many words concerning this matter. We should simply ask them, "Has Christ been divided? If not, then why are you divided?" There is the need of such a basic realization and understanding of the church. The elders, especially those who are somewhat new in the eldership, should get into all these points that they may know the church. Then they will know the truth, and their understanding, their attitude, and their standing, their ground, will be upright. To be elders caring for God's allotment, we need to know the truth.</P>
