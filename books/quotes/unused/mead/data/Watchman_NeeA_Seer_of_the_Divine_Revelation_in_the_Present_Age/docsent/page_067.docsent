   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer and Fellowship with the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Watchman Nee prayed in a slow way with one or two words coming slowly from his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I was in Chungking, I unconsciously picked up his way of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By praying in such a way I sensed the presence of the Lord abiding with me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every word was directed to the Lord, and the words kept springing up from within.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later, a leading brother rebuked me for that practice and told me that I should not copy another's way of prayer, so I stopped praying that way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, even to this day, when I pray privately I still pray this way, pouring out to God one or two words at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By praying in this way, it is much easier to touch the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On how to maintain fellowship with the Lord, Watchman Nee used the following example: "Suppose a train is traveling from Szechuan to K'un-ming.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It must pass through many tunnels.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes it is traveling in darkness, sometimes in light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The experience of a Christian's fellowship with the Lord is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If one is in darkness, he must first confess his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If there is no sense of sin, he must exercise his will to continue on in the fellowship."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Maturity in Life</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the matter of maturing in life, Watchman Nee said this:</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Time is needed for life to mature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Other than having a big head, young people cannot really be matured.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Maturity is a matter of the enlargement of capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You must allow God to give you time to suffer beyond measure; then your capacity will be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some could suffer the loss of five dollars, but could never suffer the loss of five thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some could forgive others two or three times, but the fifth time would make their hands tremble.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One discovers by eating whether a fruit is raw or ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Raw fruit tastes sour and bitter and is tough and hard.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only ripe fruit tastes sweet and fragrant.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Madame Guyon had the flavor of ripeness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She was a teacher to the elderly and a friend to children.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Christian life grows in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not a matter of being artificially ripened like the ripening of a banana with mild heat.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Son of Man came eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With some people, their eating and drinking exposes their true condition.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Life does not come as a result of spiritual cultivation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you have the Spirit, there is no need of cultivation; if you do not have the Spirit, there is no way to cultivate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Lilies blossom and birds grow feathers quite spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no need for them to cultivate these features.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Cultivation can only produce a "saint" according to the world's concept; it cannot produce a real Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is sufficient to have the seal of the cross on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no need to strive to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Striving only delays the growth of life; it cannot speed it up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is important for us to receive God's arrangement in the circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This arrangement is the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To escape God's arrangement just one time is to lose an opportunity to have our capacity enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This will prolong the time required for life to mature in us and will even require us to make up this lesson in order to reach maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A believer can never be the same after passing through suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Either he will have his capacity enlarged or he will become more hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this reason, when believers are passing through suffering, they must pay attention and they must realize that maturity in life is the sum total of receiving the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>People may see a person who has matured in life, but they cannot see the accumulated discipline of the Holy Spirit which that person has received secretly day by day throughout the years.</S>
