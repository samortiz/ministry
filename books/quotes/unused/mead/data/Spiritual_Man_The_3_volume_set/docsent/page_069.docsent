   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Colossians 2:18 speaks about the "mind" of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the self-confidence that Christians have is actually their trust that they have wisdom and that they know how to serve God and understand the teaching of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Second Corinthians 1:12 speaks of fleshly "wisdom."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is very dangerous for a man to receive the truth of the Bible with his wisdom because this is the most hidden and subtle method which causes the believers to perfect the work of the Holy Spirit by their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A very precious truth may be stored only in the memory, which is merely in the mind of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only the Spirit gives life; the flesh profits nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All truths, if not continually enlivened by the Lord, profit neither ourselves nor others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not speaking about sins here; rather, we are speaking concerning the things that come out of man's natural life, even though it is a life in union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This kind of doing is natural and not of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not only reject our righteousness, but also deny the wisdom of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This must be put on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Colossians 2:23 speaks about a "worship" in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Such worship is according to our opinion concerning the things of God's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the methods we use to stir up, seek, and acquire the sense of worship are all worship in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are not willing to worship according to the teaching of the Bible nor to be led by the Holy Spirit in Christian work, biblical knowledge, and saving souls, it is always possible to walk "according to the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible often speaks about the "life" of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If this life of the flesh has not undergone the work of the cross, it lives in the believers just as it lives in the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The only difference is that in the believers there is opposition from the life of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The life of the flesh can become the vitality of the believers; they can draw strength from it to live on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It can help the believers to have strength in serving God, in meditating on the truth, and in consecrating themselves for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It can become the motivation for doing many good works.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In fact, it can cause the believers, on the one hand, to have it as their life and, on the other hand, to think that they are keeping the word of God's will as their goal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must truly know that in man's life there are two different principles of living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many believers have a mixed life, sometimes obeying this and sometimes obeying the other.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes they completely depend on the power of the Spirit, while at other times they also have a heart of self-reliance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no steadfastness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"The things which I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, so that with me there should be Yes, yes and No, no?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>2 Cor 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The characteristic of the flesh is its fickleness Yes, yes and No, no. The will of God is to not walk according to the flesh even for a moment but to walk according to the spirit Rom 8:4 . We should accept the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ" Col 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should be willing to allow the power of the cross, as a knife of circumcision, to completely cut off from us everything which is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This kind of "cutting" should be deep and should make a clear separation so that nothing of the flesh can be hidden or remain.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The cross and the curse cannot be separated Gal 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we commit our flesh to the cross, we commit it to the curse, acknowledging that there is no good thing in the flesh and that it has no other destiny except to be cursed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not have such a heart, it will be difficult for us to take the circumcision of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The love, desire, thoughts, knowledge, mind, worship, and work of the flesh must go to the cross.</S>
