<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Restoration of Israel</H2><P>During the great tribulation, Israel will be trampled under foot by Antichrist and his army (Rev. 11:2). Furthermore, the principal calamities of the great tribulation will occur in that land (Matt. 24:16-22). At the end, Antichrist will kill many of the Jews and will besiege them on the Mount of Olives. However, at the very moment of peril, Christ will come on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory, and all Israel will look to the One whom they pierced, and they will wail for Him and repent (Matt. 24:30; Zech. 12:10). Then Christ will descend onto the Mount of Olives to save Israel (Zech. 14:4-5). After Christ judges the nations, He will send His angels with a loud trumpet, and they will gather together from the four winds all the children of Israel to the good land which He promised to Abraham. That will be the time of the restoration of the nation of Israel (Matt. 24:31), and it will usher in the restoration of all things (Acts 3:21). At that point, the kingdom age will begin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BELIEVERS' ATTITUDE TOWARD<br>THE COMING OF CHRIST</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Loving It, Awaiting It, and<br>Taking It as an Encouragement</H2><P>Since we know that the Lord's second coming is so precious, we should love the Lord's appearing (2 Tim. 4:8). The Bible concludes with "Come, Lord Jesus!" (Rev. 22:20). From the record in the New Testament, it is not difficult to discover that in their hearts the apostles firmly believed that the Lord would come quickly, and they also lived a life in preparation for the Lord's second coming. In the church's history, I know that Miss M.E. Barber was one who lived such a life. On the last day of 1925, Brother Nee went to pray with her, and she prayed, "Lord, do You really mean to say that You will let 1925 pass by, that You will wait until 1926 before You come back? However, on this last day I still pray that You will come back today!" Not long afterwards, Brother Nee met her on the street, and again she said to him, "It is really strange that up to this day He has not yet come back." Do not think that since we are clear concerning the signs of the Lord's coming, we can be slothful and can first love the world and then pursue the Lord when the last week comes. There is no such convenience. We should believe that the Lord is to be feared. In Luke 12 the Lord gave a parable concerning a rich man who endeavored to lay up wealth for himself so that his soul might enjoy itself and be merry. But God said to him, "Senseless one, this night they are requiring your soul from you" (vv. 16-20). Every "today" that we have is truly the Lord's grace. Therefore, as long as we have today, as long as we still have breath, we should love the Lord and His appearing, await the Lord's coming (Phil. 3:20), and always take His coming as an encouragement.</P><P>In 2 Timothy 4:1 Paul said to Timothy, "I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is about to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom." This is an exhortation from Paul immediately before his martyrdom. He said that he had fought the good fight, he had finished the course, and he had kept the faith, and that at the judgment seat he would be awarded the crown of righteousness, which would be awarded to all those who have loved His appearing (2 Tim. 4:6-8). He reminded Timothy, and also us, by the Lord's judgment and kingdom that we should have a living that loves the Lord's appearing. This will cause us not to be discouraged, not to backslide, not to become weak, but to remain faithful to the end.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Watching and Being Ready for It</H2><P>When the Lord comes, He will come secretly as a thief to those who love Him, and will steal them away as His treasures and bring them into His presence in the heavens (Matt. 24:42-43). Hence, we need to watch and be ready (Matt. 25:13; 24:44). If we desire to be raptured, first we must be filled with the heavenly breath and have oil in our vessels. If we are rooted on the earth and occupied daily with the anxieties of this life and with earthly pleasures, we will not be raptured at that time. We should remember Lot's wife. Because she loved and treasured the evil world which God was going to judge and utterly destroy, she took a backward look. Thus, she became a pillar of salt and was left to suffer in a place of shame. This should be a warning to us. If we love the world, the Lord will leave us here to pass through the great tribulation that we may be put to shame until we become mature and are raptured.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Beseeching to Prevail</H2><P>The Lord also reminded us to take heed to ourselves and to be watchful, at every time beseeching, lest our hearts be weighed down with dissipation (or debauchery) and drunkenness and anxieties of life, and that the day of the great tribulation come upon us suddenly as a snare; for it will come in upon all those dwelling on the face of all the earth. We should guard our hearts and give all the room to the Lord that we may prevail to escape all these things and to stand before the Son of Man (Luke 21:34-36; cf. Rev. 12:5-6, 14).</P><P>To attain maturity is not an overnight matter. Therefore, for His coming we must prepare ourselves, love Him, and grow in Him, that at His appearing we may be mature to be raptured and receive the reward.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Kuching, Malaysia on October 31, 1990)</P>
