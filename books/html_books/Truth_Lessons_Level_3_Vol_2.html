<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>The tabernacle typifies God incarnated to dwell among men that they may contact, receive, possess, and enter into Him to enjoy Him as their life and their life supply. The offerings typify the incarnated Christ who joined Himself to man to be man&rsquo;s substitute offering to solve all of man&rsquo;s problems, including sin, before God. As the offerings, He also becomes food to God and to those who belong to and serve God so that both God and man may be satisfied. There are five basic offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. In addition, there are subordinate offerings, such as the wave offering, the heave offering, the drink offering, the offering for thanksgiving, and the offering for a vow or a freewill offering. All these offerings are types of Christ, revealing that the riches of Christ in His various aspects meet the need of God and man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE BASIC OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>The basic offerings are the basis of all the offerings; all the subordinate offerings are based on the basic offerings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Burnt Offering</h2>
<p>The burnt offering (Lev. 1) is mainly for God as food for His satisfaction. It primarily signifies Christ in His living for God and for God&rsquo;s satisfaction, not in His redeeming man from sin. In the life of the Lord Jesus there was no blemish, defect, or imperfection. He was perfect, and the life He lived was perfect and absolutely for God. He was fully qualified to be the burnt offering. Through His incarnation, a body was prepared for Him by God to be the real burnt offering. He did God&rsquo;s will (Heb. 10:5-9) and became obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross (Phil. 2:8), on which He offered Himself to God once for all (Heb. 10:10).</p>
<p>When the priests offered up the sacrifice of the burnt offering to God, a satisfying fragrance, that is, a savor that brings satisfaction, peace, and rest, ascended to God for His satisfaction and rest. Since God is satisfied, He will render His sweet acceptance to man. This shows that if we desire to walk in a way that satisfies God with sweetness, peace, and rest, that is, to live a life that is absolutely for God, we must take Christ as our burnt offering. We need to lay our hands on Him to be identified with Him, to be one with Him, and to live the life He lived on earth. Such a life includes our willingness to be slaughtered (put to death), skinned (stripped of the outward expression of our virtues), cut into pieces (broken, without any reservation in our entire being), and washed (cleansed by the Holy Spirit). By passing through all these processes, we will have something to offer to God as our burnt offering&mdash;the very Christ whom we have experienced.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Meal Offering</h2>
<p>The emphasis of the burnt offering is on Christ&rsquo;s being absolutely for God, even unto death. The burnt offering implies His living but emphasizes His death. The emphasis of the meal offering is on Christ&rsquo;s human living and daily walk. The meal offering implies His death but emphasizes His living. In the burnt offering we see that Christ is the righteousness of God, and in the meal offering we see that Christ is righteous before God&mdash;He is fine, perfect, complete, and righteous in every way.</p>
<p>The meal offering (Lev. 2) is for God as food for His satisfaction, and it is also for His serving ones as food for their satisfaction. This offering shows that Christ lived a human life that was beautiful and excellent to the uttermost so that God and His serving ones could share the same satisfaction. The main element of the meal offering is fine flour, which signifies that Christ&rsquo;s humanity is fine, perfect, balanced, and right in every way. This fine flour is produced out of wheat which has passed through many processes, including being sown and buried in the ground, growing up, being beaten by wind, frost, rain, and sun, and then being reaped, threshed, sifted, and ground. These processes signify the varied sufferings of Christ in His human living, which made Him &ldquo;a man of sorrows&rdquo; (Isa. 53:3).</p>
<p>The oil of the meal offering signifies the Spirit of God (Luke 4:18; Heb. 1:9). Christ is a man with an excellent humanity. He also has the divine element, which is the Spirit of God. The meal offering is mingled with oil, signifying that Christ&rsquo;s humanity has been mingled with the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:18). This mingling also signifies that Christ&rsquo;s human nature has been mingled with God&rsquo;s divine nature; hence, He is a God-man. He is a man mingled with God; His divinity has been mingled with His humanity as one. He is a man in humanity, yet He expressed His divine attributes as human virtues, thus expressing God in His humanity.</p>
<p>In the meal offering the sweet-smelling frankincense signifies the fragrance of Christ in His resurrection. Frankincense was put on the fine flour, signifying that Christ&rsquo;s humanity with the aroma of His resurrection was manifested through His sufferings. During the course of His human life, Christ suffered a great deal, but the aroma of His resurrection was manifested through His sufferings.</p>
<p>Hence, the three elements in the meal offering&mdash;fine flour, oil, and frankincense&mdash;show the entire life of Christ. He continually lived and walked in these three things, that is, in His humanity mingled with His divinity and expressing His resurrection. No matter what the circumstances were, the Lord Jesus lived a life of suffering but expressed the fragrance of resurrection. In every place and at every time, Christ lived a life of humanity mingled with divinity, expressing His resurrection. This is the meal offering.</p>
<p>In the meal offering, all the frankincense with part of the fine flour and part of the oil were burned on the altar (Lev. 2:2). This signifies that a significant portion of Christ&rsquo;s excellent, perfect, Spirit-filled, and resurrection-saturated living was offered to God as food for His enjoyment. The remainder of the meal offering was for Aaron and his sons (v. 3). This signifies that after God&rsquo;s enjoyment, we also can enjoy Christ&rsquo;s human living as our food. We must first give God&rsquo;s portion to Him for His satisfaction, and then the remainder will be our portion for our satisfaction.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Peace Offering</h2>
<p>The peace offering as the center of the five basic offerings is based on God&rsquo;s satisfaction in the burnt offering. Christ&rsquo;s being the burnt offering to God for His satisfaction qualifies Him to deal with our sin, that is, the sin in our nature. This is indicated by Leviticus 3:5 and 6:12. Speaking of the peace offering, Leviticus 3:5 says, &ldquo;Aaron&rsquo;s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt offering, which is on the wood that is on the fire; it is an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.&rdquo; Here we see that the burnt offering is a basis for the peace offering to be accepted by God. With the burning of the burnt offering as a basis, God accepts the peace offering.</p>
<p>The peace offering is an issue of the enjoyment of God and man in the meal offering. Christ in His excellent human living as the meal offering to God is for the satisfaction of both God and man and qualifies Him to deal with our trespasses and transgressions, the sinful deeds in our conduct. Based on this, Christ becomes our peace offering so that we may have peace with God and with man and may enjoy Christ together as our peace with God and with man.</p>
<p>The peace offering was slaughtered at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting (vv. 2, 8, 13). This signifies that Christ was slain on the earth and before God so that we may enjoy Christ on earth today. The blood of the peace offering was sprinkled on and around the altar where the offerer was standing (vv. 2, 8, 13). This indicates that the blood is for peace in the offerer&rsquo;s conscience. When we see the blood of the peace offering, we have the assurance that our sins have been washed away.</p>
<p>All the fat that covered and was on the inward parts, the two kidneys, the appendage on the liver, and the entire fat tail were burned on the altar (vv. 3-5, 9-11, 14-16). This signifies that God should be the first to enjoy, enjoying the first, the best, part of the offering.</p>
<p>The breast and the right thigh of the offering were for the priests (7:32-34). This signifies that all the believers who serve God as priests may enjoy Christ with God and may enjoy Him as their loving ability and standing strength. When we eat the breast of Christ, we have His loving ability to love others and to be concerned for them in love. When we eat the thigh of Christ, we have His strength to stand.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Sin Offering</h2>
<p>The divine sequence of the five basic offerings opens with the burnt offering, showing that the primary thing for us is to be absolute for God. The burnt offering is followed by the meal offering, which shows that we should take Christ as our life supply and live by Him daily. The issue of taking Christ as the burnt offering and the meal offering is peace. Even though we have peace, we still have certain problems that need to be dealt with&mdash;sin within and sins without. Hence, after the peace offering, there is still the sin offering and the trespass offering.</p>
<p>The sin offering signifies Christ as the offering to deal with the sin in our fallen nature (Rom. 8:3; 2 Cor. 5:21). Leviticus 4 repeatedly speaks of the sin of ignorance (vv. 1-2, 13, 22, 27), that is, sin committed unintentionally. This signifies the indwelling sin in our fallen nature. Christ became flesh for our sin, but He was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin and did not have the sin of the flesh (John 1:14; Rom. 8:3). Nevertheless, He was crucified in the flesh (1 Pet. 3:18). Thus, on the cross He judged Satan, who is related to the flesh, and the world, which hung on Him (John 16:11; 12:31), and He destroyed Satan (Heb. 2:14). At the same time, through Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion in the flesh, God condemned sin, which was brought by Satan into man&rsquo;s flesh (Rom. 8:3). As a result, we can walk according to the spirit rather than the flesh, no longer being under the bondage of sin and fulfilling the righteous requirement of the law in us (v. 4).</p>
<p>The sin offering may be a young bull, a male or female goat, or a female lamb (Lev. 4:3, 14, 23, 28, 32). This signifies that Christ as the sin offering is experienced by different people in different degrees. In Himself as the sin offering, Christ does not differ in size. He is always the same. However, our realization, presentation, and application of Christ as the sin offering may differ in degree.</p>
<p>Some of the blood of the sin offering was brought into the Tent of Meeting and sprinkled seven times toward the veil of the Holy of Holies (vv. 5-6, 16-17). This signifies that the blood of Christ has been brought into the Holy of Holies in the heavens for our redemption (Heb. 9:12). Christ&rsquo;s blood covers our situation with God in the Holy of Holies. Moreover, some of the blood was put upon the horns of the altar of fragrant incense (Lev. 4:7a, 18a). This signifies that the redemption of Christ&rsquo;s blood is effective for us to contact God in prayer (Heb. 10:19). We need to contact God in our prayer through the blood. Furthermore, some of the blood was put upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering (Lev. 4:25a, 30a, 34a). This signifies that the blood of Christ is effective for our redemption. All the rest of the blood was poured out at the base of the altar of burnt offering (vv. 7b, 18b, 25b, 30b, 34b). This signifies that the blood of Christ at the standing of the cross is for peace in our conscience and that we have been redeemed and accepted by God.</p>
<p>The sin offering was slaughtered in the place where the burnt offering was slaughtered (Lev. 6:25). This indicates that the sin offering is based on the burnt offering, and it signifies that Christ can be the sin offering for us because He is the burnt offering. Christ must be the burnt offering for God&rsquo;s satisfaction so that He can be qualified to be our sin offering. This also indicates that our experience of the sin offering is altogether related to our enjoyment of the Lord Jesus as our burnt offering. The more we love the Lord and enjoy Him, the more we will know our evil nature and know our great need for Christ as our sin offering.</p>
<p>For the priests&rsquo; service, the sin offering is followed by the burnt offering (16:3, 5). This signifies that, as the priests of God, we must take Christ as the burnt offering in order to live Christ for God&rsquo;s satisfaction, after enjoying Him as the sin offering.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Trespass Offering</h2>
<p>Whereas Christ as our sin offering deals with the sin in our nature inwardly, Christ as our trespass offering deals with the sins in our conduct outwardly (1 Pet. 2:24). Leviticus 5 shows that the trespass offering is also called the sin offering (vv. 6-8, 11-12). This signifies that Christ&rsquo;s redemption for our sin resolves the problem of sin in its two aspects&mdash;sin in our inward nature and sins in our outward conduct. These two aspects of sin make up the totality of sin. John 1:29 speaks of this totality: &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; The word <em>sin</em> is in the singular; it denotes the totality of sin, comprising both inward sin and outward sins.</p>
<p>Leviticus 5:7 says, &ldquo;If he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring as his trespass offering to Jehovah for that in which he has sinned two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.&rdquo; Here we see that a sin offering and a burnt offering form the trespass offering. This signifies that the source of a trespass is the inward sin and that the reason for a trespass is not living for God. Inward sin needs the sin offering. Not living for God needs the burnt offering. The two are a complete type of Christ as the trespass offering, which resolves the problem of our sins.</p>
<p>Leviticus 5:11 says, &ldquo;But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he shall bring as his offering for that which he has sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering.&rdquo; Here, fine flour is used for a sin offering. Fine flour typifies the humanity of Jesus. Thus, the trespass offering not only includes the sin offering and the burnt offering, but it is even related to the humanity of Jesus. This indicates that we commit many sins not only because we have sin within us and are not absolute for God but also because we are short of the humanity of Jesus. Because of this shortage, we are full of lies, death, the natural life, and rashness. The humanity of Jesus is an all-inclusive dose to kill our germs, to heal our diseases, and to supply our need.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE SUBORDINATE OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>The subordinate offerings are produced out of the basic offerings, such as the breast of the peace offering which becomes the wave offering and the thigh of the peace offering which becomes the heave offering.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Wave Offering</h2>
<p>Leviticus 7:29-31 shows that the offerer of the peace offering was to bring parts of his offering for the offerings of Jehovah by fire. The fat was to be burned to God by fire on the altar with the breast waved as a wave offering before Jehovah for Aaron and his sons. <em>Wave</em> indicates movement. This signifies Christ moving in His resurrection. Hence, the wave offering is a type of Christ in resurrection. Since the breast signifies love, the breast of the wave offering signifies the loving part of Christ in resurrection. This part is for the priests, that is, for the serving ones&rsquo; enjoyment.</p>
<p>Concerning the consecration of Aaron and his sons, Leviticus 8:26-28 speaks of one unleavened cake, one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer being placed upon the portions of the fat and upon the right thigh. Then all these portions were put on the palms of Aaron and of his sons and waved as a wave offering. They were then taken from their hands and offered up in smoke on the altar upon the burnt offering for an offering of consecration by fire to Jehovah for a satisfying fragrance. This signifies that the tender, excellent, and strong parts of Christ, as the three kinds of cakes, with His sinless but Spirit-mingled humanity in different aspects as food, are offered to God in His resurrection. As such, they become a satisfying and fragrant offering in the fellowship of His sufferings unto death on the cross for our assuming of the New Testament priesthood.</p>
<p>The breast of the ram of consecration was waved as a wave offering before Jehovah, and it was Moses&rsquo; portion. This signifies that the loving capacity of Christ in His resurrection is for the one who ministers Christ to us in our consecration for the priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Heave Offering</h2>
<p>Leviticus 7:32-33 says, &ldquo;The right thigh you shall give to the priest for a heave offering out of the sacrifices of your peace offerings. The one among the sons of Aaron who presents the blood of the peace offerings and the fat shall have the right thigh as his portion.&rdquo; The heave offering signifies the ascended Christ, and the right thigh signifies strength, power. Hence, the right thigh of the peace offering given to the priest as a heave offering signifies that the strength of Christ in His ascension is given to the serving one as a portion for his enjoyment.</p>
<p>God took &ldquo;the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering...from the children of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings&rdquo; and gave them &ldquo;to Aaron the priest and to his sons for a perpetual statute to be observed by the children of Israel&rdquo; (v. 34). This signifies that God has allotted, in our enjoyment of Christ as the peace offering, the loving capacity and the strengthening power of Christ to us, the New Testament priests, as our eternal portion for our enjoyment in serving God. The more we minister Christ as the peace offering and the more we offer Christ as the peace offering to God, the more we will have the loving capacity and the strengthening power of Christ. In this way, we will become stronger and more loving.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Drink Offering</h2>
<p>The drink offering was in addition to the basic offerings revealed in Leviticus and was offered mainly with the burnt offering, the peace offering, and the meal offering (Exo. 29:40-41; Lev. 23:9-13, 15-18; Num. 15:1-10; 28:1-14; 29:12-38). The drink offering is a type of Christ pouring Himself out for God&rsquo;s pleasure and satisfaction. It is also a type of Christ as enjoyed by the offerer. Christ, as the heavenly wine, fills the offerer and even causes him to become wine to God, that is, to become a drink offering by being poured out as a sacrifice to God upon the believers&rsquo; faith, through the shedding of blood in suffering martyrdom for the Lord (Phil. 2:17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Offering for Thanksgiving</h2>
<p>The offering for thanksgiving is a kind of peace offering and is offered with the peace offering. The peace offering is of different kinds, indicating that the offerers&rsquo; enjoyment of Christ is in different conditions. Of all the different peace offerings, the peace offering for thanksgiving is the weakest. Concerning this kind of peace offering, Leviticus 7:12 says, &ldquo;If he presents it for a thanksgiving, then he shall present with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil and unleavened wafers anointed with oil and saturated cakes of fine flour mingled with oil.&rdquo; This signifies that Christ, who is mingled with the Spirit without sin, anointed with the Spirit without sin, and saturated with the Spirit as the fine One, as the meal offering in our enjoyment of Him in His conduct, is our peace offering in our thanksgiving to God, having been crucified with the shedding of His blood on the cross (Col. 1:20).</p>
<p>The flesh of the thanksgiving sacrifice of the peace offering was eaten on the day of its offering, and no part of it was laid aside until morning (Lev. 7:15). This signifies that the maintaining power of the peace offering for thanksgiving is rather small, and its enjoyment cannot be carried from one day to the next. This indicates that our offering of Christ as a thanksgiving to God must be fresh and new, with nothing left to become stale. Our experience of Christ daily needs to be adjusted, balanced, fresh, and new.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Offering for a Vow<br />
or a Freewill Offering</h2>
<p>Like the offering for thanksgiving, the offering for a vow or a freewill offering is a kind of peace offering, and it is offered with the peace offering. &ldquo;If the sacrifice of his offering is a vow or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he presents his sacrifice, and on the next day what remains of it shall be eaten&rdquo; (v. 16). This signifies that the maintaining power of the peace offering for a vow or a freewill offering is stronger than that of the offering for thanksgiving and that its enjoyment can last until the next day. This also indicates that our stronger enjoyment of Christ can last longer. If our offering is stronger, our enjoyment of this offering will last longer.</p>
<p>However, &ldquo;if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is eaten at all on the third day, it will not be accepted, neither will it be reckoned to the one who presents it; it will be an abomination, and the person who eats of it shall bear his own iniquity&rdquo; (v. 18). This signifies that our enjoyment in oldness will not be pleasant to God and not right with Him. The lawless enjoyment of Christ is abhorrent to God. Therefore, in 1 Corinthians 11 Paul warns us that in coming to the Lord&rsquo;s table, we must be careful.</p>
<p>In Leviticus 22:18-21 an offering for a vow or for a freewill offering can be a burnt offering. The significance of the burnt offering is to be absolute for God. If we make a strong decision to live absolutely for God, this vow becomes a burnt offering. If, as an exercise of our free will, we spontaneously choose to be absolute for God, this is a freewill offering becoming a burnt offering. This portion of the Scripture also tells us that each of these offerings must be a male without blemish, of the sheep or of the goats. A male here signifies a strong Christ. When we offer an offering for a vow or a freewill offering to God, our offering must be a strong Christ without blemish whom we have experienced.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Among the offerings, there are five basic ones: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. In addition, there are subordinate offerings, including the wave offering, the heave offering, the drink offering, the offering for thanksgiving, and the offering for a vow or a freewill offering. All these offerings are types of Christ, revealing how the riches of Christ in His various aspects meet the need of God and man.</p>
<p>The burnt offering signifies that through His incarnation Christ lived a life that was absolutely for God. He did God&rsquo;s will and became obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross, on which He offered Himself to God once for all for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. The three elements&mdash;the fine flour, the oil, and the frankincense&mdash;in the meal offering signify that in His life Christ continually lived in His humanity mingled with His divinity and expressed His resurrection. His excellent, perfect, Spirit-filled, and resurrection-saturated living is offered to God as His food and as the serving ones&rsquo; food for the satisfaction of both God and man. The peace offering is the center of the five basic offerings. Christ being the peace offering to God is based on His being the burnt offering to satisfy God, which qualifies Him to deal with the sin in our nature. It is also based on His being the meal offering for God&rsquo;s satisfaction, which qualifies Him to deal with the sinful deeds in our outward conduct. By this, Christ is accepted by God and becomes our peace offering so that we may have peace with God and with man and enjoy Christ together as our peace with God and with man. The sin offering signifies Christ as the offering to deal with the sin in our fallen nature. Christ being the sin offering for us is based on His being the burnt offering. Christ must be the burnt offering for God&rsquo;s satisfaction so that He might be qualified to be our sin offering to deal with the sin in our nature. Christ as our trespass offering deals with the sins in our conduct outwardly. The trespass offering not only includes the sin offering and the burnt offering, but it is also related to the humanity of Jesus. This indicates that we commit many sins not only because we have sin within us and because we are not absolute for God but also because we are short of the humanity of Jesus.</p>
<p>The subordinate offerings are the breast of the peace offering which becomes the wave offering for the priests, signifying the loving part of Christ in His resurrection for the serving ones&rsquo; enjoyment; the thigh of the peace offering which becomes the heave offering for the priests, signifying the strength of Christ in His ascension for the serving ones&rsquo; enjoyment as an eternal portion; the drink offering offered with the burnt offering, the peace offering, and the meal offering, signifying Christ pouring Himself out for God&rsquo;s pleasure and satisfaction; and the offering for thanksgiving, the offering for a vow, and the freewill offering. All these special effects are produced out of the basic offerings.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In the preceding lessons we saw how the tabernacle typifies Christ and the church and how the altar typifies the cross of Christ. We also saw how the different offerings are types of Christ in revealing the riches of Christ in His various aspects to meet the need of God and man. Now we come to see how the priesthood of Aaron and his sons typifies Christ and His believers as the New Testament priesthood.</p>
<p>Under the old covenant, God&rsquo;s original intention was that all the children of Israel would be His priests to become a kingdom of priests to Him (Exo. 19:6). Later the children of Israel fully forsook God by worshipping the golden calf (32:1-7); therefore, God rejected them and chose only Aaron and his descendants to be His priests throughout the generations.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. AARON</h2>
<p>In the Scriptures there are two orders of the priesthood: the order of Melchizedek and the order of Aaron. Melchizedek, as the one having neither beginning of days nor end of life (Heb. 7:3), was sent from God to be a priest according to God&rsquo;s eternal order. The details of what Melchizedek typifies are explained in lesson 5 of the first volume of Level Three. Aaron, as one who was taken from among men to be the priest to the children of Israel according to the order of man, typifies Christ as the High Priest chosen from among men to be the High Priest to the believers according to the order of man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being Taken from among Men</h2>
<p>Christ, as God&rsquo;s High Priest according to Aaron, was taken from among men (5:1). Hence, He possesses humanity. Furthermore, He entered with His humanity into resurrection so that He has not only honor but also glory (vv. 4-5), not only the preciousness of His position, but also the splendor of His person. In this way He is qualified to be our High Priest.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being Able to Be Touched with<br />
the Feeling of Our Weaknesses</h2>
<p>Christ, as our High Priest, was taken from among men. Possessing humanity, though not encompassed with weakness as other high priests, He was tempted in all respects like us; hence, He is able to be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses and to exercise compassion toward us who are ignorant and erring (4:15; 5:2).</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE SONS OF AARON</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Typifying the Believers in Christ<br />
Being Priests to God with Christ</h2>
<p>As Aaron typifies Christ being the High Priest according to the order of man, the sons of Aaron typify the believers in Christ being priests to God with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Becoming a Priesthood</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament age God saved the children of Israel out of Egypt, saying, &ldquo;I bore you on eagles&rsquo; wings and brought you to Myself...You shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&rdquo; (Exo. 19:4, 6). God&rsquo;s desire was for the children of Israel to be a kingdom of priests. Regrettably, because of their rebellion and failure, most of the Israelites lost the priesthood. Eventually, only the house of Aaron became the priests, with the tribe of Levi helping them in doing various duties. Hence, in the Old Testament there was a distinction between the clerical class (the priests) and the common people.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, 1 Peter 2:4-5 and 9 says, &ldquo;Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ... You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired for a possession.&rdquo; This portion clearly indicates that in the New Testament age God has recovered His original heart&rsquo;s desire that every child of God fulfill the priestly ministry. Furthermore, the New Testament believers are priests of God not singly, individually, but corporately; they are a body of priests, a priesthood. This portion of the Word also shows that the body of priests in coordination is the built-up spiritual house. God wants a spiritual house for His dwelling, a priestly body, a priesthood, for His service. We all need the corporate service in the spiritual house in order to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose and satisfy God&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The New Testament Priestly Service<br />
Being Universal</h2>
<p>By indicating that all the believers in Christ are constituted into the holy priesthood, 1 Peter 2:4-5 and 9 show that in the New Testament age the priestly service is not only for a few but is universal; every believer is a priest to God without exception. The book of Revelation also stresses that the Lord has redeemed us with His blood to make us priests to His God and Father (1:5b-6; 5:9-10). If we practice the priestly ministry in the church life today, we will be made priests to God and Christ in the millennial kingdom as a reward. In the New Jerusalem in eternity, one of the blessings to be received by the redeemed ones is to be priests serving God. That will be the consummation of the priestly service.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The New Testament Believers<br />
Being Priests of the Gospel of God</h2>
<p>The Old Testament priests offered bulls and goats as sacrifices. According to the New Testament, because all the sacrifices were accomplished by Christ (Heb. 10:9), there is no need for the New Testament believers to offer them any longer. However, according to the New Testament there is still the need for the believers in Christ to bring the sinners who have been redeemed by God through the sacrifice accomplished by Christ and present them to God as offerings (Rom. 15:16). Furthermore, the New Testament believers in Christ need to lead the believers, who have received the compassions of God, to offer themselves to God as a living sacrifice (12:1-2), and they also need to present the believers full-grown in Christ to God in all wisdom (Col. 1:28).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. No Longer Offering Bulls and Goats<br />
but Offering Sinners in Christ</h2>
<p>The offerings presented by the Old Testament priests were physical; they offered mainly bulls and goats as sacrifices to God to be His food to satisfy His heart&rsquo;s desire. All these are types. In the New Testament all the types have been fulfilled. Now the priests of God offer sinners as sacrifices. In the Scriptures the turning of the priestly ministry from the Old Testament to the New Testament occurred with John the Baptist. John was born a priest, yet he &ldquo;grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness&rdquo; (Luke 1:80). He did not live in the holy temple or in a priestly house but in the wilderness. In his ministry he neither wore priestly garments nor ate priestly food. Rather, he wore a garment of camel&rsquo;s hair, and he ate locusts and wild honey (Matt. 3:4). Moreover, instead of remaining in the holy temple to offer sacrifices, burn incense, and light lamps, he went to preach in the wilderness, baptizing people into water. All this indicates that the old way of worshipping God according to the Old Testament had been repudiated and that a new way was about to be brought in. There was a turn from the old way to the new way, and there was a change from the Old Testament priests to the New Testament priests. The New Testament believers, as the priests of the gospel of God, no longer offer bulls and goats. Instead, they offer sinners chosen by God and saved in Christ. Hence, every believer should personally preach the gospel by visiting people to save sinners and offer them to God as sacrifices.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Leading the Believers<br />
under Their Care<br />
to Offer Themselves as Living Sacrifices</h2>
<p>After people have been saved through us, we should go to the new believers&rsquo; homes to feed them as the Lord&rsquo;s lambs (John 21:15) and cherish them as a nourishing mother would cherish her own children (1 Thes. 2:7) so that our fruit may remain (John 15:16). Furthermore, we need to lead them to know the Lord and His salvation and also to know that they have the Lord&rsquo;s life (3:36a) and that their spirit has been regenerated by the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit (vv. 3, 6). Thus, they must exercise their spirit to call on the name of the Lord, pray to the Lord, breathe in the riches of the Lord (Rom. 10:12), enjoy the milk of the Lord&rsquo;s word to grow in life (1 Pet. 2:2), and thereby offer themselves to God as a living sacrifice (Rom. 12:1).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Presenting<br />
the Perfected Saints<br />
Full-grown in Christ to God</h2>
<p>The New Testament priests also need to be like fathers to exhort and console the saints (1 Thes. 2:11), teaching them all the counsel of God at the appropriate time (Acts 20:20, 27, 31), as the apostle Paul did in admonishing and teaching every man in all wisdom that he might present them full-grown in Christ to God (Col. 1:28). At this point, the perfected saints will be able to do what the gifted ones do. Thus, they can be appointed to go forth and preach the gospel by visiting people, to nourish and take care of new believers, and to teach them. Moreover, they can prophesy for the Lord to minister Christ and build up the church for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Offering<br />
Other Spiritual Sacrifices</h2>
<p>In addition to their offering of the saints who have been redeemed by Christ and who have received the compassions of God, the New Testament priests offer other spiritual sacrifices, such as praises, good deeds, and the sharing of material riches. Hebrews 13:15 says, &ldquo;Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of lips confessing His name.&rdquo; In the church the Lord Jesus sings hymns of praise in us to God the Father (2:12). We also should praise God the Father through Him in the church. Eventually, in the church He and we, we and He, praise the Father together in the mingled spirit. This is the best and highest sacrifice that we can offer to God through Jesus.</p>
<p>Hebrews 13:16 goes on to tell us about doing good and sharing with others, that is, having fellowship in the needs of the saints. This kind of doing good and fellowshipping with others are also sacrifices which we should offer to God. Furthermore, Philippians 4:18 indicates that the supply of material things by the believers to meet the apostle&rsquo;s need is a sacrifice to God, which is well pleasing to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The priesthood of Aaron and his sons typifies Christ and His believers as the New Testament priesthood. Aaron, as one who was taken from among men to be the priest to the children of Israel according to the order of man, typifies Christ as the High Priest chosen from among men to be the High Priest to the believers according to the order of man. The sons of Aaron typify the believers in Christ being priests to God with Christ to become a priesthood serving God. The New Testament priesthood is universal; without exception, every believer is a priest to God. If we practice the priestly ministry in the church life today, we will be made priests to God and Christ in the millennial kingdom as a reward. In the New Jerusalem in eternity, one of the blessings to be received by the redeemed ones is to be priests serving God. That will be the consummation of the priestly service.</p>
<p>The offerings presented by the Old Testament priests were physical; they offered mainly bulls and goats, which typify Christ, as sacrifices to God. In the New Testament all the types have been fulfilled. Hence, the New Testament believers as the priests of the gospel of God no longer offer bulls and goats. Instead, they offer sinners chosen by God and saved in Christ; they also lead the believers under their care to offer themselves as a living sacrifice; and they present the perfected saints full-grown to God in Christ. Furthermore, they offer spiritual sacrifices, such as praises, good deeds, and the sharing in material things.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>The ephod and robe worn by Aaron, the high priest, typify Christ in His expression of God&rsquo;s glory and beauty in all that He did and in His care for the redeemed saints, the constituents of His glorious church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE EPHOD</h2>
<p>In Hebrew the word <em>ephod</em> means &ldquo;to bind, fasten, gird, or link.&rdquo; As a part of the garments of the high priest, the ephod was used for fastening, girding, securing, or connecting. Two shoulder plates and one breastplate were fastened to the ephod; hence, they were also fastened, linked, girded, to the high priest. This signifies that Christ as the High Priest has the fastening power, the tying strength, and the binding ability. He ties, fastens, and binds us to Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Made Primarily of Gold Thread<br />
Woven Together with Fine Linen</h2>
<p>Exodus 28:5-6 says, &ldquo;They therefore shall take the gold and the blue and the purple and the scarlet strands and the fine linen, and they shall make the ephod of gold thread, of blue and purple and scarlet strands, and fine twined linen, the work of a skillful workman.&rdquo; This shows that the ephod was made primarily of gold woven together with fine linen. Gold here denotes gold thread. Gold was first beaten into thin plates and then cut into thread to be woven into the fine linen. The gold becoming thread and woven together with the linen portrays the process of Christ in all His sufferings. Gold signifies Christ&rsquo;s divinity, and fine linen signifies Christ&rsquo;s humanity. The weaving together of the gold and linen in the ephod typifies the divinity and humanity of Christ being mingled and woven together. They also typify that the glory of His divine and human nature is expressed through the glory and beauty of His divine attributes being lived out through His human virtues.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Blue, Purple, and Scarlet</h2>
<p>In the ephod blue, purple, and scarlet strands were also woven into the fine linen. Blue signifies heavenliness; purple, kingliness; and scarlet, redemption. Hence, in the ephod not only do we see Christ and His divine glory woven into His human beauty, but we also see His heavenliness, kingliness, and redemption. The life of the Lord Jesus on earth was an expression of God and man, an expression of divinity and humanity. In His living we see His heavenliness, kingliness, and redemption; we also see His divine glory and human beauty. Christ has the power to hold us and the strength to fasten us to Himself because He includes all these elements.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Two Shoulder Pieces Borne at the Top</h2>
<p>Exodus 28:9-10 says, &ldquo;You shall take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel, six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the remaining six on the other stone, according to their birth.&rdquo; Verse 12 says, &ldquo;You shall put the two stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as stones of remembrance for the sons of Israel. And Aaron shall bear their names before Jehovah on his two shoulders for a memorial.&rdquo; Two onyx stones were put upon the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, and the names of the twelve sons of Israel were engraved on the stones. The two onyx stones signify the believers in Christ. After regeneration, believers begin to possess the element of precious stones and enter into the process of transformation. With our natural being there is the aspect of God&rsquo;s creation and the aspect of the fall. Whatever has its source in man&rsquo;s fall will be removed, and whatever comes from God&rsquo;s creation will be transformed. Hence, on the one hand, God is working on us to shake away and remove the fallen factor and, on the other hand, to uplift and transform the aspect of our being that is related to God&rsquo;s creation so that we may become precious stones. Eventually, in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth, all the believers in Christ will be precious stones.</p>
<p>The two onyx stones were enclosed in settings of gold and then placed on the two shoulder pieces (vv. 11-12). The settings of gold signify how we are attached, fastened, and held to the Lord Jesus. The Hebrew words rendered &ldquo;settings of gold&rdquo; also mean &ldquo;plaited work of gold, plaited settings of gold, filigree settings of gold.&rdquo; These settings portray the Lord&rsquo;s divinity after it has been processed, passing through many sufferings, which causes Him to be formed into a beautiful setting of gold to hold us as precious stones.</p>
<p>The two settings of gold were fastened to the shoulder pieces by two chains of gold (vv. 13-14). The chains of gold were made of pure gold twisted together as cords. This signifies that Christ in His divinity passed through a process to become a golden fastening cord.</p>
<p>Thus, the high priest bearing the two onyx stones fastened to the two shoulder pieces with the two settings of gold and the two gold chains typifies that Christ as God&rsquo;s High Priest has the strength to bear God&rsquo;s redeemed people before God. This strength comes from His divinity mingled with His humanity, which expresses God, man, and the Lord&rsquo;s heavenliness, kingship, and redemption. Furthermore, the precious stones become a memorial in the sight of God (v. 12), that is, a memorial of the church set in Christ, a memorial of Christ holding the church, God&rsquo;s redeemed people. This memorial will last for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Breastplate Worn on the Breast</h2>
<p>The focus of the ephod is the breastplate. Hence, of the various items of the priestly garments, the first thing spoken of is the breastplate (v. 4). This indicates that the priestly garments are for the breastplate. The breastplate signifies that God&rsquo;s redeemed people have been built together in Christ. The twelve precious stones, which signify all God&rsquo;s redeemed people, being built together on the breastplate are a picture of the building of God&rsquo;s people. The breastplate is also used for the manifestation of God&rsquo;s will concerning His people. In the Old Testament age, the breastplate was the instrument and channel through which God spoke.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Breastplate Typifying the Church</h2>
<p>Verse 21 says, &ldquo;The stones shall be according to the names of the sons of Israel, twelve, according to their names; they shall be like the engravings of a signet, each according to its name, for the twelve tribes.&rdquo; The names of the twelve tribes of Israel engraved on the twelve stones signify the redeemed people of God. The stones are separate pieces, but they are not divided. Rather, they are incorporated together. Using a New Testament concept, the stones have been built together. The twelve stones are built together to become one entity, and the name of that entity is the breastplate. Hence, the breastplate typifies the church.</p>
<p>In the church the believers are distinct individuals, but they are not separated, individualistic, or divided. They have been built as one. Furthermore, the Lord does not bear each one individualistically; He bears one entity, the church, which is His Body.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Breastplate of Judgment</h2>
<p>The breastplate is called the breastplate of judgment (v. 15). The word <em>judgment</em> is related to judging. However, the judgment here is not mainly to determine right or wrong, that is, what is just or unjust. Instead, this judgment is related to God&rsquo;s people knowing His leading. If we would know God&rsquo;s leading, we must experience a great deal of judgment. Whatever is of the flesh, the self, the old man, and the world must be judged so that we may know God&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<p>The breastplate functions as a heavenly, divine, and spiritual typewriter. Of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, eighteen were contained in the names of the twelve tribes inscribed on the twelve precious stones set on the breastplate. The remaining four letters were contained in the Thummim attached to the breastplate. Therefore, the breastplate contained all the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. In addition, the Urim was inserted underneath the twelve precious stones. In Hebrew the word <em>Urim</em> means &ldquo;lights, illuminators.&rdquo; The Urim had twelve illuminators, one to illuminate each piece of stone on the breastplate. Then the transparent precious stones could shine with light. When the Urim and the Thummim were added to the breastplate, they caused it to become the breastplate of judgment (v. 30). Through the breastplate with the Urim and the Thummim, the Lord&rsquo;s leading could be obtained, and by the composition of a word or a sentence, the Lord&rsquo;s leading was made known.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the breastplate typifies the church, and on the other hand, it makes known God&rsquo;s leading. This indicates that today God reveals what we should do through the church, by the church, and with the church. If we do not know the church, we do not know the Lord&rsquo;s leading. Actually, God&rsquo;s leading and the church are one.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE ROBE</h2>
<p>The robe is called the robe of the ephod because it was mainly for the ephod. Since the ephod denotes Christ with the church, the robe is for Christ with the church. In Isaiah 6:1 we see the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lofty, and His train filled the temple. The word <em>train</em> refers to the skirt of the Lord&rsquo;s long robe. The Lord is so full that His skirt fills the temple, His dwelling place. This long robe signifies the expression of Christ&rsquo;s virtues (cf. John 12:41). The Lord&rsquo;s fullness is shown in all His virtues. In Revelation 1:13 the Lord Jesus has a garment reaching to the feet. This is a sign that the Lord&rsquo;s virtues are so extensive that they become His fullness. Hence, the long robe signifies the individual and corporate Christ as God&rsquo;s full expression. In this expression we have Christ and also the church joined to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Its Color Being All of Blue</h2>
<p>According to Exodus 28:31 the robe of the ephod was all of blue. This indicates that the church is completely heavenly. In nature and position the church is not earthly but heavenly. John 3:7 indicates that we have been born from above. Therefore, even though we are on earth, we have been born from above, from heaven, and have a heavenly life with a heavenly nature.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Its Opening Being Like<br />
the Opening of a Coat of Mail</h2>
<p>Exodus 28:32 says, &ldquo;There shall be an opening for the head in its center; around its opening there shall be a binding edge of woven work, like the opening of a coat of mail, so that it will not be torn.&rdquo; This verse indicates that the opening with a border was like the opening of a coat of mail. This signifies power for fighting. Our robe is a priestly garment, but its opening is like a coat of mail. This indicates that while we are serving as priests, we are also fighting as warriors. Our ministering is a fighting.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Pomegranates and Bells</h2>
<p>Exodus 28:33-34 says, &ldquo;You shall make on its hem pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet strands, all around its hem, and bells of gold between them all around: a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, on the hem of the robe all around.&rdquo; Verse 33 speaks of pomegranates and bells, and verse 34 of &ldquo;a golden bell and a pomegranate.&rdquo; As the garment was being made, the pomegranates came before the bells, but in function, the bells come before the pomegranates.</p>
<p>Since the skirt of the robe is a sign of fullness, and the fullness of Christ is the church, the pomegranates and bells on the hem must be related to the church. The pomegranates were made of linen, signifying humanity, and the bells were made of gold, signifying divinity. A ripe pomegranate with its seeds signifies the fullness of life. The church should be full of life in its humanity. This is the significance of pomegranates made of linen. Bells sound out warnings, and the golden bells signify that the speaking of the church must come out of divinity. The fullness of life is expressed in the church&rsquo;s humanity, but the voice of warning is expressed in the church&rsquo;s divinity.</p>
<p>The pomegranates and the bells were placed alternately. This indicates that the divine voice is closely related to the divine life. If we grow in life and eventually blossom in life, we will become pomegranates. Then we will give forth a divine sound so that others may be warned and regulated. In the church there is the beauty of life expressed in our humanity and the divine sounding from golden bells. These are signs of the proper church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The ephod and robe worn by Aaron, the high priest, typify Christ in His expression of God&rsquo;s glory and beauty in all that He did and in His care for the redeemed saints, the constituents of His glorious church.</p>
<p>As a part of the garments of the high priest, the ephod was used for fastening, girding, securing, or connecting. It was made primarily by gold thread woven together with fine linen and by blue, purple, and scarlet strands woven into fine linen. This shows Christ and His divine glory woven into His human beauty, and it also shows that His human life on earth expressed His heavenliness, kingliness, and redemption so that He has the power to hold us and the strength to fasten us to Himself. Two onyx stones were put on the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, and the names of the twelve sons of Israel were engraved on the stones. The breastplate was worn on the breast, and on the breastplate were twelve precious stones signifying the redeemed people of God built together to become one entity, which is the church. This signifies that Christ as God&rsquo;s High Priest has the strength to bear God&rsquo;s redeemed people before God and that He does not bear each one individualistically; rather, He bears one entity, the church, which is His Body. The breastplate is called the breastplate of judgment; as a heavenly, divine, and spiritual typewriter, it makes known God&rsquo;s leading, word by word and sentence by sentence.</p>
<p>The robe is called the robe of the ephod because it was mainly for the ephod. Since the ephod denotes Christ with the church, the robe is for Christ with the church, and it signifies the individual and corporate Christ as God&rsquo;s full expression. The color of the robe was all of blue, indicating that the church is completely heavenly. Its opening being like the opening of a coat of mail signifies power for fighting, and indicates that we are priests and warriors; our ministering is a fighting. Furthermore, on the hem of the robe all around were pomegranates and bells. This signifies that the church should be full of life in its humanity and that the speaking of the church must come out of its divinity. The fullness of life is expressed in the church&rsquo;s humanity, but the voice of warning is expressed in the church&rsquo;s divinity.</p>

</ol>
<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Leviticus 11 uses the matter of eating to signify the contacting of people by God&rsquo;s people, that is, whom they may contact and whom they may not contact (Acts 10:11-16). Those whom they may contact are clean; those whom they may not contact are unclean. If we, as God&rsquo;s people, intend to live a holy life as required by our holy God, we need to be careful about our contact with people. The animals, both clean and unclean, are divided into five categories: first, beasts, including cattle; second, aquatic animals, animals in the water; third, birds, animals in the air; fourth, insects; and fifth, creeping things. All the creeping things are unclean, but in the other four categories some animals are clean, and others are unclean. Let us consider the four categories of living creatures that are clean with respect to diet, signifying persons whom we may contact.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. BEASTS THAT DIVIDE THE HOOF<br />
AND CHEW THE CUD</h2>
<p>Beasts that divide the hoof and chew the cud are clean for eating (Lev. 11:2-3). This signifies that we may contact persons who have discernment in their activities and who receive the word of God with much reconsideration. A divided hoof signifies discernment, having the power, the strength, to discern the things that are of God and the things that are of Satan, the things that are heavenly and the things that are earthly, the things that are spiritual and the things that are fleshly. Chewing the cud signifies receiving the word of God with much consideration and reconsideration, like a cow chewing its cud. By reconsidering what we receive from God&rsquo;s word, we receive nourishment.</p>
<p>We need to have a walk that is full of discernment, and we also need to chew the cud, eating the word of God by chewing it again and again. We should not contact those who do not have divided hooves and do not chew the cud. We need to avoid such people, lest they affect and influence us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. AQUATIC ANIMALS THAT HAVE FINS AND SCALES</h2>
<p>Aquatic animals that have fins and scales (v. 9) signify persons who can move and act freely in the world but resist its influence. Fins help fish move in water according to their wishes. Fish can even swim against the current because they have fins. Scales protect the fish and keep the fish that live in salt water from being salted. Fins strengthen the fish to move, and scales protect them from being salted.</p>
<p>In the Bible the sea signifies the fallen, corrupted world. People who live in the sea of the world should have fins and scales in order to act freely in the world and resist its influence. On the one hand, we should have fins and scales. On the other hand, we should be careful in contacting those who do not have fins and scales so that we will not be influenced by the corrupted world.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. BIRDS THAT HAVE WINGS FOR FLYING<br />
AND THAT EAT SEEDS OF LIFE<br />
AS THEIR FOOD SUPPLY</h2>
<p>Birds that have wings for flying and that eat seeds of life as their food supply (cf. vv. 13-19) signify persons who can live and move in a life that is away from and above the world and who take the things of life as their supply of life. Clean birds have wings for flying, enabling them to fly away from and above the world. Clean birds also eat seeds of life as their food supply. The unclean birds in verses 13 through 19, however, do not feed on seeds but on carcasses.</p>
<p>Christians should be like birds that have wings and that feed on the seeds of life. We should live and move in a life that is away from and above the world, and we should take the things of life as our supply. When we contact others, even other believers, we need to discern whether they are clean birds that feed on seeds or unclean birds that like to live on the things of death. If we have contact with unclean birds, we will be influenced by their taste and become an unclean bird. For this reason, we must be careful in contacting those who feed on the things of death.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. INSECTS THAT HAVE WINGS AND LEGS ABOVE THEIR FEET FOR LEAPING ON THE EARTH</h2>
<p>Insects that have wings and legs above their feet for leaping on the earth (vv. 21-22) signify persons who can live and move in a life that is above the world and who can keep themselves from the world. Having wings enables us to fly away from anything worldly, sinful, or fleshly and to soar above the world. Having legs above the feet enables us to jump up and leave the world at any time. Believers in the Lord should be those who can jump and fly, unfettered by the world and unentangled by the earth. Only this kind of person should be the object of our contact.</p>
<p>In order to live a holy life, we need to consider the kind of people we contact. Contacting people is like eating. When we eat, we take in something that is outside of us. This can affect us within by being digested to become our constituent, that is, our being, our constitution. Similarly, our contact with certain kinds of people can cause us to be reconstituted and make us a different kind of person. We will receive what we contact, and what we receive will reconstitute us, making us different in constitution with a different expression of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. CONCLUSION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Christ Being the Reality of Cleanness</h2>
<p>Of the various kinds of people signified by the different categories of animals which are clean for eating, only Christ matches these conditions, such as dividing the hoof and chewing the cud, having fins and scales, having wings for flying and eating seeds of life as the food supply, and having wings and legs above the feet for leaping on the earth. Only Christ can match these conditions. Christ is the real cleanness. He is the reality of cleanness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Only Christ and<br />
All That Is out of Christ<br />
Being Clean for Our Food Supply</h2>
<p>Only Christ and all that is out of Christ, those who have been transformed by the life of Christ, are clean for our food supply. This is what God&rsquo;s people should contact. Nothing else should be contacted by us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. In Terms of Typology</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Christ Dividing the Hoof and Chewing the Cud</h2>
<p>Christ divides the hoof and chews the cud (v. 3). When Christ walked on earth, His hooves were fully divided, and He chewed the cud. He was full of discernment, and He received the word of God with much reconsideration.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Christ Having Fins and Scales</h2>
<p>Christ has fins (v. 9). When He was on earth, He could move freely without being caught by worldly things. Christ also has scales (v. 9); He withstood the influence of the corrupted world.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Christ Having Legs above the Feet<br />
and Leaping on the Earth</h2>
<p>Christ has legs above the feet and leaps on the earth (v. 21). When He was on earth, He lived and moved in a life that was above the world, and He kept Himself from the world.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Christ Being the Supply<br />
in Our Daily Life in Every Aspect</h2>
<p>Even a chapter such as Leviticus 11 is full of Christ. He is the supply in our daily life in every aspect. As the reality of all the positive things in the universe (Col. 2:17), He is all the clean living creatures. All the clean living creatures that walk on the earth, live in the water, and fly in the air are types of Christ. Christ is the One who can soar in the air and live in salt water. As long as we have Christ, we have the proper thing to contact, to eat, and to digest. In every way, He is our life supply. He is our cleanness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Only Christ Being Able<br />
to Keep Us Holy, As God Is Holy</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I am Jehovah your God. Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy...I am Jehovah, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt to be your God; you shall therefore be holy, for I am holy&rdquo; (Lev. 11:44-45). Only Christ is able to keep us holy, as God is holy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The animals that are clean for eating signify the persons whom God&rsquo;s people may contact; the animals that are unclean and not for eating signify those whom God&rsquo;s people should not contact. We may contact those who are clean, and we should not contact those who are unclean. The animals that are good for eating, signifying the persons whom God&rsquo;s people may contact, are divided into four categories. First, beasts that divide the hoof and chew the cud signify persons who have discernment in their activities and who receive the word of God with much reconsideration. Aquatic animals that have fins and scales signify persons who can move and act freely in the world but resist its influence. Birds that have wings for flying and that eat seeds of life as their food supply signify persons who can live and move in a life that is away from and above the world and who take things of life as their supply of life. Fourth, insects having wings and legs above their feet for leaping on the earth signify persons who can live and move in a life that is above the world and who can keep themselves from the world.</p>
<p>Based on the significance of the different categories of animals that are clean for eating, only Christ matches the conditions. Christ is the real cleanness. He is the reality of cleanness. Therefore, only Christ and all that is out of Christ, all those who have been transformed by the life of Christ, are those whom we may contact. We should receive Christ as the supply in our daily life in every aspect. When we eat Him, He becomes our constitution. Then He is able to keep us holy, as God is holy.</p>

</ol><h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Leviticus 11 covers what is clean and unclean in the contact of God&rsquo;s elect with people. Chapters 12 through 15 then cover man&rsquo;s uncleanness in various aspects and man&rsquo;s filthiness in different conditions, including the uncleanness of mankind in birth, leprosy, and discharges.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. HUMAN BIRTH</h2>
<p>Leviticus 12 shows that the very source of man is unclean. Chapter 11 tells us to be careful in contacting certain kinds of persons lest we be defiled, but chapter 12 indicates that our birth is unclean. Our uncleanness is from birth. The source of our birth is uncleanness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Woman&rsquo;s Relationship to Human Birth</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Woman Representing All Mankind</h2>
<p>In figure, woman represents all mankind. In God&rsquo;s economy, in His divine dispensation and divine arrangement, all mankind is female. Whereas woman represents all mankind, man represents God and Christ. Christ is the unique male, and all those who are married to Him are females. Hence, the uncleanness within the woman signifies the uncleanness within all mankind. Everyone is unclean, male and female alike.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Human Birth<br />
Coming out of the Woman Being Unclean</h2>
<p>The uncleanness of the human birth coming out of the woman signifies that the source of all mankind is unclean. Moreover, this uncleanness comes from within mankind. Since the source is unclean, whatever is born of the source is also unclean. We do not become unclean simply by contacting something unclean; we are unclean by birth. We were unclean even when we were in our mother&rsquo;s womb. We were born in uncleanness and live in uncleanness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Uncleanness of the Male&rsquo;s Birth</h2>
<p>The male signifies the strong ones in mankind. The uncleanness of the male&rsquo;s birth is for seven days, but the uncleanness of the female&rsquo;s birth is for fourteen days (vv. 2, 5a). The extent of the male&rsquo;s uncleanness is less than that of the female, signifying that the uncleanness of the strong ones among mankind is less than that of the weak ones.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Uncleanness of the Female&rsquo;s Birth</h2>
<p>The female, being weaker than the male by birth, is doubly unclean in her weakness, as signified by the fourteen days. Hence, the extent of the female&rsquo;s uncleanness is greater than that of the male.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Way for Man to Be Cleansed<br />
from Human Uncleanness</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Circumcised</h2>
<p>On the eighth day after birth, the male was to be circumcised (v. 3). This signifies that the flesh of the unclean person should be put aside through the death of Christ so that he might be brought into the resurrection of Christ, not only to be cleansed but also to have a new beginning of life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Cutting Off of Man&rsquo;s Natural Being</h2>
<p>To be circumcised is to cut off our natural being, the source of our uncleanness. Actually, our entire being should be circumcised, that is, put to death. This was accomplished by Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, and it is applied, executed, and carried out by the powerful Spirit (Col. 2:11 and footnotes, Recovery Version).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Carried Out on the Eighth Day</h2>
<p>Circumcision was carried out on the eighth day. The eighth day is a new start, the start of a new week. In the Bible the eighth day refers to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Death ends the old course, and resurrection begins a new course. In the resurrection of Christ we experience the circumcision which He accomplished on the cross, and we are regenerated so that we may not only be cleansed but also have a new beginning of a new life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Offering Christ As the Burnt Offering<br />
and the Sin Offering</h2>
<p>After the completion of the test for uncleanness, a burnt offering and a sin offering needed to be offered (Lev. 12:6-8). This signifies that after our uncleanness by birth is fully dealt with, we need Christ to be our burnt offering, related to not being for God, and our sin offering, related to sin (Heb. 10:5-7).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Burnt Offering</h2>
<p>The burnt offering is a type of Christ living for God on our behalf to satisfy God&rsquo;s heart. Christ was absolute for God. As the burnt offering, He takes our place; He replaces us. Now we take Him as our burnt offering. In Him we are one with Him, and we also become a burnt offering to God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Sin Offering</h2>
<p>The sin offering is a type of Christ redeeming us from our sin of not living for God. We are not absolute for God, and we are sinful in the eyes of God. Thus, we need Christ not only as our burnt offering but also as our sin offering.</p><h2 class="head1">II. LEPROSY</h2>
<p>Human uncleanness issues from birth and is intensified by sin, which is signified by leprosy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Origin of Leprosy</h2>
<p>According to the Old Testament, leprosy is the outcome of man&rsquo;s rebellion against God&rsquo;s authority, God&rsquo;s deputy authority, God&rsquo;s regulation, and God&rsquo;s economy. This is confirmed by several cases in the Bible, such as Miriam&rsquo;s rebellion against Moses, who was God&rsquo;s deputy authority (Num. 12:1-10); the rebellion of Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, against Elisha&rsquo;s practices (2 Kings 5:20-27); and King Uzziah&rsquo;s rebellion against God&rsquo;s regulation concerning the priesthood (2 Chron. 26:16-21).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Nature of Leprosy</h2>
<p>Although leprosy originates from outside a person&rsquo;s body with some kind of germs or bacteria, it is caused by these germs or bacteria entering into a person&rsquo;s body and being mingled with his constitution, thus becoming a disease that comes from within his body, as illustrated by the cases of Miriam, Gehazi, and Uzziah. Miriam became leprous after she rebelled against Moses because he married a Cushite woman. Gehazi went behind Elisha&rsquo;s back and received gifts from Naaman, a Gentile who was healed of leprosy; afterward, Naaman&rsquo;s leprosy was transferred to him. Uzziah, as king, could not participate in the priesthood. When he rebelled against this regulation, he became leprous. In these three cases, leprosy first entered into the rebellious ones and then came forth from them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Result of Leprosy</h2>
<p>Leprosy is a disease that is not easily cured and often results in death because it is mingled with man&rsquo;s constitution.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Leprosy Signifying the Sin<br />
That Dwells in Man</h2>
<p>Leprosy signifies the sin that dwells and does evil in man. The denotation of sin in the biblical sense is rebellion. Rebellion was invented, inaugurated, by Satan. Through the fall of Adam the very leprosy invented by Satan entered into us. &ldquo;Through one man sin entered into the world&rdquo; (Rom. 5:12a). This leprosy still remains in us. This is the reason Paul says, &ldquo;If what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me&rdquo; (7:20). Having entered into us, this sin, this leprosy, comes forth from within us as sins, offenses, and transgressions. Although sin comes from Satan, who is outside of man, it entered into man&rsquo;s flesh and became mingled with man&rsquo;s fallen nature. Hence, it is not easy to be cleared away; rather, it kills man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Leper</h2>
<p>Leviticus 13:45-46 speaks of a leper&rsquo;s open confession of his leprosy to others. This indicates that a sinner should make an open confession of his sin.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Tearing His Clothes,<br />
Having His Hair Let Loose,<br />
and Covering His Upper Lip and<br />
Crying &ldquo;Unclean, Unclean!&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Verse 45 says, &ldquo;As for the leper in whom the infection is, his clothes shall be torn, and the hair of his head shall be let loose, and he shall cover his upper lip and cry, Unclean, unclean!&rdquo; Here we are shown several aspects of the leper&rsquo;s confession of his leprosy.</p>
<p>The tearing of clothes signifies that a sinner admits that he is bankrupt in morality; having his hair let loose signifies that he is utterly lacking in subjection to authority, being unruly and reckless; covering his upper lip indicates that whatever issues out of a sinner is filthy and contagious and that he should not be contacted; a sinner&rsquo;s crying &ldquo;Unclean, unclean!&rdquo; indicates self-condemnation without ceasing.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Dwelling Alone outside the Camp</h2>
<p>Verse 46 says, &ldquo;He shall be unclean all the days during which the infection is in him; he is unclean. He shall live alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp.&rdquo; Dwelling alone outside the camp signifies that, until he clears up his sinfulness, the one who has sinned should stay outside the church and be isolated from the fellowship among God&rsquo;s people (1 Cor. 5:13).</p><h2 class="head1">III. DISCHARGES</h2>
<p>Leviticus 15 shows that we have a problem of discharges. These discharges are altogether unclean. Furthermore, the uncleanness that issues from us is contagious and causes others to be unclean.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. All Discharges from the Human Body<br />
Being Unclean</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, our body is our embodiment. Our body is our being, our constitution. Whatever comes out of our body, out of our constitution, as a discharge, is unclean and contagious.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Way for Cleansing a Person<br />
Who Has a Discharge</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Washing the Clothes and<br />
Bathing the Body in Running Water</h2>
<p>&ldquo;When one who has the discharge is cleansed of his discharge, then he shall count seven days for himself for his cleansing; then he shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in running water, and he shall be clean&rdquo; (v. 13). This signifies that we need to deal repeatedly with our outward living and behavior and with our natural life until our natural life is fully terminated. In addition, we need the washing of the Spirit as the water of life in the word of God for us to be cleansed.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Offering a Sin Offering and a Burnt Offering<br />
on the Eighth Day</h2>
<p>&ldquo;On the eighth day he shall take for himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons and come before Jehovah at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and give them to the priest. And the priest shall offer them, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make expiation for him before Jehovah for his discharge&rdquo; (vv. 14-15). Here Christ is typified by the two turtledoves or two young pigeons. One of these birds is a sin offering, and the other is a burnt offering. The function of Christ as the sin offering is to deal with our sinful nature. The function of Christ as the burnt offering is to be our life so that we may live a life that is absolute for God. Only Christ can meet our need in these two aspects. When we have Christ as our sin offering and as our burnt offering, the problem of our discharges is solved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The Bible uses human birth, leprosy, and discharges to speak concerning man&rsquo;s uncleanness in various aspects and man&rsquo;s filthiness in different conditions. The uncleanness of the human birth coming out of the woman signifies that the source of all mankind is unclean.</p>
<p>Moreover, this uncleanness comes from within mankind. We are unclean by birth. We were unclean even when we were in our mother&rsquo;s womb. We were born in uncleanness and live in uncleanness. The way for us to be cleansed from human uncleanness is by being circumcised. This means that our flesh must be put aside through the death of Christ so that we may be brought into the resurrection of Christ, not only to be cleansed but also to have a new beginning of life. Furthermore, we need to offer Christ as a burnt offering and a sin offering to redeem us from our sin of not living for God and to be one with Him that we may become a burnt offering offered to God.</p>
<p>Our uncleanness not only issues from birth, but it is also intensified by sin, which is signified by leprosy. Leprosy is the outcome of man&rsquo;s rebellion against God&rsquo;s authority, God&rsquo;s deputy authority, God&rsquo;s regulation, and God&rsquo;s economy. Hence, leprosy signifies the sin that dwells and does evil in man. The denotation of sin in the biblical sense is rebellion. This rebellion was invented, inaugurated, by Satan. Through the fall of Adam the very leprosy invented by Satan entered into us and remains in us all the time. Having entered into us, this sin, this leprosy, was mingled with our fallen nature as one. Hence, it is not easy to be cleared away; rather, it kills man. A leper has to openly confess his leprosy, indicating that a sinner must make an open confession of his sin. Furthermore, he has to dwell alone outside the camp, signifying that, until he clears up his sinfulness, the one who has sinned should stay outside the church and be isolated from the fellowship among God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have a problem of discharges. These discharges are altogether unclean. Moreover, the uncleanness that issues from us is contagious and causes others to be unclean. The way for one who has a discharge to be cleansed is to wash his clothes and bathe his body in running water. This signifies that we need to deal repeatedly with our outward living and behavior and with our natural life until our natural life is fully terminated. In addition, we need the washing of the Spirit as the water of life in the word of God for us to be cleansed. We also need to experience Christ as the sin offering and the burnt offering to deal with our sinful nature and to be our life so that we may live a life that is absolute for God. In this way the problem of our discharges is solved.</p>

</ol><h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>The preceding lesson covers different kinds of uncleanness, of which the worst is the leprosy in man. This lesson covers the way for a leper, a leprous garment, and a leprous house to be cleansed before God. This cleansing shows the all-inclusive salvation God has prepared and accomplished for us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE CLEANSING OF THE LEPER</h2>
<p>The cleansing of the leper typifies that a person invaded by sin is cleansed entirely through the redemption accomplished through Christ&rsquo;s death and the salvation carried out by His resurrection. The cleansing of the leper also typifies a person&rsquo;s thorough dealing with what he does and what he is according to the redemption through Christ&rsquo;s death and the salvation by His resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Leper Being Brought to the Priest</h2>
<p>&ldquo;This shall be the law of the leper on the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought to the priest&rdquo; (Lev. 14:2). This signifies an unclean person being brought to the Lord. Preaching the gospel is actually bringing unclean persons, sinners, to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Priest Going outside the Camp<br />
to Examine the Leper</h2>
<p>The priest going outside the camp to examine the leper (v. 3) signifies the Lord Jesus leaving His original place and humbling Himself to be near to the sinner. The Lord came from the heavens to the earth in order to be near to us, the sinners. This is portrayed in Matthew 8:1-4. The leper should have been isolated, excluded, from the people of God. Nevertheless, having sympathy in love for the leper, the Lord Jesus came near to him and touched him in order that he might be cleansed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Leper Who Was to Be Healed<br />
Needing to Seek Cleansing before God</h2>
<p>In Leviticus 14:4-9 we see that the leper who was to be cleansed needed to seek cleansing before God. This signifies that we, who are sick of the sin of leprosy, still need to have our shortcomings and defilement dealt with before God, even though we have been healed by life, so that we might be cleansed. Cleansing from leprosy requires not only action on God&rsquo;s side but also coordination on our side. This means that we need to seek for cleansing. Our seeking is our cooperation with God&rsquo;s grace and love. Let us consider the items included in the process of cleansing.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. With Two Living Clean Birds</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The priest shall command that two living clean birds and cedar wood and scarlet strands and hyssop be taken for the one who is to be cleansed&rdquo; (v. 4). These two living clean birds signify that Christ is clean and without any defilement, that He came from the heavens, belongs to the heavens, and transcends the earth, and that He is living and full of life. The two birds signify that Christ died for us so that our filthiness might be taken away and rose for us so that we might be delivered from our weakness by the power and strength of life. Hence, these two birds signify Christ in crucifixion and Christ in resurrection. We need the crucified and resurrected Christ in order to be cleansed.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. With Cedar Wood and Hyssop</h2>
<p>Cedar wood in verse 4 signifies the honorable and uplifted humanity of the Lord (cf. 1 Kings 4:33), which enables Him to be our Savior. Hyssop in verse 4, which is among the smallest of plants, signifies that the Lord was willing to be lowly, becoming in the likeness of men, so that He might be near to man and become man&rsquo;s Savior. On the one hand, the Lord has the highest standard of humanity, as typified by cedar wood; on the other hand, He was willing to become lowly so that He might be available to us, as typified by hyssop.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. With Scarlet Strands</h2>
<p>Scarlet strands in Leviticus 14:4 signifies that the Lord lowered Himself to become a man that He might do the will of God and shed His blood on the cross for our redemption, thus becoming the honorable and high King. The color scarlet signifies the shedding of blood, and it also implies kingship. Christ was slain, crucified, for redemption, and He became the King through the accomplishment of redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. In an Earthen Vessel in Which One Bird<br />
Was to Be Slaughtered over Running Water</h2>
<p>Verse 5 says, &ldquo;The priest shall command that one of the birds be slaughtered in an earthen vessel over running water.&rdquo; The Hebrew expression for <em>running water</em> literally means &ldquo;living water,&rdquo; signifying the eternal, living Spirit of God. The earthen vessel signifies the Lord&rsquo;s humanity. The slaughter of a bird over running water in an earthen vessel signifies that through death in the flesh the Lord offered Himself to God through the eternal and living Spirit. Hebrews 9:14 is the fulfillment of this type. This verse says that through the eternal Spirit Christ offered Himself without blemish to God. When He was dying on the cross, He offered Himself to God through the living water&mdash;the eternal, living Spirit of God&mdash;that filled Him. Christ was not alone when He was on the cross; the eternal Spirit was in Him and with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Other Bird, the Cedar Wood,<br />
the Scarlet Strands, and the Hyssop<br />
Being Dipped in the Blood of the Killed Bird That It Might Be Sprinkled Seven Times on the Leper Who Was to Be Cleansed, and the Living Bird Being Allowed to Go Free over an Open Field</h2>
<p>In Leviticus 14:6 four things&mdash;the other bird, the cedar wood, the scarlet strands, and the hyssop&mdash;were dipped in the blood of the killed bird. The Lord&rsquo;s redemption, His honorable, uplifted, and yet lowly humanity, and His resurrection, ascension, and glorification are all implied in this type. The cedar wood typifies Christ&rsquo;s honorable and uplifted humanity, and the hyssop, His lowly humanity. The slain bird signifies His redemption, and the other bird, His resurrection. Letting the living bird go into the open field to fly and soar in the air signifies Christ&rsquo;s ascension. The Lord&rsquo;s glorification is signified by the scarlet strands, which imply kingship. Christ is glorified in His kingship. Christ was humbled in His incarnation, shamed in His crucifixion, and glorified in His kingship. Therefore, in this one type we see that the Lord&rsquo;s perfect redemption not only causes man to be cleansed objectively in his position, but also causes man to experience subjectively, in the Holy Spirit, the Lord&rsquo;s suffering in the shedding of His blood in His honorable, uplifted, and yet lowly humanity and to experience His death, resurrection, ascension, and glorification.</p>
<p>These items have all been accomplished for us by Christ, and we need to experience and enjoy them in order to be cleansed. We have died in the crucified Christ, the killed bird. We are soaring in ascension in the resurrected Christ, the living bird, and we have been completely freed in Christ to overcome and transcend everything.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Washing His Clothes, Shaving Off All His Hair,<br />
and Bathing Himself in Water</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The one who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes and shave off all his hair and bathe in water, and he shall be clean&rdquo; (v. 8a). This signifies that, on the one hand, a sinner who is to be cleansed needs to experience Christ&rsquo;s death, resurrection, and ascension, and on the other hand, he needs to bear the responsibility to deal with and cut off all that is of his old living and natural life.</p>
<p>The hair of the head signifies man&rsquo;s glory, an area in which one boasts, glorifies himself, and makes a display before others. The beard signifies man&rsquo;s self-assumed honor, which causes people to have a feeling that they are superior to others. The eyebrows, the beauty of the human face, signify man&rsquo;s excellencies, merits, and virtues. All the hair of the body signifies man&rsquo;s strength and ability. Bathing oneself in water, which is to have our entire being buried in water, signifies dealing with one&rsquo;s entire being. These five items together equal ridding the self of all its glory, honor, excellencies, merits, virtues, strength, and ability, having our entire being washed, buried, and terminated in deep water.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. Dwelling outside His Tent Seven Days</h2>
<p>&ldquo;After that he may come into the camp, but he shall dwell outside his tent seven days&rdquo; (v. 8b). This signifies that a sinner who is to be cleansed cannot easily recover the fellowship with the brothers; he needs to be watchful, to wait, and to be dealt with further. This shows that dealing with our sin, our leprosy, our rebellion, which comes from Satan, is a serious matter with God. Because sin is so serious, we should not deal with it in a loose, light, or careless way.</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. On the Seventh Day Shaving Off<br />
All the Hair from His Whole Body,<br />
Washing His Clothes,<br />
and Bathing His Flesh in Water</h2>
<p>Verse 9 shows that after watching and waiting for seven days, the leper who was to be cleansed had to shave his entire body once more, wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh. This signifies that a sinner who is to be cleansed needs to bear responsibility for dealing with every part of his natural life and daily walk, indicating that God wants us to deal with our sin and our sinful self in a serious way. If we deal with ourselves definitely, thoroughly, and absolutely, we shall be cleansed.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Leper Who Was to Be Cleansed<br />
Needing to Solve the Problem<br />
of His Sin and Sins before God</h2>
<p>In the matter of the cleansing of the leper, Christ is revealed not only as the two birds, the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet strands but also as four kinds of offerings: the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, and the meal offering (vv. 10-32). The offerings were presented before God on the eighth day (vv. 10-11), signifying that man is freed in Christ in resurrection from the flesh of the old creation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Offering One of the Male Lambs<br />
for a Trespass Offering, with the Log of Oil,<br />
Both of Which Were Waved<br />
for a Wave Offering before Jehovah</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The priest shall take one of the male lambs and present it as a trespass offering and the log of oil, and wave them as a wave offering before Jehovah&rdquo; (v. 12). Here the Hebrew term for <em>log</em> denotes a certain quantity (a pint) of oil, which signifies the Holy Spirit. A wave offering is an offering of resurrection and in resurrection. Therefore, this signifies that the death of the Lord Jesus as the trespass offering deals with our sins, and His resurrection in the Holy Spirit frees us from our trespasses so that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness (1 Pet. 2:24).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Male Lamb as the Trespass Offering<br />
to Be Slaughtered in the Place of the Sanctuary<br />
Where the Sin Offering and<br />
the Burnt Offering Were Slaughtered</h2>
<p>&ldquo;He shall slaughter the male lamb in the place where they slaughter the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the sanctuary&rdquo; (Lev. 14:13a). This indicates that Christ&rsquo;s being the sin offering and the burnt offering is the base for Him to be the trespass offering.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Blood of the Trespass Offering<br />
to Be Put on the Lobe of the Right Ear<br />
of Him Who Was to Be Cleansed,<br />
on the Thumb of His Right Hand,<br />
and on the Big Toe of His Right Foot</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one who is to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot&rdquo; (v. 14). This signifies that man has trespasses because his ears are wrong in not listening to God, his hands are wrong in not doing the things of God, and his feet are wrong in not taking the ways of God. Therefore, he needs to be cleansed with the blood of the Lord Jesus as his trespass offering.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Some of the Oil to Be Poured<br />
into the Palm of the Priest&rsquo;s Left Hand<br />
and Sprinkled with His Right Finger<br />
Seven Times before Jehovah</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The priest shall take some of the log of oil and pour it into the palm of the priest&rsquo;s left hand, and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in the palm of his left hand and sprinkle some of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah&rdquo; (vv. 15-16). This signifies that the Spirit of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection has laid a perfect foundation before God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Some of the Rest of the Oil<br />
to Be Put on the Lobe of the Right Ear<br />
of the One Who Was to Be Cleansed,<br />
on the Thumb of His Right Hand,<br />
and on the Big Toe of the Right Foot,<br />
upon the Blood of the Trespass Offering</h2>
<p>&ldquo;From the rest of the oil that is in the palm of his hand the priest shall put some on the lobe of the right ear of the one who is to be cleansed and some on the thumb of his right hand and some on the big toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering&rdquo; (v. 17). This signifies that man can solve the problem of his trespasses only by listening to the word of God, doing the things of God, and taking the ways of God in the Spirit of resurrection, based on the redemption by the blood of the Lord Jesus as our trespass offering.</p>
<p>Here we have two layers: the layer of the blood and the layer of the oil. The blood signifies Christ&rsquo;s redeeming blood, and the oil signifies the Spirit of resurrection. First, the blood is applied to the lobe of the right ear, to the thumb of the right hand, and to the big toe of the right foot. This is for the washing away of our trespasses and wrongdoings. Following this, the oil is applied to the places where the blood is applied. This indicates that, based upon the redemption of Christ, the Spirit comes to help us to listen to God&rsquo;s word, to do the things of God, and to take the ways of God. This will keep us from any kind of trespass.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. The Rest of the Oil in the Priest&rsquo;s Palm<br />
to Be Put on the Head<br />
of Him Who Was to Be Cleansed</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The rest of the oil that is in the palm of the priest&rsquo;s hand he shall put on the head of the one who is to be cleansed. Then the priest shall make expiation for him before Jehovah&rdquo; (v. 18). Putting oil on the head signifies that the authority of the headship, the thoughts of the mind, and the control of the entire being of the sinner who is to be cleansed are dealt with in the cleansing Spirit of resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. The Sin Offering to Be Offered <em>to Make Expiation for Him Who Was to Be Cleansed<br />
Because of His Uncleanness</em></h2>
<p>&ldquo;The priest shall offer the sin offering and make expiation for the one who is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness&rdquo; (v. 19a). This signifies that the Lord Jesus was offered as our sin offering to deal with our uncleanness at the root (the sinful nature) of our sins, which are dealt with by the Lord Jesus as the trespass offering.</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. The Burnt Offering to Be Offered<br />
with the Meal Offering</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Afterward he shall slaughter the burnt offering. And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meal offering on the altar. Thus the priest shall make expiation for him, and he shall be clean&rdquo; (vv. 19b-20). This signifies that the sinner who is to be cleansed, after being cleansed from the uncleanness of sin and sins through Christ as his sin offering and trespass offering, offers himself in Christ as the burnt offering to God and lives and walks absolutely for God by the life of Christ as the meal offering. Thus the sinner who is to be cleansed is fully cleansed from his uncleanness. The leper has now been healed, cleansed, and expiated.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE CLEANSING OF THE LEPROUS GARMENT</h2>
<p>Garments are for covering the human body. In the Bible our garments signify our outward conduct, our daily living. Leprosy in a garment (13:47-59) signifies the sins expressed in one&rsquo;s outward living and conduct.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. If the Infection<br />
Was Spreading in the Garment,<br />
the Garment to Be Burned in Fire</h2>
<p>Leviticus 13:49-52 shows that if the greenish or reddish infection was spreading in the garment and became a malignant leprosy, the garment had to be burned in fire. Becoming a malignant leprosy signifies that the sin which is spreading within a person by eating up his flesh is becoming worse and worse. Burning the garment in fire signifies eliminating the sinful and filthy living and conduct. When we discover that something sinful in us is becoming worse and worse, we should eliminate it by &ldquo;burning,&rdquo; that is, by dealing with it strongly by applying the cross of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Washing the Garment<br />
If the Infection Had Not Spread</h2>
<p>If the infection had not spread in the garment, then the garment had to be washed (vv. 53-54). This signifies dealing with the suspected weakness in one&rsquo;s living and conduct. It may not be clear whether a certain thing is a real sin or a suspected sin. In such a case it is sufficient to wash the garment. This is to deal with a matter by applying the washing Spirit of God, who is likened to water for washing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Burning the Garment with Fire<br />
If It Was a Leprous Decay</h2>
<p>&ldquo;After the article with the infection has been washed, the priest shall look at it; and if the infection has not changed its appearance, even though the infection has not spread, it is unclean. You shall burn it in the fire; it is a leprous decay, whether the bareness is on the inside or on the outside&rdquo; (v. 55). A leprous decay signifies the corroding sin that is becoming worse and deeper, indicating that a person has no change in appearance through repentance and confession. This is the kind of sin that can take over a person, devouring and swallowing him up. Hence, this kind of sin should be &ldquo;burned&rdquo; by fire, as in the previous case of the garment with malignant leprosy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Infected Spot That Has Faded<br />
to Be Torn Out of the Garment</h2>
<p>&ldquo;If the priest looks, and if the infection has faded after it was washed, then he shall tear it out of the garment or out of the skin, whether from the warp or from the woof&rdquo; (v. 56). This signifies the eliminating of a suspected weakness in one&rsquo;s living and conduct. The fading of an infected spot in a garment after washing is a sign of healing, of recovery. Nevertheless, the faded spot should be torn out of the garment. This indicates that we need to cut off, to have a thorough dealing with, our suspected weakness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Burning the Garment after the Infected Spot<br />
Was Torn Out of the Garment and<br />
the Infection Broke Out Again in the Garment</h2>
<p>Verse 57 speaks of the infection reappearing in the garment after the infected spot has been torn out of the garment. This signifies that one&rsquo;s weakness, after being dealt with and eliminated, comes out again. Then it has to be burned in the fire. This means that it has to be dealt with and eliminated completely by applying the cross of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. After the Infection Had Departed<br />
through Washing, the Washed Garments to Be Washed a Second Time for Them to Be Clean</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The garment...which you shall wash, if the infection has departed from them, shall be washed a second time and shall be clean&rdquo; (v. 58). Washing the garment a second time after the infection has departed through washing signifies that one&rsquo;s weakness, having been dealt with, should be dealt with further, a second time.</p>
<p>The six points concerning the cleansing of the leprous garment show that we need to repent, confess, deal with certain matters, and eliminate certain matters. If we would live a normal, proper, holy Christian life, we daily need to repent, confess, deal with our actual and even suspected weaknesses, and eliminate these weaknesses from our conduct.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE CLEANSING OF THE LEPROUS HOUSE</h2>
<p>Man is always living in three layers of coverings: first, his body; second, his clothing; and third, his house. All three have the possibility of becoming leprous. For believers, our house is our home, signifying the church. Leprosy in the body typifies sin that invades our flesh, leprosy in a garment typifies the sins that invade our outward conduct, and leprosy in a house typifies the sins that invade the church life as the main part of our spiritual life. Hence, leprosy in a house is leprosy that invades the church life, that is, the sins and evils that occur in the church life.</p>
<p>Leviticus 14:49-53 covers the cleansing of the leprous house, the cleansing of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. In the Same Way as the Cleansing<br />
of Leprosy in a Man</h2>
<p>Leviticus 14:49-51 reveals that the leprosy in a house is cleansed in the same way as the cleansing of the leprosy in a man. This signifies that the whole church experiences once again the suffering, death, resurrection, ascension, and entering into glory with Christ. In order for a church to be cleansed, the church needs to experience the processes through which the Lord Jesus passed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Purging the House with<br />
the Blood of the Bird and the Living Water</h2>
<p>After the infected house has been rid of its infection, it has to be purged with the blood of the bird and the living water and then with the living bird, cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet strands (v. 52). This signifies that the whole church needs to be cleansed with the eternally efficacious blood of Christ and His eternal and living Spirit. In typology, the blood of the bird signifies the blood of Christ, water signifies the cleansing Spirit, and oil signifies the anointing Spirit. When a church becomes sick, it needs two elements in order to be recovered&mdash;the blood of Christ and the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Letting the Living Bird Go into the Open Field</h2>
<p>&ldquo;He shall let the living bird go, outside the city into the open field&rdquo; (v. 53a). This signifies that the church enters with Christ into the realm and experience of His resurrection and ascension. When an infected church is healed, surely this church will not remain on an earthly level but will rise to the heavens and soar in the heavens. Nothing will be able to hinder, restrict, restrain, or bind such a church. When the church enjoys Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension, the church is above the earth, enjoying freedom in the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The House Being Clean</h2>
<p>&ldquo;He shall make expiation for the house, and it shall be clean&rdquo; (v. 53b). The house being clean signifies that the church is fully clean to be the mutual dwelling of God and man (John 14:2).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>Chapters 13 and 14 of Leviticus cover the matter of sin in more detail than any other chapters in the Bible. These chapters show a threefold dealing with sin, not only sin in our being and in our conduct but also sin in our dwelling. A person may be unclean in his body, clothing, and house. We need to be cleansed from sin, from leprosy, in a threefold way. If we want to deal with these three kinds of leprosy, we need to repent again and again. We were born in uncleanness, and our very being is unclean. For us, it is impossible to be pure. Therefore, day by day we need to repent of our failures, confess our sins, and deal with our failures and sins, seeking even to eliminate them. In our living we need to deal with and eliminate all our sins by the cross of Christ. Then we can live a holy life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The cleansing of the leper typifies that a person invaded by sin is cleansed entirely through the redemption accomplished through Christ&rsquo;s death and the salvation carried out by His resurrection. The cleansing of the leper also typifies a person&rsquo;s thorough dealing with what he does and what he is according to the redemption through Christ&rsquo;s death and the salvation by His resurrection.</p>
<p>Leprosy in a garment signifies the sins expressed in one&rsquo;s outward living and conduct. To deal with the sins signified by leprosy, we daily need to repent, confess, and deal with any sinful thing in us that is becoming worse and worse, eliminating it by applying the cross of Christ. Furthermore, we should deal with the suspected weaknesses in our living and conduct by the cleansing Spirit of God and eliminate these weaknesses from our conduct.</p>
<p>Leprosy in a house typifies the sins that invade the church life as the main part of our spiritual life. In order for a church to be cleansed, the church needs to experience the suffering, death, resurrection, ascension, and entering into glory with Christ, that is, to experience the processes through which the Lord Jesus passed. Therefore, when an infected church is healed, the church enjoys Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension, being above the earth and enjoying freedom in the heavens. When the church is fully clean, she becomes the mutual dwelling of God and man.</p>
<p>This lesson shows a threefold dealing with sin, not only sin in our being and in our conduct but also sin in our dwelling. Hence, we need to be cleansed from sin in a threefold way. We were born in uncleanness, and our very being is unclean. Therefore, day by day we need to repent of our failures, confess our sins, and deal with and eliminate our failures and sins by the cross of Christ. Then we can live a holy life.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Leviticus 11 through 15 portray that man&rsquo;s contact with people, man&rsquo;s source, man&rsquo;s manifestation, and man&rsquo;s discharge are altogether unclean. These different aspects of human uncleanness all issue from sins. The sinful unclean man before God needs God to take away his sins. However, in the Old Testament the taking away of sins through the redemption of Christ, which God foreordained, was not yet accomplished. Hence, God set up the expiation, the covering of sins, as a symbol of the redemption which was to come. Therefore, after revealing the different aspects of human uncleanness in chapters 11 through 15, chapter 16 presents the expiation prepared by God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE MEANING OF EXPIATION</h2>
<p>In the Scriptures there is a difference between redemption and expiation. Redemption in the New Testament is the taking away of sins to fully solve the problem of sin for the sinners. This was accomplished by Christ on the cross as the Lamb of God (John 1:29); it was a redemption accomplished once for all (Heb. 9:12). Expiation in the Old Testament was not the taking away of sins but the covering of sins so that they were not seen. According to Hebrews 10:4, expiation in the Old Testament could not take away sins. If expiation had been able to take away sins, there would have been no need for the people to continually offer the sin offering year after year. The repetition of the offering was an indication that the taking away of sins for the accomplishment of redemption had not yet taken place. Therefore, it was necessary for the Lord Jesus to come to die on the cross for our redemption.</p>
<p>The lid of the Ark, which was within the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle in the Old Testament, was the place where God met with His people. Inside the Ark were the two tablets of the Testimony, the two tablets of the law, on which the Ten Commandments were written. Without the lid of the Ark, the commandments on the tablets of the law would have exposed and condemned the sins of the people who came to meet with God, making it impossible for God to meet with sinners. However, the tablets of the law that exposed and condemned the people&rsquo;s sins were covered by the lid of the Ark with the expiating blood sprinkled on it. Hence, based on the expiating blood on the lid, which pointed to the redemption which was to be accomplished by Christ, God could pass over the sins covered by the lid to meet with man (Rom. 3:25). These covered sins were not taken away; they remained until Christ came. Then they were taken away by the eternal redemption which He accomplished. Therefore, the expiating blood of the bulls and goats on this lid accomplished the covering of sins, not the actual taking away of sins; it is a type of the redemption accomplished by Christ in the New Testament (see Rom. 3:25, footnote 3, Recovery Version).</p>
<p>In the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament, the word for <em>cover,</em> as in the covering of sins, is translated &ldquo;place of propitiation.&rdquo; Actually, this is not a translation but an interpretation. It interprets the covering of sins before God as an appeasing of sins, that is, the appeasing of the problem between man and God so that God could give grace and show favor to man unhesitatingly and unquestionably (see v. 25, footnote 2, Recovery Version).</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE ACCOMPLISHING OF EXPIATION</h2>
<p>Leviticus 16:15-19 presents a picture of the accomplishing of expiation, the covering of sins. With the type of the expiation in the Old Testament age, we know how Christ accomplished the taking away of sins in the New Testament age. Let us consider the details in Leviticus 16 and their significance concerning the accomplishing of expiation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. By Slaughtering the Male Goat<br />
of the Sin Offering for the People</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Goats Signifying Sinners</h2>
<p>The first step for the accomplishing of expiation was to slaughter the goat of the sin offering for the people (v. 15a). Goats signify sinners (cf. Matt. 25:32-33, 41). We were born sinners, having a sinful nature inwardly and sinful deeds outwardly, and the wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23). Therefore, it is reserved for us to die once (Heb. 9:27). For this reason, in the accomplishing of expiation, man was required to take the goat of the sin offering as his substitute.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Goat of the Sin Offering Typifying Christ,<br />
Who Was Made in the Likeness of the Flesh of Sin,<br />
Being the Sin Offering for Sinners</h2>
<p>The slaughtered goat of the sin offering is a type of Christ, who was made in the likeness of the flesh of sin, being the sin offering for us, the sinners. &ldquo;God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh&rdquo; when Christ was crucified in the flesh on the cross (Rom. 8:3). When Christ was incarnated (John 1:14), He became one with us in the flesh. He did not know sin, but He was made sin on our behalf to be judged by God and thereby condemned sin in the flesh (2 Cor. 5:21; John 3:14). In Him, that is, in becoming one with Him in His resurrection, we have become the righteousness of God. By this righteousness we, the enemies of God, have been reconciled to God (Rom. 5:10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Bringing the Blood<br />
of the Goat inside the Veil and Sprinkling It<br />
on and before the Expiation Cover</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Sprinkling the Blood of the Goat<br />
on and before the Expiation Cover<br />
to Fulfill God&rsquo;s Requirement</h2>
<p>The second step for the accomplishing of expiation was to bring the blood of the goat inside the veil and sprinkle it on and before the expiation cover. According to God&rsquo;s law, without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins (Heb. 9:22). Therefore, the sprinkling of the blood of the goat on and before the expiation cover, which was the lid of the Ark, was for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s requirement so that God might have fellowship with the approaching one. By the lid of the Ark, with the expiating blood sprinkled on it, the entire situation of the sinner was fully covered. Therefore, upon this lid God could meet with the people who had broken His righteous law. Since the problem between man and God was appeased, God could forgive and show mercy to man and thereby give grace to man.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Signifying That the Blood of Christ<br />
Was Brought into the Holy of Holies<br />
in the Heavens to Accomplish<br />
Eternal Redemption for Sinners before God</h2>
<p>The priest was to bring the blood of the goat inside the veil and sprinkle it on and before the expiation cover. This signifies that the blood of Christ was brought into the Holy of Holies in the heavens to accomplish eternal redemption for sinners before God (v. 12). In the Old Testament man&rsquo;s sins were not taken away; they were merely covered by the blood of the sacrifices, which were types of Christ. In the old covenant the blood of goats only made expiation for people&rsquo;s sins; it never accomplished redemption for their sins, because it is impossible for the blood of goats to take away sins (10:4). However, Christ as the Lamb of God took away the sin of the world (John 1:29) by offering Himself once for all on the cross as the sacrifice for sins (Heb. 9:14; 10:12). His blood, which He sprinkled in the heavenly tabernacle before God for our expiation, has accomplished an eternal redemption for us, even redemption for transgressions under the old covenant, transgressions that were only covered by animal blood (9:15). Thus, we have been redeemed with the precious blood of Christ (1 Pet. 1:18-19).</p><h2 class="head2">C. Putting the Blood on and around<br />
the Horns of the Altar and Sprinkling It<br />
on the Altar Seven Times</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Putting the Blood on the Horns of the Altar, Signifying That the Efficacy of Christ&rsquo;s Redemption<br />
Is for the Four Corners of the Earth</h2>
<p>&ldquo;He shall go out to the altar that is before Jehovah and make expiation for it, and he shall take some of the blood of the bull and some of the blood of the goat, and put it on and around the horns of the altar &rdquo; (Lev. 16:18). Putting the blood on and around the four horns of the burnt offering altar signifies that the efficacy of the redemption of the blood of Christ is for the four corners of the earth. The blood of the bull was for Aaron and his household, the blood of the goat was for the entire people of Israel, and the four horns of the altar point toward the four directions of the earth. Therefore, putting the blood of the bull and the goat on and around the horns of the altar signifies that the efficacy of the redemption of the blood of Christ is toward the four corners of the earth for the people in every direction of the earth, as the apostle says in 1 John 2:2: &ldquo;He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world.&rdquo; This shows that the sphere reached by the efficacy of the redemption by the blood of Christ is inclusive and extensive.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Sprinkling the Blood on the Altar Seven Times, Signifying That the Full Efficacy<br />
of Christ&rsquo;s Blood Is So That the Sinner<br />
May Look at It and Be at Peace in His Heart</h2>
<p>The blood of the bull and the goat was not only put on and around the horns of the altar but also sprinkled on the altar seven times (Lev. 16:19a). This signifies that the full efficacy of the blood shed on the cross by Christ is so that the sinner may look at it and be at peace in his heart. When we, as sinners, look at the blood sprinkled on the altar, we know that our sin and sins have been dealt with. Knowing that the problem of sin has been solved, we have peace in our heart.</p>
<p>The blood sprinkled on the altar was for the peace of the sinner, but the blood sprinkled on the expiation cover was for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. The blood was sprinkled first on the expiation cover within the veil. This was for God to see. It was for His satisfaction. Then the blood was sprinkled on the offering altar in the outer court. This was for the sinner to see. It was for his satisfaction. Both God and man are satisfied through the redeeming blood of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Cleansing the Altar and Sanctifying It<br />
from the Uncleannesses of the Children of Israel</h2>
<p>Leviticus 16:19b tells us that Aaron was to cleanse the altar and &ldquo;sanctify it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel.&rdquo; This signifies that all the world&rsquo;s sins were gathered upon the cross of Christ and resolved. Uncleannesses here refers to our sin, to our leprosy, to our rebellion, and even to the satanic nature within us. Because the people of God were in this uncleanness, even the altar used by God for the redemption of His people was contaminated. By the cross of Christ this uncleanness has been dealt with and taken away. Now there is a clean situation in which we and God may enjoy each other and have peace with one another.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Man is sinful and unclean before God and needs God to take away his sins. However, in the Old Testament the taking away of sins through the redemption of Christ, which God foreordained, was not yet accomplished. Hence, God set up the expiation as a symbol of the redemption which was to come.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the two tablets of the Testimony, the two tablets of the law, were placed in the Ark within the Holy of Holies. The Ten Commandments on the two tablets exposed and condemned the sins of the people who came to meet with God, making it impossible for God to meet with the sinners. However, the tablets of the law which exposed and condemned the people&rsquo;s sins were covered by the lid of the Ark with the expiating blood sprinkled on it. Based upon the redemption which was to be accomplished by Christ and to which the expiation blood on the lid pointed, God could pass over the sins covered by the lid to meet with man. These covered sins were not taken away; they remained until Christ came. Then they were taken away by the eternal redemption which He accomplished. Therefore, on this lid the expiating blood of the bulls and goats accomplished the covering of sins, not the actual taking away of sins.</p>
<p>With the type of expiation we can see how Christ accomplished for the sinners the taking away of sins in the New Testament age. First, the goat was slaughtered as a sin offering for the people, typifying Christ, who was made in the likeness of the flesh of sin, as the sin offering for sinners. Then the blood of the goat was brought inside the veil and sprinkled on and before the expiation cover, signifying that the blood of Christ was brought into the Holy of Holies in the heavens to accomplish eternal redemption for us. Then the blood was put on and around the four horns of the altar and sprinkled on the altar seven times, signifying that the efficacy of the redemption of Christ is for the four corners of the earth and that the full efficacy of the blood of Christ is so that the sinner may look at it and be at peace in his heart. Thus, we and God may enjoy each other and have peace with one another in a clean situation.</p>

</ol><h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Concerning the Old Testament, the types in Genesis may be considered as a series, from Christ as light and life to the producing of a complete person redeemed, called, and transformed by the Triune God to become a prince of God; the types in Exodus and Leviticus may be considered as another series, from the keeping of the passover and the exodus from Egypt by the people of God to their enjoyment of rest and keeping of the holy festivals with God and for the full mutual enjoyment of the jubilee foreordained by God for His people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SABBATH</h2>
<p>The Sabbath as the weekly season or feast signifies rest for God&rsquo;s redeemed people to enjoy with God and with one another (Lev. 23:3). Every seven days there was a day for rest and enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being the Principal Denotation<br />
of All the Annual Feasts</h2>
<p>The principal denotation of all the annual seasons (feasts) is for God&rsquo;s people to enjoy rest with God and with one another. Rest is thus the denotation of each of the seven annual seasons. Every annual feast, like the weekly rest, was a rest. The weekly rest lays the foundation for God&rsquo;s people to keep the holy feasts with God annually.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. A Complete Rest</h2>
<p>The weekly Sabbath was a complete, solemn rest. It was not something light or common but something quite holy, sacred, and important for God&rsquo;s enjoyment and His people&rsquo;s enjoyment. This complete rest signifies a genuine and thorough rest of God and with God for God&rsquo;s redeemed people to enjoy with Him and with one another.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. A Holy Convocation</h2>
<p>Whenever a festival took place, it was a holy convocation. A holy convocation signifies a corporate enjoyment of rest, not by individual believers separately but by the church corporately. In such a gathering we have the enjoyment of God before God, with God, and with one another.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Not Doing Any Work</h2>
<p>On the Sabbath no one was allowed to do any work. This signifies that man needs to enjoy rest, not to labor.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. A Sabbath to Jehovah</h2>
<p>The Sabbath was &ldquo;to Jehovah.&rdquo; This signifies a rest for God&rsquo;s enjoyment, participated in by His redeemed people. In all the convocations, in all the festivals, we are resting before God and with God and one another.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE HOLY FEASTS</h2>
<p>The seasons (feasts) appointed by God as holy convocations signify the gathering of God&rsquo;s redeemed people to have a festival with God for His joy and enjoyment so that the redeemed may participate in it with Him and with one another. According to Leviticus 23, there were seven annual feasts. Seven is the number of fullness. The seven annual feasts were in the fullness of God&rsquo;s riches. These seven feasts are in two groups. The first group consists of four festivals, which took place in the first half of the year; the second group consists of three festivals, which took place in the second half of the year. According to their dispensational fulfillment, the first four have taken place already, and the last three will take place in the future.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Feast of the Passover</h2>
<p>The Feast of the Passover is in the first month of the year (vv. 4-5), that is, the beginning of a course. This signifies Christ (1 Cor. 5:7b) as our redemption to begin our enjoyment of God&rsquo;s salvation with God. The passover has the denotation of a passing over. It signifies that the judging God has passed over us, sinners who are in our sins, so that we may enjoy Him as our feast for rest and for joy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Feast of Unleavened Bread</h2>
<p>The Feast of Unleavened Bread signifies Christ, who is without sin, for our enjoyment as a feast in a life apart from sin (Lev. 23:6-8; 2 Cor. 5:21). It closely followed the day of the Feast of the Passover. Hence, these two feasts&mdash;the Feast of the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread&mdash;should be considered together. The first feast is the beginning, and the second is the continuation. Whereas the first feast lasted for only one day, the fourteenth day of the first month, the second feast lasted for seven days, from the fifteenth day through the twenty-first day.</p>
<p>The Feast of Unleavened Bread lasting for seven days signifies the entire course of our Christian life. The course of our Christian life is a feast of unleavened bread, a feast without sin. We have been redeemed from sin, and now the Redeemer, who is without sin, is the feast for our entire life. We should be enjoying rest, enjoying God, and enjoying our Redeemer, apart from sin, for our entire life.</p>
<p>The main thing we enjoy in the Passover feast is Christ as our Lamb. In the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the main thing we enjoy is Christ as the unleavened bread, as our life supply without sin. For our whole Christian life we live on this bread which is without sin.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Feast of Firstfruits</h2>
<p>The third annual feast is the Feast of Firstfruits (Lev. 23:9-14). This feast signifies the resurrected Christ for our enjoyment as a feast in His resurrection (1 Cor. 15:20). This feast took place three days after the Passover feast. Christ was crucified at the time of the Passover feast, and on the third day He was resurrected. The day of His resurrection was the fulfilment of the Feast of Firstfruits. Christ in His resurrection is the firstfruits.</p>
<p>In the Feast of Firstfruits, &ldquo;you shall bring the sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest&rdquo; (Lev. 23:10). This signifies that the resurrected Christ, with some of the Old Testament saints (cf. Matt. 27:52-53), was brought to God and presented to God for His fresh enjoyment. The first sheaf of the offering was waved before Jehovah on the day after the Sabbath (Lev. 23:11). This signifies that Christ was resurrected so that we might be justified before God and accepted by God (Rom. 4:25b). &ldquo;You shall eat no bread or parched grain or fresh ears until that same day, until you have brought the offering of your God&rdquo; (Lev. 23:14). This signifies that the resurrected Christ ascended to the heavens and was offered first to God with all the fruit in His resurrection as God&rsquo;s food for His satisfaction. Then He became man&rsquo;s supply for man&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
<p>The resurrected Christ, the fresh Christ in His resurrection, was enjoyed by God first. This is the firstfruits, and the firstfruits are for God&rsquo;s enjoyment. Then the resurrected Christ becomes our enjoyment with God and with one another.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Feast of Pentecost</h2>
<p>The Feast of Pentecost was the feast of the fiftieth day, counting from the day after the Sabbath, the day on which the sheaf of the wave offering was brought to God, until the day after the seventh Sabbath, being a total of fifty days (vv. 15-16a). This signifies the resurrection of Christ in its sevenfold fullness reaching the realm of the complete fullness, bearing the full responsibility (signified by the number fifty, which is ten times five, the number of responsibility) for the testimony of resurrection.</p>
<p>In the Feast of Pentecost, two loaves of bread of fine flour baked with leaven as firstfruits were brought and presented to Jehovah as a new meal offering (v. 16). The fine flour typifies Christ at the stage of the firstfruits; two loaves of bread baked with leaven typify the church in two sections at the stage of Pentecost, the section of the church composed of the Jewish believers and the section composed of the Gentile believers; both sections had sins (signified by leaven) within them, being offered to God as the new meal offering for God&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
<p>According to Leviticus 2 there was to be no leaven in the meal offering, but here leaven was added to the meal offering because in each part of the church as the Body of Christ there is still sin, as seen in the book of Acts. There is the sin of Ananias and Sapphira in chapter 5 and the murmuring over the distribution of food in chapter 6, for example.</p>
<p>These loaves are the increase, the expansion, of the fine flour that came out of the firstfruits on the day of resurrection. In typology this indicates that Christ has become the church, that the church is the enlargement of Christ. As such an enlargement of Christ, the church with its two parts is offered to God for His satisfaction.</p>
<p>In reaping the harvest of the land, the people were not to completely reap the corners of their field and gather all the gleanings of their harvest. Instead, something was to be left for the poor and the sojourner (Lev. 23:22). This signifies that there is a remainder of the grace of Christ in His resurrection at the Feast of Pentecost in which the poor and the Gentiles may participate.</p>
<p>We are typified by the poor and the sojourner, and our portion is the gleanings of the harvest. This is the extraordinary portion of God&rsquo;s grace. Such a portion is illustrated by the case of the Canaanite woman in Matthew 15. Now we may enjoy the Pentecost Triune God, the Pentecost Christ, and the Pentecost all-inclusive Spirit as our portion. This portion has made us part of Christ&rsquo;s increase, enlargement, extension, and expansion.</p>
<p>The first four festivals&mdash;the Passover, the Unleavened Bread, the Firstfruits, and Pentecost&mdash;are all related to food and to the matter of eating for God&rsquo;s satisfaction, yet God still remembers the poor and the sojourner. Hence, we, the Gentiles, are able to participate in the grace of Christ at the Feast of Pentecost, which was accomplished for the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets</h2>
<p>The Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets (Lev. 23:23-25) signifies God calling together His scattered people (the dispersed Israelites) and His reminding them that He will issue such a call to them (Matt. 24:31; cf. Isa. 27:13; Psa. 81:3). This feast was on the first day of the seventh month, the beginning of the second half of the year. This signifies the second half of God&rsquo;s redemption, which is to be accomplished on Israel, the first half having been accomplished on the church. Although the second half of God&rsquo;s redemption will be applied to Israel, it will still be related to the church.</p>
<p>The interval from the day of Pentecost, when the church came into being, to the day God calls His scattered people to come back together, is the church age, which is called the age of mystery.</p>
<p>The Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets was a complete rest (Lev. 23:24b). This signifies the gathering of God&rsquo;s people to enter into God&rsquo;s genuine and thorough rest.</p>
<p>During the twenty-six hundred years since the carrying away to Babylon, the Jews have been a people without rest. They lost their homeland because they rejected the God of rest. When the trumpet sounds, God will call His scattered people, who have so long been without rest, back to the land of their fathers. Then they will have rest with God. They will enjoy Christ as the absolute and thorough rest. For the Jews, this will be a real feast.</p><h2 class="head2">F. The Feast of Expiation</h2>
<p>The sixth feast is the Feast of Expiation, the Day of Expiation, closely following Israel&rsquo;s repentance unto God (vv. 26-32). This signifies that the day of man&rsquo;s redemption follows our trumpeting of the gospel and man&rsquo;s repentance as a reaction to it.</p>
<p>On the Day of Expiation, the people were to afflict their souls and present an offering by fire to Jehovah (vv. 27c, 29). This signifies mourning, repentance, and sorrow for sin, and offering Christ as food to God for the satisfaction of both God and man. According to Zechariah 12, this is what the Jews will do when the Lord Jesus comes back.</p>
<p>The Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets was on the first day of the seventh month; the Feast of Expiation was on the tenth day of that month. The Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets will be fulfilled when the Lord Jesus comes back, and the trumpet sounds to call God&rsquo;s dispersed people together to their fathers&rsquo; land. After the Lord Jesus descends from the air to the earth, the Jews will repent, mourn, and return to God, receiving Christ as their Savior. This will be a literal fulfillment of the Feast of Expiation.</p>
<p>The type of this feast has been fulfilled spiritually with the New Testament believers. On the cross Christ accomplished expiation. Using the New Testament term, He accomplished redemption. When we repented, believed, and received Christ as our Savior, we experienced this feast. Therefore, the Feast of Expiation has a double application. Spiritually this feast has been applied to the New Testament believers, and it will be applied literally to the Jews.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Feast of Tabernacles</h2>
<p>The seventh feast, which is the last feast, is the Feast of Tabernacles (Lev. 23:33-44). This feast signifies the coming millennium as a dispensational, joyful blessing for God&rsquo;s redeemed people to enjoy with God for a full period of time in God&rsquo;s old creation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days to Jehovah&rdquo; (v. 34). These seven days signify that the Feast of Tabernacles is for a complete course of days, which will be a thousand years. &ldquo;Seven days you shall present an offering by fire to Jehovah&rdquo; (v. 36a). This signifies that during this festival, Christ is offered day by day as food to God for the satisfaction of both God and man. According to this type, in the millennium every day an offering will be presented to God to signify that Christ is God&rsquo;s food in our experiences, which is offered to God for His satisfaction so that we and God may enjoy mutual rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the produce of the land, you shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days&rdquo; (v. 39a). This signifies that the millennium will come after the harvest of what God desires to obtain on earth. In His eternal plan God has a purpose with man, and this purpose is to produce a people for His expression, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. For this reason, God uses four dispensations to do His work of the new creation on man in the old creation. The first is the dispensation of the fathers; the second is the dispensation of the law; and the third is the dispensation of the church. In the fourth dispensation, the dispensation of the millennial kingdom, there will be a full harvest of what God has been doing in the first three dispensations. Hence, the millennial kingdom will be a feast both to God and to His redeemed. In the millennium God&rsquo;s redeemed people&mdash;including both the church and the kingdom of Israel&mdash;will enjoy this feast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the first day you shall take for yourselves the product of stately trees, branches of palm trees and boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before Jehovah your God for seven days&rdquo; (v. 40). This signifies the evergreen, nourishing, beautiful, and rich scenery of the humanity of Christ being lived out from God&rsquo;s redeemed people.</p>
<p>Trees are of the plant life, and in typology plants signify Christ&rsquo;s humanity. The trees in verse 40 signify different aspects of Christ&rsquo;s humanity. Christ is not only full of fruit but also full of leaves, which in a particular way show the beauty of His humanity. In the millennium all the overcomers will live out the evergreen, nourishing, beautiful, and rich scenery of the humanity of Christ.</p>
<p>The seven festivals portray our Christian life from our salvation as sinners to our entrance into the millennial kingdom, which God has prepared as the peak of His consummation of the new creation in the old creation, so that God and man may gladly enjoy all the blessings that God&rsquo;s work of new creation accomplished in the age of the old creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE SABBATH YEAR</h2>
<p>In Leviticus 25, verses 2 through 7 and verses 18 through 22 speak of the Sabbath year. This Sabbath was not a day of rest but a year of rest. The Sabbath year was a rest not only for man but also for the land.</p>
<p>The Sabbath day refers to Christ, and the Sabbath year also refers to Christ. Christ is our Sabbath not merely for one day but for a full year. Hence, the Sabbath year denotes Christ in His fullness as our rest. We need to enjoy Him not only as our Sabbath day but also as our Sabbath year, that is, not only as our rest in part but as our rest in full. The Sabbath year is for us to enjoy Christ in full as our rest with God.</p>
<p>In the Sabbath year &ldquo;the land shall observe a Sabbath to Jehovah&rdquo; (v. 2). This signifies that Christ is the realm of the full rest that we may enjoy Him as our rest to the fullest. &ldquo;You shall not sow your field nor prune your vineyard. The aftergrowth of your harvest you shall not reap, and the grapes of your unpruned vine you shall not gather&rdquo; (vv. 4b-5). This signifies that rest is purely and wholly of grace and that all human labor should cease absolutely. Furthermore, the Sabbath produce of the land was to be food for all kinds of people and for the cattle and the animals (vv. 6-7). This signifies that there is grace toward everyone regardless of his status. In this common enjoyment of the produce of the land, there is real freedom. For this purpose, God commanded His blessing on the people in the sixth year so that the land would yield a sufficient crop for three years. This signifies that the sufficient grace in Christ surpasses our need threefold. The practice of keeping the Sabbath year ushers us into the jubilee.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE YEAR OF JUBILEE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Jubilee Coming Out of<br />
Eight Consecutive Sabbath Years</h2>
<p>The fifty years that consummated in the jubilee comprised eight Sabbath years, being Sabbath upon Sabbath to be an eightfold Sabbath (cf. v. 8), signifying the superabundance of the fullness of God&rsquo;s rest with satisfaction to us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being the Pentecostal Year,<br />
Comprising Eight Eighth Years</h2>
<p>For the fifty years, the first and last years were eighth years, and in between there were six eighth years. Hence, there was a total of eight eighth years. Since the number eight signifies resurrection, this indicates that the jubilee is something that is altogether from resurrection, to resurrection, in resurrection, and with resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Those Who Lost Their Possession<br />
Returning to It</h2>
<p>God brought His redeemed people out of Egypt, through the wandering in the wilderness, and eventually into Canaan, the good land. Then according to God&rsquo;s ordination, every tribe was allotted a portion of the land, and the allotment was divided and given to each family within the tribe; everyone received an allotted portion of the land as an inheritance. God charged them saying that the land which they possessed belonged to God and was not to be sold in perpetuity (v. 23). When an Israelite became poor and sold some of his possession, his nearest relative was to be his redeemer and redeem what he had sold. If he did not have someone to redeem his possession but acquired the means for its redemption, he could redeem it by himself. If a man did not have sufficient means to redeem his possession, it remained until the year of jubilee, at which time it was released to him (vv. 24-28).</p>
<p>There were three ways for an Israelite to recover his lost possession. First, it could be redeemed by his nearest relative. This is a matter of grace. Second, if he had the means, he could redeem it himself. Third, if he did not have a relative to redeem it and he could not redeem it himself, he could wait for the year of jubilee when the sold possession would spontaneously be restored to him. This also is a matter of grace. The jubilee is a very good type of God&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Those Who Were in Slavery Being Released</h2>
<p>If an Israelite was still poor after he sold his land, he could sell himself as a slave. In Leviticus 25, verses 39 to 41 and 54 show that if a brother became poor and sold himself to another brother, he and his sons would go back to his own family and return to the possession of his fathers at the jubilee. When the jubilee came, everyone was released to return to his possession and go back to his family. No one needed to spend any money to redeem his possession; everyone freely regained his possession and liberty.</p>
<p>Hence, in the fiftieth year no one was without a piece of land and no one was in slavery; everyone had his own possession and liberty. This is grace. Hence, Isaiah 61:2 speaks of the year of jubilee as &ldquo;the acceptable year of Jehovah.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Significance of the Jubilee</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The New Testament Age as the Year of Jubilee<br />
to the God-redeemed Believers</h2>
<p>In Luke 4:14-30 the Lord Jesus began His ministry by proclaiming the jubilee of grace. On the Sabbath day in the synagogue at Nazareth, He read from the book of Isaiah and proclaimed the acceptable year of the Lord. This acceptable year is the New Testament age of grace, typified by the year of jubilee, the fiftieth year, in which all the slaves were liberated and every man&rsquo;s inheritance was restored.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Returning to the Possession Lost in Adam</h2>
<p>God created man with the intention that man would take God as his possession. After creating man, God placed him in a garden and in front of the tree of life. The garden is for lodging, and the tree of life is for eating. However, instead of eating of the tree of life, Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Thus, he became fallen and lost God. When he lost God, he lost his possession. Therefore, all his descendants living on earth are without God (Eph. 2:12), without a possession.</p>
<p>Colossians 1:12 says that the Father has qualified us for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light, and Ephesians 1:14 speaks of the pledge of our inheritance. Now that we have been returned to God as our portion, we have God in Christ as our inheritance. In Acts 26:18 Paul speaks of fallen people being brought back to God as their inheritance: &ldquo;To open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive...an inheritance among those who have been sanctified.&rdquo; The divine inheritance here is the Triune God Himself with all that He has, all that He has done, and all that He will do. This Triune God is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ (Col. 2:9), who is the portion allotted to the saints as their inheritance. The Holy Spirit, who has been given to the saints, is the foretaste, the pledge, and the guarantee of this divine inheritance (Rom. 8:23; Eph. 1:14), which we are sharing and enjoying today in God&rsquo;s New Testament jubilee and will share and enjoy in full in the coming age and for eternity.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Those under the Slavery of Sin Being Set Free</h2>
<p>The second blessing of the jubilee is that those who have sold themselves as slaves are freed from their slavery (Lev. 25:39-41, 54).</p>
<p>The New Testament reveals that fallen man has sold himself as a slave, in particular as a slave of sin. In Romans 7:14 Paul declares, &ldquo;I am fleshy, sold under sin.&rdquo; In John 8:34 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.&rdquo; However, God&rsquo;s jubilee frees fallen man from the slavery of sin. For this reason, the Lord then said, &ldquo;If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed&rdquo; (v. 36). Furthermore, Paul declares, &ldquo;Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves; for he who has died is justified from sin&rdquo; (Rom. 6:6-7). Then he says, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death&rdquo; (8:2). According to Galatians 5:1, God&rsquo;s jubilee frees us also from the bondage of the law.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Jubilee in the Millennium</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. To Inherit the Land Lost through Adam</h2>
<p>When God created Adam, He gave man dominion over the whole earth (Gen. 1:26) to recover the earth usurped by Satan so that God&rsquo;s kingdom could come to this earth and God&rsquo;s will would be done on this earth (Matt. 6:10). However, because of his fall, Adam lost his God-given authority over the earth. When the jubilee of the millennium comes, the earth will become the kingdom of God (Rev. 11:15), Satan will be cast from the earth to the abyss (20:2-3), and the overcomers will inherit the world (Rom. 4:13), the earth lost by Adam, and reign with Christ on earth.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. To Be Freed from the Slavery of the Old Creation</h2>
<p>After the fall of Adam, the whole creation was made subject to vanity and was enslaved under the law of decay and corruption (8:20-21). Although we have the divine Spirit as the firstfruits in our spirit, our body has not yet been saturated with the divine life. Our body is still the flesh, linked to the old creation. Hence, we groan together with the creation (vv. 19, 22). When the jubilee in the millennium comes, we will obtain the full sonship, the redemption and transfiguration of our body, and we will be freed from the slavery of the old creation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Jubilee in the New Heaven and New Earth</h2>
<p>The ultimate fulfillment of the jubilee is in the new heaven and new earth as the jubilee for all the God-redeemed and fully perfected saints throughout the generations.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. To Inherit the New Earth as an Eternal Inheritance</h2>
<p>In eternity the New Jerusalem will descend from heaven to the earth (Rev. 21:1-2). Satan will be cast into the lake of fire (20:10), and all the filthy things will be cleared away. All God&rsquo;s redeemed will reign as kings on the new earth to fully occupy and possess it (22:5), that is, to inherit it as their eternal inheritance and to rule over it for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. To Be Freed from All Slavery</h2>
<p>In eternity future all enslavement will be eliminated. There will no longer be a curse, and night will be no more (vv. 3, 5). All the negative things, including death and Hades, will be cast into the lake of fire (20:14). All God&rsquo;s redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people will be freed from all slavery. This is the highest peak which God&rsquo;s work of grace in His new creation will attain fully and completely by ascending step by step, from the New Testament age to the millennium and then from the millennium to the new heaven and new earth. Then all His chosen, redeemed, and transformed people will enjoy for eternity what He as the Divine Trinity is and does, as manifested in His work of the new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>After God&rsquo;s people were cleansed, they could enjoy their rest and keep the holy festivals with God in the full enjoyment of the jubilee foreordained by God for His people. The Sabbath as the weekly feast signifies rest for God&rsquo;s redeemed people to enjoy with God and with one another, and it is the principal denotation of all the annual feasts.</p>
<p>The feasts, appointed by God as holy convocations, signify the gathering of God&rsquo;s redeemed people to have a festival with God for His joy and enjoyment that the redeemed may participate in it with Him and with one another. The Feast of the Passover in the first month of the year, signifying that Christ as our redemption causes the judgment of God to pass over us and enables us to enjoy God as our feast, begins our enjoyment of God&rsquo;s salvation with God. The Feast of Unleavened Bread signifies Christ, who is without sin for our enjoyment, as a feast in a life apart from sin. Our Redeemer, who is without sin, is the feast for our entire life as believers. We should enjoy rest, enjoy God, and enjoy our Redeemer, apart from sin, for our entire life. The Feast of Firstfruits signifies the resurrected Christ for our enjoyment as a feast in His resurrection. The resurrected Christ, the fresh Christ in His resurrection, was enjoyed first by God and then became our enjoyment with God and with one another. The Feast of Pentecost signifies the resurrection of Christ in its sevenfold fullness reaching the realm of complete fullness and bearing the full responsibility for the testimony of resurrection. The two loaves of bread presented in this feast typify the church in two sections, the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers, at the stage of Pentecost. These loaves are the increase, the expansion, of the fine flour that came out of the firstfruits on the day of resurrection, typifying the church as the enlargement of Christ. As such an enlargement of Christ, the church with its two sections is offered to God for His satisfaction. The Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets signifies God&rsquo;s calling His scattered people together so that they, who have so long been without rest, can come back to the land of their fathers. Then they will have rest with God and will enjoy Christ as the absolute and thorough rest. On the Day of Expiation, the people were to afflict their souls and present an offering by fire to Jehovah, signifying their mourning, repentance, and sorrow for sin, and their offering of Christ as food to God for the satisfaction of both God and man. This is what the children of Israel will do when the Lord Jesus comes back. After the Lord Jesus descends from the air to the earth, the Israelites will repent, mourn, and return to God, receiving Christ as their Savior. This will be a literal fulfillment of the Feast of Expiation. The Feast of Tabernacles signifies the coming millennium as a dispensation, a joyful blessing for God&rsquo;s redeemed people to enjoy with God for a full period of time in God&rsquo;s old creation.</p>
<p>The Sabbath year as a year of rest typifies Christ in His fullness as our rest with God in full. It is also a rest for the land, signifying that Christ is the realm of the full rest. In the Sabbath year, all human labor should cease absolutely; this is a matter purely and wholly of grace toward everyone, regardless of his status. Furthermore, the sufficient grace in Christ surpasses our need threefold. This practice of keeping the Sabbath year ushers us into the jubilee.</p>
<p>The jubilee came out of eight consecutive sabbath years, being an eightfold sabbath. It signifies the superabundance of the fullness of God&rsquo;s rest with satisfaction to us. The jubilee was also the Pentecostal year that came out of eight eighth years, indicating that the jubilee is something altogether from resurrection, to resurrection, in resurrection, and with resurrection. In the year of jubilee, those who lost their possession returned to it, and those who were in slavery were released. This signifies that the God-redeemed believers return to the possession lost in Adam and are set free from the slavery of sin. It also signifies that in the millennium, the overcomers will inherit the land lost through Adam and will be freed from the slavery of the old creation. Its ultimate fulfillment is in the new heaven and new earth, in which all the redeemed and fully perfected saints throughout the centuries will inherit the new earth as their eternal inheritance and be freed from all slavery.</p>

</ol><h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In the first three books of the Old Testament&mdash;Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus&mdash;different types are used to portray Christ and the church, Christ&rsquo;s redemption and God&rsquo;s salvation, man&rsquo;s condition and his need, and the believers&rsquo; proper living and service before God. From Numbers to the end of the Old Testament, various aspects of the history of the children of Israel are used to prefigure aspects of the history of the church on earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE HISTORY OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</h2>
<p>From Numbers to the end of the Old Testament, the various aspects of the history of the children of Israel can be divided generally into six stages.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Wandering</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Going out of Egypt<br />
and Arriving at Mount Horeb</h2>
<p>After their exodus from Egypt, the children of Israel began a journey through the wilderness under the leading of God with the pillar of cloud in the day and the pillar of fire in the night. Furthermore, through their experiences of the tree which caused the bitter water to become sweet (Exo. 15:23-25), the twelve springs at Elim (v. 27), the manna from heaven (16:14-15, 31-32, 35), the living water flowing out of the cleft rock (17:6), and by their overcoming the Amalekites (vv. 8-16), they were brought to Mount Horeb, the mountain of God.</p>
<p>At Mount Horeb the children of Israel received God&rsquo;s revelation and equipping. First, they received the enlightenment of the law to know God&rsquo;s being. Then they received the revelation concerning the tabernacle and the priesthood, and thereby they participated in the building of the dwelling place of God on earth, knowing how to fellowship with God and serve God and how to be God&rsquo;s holy people, living a sanctified life by the tabernacle, with the offerings, and through the priests. Lastly, they were built up and formed into a priestly army to journey on under the leading of God and to fight for Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. From Mount Horeb to Kadesh-barnea</h2>
<p>After they were formed into an army, the children of Israel began their journey to the good land to possess it so that God could gain a place on the earth to build up His kingdom with His house.</p>
<p>After journeying for eleven days from Mount Horeb, they reached Kadesh-barnea at the border of the good land (Deut. 1:2). Even though God had gone before them in the fire by night and in the cloud by day, seeking out places for them to camp and showing them the way they should go (v. 33), the children of Israel disregarded God&rsquo;s care for them in the wilderness because of the evil report brought back by ten of the twelve men who went to spy out the good land and because they forgot how He had carried them through the great and awesome wilderness (v. 31). Thus, they had an evil heart of unbelief, believing neither in God nor in His promise. They even murmured against God, saying that God brought them into the land to fall by the sword and for their wives and little ones to become a plunder (Num. 14:1-3). Hence, God swore in His wrath that not one of the unbelieving generation would see the good land which He had sworn to give to their fathers; only Caleb and Joshua were allowed to enter (Deut. 1:34-38). As for the rest of the people, their corpses fell in the wilderness, but the little ones, who the people said would become plunder, were brought into the land by God. The people and their children wandered in the wilderness forty years to bear their iniquities according to the number of days that the land had been spied out (a year for every day). Those who gave the evil report all died by a plague before Jehovah (Num. 14:26-38). This shows that it is a terrible thing not to believe in God. We need to be careful not to have an evil heart of unbelief.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. From Kadesh-barnea<br />
to the East Bank of the Jordan River</h2>
<p>After the failure of the children of Israel at Kadesh-barnea, God commanded them to leave. Therefore, they turned and set out for the wilderness by the way that led to the Red Sea. The time they spent in going from Kadesh-barnea until they crossed over the brook Zered was thirty-eight years (Deut. 2:1-14). Although Kadesh-barnea was the entry into the good land, the children of Israel were not allowed to enter in; rather, they wandered in the wilderness for thirty-eight years until everyone in the old generation had been consumed, with the exception of Joshua and Caleb.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Falling Dead</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Wandering until They Fell Dead<br />
in the Wilderness</h2>
<p>Because of their evil deeds and unbelief, most of the children of Israel became those with whom God was not well pleased (1 Cor. 10:5). Eventually, in their wandering in the wilderness, all of the first generation, except Caleb and Joshua, fell dead in the wilderness, failing to reach the goal for which God led them out of Egypt.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Not Being Allowed<br />
to Enter into the Promised Good Land</h2>
<p>The goal of God&rsquo;s calling the children of Israel was that they would enter into the promised good land to enjoy its riches so that they might establish God&rsquo;s kingdom and be God&rsquo;s testimony on the earth. The all-inclusive Christ, typified by the good land, is the greatest blessing which God intends to give to His elect. To inherit the promised good land, a person should love God, fear God, care for God&rsquo;s intention, and live in God&rsquo;s presence. The old generation of the children of Israel fell away from the living God because of their evil heart of unbelief (Heb. 3:12); they repeatedly offended God and disobeyed Him to the point that they, being abhorred and rejected by God, fell in the wilderness and were not allowed to enter the promised good land.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Crossing the Jordan River</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Second Generation<br />
Receiving Renewed Training</h2>
<p>God rejected the old generation of the children of Israel, but He promised to lead their children into the good land of Canaan. After the new generation of the children of Israel passed through forty years of trials and tests in the wilderness, God gave them a renewed training through Moses when they reached the Jordan River. Moses trained them through a review of the past (Deut. 1&mdash;4), a rehearsal of the law (chs. 5&mdash;26), a warning (chs. 27&mdash;28), the enactment of the covenant (chs. 29&mdash;30), along with some other words, so that they might be prepared and fit to inherit the promised good land as God&rsquo;s blessing to them. In his review of the past, Moses pointed out God&rsquo;s leading and the people&rsquo;s failure. With a view toward the future, he expected that the people would know the love and government of God and their real condition. They needed to know that God is loving and righteous in dealing with them. They also needed to know that they were a failure so that they would condemn themselves, humble themselves, and have no trust in themselves and so that they could respond to God&rsquo;s love in a way that would fit His governmental administration. Thus, they could be in the good land, having a prolonged enjoyment of its blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Qualified to Cross the Jordan River</h2>
<p>After the new generation, the second generation, of the children of Israel received this renewed training, everything was ready (Josh. 1). The children of Israel had been chosen, called, redeemed, saved, trained, and prepared by God. Thus, they were qualified to go forward with Him to cross over the Jordan River and take the good land, which typifies the rich, all-inclusive Christ. Under the leadership of Joshua they crossed the Jordan River by faith to enter into the good land of Canaan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Entering into Canaan</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Defeating the Enemies</h2>
<p>To take, possess, and enjoy the land of Canaan after entering into it, the children of Israel had to fight the enemies who had usurped the land. Beginning with the city of Jericho, they fought battle after battle, city after city, until eventually they took the whole land of Canaan. In his lifetime Joshua did not cut off all the enemies from the good land. After his death, in the age of the judges, a period of approximately four hundred and fifty years, the children of Israel were unable to completely dispossess and utterly destroy the seven tribes remaining in the good land. This fighting lasted until the time of David. During David&rsquo;s reign all the enemies in the land were fully subdued (1 Chron. 22:18).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Taking Possession of the Good Land</h2>
<p>Whenever the children of Israel defeated their enemies, they took possession of the land for their use, and they settled down and lived in the good land, laboring on it and enjoying its rich produce for their rest and satisfaction.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Becoming a Kingdom and Building the Temple</h2>
<p>After the children of Israel entered into the good land, the people of God did not have the adequate place and time to build the temple for God because of incessant fightings and rebellions. After David subdued the enemies in the land, the kingdom of God was brought in. Then Solomon built the temple as God&rsquo;s dwelling place upon the foundation of peace brought in by his father David.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Being Taken into Captivity</h2>
<p>Although the children of Israel established the kingdom of God and built the temple for God in the good land, they were unfaithful to God; the people and their kings forsook God and His word and turned to the worship of idols. Although God sent prophets to warn them, they still did not obey. Eventually, they suffered the fall of their nation and were taken into captivity.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Forsaking God to Worship Idols</h2>
<p>The children of Israel transgressed against the covenant which God made with them, forsaking God as the fountain of living waters (Jer. 2:13) and not loving Jehovah their God with all their heart and soul. They forsook the law which God set before them and did not listen to His voice (9:13). This was the main factor of the degradation of God&rsquo;s people. Because they forsook God and His word, they turned away to burn incense to other gods and worship the works of their own hands. They took idols as their God and committed spiritual fornication. They committed fornication on every high mountain and under every flourishing tree, and they committed adultery with stones and trees so that even the land became polluted (3:6-9).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being Captured to the Nations</h2>
<p>The children of Israel forsook God and were rejected by God. First, the northern kingdom of Israel was captured by Assyria and Egypt. Instead of taking this as a warning to repent to God, the kingdom of Judah also did things that were evil in the sight of Jehovah. Hence, Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Chaldea, to be taken as captives to Babylon. Thus, the holy land was usurped, the holy temple was burned, and the holy city was torn down. The children of Israel became a subjugated people in the Gentile lands, suffering all kinds of hardship and mistreatment until the days ordained by God for their punishment were fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Returning</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Seventy Years after the Captivity</h2>
<p>According to the word spoken by Jeremiah, God would visit the children of Israel and bring them back to their land after seventy years were fulfilled (25:12; 29:10). They became captives in the Gentile lands for seventy years until the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, when God began to bring them back to the God-promised good land enjoyed by their fathers.</p>
<p>Their return occurred at three different times. The first return was under the leadership of Zerubbabel, a descendant of David, of the royal family; he was appointed the governor. The second return was under the leadership of Ezra, a descendant of Aaron, of the priestly order. The third return was under Nehemiah, an ordinary person, a commoner.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Rebuilding the Holy Temple and the Holy City</h2>
<p>After the children of Israel returned to their own land, under the leadership of Zerubbabel they rebuilt the temple on its original foundation (Ezra 3:1-4, 8). Furthermore, they recovered their worship, service, and enjoyment of God through Ezra (Neh. 8:1-3, 13-17; 13:15-22). Then they rebuilt the holy city through Nehemiah (2:17-18; 6:15) to restore the government of the kingdom. However, the kingship was never restored so that they had to govern themselves under the dominion of the nations.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE REPETITION IN THE HISTORY<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In principle, the various things experienced by the race of Israel in its history are repeated in the church in the New Testament. At Pentecost, the church entered into the good land promised by God in Christ, but because of unbelief, the church later failed to enter into the blessing promised by God in Christ to enjoy His riches. After the formation of the Roman Catholic Church, the general condition of the church was one of being captured by the great Babylon of Romanism, forsaking the straight way of the truth and turning away from God to worship all kinds of idols (Rev. 17). In the centuries before the Reformation, there were some feeble revivals that could be considered as undercurrents of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. During the Reformation in Luther&rsquo;s time, however, these undercurrents burst forth into a definite recovery, which was signified by the church in Sardis. Nevertheless, the recovery was still very weak in life and truth (3:1-2). It was strengthened by Zinzendorf and later by the Brethren, especially in the matter of truth, through their returning to the unique name of Christ apart from the divisive names of the denominations as signified by the church in Philadelphia. However, the church soon degraded into the lukewarm Laodicea. The Lord desires that His lovers would carry on with what was recovered through Luther, Zinzendorf, and the Brethren until His church, which has been divided, can have a full testimony of oneness for the organic building up of His Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The various aspects of the history of the chosen race of Israel can be divided generally into six stages: wandering, falling dead, crossing the Jordan River, entering into Canaan, being taken into captivity, and returning. The children of Israel had an evil heart of unbelief, believing neither in God nor in His promise. Hence, God swore in His wrath that none of the unbelieving generation would see the good land which He had sworn to give to their fathers. They and their children would wander in the wilderness forty years until all the fleshly Israelites were destroyed and had fallen dead in the wilderness. After a new generation of the children of Israel passed through forty years of trials and tests in the wilderness, God gave them renewed training through Moses so that they might be prepared and fit to inherit the promised good land as God&rsquo;s blessing to them. Under the leadership of Joshua, they crossed the Jordan River by faith to enter into the good land of Canaan. They had to fight with the enemies who had usurped the land to take, possess, and enjoy the land of Canaan after entering into it. This fighting began with Joshua and lasted until David. During David&rsquo;s reign, all the enemies in the land were fully subdued. Thus, the children of Israel were able to settle down and live in the good land, laboring on it and enjoying its rich produce for their rest and satisfaction, thereby bringing in the kingdom of God and the building up of the holy temple as God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<p>Although the children of Israel established the kingdom of God and built the temple for God in the good land, they were unfaithful to God; the people and their kings forsook God and His word and turned to the worship of idols. Because of their lack of repentance, their nation fell, and they were taken into captivity until the days ordained by God for their punishment had been fulfilled. According to the word spoken by Jeremiah, God began to bring them back to the God-promised good land enjoyed by their fathers seventy years after their captivity. They rebuilt the temple on its original foundation, recovered their worship, service, and enjoyment of God, and rebuilt the holy city to restore the government of the kingdom. However, the kingship was never restored so that they had to govern themselves under the dominion of the nations.</p>
<p>In principle, the various things experienced by the race of Israel in its history are repeated in the church in the New Testament.

However, the church soon degraded into the lukewarm Laodicea. The Lord surely desires that His lovers would go on continually in His recovery until His church, which has been divided, can have a full testimony of oneness for the organic building up of His Body.</p>

</ol><h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>There are five kinds of people with special statuses in the Old Testament&mdash;priests, Nazarites, kings, prophets, and shepherds. Each of these typify Christ and the New Testament believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. PRIESTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Priestly Ministry</h2>
<p>According to the Bible there are three main ministries in God&rsquo;s eternal economy and governmental arrangement: the priesthood, the kingship, and the prophethood. The priesthood is the leading ministry of the three and brings the kingship and prophethood into function. The ministry of the priests is engaged especially in the service of God; their responsibility is to serve God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Drawing Near to God<br />
and Waiting in His Presence</h2>
<p>Since a priest serves God, his main function is not to work but to draw near to God and to wait and remain in His presence. He can contact and receive God and be saturated and permeated with God so that he is possessed by God, and he can be one with God to become God&rsquo;s living expression.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Presenting Offerings to God</h2>
<p>In their daily responsibilities the priests took care of the offerings and presented offerings to God. According to Leviticus 1 through 7, there are five main offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. All the offerings are types of Christ. Christ, as the offerings presented to God, solves man&rsquo;s problem of sin and man&rsquo;s other problems before God. He becomes food to God and to those who are separated unto God for His service so that both God and man may be satisfied. In order to participate in the priesthood, believers must experience Christ as the offerings and offer Christ to God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Spreading the Bread of the Presence</h2>
<p>After taking care of the offerings, the priests spread the bread of the Presence in the Holy Place (24:5-9). This signifies that Christ is not only life within us but also our life supply. When we experience Christ as the life supply within us, we will be able to spread the Christ whom we have experienced before God as the life supply to God and man.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Tending the Lampstand</h2>
<p>The high priest tended the lamps on the lampstand, which was next to the table of the bread of the Presence, from evening to morning before God (vv. 2-4; Exo. 27:20-21). This signifies that Christ as our High Priest continually takes care of the divine light, causing it to shine for God continually. By spreading the bread of the Presence and tending the lampstand, the priests who serve God receive divine food and divine light in order to have sufficient strength to walk and serve in the divine light.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Burning the Incense before God</h2>
<p>The priests also burned the incense at the golden altar in the Holy Place (30:6-8). As the incense ascended through burning at the altar, the intercession offered by the high priest was accepted by God, and the high priest was led into the Holy of Holies to meet with God. The incense altar typifies the resurrected Christ as a sweet and fragrant incense. When we pray by such a Christ to contact God, turning Christ and the effectiveness of His death and resurrection into prayer, we are accepted by God so that we are brought into His sweet presence to fellowship with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Teaching God&rsquo;s People the Law</h2>
<p>In Moses&rsquo; blessing of the children of Israel, he said, concerning the Levites who had the priesthood, &ldquo;They shall show Jacob Your judgments, / And Israel Your law&rdquo; (Deut. 33:10a). The priests who served God brought offerings to God, spread the bread of the Presence, tended the lamps, burned the incense, and taught God&rsquo;s people the law.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. Bringing Man to God</h2>
<p>Since a priest serves God and draws near to God, he knows God&rsquo;s intention and enjoys God&rsquo;s riches. Hence, he can bring the people of God, including their condition, difficulties, problems, and needs, to the presence of God so that they may turn to God, gain God, and be joined to God. Exodus 28:6-30 speaks of two onyx stones on the shoulder pieces and twelve precious stones on the breastplate of judgment of the ephod worn by the high priest on which were engraved the twelve names of the sons of Israel. In serving God, the high priest held and bore the people of God to God&rsquo;s presence.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Establishment of the Priests</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Chosen by God</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s original intention was that all His people would fulfill the priestly ministry. However, because of the rebellion of the children of Israel and their fall by worshipping the golden calf, they lost the priesthood. Only the tribe of Levi guarded God&rsquo;s covenant and separated themselves from their brothers. This qualified the Levites for the priesthood of God. From that time onward the tribe of Levi was chosen by God to replace all the people of Israel (Exo. 32; Deut. 33:8-10). However, not even the whole tribe of Levi was chosen by God; only those of the house of Aaron were chosen to be priests.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Anointed by God</h2>
<p>Leviticus 8 describes how the high priest, Aaron, and his sons were anointed and ordained by God. Aaron was anointed by God through Moses, who poured the anointing oil upon Aaron&rsquo;s head and then sprinkled it on his sons and on their garments for their sanctification (vv. 12, 30), thereby ushering in the priestly service.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Typifying Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. As Our High Priest</h2>
<p>Christ went from us to God through crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to be our High Priest to bear us into the presence of God and to care for all our needs (Heb. 2:17-18; 4:14-15). On the one hand, as our High Priest according to the order of Aaron, Christ was tempted in all respects like us and is able to be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses, and He affords us forgiveness of sins through His work on the cross. On the other hand, as the High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek (5:6), Christ has become the source of eternal salvation to us (v. 9), and now He is on the throne in heaven ministering to us with His divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Bringing Us to God</h2>
<p>Christ was appointed High Priest not according to the powerless letters of the law but according to the power of an indestructible life (7:16). By this life Christ ministers as our High Priest. Hence, He is able to save us to the uttermost; He lives always to intercede for us (v. 25). He brings us to God and prays that we may be saved and brought fully into God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Typifying the Believers</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Engaged Especially<br />
in Serving God</h2>
<p>In the New Testament Christ is the High Priest of God, and the believers are a royal priesthood engaged in serving God (1 Pet. 2:5, 9). Every regenerated believer should grow by being nourished with Christ (v. 2) and be built together into a priesthood to serve God corporately, offering up Christ as a spiritual sacrifice for God&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Bringing Man to God</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:28 says, &ldquo;Whom we announce, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ.&rdquo; This presenting, which is the work of a priest, brings man to God. This is a duty that must be fulfilled by every believer. Whether in announcing Christ or in teaching others and interceding for them, we minister Christ to people that they may become mature with Christ as the element of the divine life unto full growth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Being New Testament Priests<br />
of the Gospel of God</h2>
<p>As New Testament priests of the gospel, believers do not offer material sacrifices such as goats and bulls. Rather, they offer spiritual sacrifices, including Christ as the reality of the types of the Old Testament sacrifices. They also offer sinners who are saved by gospel preaching (Rom. 15:16); that is, they save sinners to offer them to God as sacrifices. Furthermore, they help believers, who have received God&rsquo;s compassions, to present themselves as a living sacrifice to God (12:1-2), and they exercise all wisdom to present every believer full-grown in Christ (Col. 1:28).</p><h2 class="head1">II. NAZARITES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Consecrating Themselves Voluntarily</h2>
<p>Numbers 6 is on the vow of the Nazarite. A Nazarite is a voluntarily consecrated one. Whereas a priest is chosen by God, a Nazarite voluntarily consecrates himself. Although not every Israelite was blessed with being chosen by God, everyone could voluntarily consecrate himself to be a Nazarite and receive the blessing of God&rsquo;s choosing. This is like Samuel (1 Sam. 1:11-28), who complemented the priestly ministry of God&rsquo;s ordination by his human cooperation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Separating Themselves from Worldliness</h2>
<p>The Nazarites also separated themselves from worldliness. They separated themselves to God by making a special vow. They were separated to Jehovah in not drinking wine and strong drink and in not eating anything of grapes (Num. 6:3-4). This signifies that they did not care for earthly enjoyment or pleasure and that they rejected the blessings of the world. They were altogether separated from worldliness and were absolutely for God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Submitting Themselves to God</h2>
<p>The Nazarites also submitted themselves to God. During the days of a vow of separation, no razor could pass over the head of the Nazarite; he was to let the locks of the hair of his head grow long (v. 5). Not shaving the head signifies not rejecting the headship of the Lord (cf. 1 Cor. 11:3, 6). A Nazarite must remain under the Lord&rsquo;s headship to absolutely belong to God and be in subjection to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Typifying Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Consecrating Himself to God Voluntarily</h2>
<p>According to typology, among the human race the unique Nazarite is the Lord Jesus. He voluntarily consecrated Himself to God in living for God in His humanity. He was always carrying out God&rsquo;s work, doing God&rsquo;s will, speaking God&rsquo;s word, seeking God&rsquo;s glory, and expressing God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being Sanctified to God</h2>
<p>Throughout His life the Lord Jesus was absolutely separated unto God, was for God, and was one with God. Hence, He is called the Holy One (cf. Acts 3:14). He is not of the world (John 17:14), and in Him the ruler of the world has nothing (14:30). He is absolutely holy in Himself; however, He still sanctified Himself in His living to set an example of sanctification for us (17:19).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Submitting Himself to God</h2>
<p>Christ submitted Himself to God in His walk and living. He took the form of a slave to serve God and man (Phil. 2:7; Acts 3:13; Mark 10:45). He humbled Himself and became obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross (Phil. 2:8), that He might give His life as a ransom for all for the accomplishment of the eternal purpose of God to whom He is in subordination.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Typifying the Believers</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Consecrating Themselves to God</h2>
<p>Through redemption and regeneration, the New Testament believers have been chosen and ordained by God to be the priests who serve Him. However, we still need to be a Nazarite in consecrating ourselves to God for the fulfillment of the service of the holy priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Separating Themselves from the World</h2>
<p>To take up the standing of the priesthood, we must be willing to be separated, sanctified, from the world unto God and His will by leaving the earthly enjoyments and pleasures to live a sanctified life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Submitting Themselves to God</h2>
<p>As Nazarites serving God, we must deal with the rebellion in our nature and live under the Lord&rsquo;s headship, submitting ourselves to God. We need to have a submissive spirit, standing, atmosphere, and intention. Thus, we can be a genuine Nazarite serving God as a priest to fulfill His purpose.</p><h2 class="head1">III. KINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Kingly Ministry</h2>
<p>In the Bible the kingship is equal in importance to the priesthood. Priests have the image of God to express God and bring man into God&rsquo;s presence. Kings have the authority of God to represent God and bring God to man.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Reigning for God</h2>
<p>The kingship is mainly to reign for God, to rule over God&rsquo;s people for God. To reign for God, we need to know God&rsquo;s sovereign authority and submit ourselves under God&rsquo;s authority. David and the Lord Jesus knew God&rsquo;s authority from their heart and always submitted themselves under God&rsquo;s authority so that eventually they could reign for God. Only those who obey authority can represent God as authority to reign for God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Bringing God to Man</h2>
<p>The kings established by God, such as David and Solomon, brought God to man in God&rsquo;s authority. Acts 13:36 says, &ldquo;David, having served his own generation by the counsel of God.&rdquo; This indicates that David&rsquo;s reigning as king brought God to man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Anointed by God</h2>
<p>The kingship is brought in by God&rsquo;s anointing. This can be illustrated by David, who, as the first generation in the age of the kingship, was chosen and anointed by God (1 Sam. 16:10-13) to bring in the kingdom of God. Solomon was anointed by God to be the legal successor to the throne of David (1 Kings 1:32-40). David typifies Christ in His sufferings until His crucifixion; Solomon typifies Christ in His resurrection reigning as the King in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Typifying Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Anointed by God</h2>
<p>When Jesus was baptized, He was anointed by the Spirit of God (Matt. 3:16) to carry out the kingship in His humanity. This was the fulfillment of the word of the prophet Isaiah concerning the anointing of the new King and His introduction to His people (61:1; 42:1). In His ascension He was made Christ (Acts 2:36), God&rsquo;s Anointed, to carry out God&rsquo;s economy and accomplish God&rsquo;s commission.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. As the Ruler<br />
among God&rsquo;s People</h2>
<p>Micah 5:2 prophesied that Christ would be born in Bethlehem to be Ruler in Israel. This was fulfilled in Matthew 2:4-6. Christ as the King reigns for God to shepherd God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. As the King<br />
Ruling over the Nations</h2>
<p>When Christ comes again to possess the earth, He will be the King in the kingdom, governing the earth and ruling over the nations with His overcoming believers (Rev. 20:4, 6; 2:26-27). As the coming King, He will be the Head and the center in the coming kingdom. In His coming reign, God&rsquo;s authority and glory will be fully manifested, and the whole earth with man will be brought into the righteousness, peace, joy, and full blessing of God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Bringing God to Man</h2>
<p>In the divine administration Christ is the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5; Acts 5:31) to rule over the whole world. Today the whole world is under the ruling of Christ. He rules sovereignly over all men, all affairs, and all things for the execution of God&rsquo;s authority to bring God to man for the establishing of the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Typifying the Believers</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Anointed by God</h2>
<p>The believers have been firmly attached by God to Christ, the anointed One; thus, when Christ was anointed to be the King, we were spontaneously anointed with Him by God (2 Cor. 1:21).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. As Kings Reigning with Christ<br />
in the Millennium</h2>
<p>The overcomers will be priests, drawing near to God and Christ, and kings, reigning over the nations with Christ in the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6; 2:26-27; 12:5). As priests, they satisfy God and Christ by enjoying their service, and as kings, they reign for God and represent God, shepherding man for man&rsquo;s enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Bringing God to Man</h2>
<p>Since the believers reign with Christ, they minister with Christ to bring God to others. Today, in a normal situation, proper believers bring others and their need before God and also minister God to others. By exercising the priestly ministry and the kingship, the believers meet the need of both God and man, bringing man to God and bringing God to man that both God and man may have the enjoyment and satisfaction.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. PROPHETS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Prophetic Ministry</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Speaking for God</h2>
<p>Prophets speak for God by God&rsquo;s revelation. Our God, who is a speaking God, spoke in the Old Testament to the people in many portions and in many ways through the prophets (Heb. 1:1 and footnote 2, Recovery Version).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Speaking Forth God</h2>
<p>Prophets receive God&rsquo;s revelation directly and are borne by the Spirit of God to speak for God and speak forth God (2 Pet. 1:21). God is hidden, but through the speaking of the prophets, God Himself and His intention are explained.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Prophesying (Predicting) for God</h2>
<p>Many times when prophets speak for God and speak forth God, they also prophesy, predict, for God. In the Old Testament, especially in the books of the major and minor prophets, many of the speakings of the prophets were in the nature of predictions, conveying beforehand things which God would do or things which would happen, so that they might lead God&rsquo;s people to walk in God&rsquo;s will. No prophecy of Scripture is of the prophet&rsquo;s or writer&rsquo;s own interpretation, because no prophecy was ever borne by the will of man, but men spoke from God while being borne by the Holy Spirit (vv. 20-21).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Assisting the Kings<br />
in Establishing God&rsquo;s Kingdom</h2>
<p>Since the prophets were able to receive God&rsquo;s word directly, they could rebuke, instruct, and teach the kings, thereby assisting them in establishing God&rsquo;s kingdom. In the history of the nation of Israel, whenever the priesthood was weakened and the kingship erred, the prophetic ministry was needed for correction and strengthening. For instance, when the Aaronic priesthood waned, Samuel was raised up by God to speak for Him as a prophet (1 Sam. 3:19-21) and to bring in the kingship for God&rsquo;s authority (16:1-13). The kingship among all the kings of Israel was regulated by the prophets, such as David by Nathan (2 Sam. 12), Ahab by Elijah (1 Kings 18), and Jehoram by Elisha (2 Kings 3), and strengthened by the prophets, such as Hezekiah by Isaiah (chs. 18&mdash;20) and the other kings by Jeremiah (Jer. 1:1-3). After the captivity of Israel because of the kings&rsquo; failures, those in captivity returned through the prayer of Daniel as a prophet (Dan. 6:10; 9:15-27).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Typifying Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Speaking for God</h2>
<p>Christ is the Word of God (John 1:1; Rev. 19:13) and the speaking of God (Heb. 1:2a). When He was on earth speaking for God and teaching people, His teaching was not His own but was according to what the Father had taught Him (John 7:16; 8:28b). He did not speak from Himself; as the Father spoke to Him, so He spoke (12:49-50). Today He is in us still speaking for God to reveal God and speaking God into people.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Ministering God to People in God&rsquo;s Word</h2>
<p>Christ ministers God to people in God&rsquo;s word by speaking God&rsquo;s word. In John 6:63 the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; This shows that the words which He spoke ministered spirit and life, that is, ministered God, to people. He is now the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and the Spirit is embodied in His words. When we receive His words by exercising our spirit, we get the Spirit, who is life, and enjoy God&rsquo;s supply.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Prophesying (Predicting)</h2>
<p>Christ also prophesied, predicted, by declaring &ldquo;many things&rdquo; and &ldquo;the things that are coming&rdquo; (16:12-13). Many of the things which He spoke were in the nature of predictions, such as the things concerning the redemption of Christ, the church, the kingdom of God, the believers&rsquo; rapture, the great tribulation, Christ&rsquo;s coming again, the judgment, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Building Up the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>Christ reveals the word of God for the purpose of building up the Body of Christ (Matt. 16:18). Christ is building His Body, the church, on Christ and on the revelation concerning Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Typifying the Believers</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Prophesying for God</h2>
<p>The New Testament believers are saved by God to be kings, priests, and prophets who prophesy for God (Rev. 1:5-6; 20:4b; 1 Cor. 14:31). God desires that each of the believers prophesy, that is, speak for and speak forth Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Ministering God and Christ to People</h2>
<p>Since prophesying is to speak for and speak forth God, it is ministering God and Christ to people for the edification of the believers in life and in truth. First Corinthians 14:3 says, &ldquo;He who prophesies speaks building up and encouragement and consolation to men.&rdquo; When we practice prophesying, ministering God and Christ to people, we build up people and give them encouragement and consolation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Prophesying (Predicting)</h2>
<p>In prophesying, sometimes there is also predicting. This is one of the manifestations of the believers&rsquo; being filled by the Holy Spirit outwardly (Acts 2:17-18; 19:6; 21:9), causing them to speak beforehand the things that God will do and the things that will happen later.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Building Up the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>Prophesying, speaking forth the Lord, to minister God and Christ builds up not only the individual saints but also the Body of Christ, the church (1 Cor. 14). For this reason, the apostle Paul charged us to desire earnestly the most profitable gift, the gift of prophecy (v. 1), and to seek that we may excel for the building up of the church (v. 12). Among all the gifts, prophesying is the highest and most excellent because it is for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">V. SHEPHERDS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Shepherding Ministry</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament, in addition to the ministries of the priests, kings, and prophets, there was another ministry related to God&rsquo;s people, the ministry of the shepherds (Jer. 23:3-4; Ezek. 34:11-31).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Feeding God&rsquo;s People</h2>
<p>In the Bible God likens His people to a flock, and those who pasture God&rsquo;s people are called shepherds. Shepherds are commissioned by God to feed God&rsquo;s flock so that they may receive the supply of life with full enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Taking Care of God&rsquo;s People</h2>
<p>Besides feeding God&rsquo;s people, shepherds take care of God&rsquo;s people so that they may lie down and have rest. Sometimes shepherds seek out, heal, and rescue.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Teaching God&rsquo;s People</h2>
<p>As a shepherd, one also should teach God&rsquo;s people and open their understanding with the holy Word of God so that they may know God and obey God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Leading God&rsquo;s People</h2>
<p>The most crucial responsibility of a shepherd is to lead God&rsquo;s people so that they are not scattered and led astray but obey and keep God&rsquo;s word and are one flock under God&rsquo;s name.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Typifying Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. As Our Chief Shepherd</h2>
<p>Christ is our Chief Shepherd (1 Pet. 5:4), and He is the Head of all the shepherds. He leads us to feed, look after, teach, and guide the flock of God according to God&rsquo;s intention and to become patterns of the flock (vv. 2-3).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Feeding, Looking After, and<br />
Leading the Believers</h2>
<p>Psalm 23 reveals how Christ as the Shepherd in resurrection feeds, looks after, and leads the believers in five stages: (1) in the enjoyment in green pastures and beside waters of rest (vv. 1-2); (2) in revival and transformation on the paths of righteousness (v. 3); (3) in the presence of the resurrected, pneumatic Christ in the valley of the shadow of death (v. 4); (4) in the deeper and higher enjoyment of the resurrected Christ (v. 5); (5) and in the lifelong enjoyment of the divine goodness and lovingkindness in the house of God (v. 6).</p>
<p>As the good Shepherd (John 10:11, 14), Christ laid down His human life to accomplish redemption for us (vv. 15, 17-18) that we may have His divine life (v. 10b) and be formed into one flock with Himself as the one Shepherd (v. 16). Now He is our soul&rsquo;s Shepherd in the resurrection life within us (1 Pet. 2:25). As such, He guides us within and supplies us with life that we may follow in His steps.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Typifying the Believers</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Shepherding the Church</h2>
<p>Christ is the Chief Shepherd, and the believers are shepherds. Peter entreated the elders to &ldquo;shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing...according to God&rdquo; (5:2). The flock of God, which is the church of God (Acts 20:28), is God&rsquo;s possession, allotted to the believers who have a greater measure of growth in life as their allotment, their portion, and entrusted to them by God for their shepherding (1 Pet. 5:3).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Looking After the Believers</h2>
<p>The believers are not only shepherded corporately in the church; they also need to be looked after individually. In John 21 the Lord appeared to Peter in His resurrection. He came to restore Peter&rsquo;s love toward Him, charging him to feed His lambs (v. 15), that is, to nourish the believers with the riches of the inner life, looking after their needs. Likewise, if we love the Lord, we need to enjoy the riches of the Lord&rsquo;s divine life that we may feed and look after others for the fulfillment of the shepherds&rsquo; responsibility.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Leading the Flock</h2>
<p>Those who are shepherds also need to lead the flock of God to walk in the way ordained by God, according to God&rsquo;s nature, desire, way, and glory, not according to man&rsquo;s preference, interest, and purpose. They should watch diligently to be aware of the flock&rsquo;s situation (1 Pet. 5:2-3) and lead them to walk in the will of God. Thus, they will be approved by God to receive the unfading crown of glory at the manifestation of the Chief Shepherd (v. 4).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Priests, Nazarites, kings, prophets, and shepherds are five kinds of people with special statuses in the Old Testament, typifying Christ and the New Testament believers in these five aspects of their status.</p>
<p>The ministry of the priests is engaged especially in the service of God; their responsibility is to serve God. Their main function is to draw near to God and to wait and remain in His presence. They also present offerings to God, spread the bread of the Presence, tend the lampstand, burn incense before God, teach God&rsquo;s people the law, and bring people to God. This typifies Christ as our High Priest who brings us to God and prays for us so that we may be saved and brought fully into God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. This also typifies that the believers are engaged especially in serving God to bring men to God and that they, as New Testament priests of the gospel, offer spiritual sacrifices to God.</p>
<p>Nazarites are those who have voluntarily consecrated themselves, who are separated from worldliness, and who have submitted themselves to God. This typifies Christ as One who voluntarily consecrated Himself to God, who sanctified Himself to God, and who submitted Himself to God for the accomplishment of the eternal purpose of God to whom He is in subordination. This also typifies the believers who consecrate themselves to God, are separated from the world, and submit themselves to God to fulfill His purpose.</p>
<p>The kingship is mainly to reign for God, to represent God, and to bring God to man. It is equal in importance to the priesthood and is brought in by God&rsquo;s anointing. This typifies that Christ was anointed by God to be the Ruler among God&rsquo;s people and to be the King ruling over the nations. Today He is the Ruler of the kings of the earth, ruling sovereignly over all men, all affairs, and all things for the execution of God&rsquo;s authority to bring God to man for the establishing of the kingdom of God. This also typifies that the believers have been anointed with Christ by God and that the overcoming believers will reign with Christ. Today the proper believers also minister with Christ to bring God to men that they may have enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Prophets are those who speak for God by God&rsquo;s revelation. Their ministry is to speak for God, to speak forth God, to prophesy (predict) for God, and to assist the kings in establishing God&rsquo;s kingdom. This typifies Christ speaking for God, ministering God to people in God&rsquo;s word, and prophesying for the purpose of building up the Body of Christ. This also typifies the believers who prophesy for God, minister God and Christ to people, and sometimes prophesy by predicting. To prophesy by speaking forth the Lord is to minister God and Christ to build up the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Shepherds are those who pasture the people of God. The shepherding ministry is to feed, take care of, teach, and lead the people of God. This typifies Christ as our Chief Shepherd, feeding, looking after, and leading the believers and, as our soul&rsquo;s Shepherd in the resurrection life, guiding us within and supplying us with life that we may follow in His steps. This also typifies the believers as the shepherds who pasture the church, nourishing and looking after one another with the riches of the inner life, leading the flock to walk in the way ordained by God and in the will of God.</p>

</ol><h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>There are three things in the book of Numbers which are rich in spiritual meaning, functioning as types and symbols. These three things are the fringes, the water for impurity, and the cities of refuge.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE FRINGES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Fringes Indicating Beauty</h2>
<p>Numbers 15:37-41 gives a record of the ordinance concerning the dress of God&rsquo;s people. &ldquo;Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the children of Israel and tell them to make for themselves fringes on the borders of their garments throughout their generations&rdquo; (vv. 37-38a). Garments signify the conduct of God&rsquo;s people before Him. God required the children of Israel to make fringes on the borders of their garments, indicating that He wants His people to have a beautiful expression in their conduct before Him; He wants us to walk worthily of the calling with which we were called (Eph. 4:1).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. A Cord of Blue Signifying a Heavenly Binding</h2>
<p>Furthermore, God told the people of Israel to put a cord of blue on the fringe of each border (Num. 15:38b). Blue, a heavenly color, signifies a heavenly expression; the cord signifies binding, restriction. Hence, a cord of blue signifies that God wants His people to have a heavenly binding and a heavenly expression in their conduct. A cord of blue signifies that our conduct and behavior, as children of God with the divine nature, should be beautiful and under the heavenly ruling and binding for the manifestation of human virtues.</p>
<p>The people of Israel were to look upon the fringe and remember the commandments of Jehovah and do them; they were not to seek after their own heart and own eyes, according to which they had committed fornication. Thus, the people would remember and do all God&rsquo;s commandments and be holy to God (vv. 39-41).</p>
<p>According to the record of the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus wore this kind of garment. One day a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years came to touch the fringe of His garment with faith. The power of the Lord&rsquo;s human virtues came upon her, and she was healed (Matt. 9:20-22). Out of Christ&rsquo;s heaven-ruled deeds issued the virtue which became the healing power (14:36). Both God&rsquo;s ordinance and the Lord&rsquo;s conduct indicate that we should walk under the heavenly binding as children of God. As people of the kingdom of the heavens, we should be bound not by the police or law courts but by a heavenly binding, by the heavenly government and ruling. This will produce a beauty in our human conduct that we may be sanctified and glorify God. Therefore, Peter exhorted us as strangers and sojourners to live a life in an excellent manner toward all men in all concerns (1 Pet. 2:11&mdash;3:13), abstaining from fleshly lusts, on one hand, and having a manner of life excellent among the Gentiles so that God may be glorified, on the other hand.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE WATER FOR IMPURITY</h2>
<p>After the rebellion of the children of Israel in Numbers 16 and 17 and as a result of God&rsquo;s punishment, their corpses lay throughout the land and the filthiness of death spread everywhere. The entire population of the Israelites was under the effect of death. They were all in a situation of impurity. Thus, in chapter 19 God told them to prepare the water for impurity with a red heifer that they might use the water to get rid of the filthiness of death with which they were affected.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Its Composition</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. A Red Heifer</h2>
<p>&ldquo;This is the statute of the law which Jehovah has commanded, saying, Tell the children of Israel to bring you a red heifer without defect, in which is no blemish and upon which a yoke has never come. And you shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and someone shall bring it outside the camp and slaughter it in his presence&rdquo; (vv. 2-3). This heifer, the principal component of the water for impurity, signifies Christ for our redemption. The color red signifies the likeness of the flesh of sin, which is for the bearing of man&rsquo;s sin outwardly. When Christ was incarnated, He became in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3). Furthermore, the heifer was without defect. This signifies that the redeeming Christ was without sin. Although Christ was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, there was no sin within Him. He did not have the sinful nature, and He did not know sin (2 Cor. 5:21). The heifer also had no blemish. This indicates that Christ was perfect. Furthermore, the heifer had never come under a yoke. This signifies that Christ was not used by anyone, especially by or for God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan. Eventually, Christ accomplished God&rsquo;s redemption by being crucified outside the camp on Calvary (Heb. 13:12-13), a small mount outside the city of Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Cedar Wood, Hyssop, and Scarlet</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet strands, and cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer&rdquo; (Num. 19:6). Cedar wood signifies Christ in His dignified humanity, hyssop signifies Christ in His humbled humanity, and scarlet signifies redemption in its highest significance. This indicates that the high and dignified Christ and the lowly and humbled Christ in His redemption were elements for the composition of the water for impurity.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Living Water for Purification</h2>
<p>&ldquo;A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and place them outside the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the assembly of the children of Israel as water for impurity; it is a sin offering&rdquo; (v. 9). The burning of the heifer with the other elements produced ashes, which signify Christ reduced to nothing. These ashes were kept for the water for impurity; it was a purification of sin, or a sin offering. Verse 17 says, &ldquo;For the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin offering, and running water shall be added to them in a vessel.&rdquo; The running water, that is, the living water, put in the vessel, signifies the Holy Spirit in the resurrection of Christ. Hence, in the water for impurity, there is the efficacy of Christ&rsquo;s redemption with the washing power of the Spirit of His resurrection.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Its Usage</h2>
<p>Now we shall see the usage of the water for impurity.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. To Be Sprinkled upon Unclean Persons</h2>
<p>The water for impurity was to be sprinkled upon unclean persons: those who touched a dead body, who came into a tent or were in a tent in which a man died, who touched one who had been slain with a sword, a dead body, a human bone, or a grave (vv. 11-14, 16-20). Death comes out of sin, and sin is the root of death (Rom. 5:12). From the sin of rebellion, death was prevailing among the children of Israel. Thus, there was a need for the water for impurity. Only the working of Christ&rsquo;s redemption, through His dignified and humbled humanity and with His death and the Spirit of His resurrection, could heal and cleanse the situation of God&rsquo;s people, a situation full of death.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. To Be Sprinkled<br />
upon the Tent in Which a Man Dies<br />
and upon the Open Vessels and Furnishings in It</h2>
<p>The water for impurity was also sprinkled upon the tent in which a man died and upon all the open vessels and furnishings in the tent for their cleansing (Num. 19:15, 18). Because of the universal rebellion among God&rsquo;s people, death overshadowed the entire people of God so that the tents and every vessel in the tents were contaminated. No matter where someone went or what he touched, he was unclean. By sprinkling the water for impurity, the entire situation of the children of Israel was cleansed from the effect of death because of their sin of rebellion. It is the same with us today. Only the efficacy of redemption, accomplished through the death of Christ, and the washing power of the Spirit, accomplished through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, can annul the effect and impurity of death brought in by our committing of sins.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE CITIES OF REFUGE</h2>
<p>In Numbers 35 God wanted the children of Israel to set up six cities as cities of refuge in places distributed for their dwelling so that the manslayer who killed a person unintentionally might flee there to escape death. This shows that God&rsquo;s redemption for His chosen people is thorough and complete.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Number of the Cities of Refuge</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. A Total of Six Cities</h2>
<p>The cities of refuge were six in number (v. 13). The number six signifies mistake-making man, who was created by God on the sixth day (Gen. 1:26-27, 31). Hence, God commanded that cities of refuge be set up that the refuge of God might be brought to sinful man.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Divided into Two Sets of Three Cities Each</h2>
<p>The cities of refuges were divided into two sets of three cities each. The number three signifies the Triune God as the refuge for the man who makes mistakes. God regards us as those who make mistakes, and He has ordained that there be a refuge into which we may flee; that is, He came to be our redemption. The number two signifies a testimony standing in the universe. The two sets of cities of refuge testify and declare to the universe that the Triune God is living on earth among human beings to be their city of refuge.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Distribution of the Cities</h2>
<p>God ordained six cities of refuge, three across the Jordan, that is, east of the Jordan, and three in the land of Canaan, that is, west of the Jordan (Num. 35:14). This shows that the cities of refuge were distributed in different places, indicating that God has come to where man is in order to approach man. The Triune God is near and available to us. Regardless of where we are, the Triune God is available as our city of refuge.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Six Cities Being the Same Distance<br />
from Each Other</h2>
<p>The six cities were the same distance from each other for the convenience of fleeing there by anyone who killed a person unintentionally. This indicates that the Triune God has spread Himself among men, to the very place where we are, to be a city of refuge for all those who make mistakes.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Function of the Cities</h2>
<p>The cities of refuge were provided so that a manslayer who killed any person unintentionally may flee there (v. 11b). Verse 12 says, &ldquo;The cities shall be for you as a refuge from the avenger, so that the manslayer may not die unless he stands before the assembly for judgment.&rdquo; In this way a manslayer could be protected from the avenger. However, the cities of refuge were not for murderers, those who killed with an intent (vv. 16-21). They were only for one who killed unintentionally so that he might be delivered out of the hand of the avenger of blood and come under the judgment of the assembly (vv. 22-25a). Adam sinned without intent, and we, the descendants of Adam, have sinned in the same way (cf. Rom. 7:15-24). Our sinning today is foolish and nonsensical. Therefore, in the sight of God we are those who sin without intent, and He considers our sinning as being without intent and thus has prepared cities of refuge for us. In those days the cities of refuge were not only for the children of Israel but also for the stranger and sojourner among them (v. 15). This signifies that the Triune God as a refuge for mistake-making man is for all mankind. Today both Jews and Gentiles have a refuge in the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Duration of Stay in the Cities of Refuge</h2>
<p>The rescued killer was to remain in the city of refuge and live in it until the death of the anointed high priest. After the death of the high priest, he could return to the land of his possession (vv. 25b-29). The need of the one who fled to the city of refuge to live in it until the death of the high priest signifies that the redemption of Christ, our High Priest, became effective in releasing us at the time of His death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Cities of Refuge<br />
Typifying Christ as Our Refuge</h2>
<p>The cities of refuge typify that Christ, as the embodiment of the Triune God, is our refuge. For Old Testament saints, such as Abraham, David, and Isaiah, the city of refuge was like the fold in John 10. These saints had to remain in this refuge, in this fold, until Christ, the High Priest, died. No ransom could have released them before the time of Christ&rsquo;s death (Num. 35:32), but now that Christ has died and resurrected, we, who have sinned unintentionally, can flee into Him to be redeemed and to be in the good land enjoying the blessed portion given to us by God. This is truly a picture full of God&rsquo;s mercy, grace, wisdom, and sovereignty.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The fringes, the water for impurity, and the cities of refuge are rich in spiritual meaning, functioning as types and symbols. The fringes indicate beauty, and a cord of blue on the fringe signifies a heavenly binding. This indicates that, as people of the kingdom of the heavens, we should be bound by the heavenly binding and ruling to produce a beauty in our human conduct that we may be sanctified and glorify God.</p>
<p>The water for impurity is the water which was used to get rid of the filthiness of death with which the children of Israel were affected. The water for impurity was composed of a red heifer, the principal component, which signifies that Christ, who is sinless and perfect and who has never been used by anyone, is our redemption. Other components were cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet strands, signifying that the high and dignified Christ and the lowly and humbled Christ in His redemption were elements in the composition of the water for impurity. There was also living water for purification, which signifies the Spirit in the resurrection of Christ. Hence, the water for impurity signifies that the efficacy of Christ&rsquo;s redemption with the washing power of the Spirit of His resurrection can heal and cleanse the situation of God&rsquo;s people, a situation which is full of death, and annul the effect of death and impurity brought in by our committing of sins.</p>
<p>The cities of refuge were for a manslayer, someone who killed a person unintentionally, to flee there to escape death. There were six cities of refuge, divided into two sets of three cities. Three cities were on the east of the Jordan, and three cities were on the west of the Jordan. Moreover, the six cities were the same distance from each other. This signifies that the Triune God, as the refuge for all those who make mistakes, dwells on earth among mankind to be their refuge, and that the Triune God, who has spread Himself among men to be a city of refuge for all those who make mistakes, is near and convenient. Regardless of where we are, we can flee into Him. As such a refuge, the Triune God is for all mankind. Everyone, including Jews and Gentiles, has a refuge in the Triune God. The one who fled to the city of refuge had to live in it until the death of the high priest, signifying that the redemption of Christ, our High Priest, became effective in releasing us at the time of His death. The picture of the cities of refuge typifies that Christ, as the embodiment of the Triune God, is our refuge. Now that Christ has died and resurrected, sinners can flee into Him to be redeemed and to be in the good land enjoying the blessed portion given to us by God.</p>

</ol><h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Five seemingly unrelated items&mdash;the bronze serpent, the one hanging on a tree, the hind of the dawn, and the bridegroom and the bride&mdash;are considered together in this lesson. In the Old Testament these five items typify Christ in different aspects. The first two items signify the crucified Christ, the third item signifies the resurrected Christ, and the last two items signify Christ in His resurrection as the Bridegroom gaining the church as His bride. In the typology of the Old Testament these five items seem unconnected, but in the spiritual significance of the New Testament they are connected&mdash;Christ died and resurrected as the Bridegroom to obtain the church as His bride.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE BRONZE SERPENT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Need for the Bronze Serpent</h2>
<p>In Numbers 21 the people of Israel became impatient because the way in the wilderness was very difficult, and the people spoke against God and Moses. Then God sent fiery serpents among the people, and the people were bitten by the fiery serpents so that many of them died. When the people repented and confessed their sins, God commanded Moses to make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole, lifting it up, to suffer God&rsquo;s judgment as a replacement for the people and to redeem them from their sins. When they would look at the bronze serpent, they would live and not die (vv. 4-9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Form of the Bronze Serpent</h2>
<p>The bronze serpent had the form of the fiery serpent but was without the fiery serpent&rsquo;s poison. When the children of Israel were bitten by the fiery serpents, they became serpents in the eyes of God. They were serpentine and had the serpentine nature. The bronze serpent, however, had only the form of a serpent, not the nature of a serpent. Hence, it was qualified to suffer God&rsquo;s judgment as a replacement for the people of Israel, who had the serpentine nature.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Bronze Serpent Being Lifted Up on a Pole</h2>
<p>The bronze serpent was lifted up on a pole so that the people could look at it and live. The people of Israel, who had become serpentine, should have suffered God&rsquo;s judgment unto death. However, according to God&rsquo;s saving way, when the bronze serpent, which had only the form but not the poison of a serpent, was lifted up on the pole, it became their replacement to suffer the judgment of God. They lived by looking at the bronze serpent.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Bronze Serpent Typifying Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Made Sin on Our Behalf</h2>
<p>In John 3:14 the Lord said, &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&rdquo; This shows that the bronze serpent lifted up by Moses in the wilderness typifies Christ, who was made sin on our behalf so that He might deliver us out of death into life (2 Cor. 5:21). We were bitten by the old serpent and have the poisonous element of sin. Sin came from Satan, who rebelled against God (Isa. 14:12-14). This sin, which came out of the evil one, entered into man and made man not only a sinner but also sin itself under God&rsquo;s judgment; hence, when Christ became a man in the flesh (Rom. 5:12; John 1:14), He was made sin (not sinful) on our behalf to be judged by God (Rom. 8:3).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Having Only the Likeness of the Flesh of Sin<br />
but Not the Poisonous Element of Sin</h2>
<p>The bronze serpent had the form of a serpent but not the poisonous element of a serpent. This is a full type of Christ coming in the likeness of the flesh of sin to be our replacement (v. 3). The flesh is of sin, yet Christ became flesh (John 1:14; Heb. 2:14). However, He was only in the likeness of the flesh; He did not have the sin of the flesh (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15). He was the same as a sinful man in His outward form, but He did not have the nature of sin within Him. This is like the bronze serpent, which had the form, the likeness, of a serpent but not the poison of a serpent. Only such a Christ, who did not know sin, could bear God&rsquo;s judgment on behalf of us sinners, who were poisoned by sin, and could deal with Satan, who poisoned us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Condemning Sin<br />
through His Crucifixion in the Flesh</h2>
<p>Christ became flesh for us, and in the flesh He was judged by God on behalf of us who have the sinful nature. In Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion God caused Him who knew no sin to become sin on our behalf (2 Cor. 5:21). Through this, God condemned sin in the flesh, judged sin for us, and dealt with the sin in our nature and the sinful nature to which it belongs (Rom. 8:3). As a result, we have the eternal life by believing in Him (John 3:15). This can be compared to the people of Israel, who were poisoned by the serpents and lived by looking at the bronze serpent on the pole. Our sins have been taken away, our serpentine nature has been dealt with, and Satan has been destroyed in us; thus, we have the life of God.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE ONE HANGING ON A TREE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being One Who Sinned</h2>
<p>In reiterating the statutes of the law of God in Deuteronomy 21:22, Moses said, &ldquo;If in a man there is a sin, a cause worthy of death, and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree.&rdquo; Hanging on a tree was punishment for one who committed a crime worthy of death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being One Who Was Cursed</h2>
<p>In the same chapter Moses said that a person who committed a crime worthy of death and was hanged on a tree was accursed of God (v. 23).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Typifying Christ</h2>
<p>A person who was cursed and hanged on a tree to die is a type of the crucified Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Hanging on the Tree<br />
for Us Who Sin and Deserve Death</h2>
<p>First Peter 2:24 speaks of Christ, who &ldquo;bore up our sins in His body on the tree.&rdquo; As prophesied in the Old Testament, when Christ offered Himself as a sacrifice for our sins (Heb. 7:27), it was in His body that He was hanged on the tree for us, who have sinned and who deserve death; He bore up our sins on the cross, the true altar for propitiation, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Suffering the Curse of Death<br />
for Us Sinners Who Deserve Death</h2>
<p>After the fall of Adam, sin entered into the world through one man (Rom. 5:12). Furthermore, through the disobedience of one man all were constituted sinners (v. 19). Hence, before God we all are sinners who deserve death and the curse of death. Galatians 3:13 says, &ldquo;Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, &lsquo;Cursed is everyone hanging on a tree&rsquo;.&rdquo; As our Substitute on the cross, Christ not only bore the curse for us but also became a curse for us. The curse of the law issued from the sin of man (Gen. 3:17). When Christ suffered the curse of death on the cross for us sinners, who deserve death, He redeemed us out of the curse of the law.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. That We Might Receive<br />
the Spirit Promised by God</h2>
<p>Galatians 3:14 goes on to say, &ldquo;In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&rdquo; When Christ suffered the curse of death before God for us sinners, who deserve death, He delivered us out of the curse of the law so that we might receive the life-giving Spirit with the eternal life of God. In the gospel we have received not only the blessing of forgiveness, washing, and cleansing; we have received the greatest blessing, which is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;as the processed, all-inclusive life-giving Spirit dwelling in us in a most subjective way for our enjoyment. What a blessing that we can enjoy such an all-inclusive One as our daily portion!</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE HIND OF THE DAWN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Typifying the Resurrected Christ</h2>
<p>Psalm 22:1-21 speaks of Christ standing for God and being put to shame by people in His crucifixion. Then it speaks concerning His coming in resurrection to declare the name of God the Father to His brothers, whom He produced in resurrection, as the church (v. 22; Heb. 2:12). The title of Psalm 22 refers to &ldquo;the hind of the dawn.&rdquo; According to the contents of this psalm, the hind of the dawn refers to the resurrected Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Fresh and Active</h2>
<p>The dawn, referring to the morning, is the new beginning of a day, denoting the freshness of resurrection. The life of Christ in His resurrection is fresh. The hind usually runs on the mountaintop and is very active and full of energy. This denotes Christ in His resurrection as the One who is active, lively, and powerful. With the moving strength of His resurrection life, He is able to walk steadily in high places. There is nothing that can hinder Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. A Young Hart</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Having Fellowship with Us</h2>
<p>Song of Songs 2:8-9 speaks of Christ as the Bridegroom who is like a young hart, leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills, denoting His freshness and vigor. <em>Leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills</em> indicates being full of liveliness and full of power. A young hart has a lowly appearance and is lovable and endearing. The Lord is full of liveliness and power, yet He is neither dreadful nor fearsome but endearing and desirable. He seeks us in this way to have fellowship with us; He does not want to be separated from us (v. 17).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Coming Back to Meet with Us</h2>
<p>Song of Songs 8 ends with Christ as the Bridegroom who is like a young hart upon the mountains of spices (v. 14). This typifies that Christ in His coming back will descend in His kingdom as the resurrected One and will receive us into the kingdom of God to enjoy His presence. This kingdom is brought in through the lovers and pursuers of the Lord in their fellowship and union with Him.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE BRIDEGROOM AND THE BRIDE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Typifying Christ and the Church</h2>
<p>According to Song of Songs, the king is the bridegroom and the maiden who adores and pursues him is his bride (1:13-16). This is a type of Christ and the church as the universal couple. The Bible reveals that God in Christ is the Bridegroom of His elect as His bride. Ephesians 5:22-33 shows that the husband and the wife are a type of Christ and the church as the great mystery. Hence, 2 Corinthians 11:2 shows that the church, constituted with all the believers, is the wife betrothed to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. In His Resurrection</h2>
<p>The church as the bride of Christ is produced by Christ in His resurrection. Christ regenerated all the believers in His resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3) so that the believers were begotten with Him of the same Father and have the same life and nature to constitute the church as His counterpart to match Him (John 20:17; Heb. 2:11-12).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Christ Being Lovely as the Bridegroom</h2>
<p>Song of Songs 5:10-16 portrays Christ in resurrection as the lovely Bridegroom. In His resurrection He is full of life and full of power; He is the One whom we look to and follow and who is leading us in a triumphal procession (John 12:32; 2 Cor. 2:14). Furthermore, He has God&rsquo;s nature and glory, and He is our Head. He is rich in power and never fading, and He is intimately affectionate toward us.</p>
<p>All that He has is firm and unshakable because it is based upon God&rsquo;s nature and because of His righteousness. He is transcendent and heavenly, and He is the resurrected and glorified One. He transfuses into us all that He has received and tasted of God. With such a Christ in resurrection, we cannot but be burning in our heart and cry out, &ldquo;He is altogether desirable!&rdquo; This One is &ldquo;my Beloved!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Obtaining the Church as the Bride</h2>
<p>John 3:29 says, &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom.&rdquo; Christ, who is the Bridegroom, has the divine life and nature. Through His resurrection He produced the church that the church may have His divine life and nature and be qualified to match Him, that is, to become His bride to match Him, the Bridegroom. Now we need to live with Christ and live to Christ (2 Cor. 5:15), taking Him as our person that we may grow and become His satisfaction. Then at the end of this age, Christ will come to marry His bride and enjoy a married life together with His bride for eternity (Rev. 19:7; 21:9).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In the typology of the Old Testament, five items&mdash;the bronze serpent, the one hanging on a tree, the hind of the dawn, and the bridegroom and the bride&mdash;are seemingly different from one another. However, in the spiritual significance of the New Testament they are connected&mdash;Christ died and resurrected as the Bridegroom to obtain the church as His bride.</p>
<p>The bronze serpent had the form of the fiery serpent but was without the fiery serpent&rsquo;s poison. When the children of Israel were bitten by the fiery serpents, they became serpents in the eyes of God and deserved God&rsquo;s judgment unto death. However, according to God&rsquo;s saving way, when the bronze serpent, which had only the form but not the poison of a serpent, was lifted up on the pole, it became their replacement to suffer the judgment of God. They lived by looking at the bronze serpent. This is a type of Christ being made sin on our behalf to be the same as a sinful man but having only the form of the flesh of sin and not the poison of sin. Through Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion in the flesh, God condemned sin in the flesh, judged sin for us, and dealt with the sin in our nature and the sinful nature to which it belongs. Furthermore, He annulled Satan in us that we may have eternal life by believing in Christ.</p>
<p>The one hanging on a tree is a type of Christ, who was hanged on the tree as the replacement for us, who have sinned and deserve death. He bore up our sins on the cross that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness. Moreover, He suffered the curse of death for us sinners, who deserve death, and thus redeemed us out of the curse of the law that we may receive the Spirit promised by God.</p>
<p>The hind of the dawn typifies the resurrected Christ. The life of Christ in resurrection is fresh, active, lively, and powerful, and He is able to walk steadily in high places. There is nothing that can hinder Him. Christ is likened also to a young hart, indicating that Christ is fresh and vigorous, yet He is neither dreadful nor fearsome but endearing and desirable for having fellowship with us and also for coming back to meet with us and to receive us into the kingdom of God to enjoy His presence.</p>
<p>The bridegroom and the bride are a type of Christ and the church as the universal couple. The Bible reveals that God in Christ is the Bridegroom of His elect as His bride. Ephesians 5:22-33 shows that the husband and the wife are a type of Christ and the church as the great mystery. The church as the bride of Christ is produced by Christ in His resurrection. Christ regenerated all the believers in His resurrection so that the believers were begotten with Him of the same Father and have the same life and nature to constitute the church as His counterpart to match Him.</p>

</ol>
<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>After Israel&rsquo;s thirty-eight years of wandering in the wilderness, all the men of their first generation, except Joshua and Caleb, fell dead in the wilderness. The remaining second generation, the new generation, arrived at the plain on the east of the Jordan, and after they received renewed training by Moses in the reiteration of the law (Deut. 1), they crossed the Jordan and entered into the good land. The Jordan River typifies the death and resurrection of Christ, and the crossing of the Jordan River typifies the believers&rsquo; baptism.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE JORDAN RIVER TYPIFYING<br />
THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Joshua 3 and 4 cover Israel&rsquo;s crossing of the Jordan. The Jordan River signifies the death and resurrection of Christ. The Ark of God and the priests who bore it took the lead to go into the waters of the Jordan and stood in the waters (3:3, 6, 8, 10-11, 14). The Ark is a type of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God. The Ark&rsquo;s entering into and coming out of the Jordan indicates the death and resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>The children of Israel passed through the death of Christ to bury their old man and to become a new man in Christ for fighting spiritual warfare. This shows that our natural man, our old man, is altogether unqualified to fight spiritual warfare for Christ. God&rsquo;s intention is to join us to Christ that we may have an organic union with Him and become one with Him and that His history may become our history. In our union with Christ, His experiences become ours. He died on the cross, and we died with Him. He was buried, and we were buried with Him. He was resurrected from the dead, and we were resurrected with Him. Ephesians 2:5-6 says that we were dead in offenses, but God made us alive together with Christ and raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being the Death of Christ<br />
into Which the Believers Have Been Baptized</h2>
<p>In the New Testament the first baptism of the believers took place in the Jordan (Matt. 3:6). According to the spiritual principle in the Scriptures, the first mention concerning a matter becomes the spiritual significance of that matter. The first mention of the believers&rsquo; baptism takes place in the Jordan. Hence, according to the meaning in typology, the Jordan River denotes the death of Christ into which the believers have been baptized. According to the fact, the believers have been baptized into the death of Christ.</p>
<p>Romans 6:3 says, &ldquo;Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?&rdquo; Baptism is not a form or a ritual; it signifies our identification with Christ. Christ and His death are one. Christ&rsquo;s death has separated us from the world and the satanic power of darkness; it has terminated our natural life, our old man, our self, our flesh, and even our entire history. The former is signified by the crossing of the Red Sea and the latter by the crossing of the Jordan River. Through baptism we were buried with Christ into death. We did not die directly; we entered into Christ&rsquo;s death through baptism.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being Led to the Resurrection of Christ</h2>
<p>The death of Christ leads us to His resurrection. The believers&rsquo; baptism into the death of Christ, as the crossing of the Jordan River, leads the believers into the resurrection of Christ. Colossians 2:12 says, &ldquo;Buried together with Him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead.&rdquo; In the aspect of burial, baptism is the termination of our flesh; in the aspect of resurrection, baptism is the germination of our spirit so that we are made alive in Christ with the divine life. In the new realm of resurrection we enjoy Christ as the all-inclusive good land in which we walk and even are being rooted and built up for the accomplishing of the economy of God (Rom. 6:4; Col. 2:7).</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE CROSSING OF THE JORDAN RIVER<br />
TYPIFYING BAPTISM</h2>
<p>The first generation of the children of Israel was baptized in the Red Sea when they came out of Egypt, and the second generation was baptized in the Jordan River when they entered into Canaan, the good land.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Burying the Old Man</h2>
<p>When the first generation of the children of Israel was baptized in the Red Sea, they buried the power of Egypt, that is, the power of the world (Exo. 14:27). The baptism of the second generation of the children of Israel in the Jordan River buried their old man, signified by the twelve stones which were left in the Jordan.</p>
<p>According to Joshua 4:9, Joshua erected twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who carried the Ark had stood. These twelve stones signify the twelve tribes of Israel in their old life and in their old nature. Joshua erected these twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan where the Ark was, signifying that the Lord buried Israel in their old nature under the death water of the Jordan. This typifies the old man of the believers being buried with Christ through baptism. Our old man was crucified in Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion and buried with Him in baptism, signified by the crossing of the Jordan (Rom. 6:6, 4a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being Ushered<br />
into Resurrection to Bring Forth<br />
the New Man</h2>
<p>When the second generation of the children of Israel passed through the Jordan, twelve representatives of the twelve tribes of Israel took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan and brought them over and laid them in the place where Israel lodged that night (Josh. 4:1-5, 8). When they passed through the death of the Jordan and came up out of the death river, they entered into resurrection to become a new people. This is signified by the twelve stones which they took from the Jordan. Hence, they entered into the good land in a new state of resurrection.</p>
<p>This signifies that the New Testament believers experience resurrection from death with Christ through baptism. Romans 6 shows that after our baptism, we have become the new man in resurrection to walk in newness of life (v. 4), that is, to grow together with Him in the likeness of His resurrection (v. 5).</p>

<p class=otl2t>TEXT</p>
<p>The book of Ruth is the shortest among the historical books of the Old Testament, yet the story recorded in it concerning Ruth and Boaz carries great spiritual and typological significance. A Gentile, even a Moabitess, was joined to the holy elect of God and became an heir to partake of the divine inheritance through her union with the person among the holy elect who redeemed her. This is a complete prefigure of the Gentile sinners&rsquo; being brought with Israel, God&rsquo;s elect, into the divine inheritance through the redemption of Christ in their union with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. RUTH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being One of the Moabites,<br />
Who Were Forbidden to Enter<br />
the Holy Congregation of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Ruth&rsquo;s ancestor was Moab, who was the fruit of Lot&rsquo;s incestuous union with his daughter (Gen. 19:31-38). She was a descendant of a people who also did not take care of the children of Israel in their hard journey out of Egypt and instead hired Balaam to curse them. They were prohibited by God from entering the holy congregation of Jehovah, and God did not allow Israel to seek peace and prosperity with them (Deut. 23:2-6). Ruth was not only a Gentile sinner but also a descendant of a people born in incest and rejected by God. She was a person of low birth, and she had nothing to do with God, having no God and no hope.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Becoming a Part of Israel and<br />
Partaking of Her Husband&rsquo;s Inheritance<br />
through Marriage</h2>
<p>Ruth 1:1-4 presents a record of Elimelech, a man from Bethlehem in Judah who went down to Moab to escape famine. Ruth became a part of Israel because she married one of Elimelech&rsquo;s sons and partook of her husband&rsquo;s inheritance.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Choosing God and His Kingdom</h2>
<p>Both Ruth&rsquo;s husband and his brother died without leaving any descendants, and her husband had no other brother who could marry her to bear children for her husband. Nevertheless, she followed her widowed mother-in-law to the land of Judah to be a citizen of Israel and to receive the God of Israel as her God.</p>
<p>When her mother-in-law urged her to return to her people and to her gods, Ruth said, &ldquo;Do not entreat me to leave you and turn away from following after you. For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you dwell, I will dwell; and your people will be my people, and your God will be my God&rdquo; (v. 16). Ruth chose the goal of God and His kingdom in order to participate with God&rsquo;s elect in the enjoyment of Christ. Eventually, she became an important ancestor of Christ, one who helped bring forth Christ into mankind (Matt. 1:5).</p>
<p>Regardless of who we are and what our background is, we are in a position to be accepted into the birthright of Christ as long as we have a heart that seeks God and His people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Exercising Her Right<br />
to Glean the Harvest of God&rsquo;s Elect</h2>
<p>Ruth returned to Bethlehem with her mother-in-law at the beginning of the barley harvest (Ruth 1:22b). However, they returned empty, having nothing, and thus became needy ones among God&rsquo;s elect. According to God&rsquo;s loving care, when the children of Israel reaped the harvest of their land, they were not to completely reap the corners of their field, neither were they to gather the gleanings of their harvest; they were to leave them for the poor and the sojourner (Lev. 23:22; 19:9-10). If they forgot a sheaf in the field, they were not to turn back to gather it; it was for the sojourner, the orphan, and the widow (Deut. 24:19). Ruth came to the good land, and according to her threefold status as a sojourner, a poor one, and a widow, she exercised her right to glean the harvest. Her gleaning was not a begging; it was an exercising of her right. Ruth, a Moabitess, a heathen sinner, alienated from God&rsquo;s promises (Eph. 2:12), was privileged to partake of the crumbs under the table of the portion of God&rsquo;s elect children (Matt. 15:25-28).</p>
<p>This portrays that sinners have the way, the position, the qualification, and the right to participate in Christ and to enjoy Christ. According to God&rsquo;s ordination, we have been qualified and positioned to exercise our right to enjoy Christ. We do not need to beg God to save us. We can go to God to claim His salvation for ourselves. This is the highest standard of receiving the gospel. We have the position, qualification, and right to claim salvation from God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Gaining a Redeeming Husband</h2>
<p>Ruth not only had the right to partake of the rich produce of the inheritance of God&rsquo;s elect, but under the prodding of her mother-in-law, she also sought a resting place (Ruth 3:1). According to God&rsquo;s ordination in Leviticus 25:25, &ldquo;If your brother becomes poor and sells some of his possession, then his redeemer, the nearest relative, shall come and redeem what his brother has sold.&rdquo; Moreover, according to Deuteronomy 25:5-9, if brothers dwelled together and one died and had no son, the wife of the deceased man should not become the wife of a stranger outside the family, but her husband&rsquo;s brother should take her as his wife to bear a child for his deceased brother. Therefore, according to her mother-in-law&rsquo;s charge and based upon the God-ordained way (Ruth 3:6), Ruth approached Boaz, who was a kinsman of her deceased husband. She was accepted by Boaz and received his promise and generous care (vv. 10-15). Eventually, she was married to Boaz and was redeemed by him to be his wife (4:9-10). Her actions were witnessed and blessed by the people and the elders in the gate. She was also blessed by God to conceive and bring forth a son. Thus, she became a crucial ancestor in the genealogy of Christ to bring in the royal house of David to continue the line of God-created humanity for the incarnation of Christ to accomplish the eternal economy of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Typifying the Church of the Gentiles</h2>
<p>Ruth typifies the church of the Gentiles, composed of Gentile sinners who were alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and without God in the world, yet who are now fellow citizens with the saints, having God as their God (Eph. 2:11-13, 16, 19).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Before Her Salvation, as Men<br />
in God&rsquo;s Creation and Sinners in Man&rsquo;s Fall</h2>
<p>Being a woman in Adam in God&rsquo;s creation and a Moabitess in man&rsquo;s fall, Ruth typifies the church in her status as the old man before salvation in two aspects&mdash;as men in God&rsquo;s creation and as sinners in man&rsquo;s fall (Rom. 6:6). Ruth had an incestuous background, and we all have the same background. Adam and Eve joined themselves to Satan; that is, they married Satan. This was the initiation of incest. Hence, the Moabites typify all sinners, because all sinners are born of incest.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. With Her Old Man as Her Crucified Husband Redeemed by Christ for the Recovery<br />
of the Lost Right of Her Natural Man<br />
in God&rsquo;s Creation</h2>
<p>Ruth, as the widow of the dead husband, was redeemed by Boaz, who cleared the indebtedness of her dead husband to recover the lost right to her dead husband&rsquo;s property. In this aspect Ruth typifies the church, whose old man is her crucified husband (7:4a), being redeemed by Christ, who cleared away the sin of the old man for the recovery of the lost right of her natural man in God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<p>The believers&rsquo; old man is composed of the natural part created by God and the fallen part corrupted by sin. This old man has been crucified with Christ. The crucifixion of Christ has redeemed the natural part and destroyed the fallen part, clearing away the sin of the fallen part. Christ did not redeem the fallen part of our old man; He terminated it. He redeemed the God-created part in order to recover us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. After Being Saved through the Regeneration<br />
of Her Natural Man,<br />
Becoming the Counterpart of Christ</h2>
<p>Ruth&rsquo;s becoming a new wife to Boaz after being redeemed by him typifies the church&rsquo;s becoming the counterpart of Christ after being saved through the regeneration of her natural man (v. 4b). Our natural man was created by God to be God&rsquo;s counterpart, taking God as our Husband and Head, but in the fall our natural man put God aside and made himself the husband and head, thus becoming the main part of our old man. After being redeemed and regenerated, our natural man, not including our fallen part, becomes our new man and takes Christ as our new Husband in a divine organic union with Him (v. 4b). Ruth typifies the church being saved through the regeneration of her natural man. This makes the church a new creation to be a new maiden, a new wife. Hence, the church becomes the counterpart of Christ in an organic union with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Gentile Sinners Being Attached to Christ That They May Partake<br />
of the Inheritance of God&rsquo;s Promise</h2>
<p>Ruth&rsquo;s being united to Boaz typifies the Gentile sinners&rsquo; being attached to Christ so that they may partake of the inheritance of God&rsquo;s promise (Eph. 3:6). Once we are joined to Christ, we enjoy God&rsquo;s promise. Hence, we are God-created persons, fallen persons, redeemed persons, and regenerated persons. We have become a new creation in our organic union with Christ through regeneration. God has allotted us the all-inclusive Christ, typified by the good land, to be our eternal portion and has transferred us into Him to participate in Him (Col. 1:12; 1 Cor. 1:30, 9). Hence, we can produce a home for rest in Him, and we can bring forth Christ and spread Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">II. BOAZ</h2>
<p>Ruth 2:1 says, &ldquo;Naomi had a relative of her husband&rsquo;s, a man of great wealth, from Elimelech&rsquo;s family; and his name was Boaz.&rdquo; Boaz belonged to a renowned family of Judah and was rich in wealth. Furthermore, he was a relative, even a kinsman, of Ruth&rsquo;s father-in-law, Elimelech, and was qualified to redeem Elimelech&rsquo;s property (4:3-6). As a kinsman of Mahlon, the dead husband of Ruth, he was willing to redeem the lost right of Mahlon&rsquo;s property, and he took Mahlon&rsquo;s widow, Ruth, as his wife to bear a son for the establishing of her husband&rsquo;s name (vv. 9-10). In all these things Boaz typifies Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. As a Man of Noble Birth</h2>
<p>In Luke 19:12 the Lord Jesus likened Himself to a man of noble birth. This signifies that the Lord Jesus, who is of the highest status, is the God-man, both honorable in His deity and noble in His humanity. Hence, as a man rich in wealth and generous in giving, Boaz typifies the Savior Christ, who is rich in the grace of God. His divine riches are unsearchable (Eph. 3:8; 2 Cor. 12:9), and He takes care of God&rsquo;s needy people with His bountiful supply (Phil. 1:19b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Typifying Christ, as the Kinsman<br />
of the Believers, Being Qualified and Willing<br />
to Redeem the Believers as His Counterpart</h2>
<p>The first kinsman of Ruth&rsquo;s deceased husband, Mahlon, typifies our natural man, who cannot and will not redeem us from the indebtedness (sin) of our old man. Boaz, the second kinsman of Ruth&rsquo;s deceased husband, was qualified and willing to redeem the lost right of Mahlon&rsquo;s property and took Mahlon&rsquo;s widow, Ruth, as his wife for the producing of the needed heirs (Ruth 4:9-10, 13). Hence, Boaz typifies Christ, who partook of blood and flesh to be like us and who has become the believers&rsquo; Kinsman (Heb. 2:14). Having shed His blood to accomplish redemption for us, He can and will redeem us from our sin, recover the lost right of our natural man in God&rsquo;s creation, be our new Husband that He may have a divine organic union with us, and take us as His counterpart for His increase (Eph. 5:23-32; John 3:29-30).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Ruth and Boaz are a complete prefigure of the Gentile sinners&rsquo; being brought with Israel, God&rsquo;s elect, into the divine inheritance through the redemption of Christ in their union with Him.</p>
<p>Ruth was one of the Moabites, who were forbidden to enter the holy congregation of Jehovah, yet she became a part of Israel and partook of her husband&rsquo;s inheritance through marriage. She chose God and His kingdom and exercised her right to glean the harvest of God&rsquo;s elect and partake of the rich produce of the inheritance of God&rsquo;s elect. Eventually, she gained a redeeming husband, and she conceived and brought forth a son to bring in the royal house of David. Thus, she became an important ancestor in the genealogy of Christ to continue the line of the God-created humanity for the incarnation of Christ to accomplish the eternal economy of God. She typifies the Gentile church, before her salvation, as men in God&rsquo;s creation and sinners in man&rsquo;s fall, yet the church with her old man as her crucified husband was redeemed by Christ for the recovery of the lost right of her natural man in God&rsquo;s creation. Furthermore, after being saved through the regeneration of her natural man, the church became the counterpart of Christ. The Gentile sinners were thus attached to Christ to partake of the inheritance of God&rsquo;s promise, producing a home for rest and bringing forth Christ and spreading Christ.</p>
<p>Boaz was a man rich in wealth and generous in giving. Furthermore, he was a kinsman of Ruth&rsquo;s father-in-law, Elimelech, and he was qualified and willing to redeem the lost right of Ruth&rsquo;s deceased husband&rsquo;s inheritance and to take Ruth as his wife to bear a son for the establishing of her husband&rsquo;s name. In all these aspects Boaz typifies Christ, who is of the highest status, is rich in God&rsquo;s grace, has the unsearchable riches, and takes care of God&rsquo;s needy people by His bountiful supply. Christ partook of blood and flesh to be like us and became the believers&rsquo; Kinsman. He shed His blood to accomplish redemption for us, and He can and will redeem us from our sin, recover the lost right of our natural man in God&rsquo;s creation, and take us as His counterpart for His increase.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>The tabernacle as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth typifies the church; the Ark as God&rsquo;s testimony on earth typifies Christ. According to God&rsquo;s arrangement, the Ark was placed in the Holy of Holies within the tabernacle. After the children of Israel entered into the good land, because of the deterioration of the house of Aaron the priest, they presumptuously removed the Ark from the tabernacle to help them in their fighting, and the Ark was captured by the Philistines (1 Sam. 4:3-11). Later the Philistines returned the Ark to the children of Israel, and it was taken by the men of Kiriath-jearim and brought to the house of Abinadab (6:8; 7:1-2). Then it was taken by David from the house of Abinadab and put in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. Later David removed the Ark and carried it from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David (2 Sam. 6:2-3, 10-12). During this time, however, the tabernacle remained in Shiloh (Josh. 18:1). During Saul&rsquo;s time, the tabernacle was in Nob (1 Sam. 21:1; cf. Mark 2:26), and later, during the time of King David and King Solomon, it was in Gibeon (1 Chron. 16:39; 21:29). Thus, the Ark was separated from the tabernacle until the building of the temple was completed. Then it was moved into the Holy of Holies in the temple (1 Kings 8:1-11).</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE ARK SEPARATED FROM THE TABERNACLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Typifying Christ Leaving the Formal Church</h2>
<p>The Ark being separated from the tabernacle was a very abnormal situation. The Old Testament shows that the children of Israel took the tabernacle or the temple as their center. From the time the children of Israel built the tabernacle, they considered the tabernacle to be their center. Their encampment, their move, their worship, and their warfare all took the tabernacle as the center, but the tabernacle took the Ark as its center. The Ark is a type of Christ as the center of God&rsquo;s testimony. The presence of Christ was with the Ark. Without the Ark, the tabernacle was something with a form but without the reality.</p>
<p>The history of the church repeats the history of the Old Testament. In the desolation and decline of the church, Christ has left the formal church and has been separated from it as if He has been captured. In the beginning the church preached a living Christ. However, even during the time of the apostles, the decline of the church began. Some rose up to preach &ldquo;a different gospel&rdquo; (Gal. 1:6-7), &ldquo;destructive heresies&rdquo; (2 Pet. 2:1-3), and the teachings of the antichrist (2 John 7), and they forsook the apostle and his ministry (2 Tim. 1:15). Revelation 2 and 3 show that the church became so desolate that she forsook her original condition and deviated further and further. When Constantine became the Roman emperor, he legalized Christianity and made it the national religion, and he appointed the overseers of the city of Rome to be the leaders over the entire church. As a result, the church became weaker and was defeated; she lost the testimony of God and became divided so that she could no longer satisfy God&rsquo;s requirement but could only maintain an outward service in formality.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Christ and the Church Being<br />
One and Inseparable</h2>
<p>In the New Testament age, like the tabernacle, the church is the dwelling place of God on earth. Whether in work, service, worship, or fighting, the children of God should take the church as their center. Moreover, the church must take Christ as her center. In the ancient days, the tabernacle needed the Ark inside, and the Ark needed the tabernacle outside. If Christ is in a certain place today, the church must be there, and if the church is in a certain place, Christ must be there. Christ is the life and the content of the church, and the church is the living and expression of Christ. Christ and the church are one and inseparable. The church tells out the Christ who was despised by men but exalted by God and glorified before God (2 Cor. 4:5; 1 Pet. 2:9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Church Losing the Presence of Christ<br />
Because of Her Degradation</h2>
<p>After the passing away of the apostles, the church continued to fall and go downward because of the Nicolaitans, who changed the universal priesthood ordained by God into a clerical class. Later the church imitated the way of the children of Israel by setting up one man to rule over them as their king so that the church looked more to a human leader than to Christ the Head. As a result, many sects were brought forth. When the church degraded and became a worldly organization, the presence of Christ was no longer in the church. Consequently, the formal church had only human ways, doctrines, opinions, criticisms, and judgments. There was no longer the word of God, the riches of Christ, or the authority of God. Instead, there were evil people who captured the children of God into the world. According to Revelation 2:13, even Satan, the prince of this world, set up his throne in the church! Everything was in desolation and corruption.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Roman Catholic Church and<br />
Protestant Denominations<br />
Having an Outward Form<br />
without the Inward Reality of Christ</h2>
<p>After the church degraded and became a worldly organization, she was gradually formed into the Roman Catholic Church with a Judaistic hierarchy of overseers. She allowed the deep things of Satan to be brought in (v. 24), and she tolerated the teachings of Jezebel, thereby bringing in confusing heresies, including the committing of fornication and the eating of idol sacrifices (v. 20). The Roman Catholic Church is condemned by God; hence, God calls to His people, saying, &ldquo;Come out of her, My people, that you do not participate in her sins and that you do not receive her plagues&rdquo; (18:4).</p>
<p>The Reformation took place when Martin Luther came out of the Roman Catholic Church to recover the open Bible and teach the truth concerning justification by faith. However, at the same time, the Reformation was utilized by many earthly governments to serve their political intentions. Because of the ignorance of God&rsquo;s people, the Reformation was turned into a movement in which the church and the world were united to oppose the Roman Catholic Church. As a result, state churches were brought forth. They imitated the practice of the Roman Catholic Church and became a union of politics and religion. This was the initiation of Protestantism. Later some people saw that the state churches were wrong, and they received new revelation before God. Based on the revelation they saw, they established the so-called private churches. Both the state and private churches had a name that they were living, but they were dead in the eyes of the Lord (3:1b). In the beginning they had the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, but they were not completely delivered out of the Roman Catholic Church. Rather, they adopted the organizational way of the Roman Catholic Church to maintain the blessings which they received. Consequently, like the Roman Catholic Church, they had an outward form without the inward reality of Christ.</p>
<p>In both the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations there are the people of God who worship the Lord, but the &ldquo;Ark&rdquo; is no longer present. They have lost the inward reality of Christ, and all that remains is an outward form. The center of the tabernacle was the Ark, and the center of the church is Christ. The people of God should be with Christ. After Solomon ascended to the throne, he went up to Gibeon to offer sacrifices, &ldquo;for the Tent of Meeting of God was there, which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness. However David had brought up the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem&rdquo; (2 Chron. 1:3-4). After Solomon saw a vision in the night and received wisdom, he left the empty tabernacle in Gibeon and returned to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices before the Ark (vv. 5-6).</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE ARK STAYING IN THE HOUSES<br />
OF TWO PERSONS&mdash;ABINADAB AND OBED-EDOM</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Typifying Christ<br />
Being with the Believers Individually</h2>
<p>After the Ark was removed from the tabernacle, it was placed in the house of Abinadab and then in the house of Obed-edom. This typifies that although the presence of Christ is no longer in the formal church, Christ is still present individually with believers who love Him. The church has become desolate, Christ and the church have been separated, and all that the so-called church has is an outward shell of formality. In contrast, the presence of Christ can be touched in the homes of the saints who love the Lord with a pure heart.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Christ&rsquo;s Presence with the Believers</h2>
<p>In the degradation of the church, in which an outward form is stressed but the inner presence of Christ is lost, the presence of Christ can be found only in the homes of believers who love the Lord. Although this presence of Christ is good and brings in the blessing (2 Sam. 6:11-12), there is no testimony of the church. Hence, there is the need for the raising up of David to build a solid temple as the dwelling place of the Ark, which had been separated from the tabernacle (7:1-2; Psa. 132:2-8). In the age of the desolation of the church, the Lord will raise up a group of people to build up the organism of Christ so that He may have a place to make His home.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Christ&rsquo;s Presence with the Believers<br />
Being Movable</h2>
<p>After the Ark was separated from the tabernacle, it became movable. Although it was returned to Israel by the Philistines after its captivity, the Ark was moved from the house of Abinadab to the house of Obed-edom, and then from the house of Obed-edom to the tent of David (2 Sam. 6:17). This shows that in the desolation and degradation of the church, the presence of Christ with the believers is movable. Where His lovers are, there His presence is.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Believers Not to Be Satisfied<br />
with Christ&rsquo;s Presence with Individuals</h2>
<p>It is precious for the believers to have Christ&rsquo;s presence individually in the desolation of the church. However, the believers should not be satisfied and self-contented. Rather, they should seek after the building up of the church so that Christ may have a corporate dwelling place and the believers may have His corporate presence.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE ARK ENTERING THE HOLY OF HOLIES<br />
IN THE TEMPLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Typifying Christ&rsquo;s Obtaining<br />
the Builded Church as His Dwelling Place</h2>
<p>After the completion of the building of the temple by Solomon, the Ark was brought into the Holy of Holies in the holy temple (1 Kings 8:6). This typifies that Christ will eventually obtain the builded church as a dwelling place for His rest. God did not ordain the Ark to bear His testimony in the homes of His people. God&rsquo;s ordination involved the Ark bearing a corporate testimony in His dwelling place. Although David received the Ark into the city of David and placed it in the tent that he pitched, this still was not according to the heart&rsquo;s desire of God. Because David knew God&rsquo;s heart, he was determined to build the holy temple for God, saying, &ldquo;I shall not go into the tent of my house; / I shall not go up onto the couch of my bed; / I shall not give sleep to my eyes, / Slumber to my eyelids; / Until I find a place for Jehovah, / A tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob&rdquo; (Psa. 132:3-5). Furthermore, he prayed, &ldquo;Arise, O Jehovah, unto Your resting place, / You and the Ark of Your strength&rdquo; (v. 8). His heart&rsquo;s desire was acceptable to God, and God sent the prophet Nathan to tell David that God would give him a son, Solomon, who would be a man of peace and would build the temple for God. Furthermore, God revealed the pattern of the temple to David through His Spirit (1 Chron. 28:11-12), just as God revealed the pattern concerning the tabernacle to Moses. Before his death, David clearly instructed Solomon concerning the pattern. Thus, Solomon built the temple according to the pattern that his father saw, and the Ark was carried into the Holy of Holies in the holy temple. Then the Ark of God had a proper and secure dwelling place.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Believers Being Built Up<br />
as the Dwelling Place of God</h2>
<p>In the New Testament age, following the desolation and decline of the church, Christ left the formal church to be individually with the believers who love Him with a pure heart and who also have a desire to let Christ make His home in them. However, even though this desire is good, it cannot remain to eternity because it is not according to what God has revealed, and it is not of God or what God wants. God&rsquo;s intention, His eternal purpose, is that the believers would be built up to be the universal house of the processed and consummated Triune God, which is the holy temple in the Lord (Eph. 2:21), and to be the organic Body of Christ as a great corporate vessel for His expression to consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth as the dwelling place of the processed and consummated Triune God in eternity forever and ever.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The tabernacle as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth typifies the church; the Ark as God&rsquo;s testimony on earth typifies Christ. According to God&rsquo;s arrangement, the Ark was placed in the Holy of Holies within the tabernacle. After the children of Israel entered into the good land, the Ark was captured and separated from the tabernacle because of the deterioration of the house of Aaron the priest.

</ol><h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>The temple and the tabernacle were both used by God as His dwelling place on earth. His dwelling place was first the tabernacle, which was movable and temporary, and then the temple, which was fixed and permanent.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE TEMPLE BEING<br />
THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>The tabernacle was the predecessor of the temple as the dwelling place of God on earth, and the temple was the consummate building of the tabernacle. The tabernacle and the temple were the same in use, and they have the same significance in typology.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE<br />
BEING DAVID&rsquo;S DESIRE</h2>
<p>The movable and temporary tabernacle followed the children of Israel into the good land and was placed in Shiloh (Josh. 18:1). Later it was moved to Nob (1 Sam. 21:1; cf. Mark 2:26) and then to Gibeon (1 Chron. 16:39; 21:29). During David&rsquo;s reign, he sensed God&rsquo;s heart for His kingdom and His house. Hence, David established a kingdom on earth according to God&rsquo;s desire. Moreover, when he realized that the Ark of God needed a fixed and permanent dwelling place, he desired to build a temple for God to replace the movable and temporary tabernacle.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. David Typifying the Suffering Christ,<br />
Who Fought for the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>The entire life of David was a suffering. He was born as the youngest among his brothers, and as a young boy he was assigned to tend the sheep (1 Sam. 16:11); thus, he was trained by God in humility. Although he was anointed by Samuel with oil and defeated Goliath, a champion of the Philistines, by trusting in God, he was envied and persecuted by King Saul, who was determined to kill him. He fled to different places to escape Saul&rsquo;s pursuit. He suffered many afflictions and was nearly driven from the good land so that he would not have any share in Jehovah&rsquo;s inheritance.</p>
<p>After David ascended to the throne to be the king of God&rsquo;s kingdom on the earth, he continually fought for the kingdom of God to conquer the enemies in the surrounding regions and to capture the land usurped by them. In this, David typified the aspect of Christ&rsquo;s suffering and fighting for God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. David&rsquo;s Preparation<br />
for the Building of the Temple</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention was for the children of Israel to take the good land and build the temple in the place where He had chosen to set up His name. However, God had no way to build the temple because the enemies still occupied the land and were not yet completely subdued. Hence, God raised up David to defeat the enemies and take the land. Furthermore, David bought the threshing floor of Ornan, the threshing floor of Araunah, from Ornan the Jebusite as the site for the building of the temple (1 Chron. 21:22-25; 2 Sam. 24:20-24).</p>
<p>After he obtained the site for the building of the temple, David received from God the pattern needed for the building of the temple (1 Chron. 28:11-19), just as Moses received from God the revelation of the pattern on the mountain concerning the tabernacle. Before his death, David instructed Solomon, his son, concerning this pattern. Thus, according to the pattern shown to his father David, Solomon built the temple, which was according to God&rsquo;s desire for His dwelling.</p>
<p>Throughout the days of his life, through all his difficulties and according to his power, David prepared the materials necessary for the building of the temple. Because he set his affection on the house of God, he gave his private treasure of gold and silver over and above all that he had prepared for the building of the holy house. Then David called the leaders of the fathers&rsquo; houses, the leaders of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and they all offered willingly and prepared all the materials needed for the building of the house (29:2-9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. God Not Wanting David to Build<br />
the Temple Directly</h2>
<p>Although David desired to build the holy temple for God and also prepared all the materials for the building, God did not want David to build the temple for Him directly because he was a man of war and had shed the blood of many. God wanted Solomon, David&rsquo;s son, to build the house for Him to be His dwelling place on the earth (28:3-6), because the building of the holy temple of God should be carried out in peace through a person of peace, not in war through a person of bloodshed.</p><h2 class="head1">III. GOD DESIRING THAT SOLOMON<br />
BUILD THE TEMPLE FOR HIM</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Solomon Typifying the Resurrected Christ,<br />
Who Is for the Building of the Dwelling Place<br />
of God in the Peace of His Resurrection</h2>
<p>Solomon typifies the resurrected Christ, including Christ in His ascension and coming back. Just as Solomon completed the building, Christ is building His church in resurrection until His coming back.</p>
<p>The name Solomon means &ldquo;peaceful.&rdquo; As the king of peace who built the house of God in peace, Solomon typifies the resurrected Christ, who is building a dwelling place for God in the peace of His resurrection. On the cross Christ abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances and made peace, and now in the peace of His resurrection He is building the Body of Christ (cf. Eph. 2:15-22).</p>

Typifying Christ&rsquo;s Building of the Church</h2>
<p>Solomon typifies Christ, and Solomon&rsquo;s building of the temple typifies Christ&rsquo;s building of the church. The building of the holy temple was for God to have a dwelling place on the earth; likewise, this is the purpose of the building of the church (vv. 21-22). Whereas Solomon and the temple he built played the strongest roles and occupied a wide span in the history of Israel, Christ and the church as the unique building of God in the universe are the centrality, universality, and goal of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE TEMPLE TYPIFYING<br />
CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The holy temple typifies Christ and the church because the church and Christ are one&mdash;Christ is the Head and the church is the Body. The Body is the enlargement of the Head to be the dwelling place of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Typology of the Temple<br />
Being the Same as That of the Tabernacle</h2>
<p>The temple replaced the tabernacle as the dwelling place of God on the earth. They both signify the incarnated Christ as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on the earth and the church (John 2:19-21; 1:14; Matt. 12:6), including all the believers, the members of Christ, to be the enlargement of Christ as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on the earth (1 Cor. 3:16; 6:19; Eph. 2:21-22).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Temple<br />
Typifying the Individual Christ<br />
as the Dwelling Place of God</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Christ Becoming Flesh<br />
to Be the Tabernacle of God and<br />
the Temple of God</h2>
<p>John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; This indicates that Christ became flesh not only to bring God into man but also to be the tabernacle as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on the earth among men. In John 2:19 the Lord Jesus told the Jews, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo; Here Jesus spoke of the temple of His body (v. 21). These two verses clearly show that the incarnated Christ was both the tabernacle of God and the temple of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Christ Building Up His Body<br />
in Resurrection</h2>
<p>The Jews destroyed, that is, crucified on the cross, the body of Christ, which was the temple of God, but Christ raised it up in three days. Three days signifies resurrection, indicating that Christ builds up His body in resurrection to be God&rsquo;s dwelling place for God to dwell in.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Temple<br />
Typifying the Corporate Christ&mdash;<br />
the Church&mdash;<br />
as the Dwelling Place of God</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Christ in His Resurrection<br />
Building Up His Individual Body<br />
into the Corporate Body&mdash;<br />
the Church</h2>
<p>In His resurrection Christ, on the one hand, raised His individual body from the dead and, on the other hand, raised all His believers up together with Him (Eph. 2:6). Thus, He enlarged His individual body into His corporate Body, which is the church. Therefore, the temple typifies the corporate Christ&mdash;the church&mdash;as the dwelling place of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Corporate Body of Christ<br />
Being the New Creation<br />
in Resurrection</h2>
<p>In His resurrection Christ regenerated the believers, who were raised up together with Him (1 Pet. 1:3), that they may have God&rsquo;s life and nature and become God&rsquo;s new creation (2 Cor. 5:17), which comes out of the old creation by its passing through death and resurrection. The corporate Body built by Christ in resurrection is altogether a new creation, not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Corporate Body of Christ<br />
Being Spiritual and Mystical</h2>
<p>The corporate Body of Christ in resurrection is of His Spirit (Eph. 4:4a), it is formed by being baptized into His Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13), and it is in our spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God (Eph. 2:22). God&rsquo;s dwelling place is in our spirit. Therefore, the corporate Body of Christ is spiritual, and since it is spiritual, it is mystical.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Both the temple and the tabernacle served as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on the earth. His dwelling place was first the tabernacle, which was movable and temporary, and then the temple, which was fixed and permanent. The tabernacle was the predecessor of the temple as the dwelling place of God on earth, and the temple was the consummate building of the tabernacle. The tabernacle and the temple were the same in use, and they have the same significance in typology.</p>
<p>The building of the temple was David&rsquo;s desire. David typifies the suffering Christ, who fought for the kingdom of God. David defeated the enemies, gained the good land, and also bought the threshing floor of Ornan as the site for the building of the temple. Moreover, he received from God the pattern needed for building the temple. Throughout the days of his life, through all his difficulties and according to his power, David prepared the materials necessary for the building of the temple and gave his private treasure of gold and silver. Furthermore, he called the leaders of the fathers&rsquo; houses, the leaders of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and they all offered willingly and prepared all the materials needed for the building of the house. However, God did not want David to build the holy temple for Him directly because he was a man of war and had shed the blood of many; rather, God wanted Solomon as the king of peace to build the house of God in peace. Solomon typifies the resurrected Christ, who builds the dwelling place of God in the peace of His resurrection. Therefore, Solomon&rsquo;s building of the temple typifies Christ&rsquo;s building of the church. Whereas Solomon and the temple he built played the strongest roles and occupied a wide span in the history of Israel, Christ and the church as the unique building of God in the universe are the centrality, universality, and goal of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</p>
<p>The holy temple typifies the incarnated Christ as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on the earth, and it also typifies the church, including all the believers, the members of Christ, to be the enlargement of Christ as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on the earth. The body of Christ was destroyed on the cross, and in His resurrection Christ built up this body to be God&rsquo;s dwelling place. In His resurrection Christ also raised up all His believers together with Him and enlarged His body into the corporate Body, which is the church, as the corporate dwelling place of God. This corporate Body is altogether a new creation in resurrection; it is spiritual and mystical.</p>

</ol><h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>The Holy Scriptures, including both the Old Testament and the New Testament, use various plants, trees, and flowers to signify God, Christ, the church, the saints, and the world. This lesson covers eight items: the Shoot of Jehovah, the Shoot of David, a twig coming forth from the stem of Jesse, a branch from Jesse&rsquo;s roots, the root of Jesse, a tender plant growing up before Jehovah and a root out of dry ground, the fruit, and a green fir tree.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SHOOT OF JEHOVAH</h2>
<p>Isaiah 4:2 says, &ldquo;In that day the Shoot of Jehovah will be beauty and glory.&rdquo; <em>Shoot</em> in Hebrew denotes a new, tender sprout, indicating the initial development of the growth of a tree. This shows the initial development of the divinity of God in Christ through incarnation (John 1:14). Christ as the incarnated God is the shooting forth, the sprouting, of divinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Typifying the Sprouting<br />
of the Divinity of Christ in Him</h2>
<p>The Shoot of Jehovah typifies not only Christ&rsquo;s divinity but the sprouting and development of Christ&rsquo;s divinity through the incarnation of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Coming Out of God as<br />
the Branching Out of God Himself</h2>
<p>The Shoot of Jehovah is the sprouting of God in Christ. This sprouting comes out of God as the branching out of God Himself for His expression.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being the Sprouting and Development of God<br />
in Christ&rsquo;s Humanity</h2>
<p>The sprouting and development of God in Christ are for the expression of all the riches of divinity in Christ&rsquo;s humanity, that is, for the rich attributes of divinity to be developed into the virtues of Christ, the God-man, in His humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Also Typifying the Divinity That Sprouted<br />
in Christ to Develop unto the Expression<br />
of the Glory and Beauty of His Divinity</h2>
<p>In the development of the divinity in Christ, its sprouting is the beginning of the growth of the divinity in Christ. This growth will increase until it reaches its goal, that is, the expression of the glory and beauty of divinity.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. From His Incarnation to His Entering into<br />
Glory in His Resurrection</h2>
<p>The development of the divinity in Christ began with His incarnation, in which He was born to be a God-man. Then it passed through His human living on earth for thirty-three and a half years, in which the divine attributes were expressed in His human virtues, and it also passed through His life-releasing death. Eventually, it reached His resurrection, in which He entered into glory.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Passing through His Ascension<br />
to Attain to His Beauty and Glory<br />
in the Kingdom Age</h2>
<p>&ldquo;That day&rdquo; in Isaiah 4:2 refers to the day of restoration in the kingdom age. By passing through ascension Christ was made Lord and Christ (Acts 2:33-36), seated on the right hand of the throne of God (Heb. 12:2), and crowned with glory and honor (2:9). In the day that Christ comes back, the consummate development of the divinity in Him will be manifested as beauty and glory; that is, His divinity will be manifested in the brilliant splendor, precious worth, and dignified position in His kingship in His humanity.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE SHOOT OF DAVID</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Typifying the Development and<br />
Growth of Christ&rsquo;s Humanity</h2>
<p>Christ is God as man with divinity and humanity. Hence, the Old Testament uses two shoots to signify His two natures of divinity and humanity. The Shoot of Jehovah signifies Christ&rsquo;s divinity, whereas the Shoot of David (Jer. 23:5) signifies Christ&rsquo;s humanity. The development of His divinity is from His incarnation to the manifestation of His beauty and glory, that is, the manifestation of His divinity in splendor. The development of His humanity is from His birth as the Son of Man to the uplifting of His humanity into His divinity in resurrection, that is, the mingling of His humanity with His divinity for Him to be the firstborn Son of God with two natures&mdash;divinity and humanity (Rom. 8:29).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being the Development and Growth<br />
of Christ in His Birth as the Son of Man<br />
and in His Humanity</h2>
<p>Christ was born as a human baby (Luke 2:12), grew up through childhood (vv. 40-43), and at the age of thirty became a complete man (3:23). This is the development and growth of Christ in His humanity as the Shoot of David living for God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being the Development and Growth<br />
of Humanity in Christ&rsquo;s Divinity</h2>
<p>The development and growth of Christ in His humanity is the development and growth of His humanity in His divinity, that His humanity may be filled with divinity and that His divinity may live out all the divine attributes through His humanity in His human virtues.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Development of Christ&rsquo;s Humanity<br />
to Attain to the Consummate Glory<br />
in Full in Eternity</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Related to the Development<br />
of His Divinity That He May Be One Who Is<br />
Glorified in Divinity and Humanity</h2>
<p>The development of Christ&rsquo;s humanity is related to the development of His divinity that He may be a God-man who enters into glory in both divinity and humanity. He passed through incarnation and arrived at His resurrection out of death to enter into the glory of His divinity. Then in resurrection He ascended to heaven and was exalted, and through His ascension He entered into the state of reigning in the kingdom. In the restoration of all things in the coming kingdom, the kingship of Christ with His humanity, which has attained to the highest state, will manifest the splendor of the glory of His fullness, as prophesied in Jeremiah 23:5 and 33:15.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Eventually Attaining to the Consummate<br />
Glory in Full in the New Jerusalem<br />
in the New Heaven and New Earth</h2>
<p>The development of Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah and the Shoot of David will attain not only to the glorious condition of the kingdom in the coming age but also to the condition of the consummate glory in full in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. In eternity He will be the Shoot of Jehovah and the Shoot of David&mdash;the God-man as the development of the Shoot of Jehovah and man, attaining to the full glory in the ultimate consummation.</p><h2 class="head1">III. A SPROUT COMING FORTH<br />
FROM THE STUMP OF JESSE</h2>
<p>Jesse was David&rsquo;s father (Ruth 4:22), and in the Old Testament the house of Jesse was considered a great tree. At the time of David, this great tree developed into a royal family. Because of the sins committed by David&rsquo;s son Solomon, however, this royal house declined and lost over ninety percent of its kingdom, even losing the land which God had given to them, so that the people were captured and the nation perished. It was like a tree that had been cut down with only a stump, a stem, remaining; this was the stump of Jesse (Isa. 11:1a). From this stump came forth a sprout, Christ (Matt. 1:16), at the time of Mary and her husband, Joseph, both of whom were descendants of David (Luke 3:23-32). A sprout in Hebrew denotes a small branch as a stick or a twig; hence, in Proverbs 14:3 the same word is rendered <em>rod.</em></p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Typifying Christ</h2>
<p>In the Scriptures Christ is first likened to a tree, such as the tree of life (Gen. 2:9), the true vine (John 15:1), and the apple tree (S. S. 2:3). Then He is likened to the shoot of a tree, a sprout, a root, and eventually to fruit on a tree (Luke 1:42).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. As the Son of Jesse</h2>
<p>The stump of Jesse implies that the descendants of Jesse had been cut down. When Christ was born as Jesus, both His mother, Mary, and Mary&rsquo;s husband, Joseph, were people of a lowly family, living in Nazareth, a despised city. He was not brought forth from the stump or branch of a flourishing great tree; He was a small sprout brought forth from a dried up stem, or stump, of a tree that had been cut down.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. As the Son of David</h2>
<p>Christ came out of the family of Jesse, and Jesse had a son named David. Hence, the sprout which came forth from the stump of Jesse also typifies that Christ was the son of David (Matt. 1:1), the One who would inherit the throne of David (Luke 1:31-33). This implies that although He was born of a poor family as a poor and humble person, eventually He became the Christ of God, the Messiah, to be the King of God&rsquo;s elect for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Indicating the History of Christ&rsquo;s<br />
Becoming a Man in His Humanity</h2>
<p>The book of Isaiah contains prophecies concerning Christ in His divinity, such as the Shoot of Jehovah (4:2), Immanuel (7:14), the Mighty God, the Eternal Father (9:6), the root of Jesse (11:10; cf. Rev. 22:16), and the arm of Jehovah (Isa. 53:1), and concerning Christ in His humanity, such as a sprout coming forth from the stump of Jesse, a branch from the roots of Jesse (11:1), a child (9:6), a tender plant, a root out of dry ground (53:2), a lamb, a sheep (v. 7), and an offering for sin (v. 10). The sprout that came forth from the stump of Jesse linked Christ in His humanity not only to Jesse and David but also to the entire royal tribe of Judah, as seen in the blessing with which Jacob and Moses blessed Israel (Gen. 49:9-10; Deut. 33:7).</p>
<p>In the sprout that came forth from the stump of Jesse, we can also see the history of Christ&rsquo;s becoming a man in His humanity who first humbled Himself and then was exalted with honor. This is the process of Christ in His humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. A BRANCH FROM JESSE&rsquo;S ROOTS</h2>
<p>A sprout comes forth from the stump of a tree, but a branch is from the roots of a tree. Therefore, the source of the branch is deeper than that of the sprout. The source of the sprout is above the earth, but the source of the branch is underneath the earth. The branch can supply the sprout; the sprout cannot supply the branch. The branch from the roots of Jesse typifies that Christ was a branch that came out of the roots of Jesse. The root, the source, of Jesse, was God; the branch of Jesse, that is, that which was born of Jesse, was a man. This signifies that Christ came out of God to become a man. Hence, He was the God-man. Inwardly, He came out of God; outwardly, He was manifested as a man. He was God who became a man to be the Christ of God for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE ROOT OF JESSE</h2>
<p>Isaiah 11:10 says, &ldquo;In that day the root of Jesse, / Who stands as a banner to the peoples&mdash; / Him will the nations seek.&rdquo; <em>Root</em> denotes the source, the origin. The root of Jesse typifies Christ as the source, the origin, of Jesse. In the prophecies in Isaiah we see that Christ in His divinity is the Shoot of Jehovah and the root of Jesse, and that Christ in His humanity is the sprout coming forth from the stump of Jesse, the branch from the root of Jesse, the tender plant that grows, and the root out of dry ground (53:2). In His divinity Christ came out of God; God is His origin. Hence, Christ is the source, the origin, of Jesse. In His humanity Christ came out of Jesse; therefore, Jesse is His origin, His source. He is the sprout and branch of Jesse, and He is also the root of Jesse. He is everything concerning Jesse. According to His humanity, He came out of Jesse; according to His divinity, He brought forth Jesse.</p>
<p>In Revelation 5:5 the root of Jesse is called the Root of David, indicating that Christ was the source of Jesse and also the source of Jesse&rsquo;s son David. Hence, although David was Christ&rsquo;s forefather, he called Him Lord (Matt. 22:42-45).</p><h2 class="head1">VI. A TENDER PLANT GROWING UP BEFORE JEHOVAH<br />
AND A ROOT OUT OF DRY GROUND</h2>
<p>Isaiah also likened Christ to a tender plant growing up before Jehovah and a root out of dry ground (53:2). Christ&rsquo;s growing up before Jehovah was a matter before God. A tender plant growing up refers to Christ in His childhood. In God&rsquo;s eyes, when Christ was born to be a man, He grew up before God even as a child. Christ&rsquo;s coming out of dry ground was a matter before men. A root growing downward refers to Christ in His youth. In man&rsquo;s eyes Christ came out of a poor family as dry ground. This shows that from the time of His childhood and youth, Christ lived a life of godliness before God and a life of hardships before men. He lived such a life on earth for His whole life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE FRUIT</h2>
<p>In Luke 1:42 Elizabeth said that the baby in Mary&rsquo;s womb, which was Christ in His conception, was the fruit. Here and in Acts 2:30 (&ldquo;fruit of his loins&rdquo;), <em>fruit</em> is used to denote Christ as a human offspring. In Isaiah 4:2 (&ldquo;the fruit of the earth&rdquo;) it is used to denote Christ&rsquo;s humanity, and in Revelation 22:2 it is used to denote the fruit of the tree of life. Fruits are produced by trees to be food to man. The Bible likens Christ not only to a tree but also to the fruit produced by the tree. Thus, the Bible uses figures and signs to show that Christ is the root of the tree, the tree itself, the shoot of the tree, the branch of the tree, and the fruit produced by the tree. He is the fruit of Mary and of David; He is God becoming man to bring God into man that we may eat of Him as the tree of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. A GREEN FIR TREE</h2>
<p>In Hosea 14:8 God said that He is like a green fir tree. A green fir tree never grows old or dries up but is evergreen. It is a symbol of God, who never changes and who is ever new. God is the eternal God, and His life is the eternal life. Hence, He is ever-existing, ever-unchanging, and ever new. God never grows old or becomes worn; He is the same from beginning to end. He is ever-unchanging and ever-unfailing toward His people; He is always new and never grows old, and He never fades away. Therefore, assuredly, we can trust in Him. We receive our fruit from Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The Holy Scriptures use various plants, trees, and flowers to signify God, Christ, the church, the saints, and the world. In this lesson we have covered eight representative items. The Shoot of Jehovah typifies Christ&rsquo;s divinity and the sprouting of Christ&rsquo;s divinity through the incarnation of God. It also typifies the divinity that sprouted in Christ to develop from His incarnation to His entering into glory in His resurrection and then to pass through His ascension to attain to His beauty and glory in the kingdom age.</p>
<p>The Shoot of David typifies the development and growth of Christ&rsquo;s humanity. The development of His humanity began with His birth as the Son of Man and passed through His human living on earth, in which His humanity was filled with divinity, and His divinity lived out all the divine attributes through His humanity in His human virtues. Then it arrived at the uplifting of His humanity into His divinity in resurrection, that is, the mingling of His humanity with His divinity for Him to be the firstborn Son of God with divinity and humanity, the One who is glorified in divinity and humanity and who will manifest the splendor of the glory of His fullness in the restoration of all things in the coming kingdom. Eventually, it will attain to the condition of the consummate glory in full in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</p>
<p>The sprout coming forth from the stump of Jesse typifies Christ as the descendant of Jesse who came out of a lowly family; it also typifies Christ as the descendant of David who inherited the throne of David. Although He was born of a poor family, eventually He became the Christ, the Messiah, of God to be the King of God&rsquo;s elect for eternity. This indicates that the history of Christ&rsquo;s becoming a man in His humanity is that He first humbled Himself and then was exalted with honor.</p>
<p>The branch from Jesse&rsquo;s roots typifies that Christ was a branch that came out of the roots of Jesse. The root, the source, of Jesse was God; the branch of Jesse, that is, that which was born of Jesse, was a man. This indicates that Christ came out of God to become a man. He was the God-man for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</p>
<p>The root of Jesse typifies Christ as the source, the origin, of Jesse. In His divinity Christ came out of God; God was His origin. Hence, He was the root, the source, the origin, of Jesse. The root of Jesse is also called the Root of David, indicating that Christ was also the source of David. Hence, although David was Christ&rsquo;s forefather, he called Him Lord.</p>
<p>The tender plant growing up before Jehovah and the root out of dry ground indicate that when Christ was born to be a man, He grew up before God even as a child. Moreover, in man&rsquo;s eyes He came out of a poor family as dry ground. Christ lived a life of godliness before God and a life of hardships before men for His whole life.</p>
<p>Fruits are produced by trees to be food to man. The Bible likens Christ not only to a tree but also to the fruit produced by the tree. As the fruit of Mary, He was Christ in conception; as the fruit of David, He was a human offspring. He was God becoming man to bring God into man that we may eat of Him as the tree of life.</p>
<p>The green fir tree never grows old or dries up but is evergreen. It is a symbol of God, who never changes and who is ever new. God is ever unchanging and ever unfailing toward His people. He is always new and never grows old, and He never fades away. Hence, assuredly, we may trust in Him.</p>

<h1 class="title">THE TWO OLIVE TREES</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Moses and Elijah being representatives of the law and the prophets in the Old Testament.</li>
<li>Moses and Elijah appearing before the Lord Jesus in His transfiguration on the mount.</li>
<li>The two witnesses in Revelation doing the same thing as Moses and Elijah.</li>
<li>The two witnesses being the two sons of oil before God.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Zechariah 4:2 likens God&rsquo;s people, the Israelites, to the golden lampstand which testifies for God. God&rsquo;s testimony needs the shining forth. To have this shining, there needs to be the burning; to have the burning, there needs to be a continuous supply of olive oil; and to have the olive oil, there needs to be the olive trees. Hence, there are two olive trees by the lampstand, one on its right and the other on its left, to produce the olive oil to supply the need of the lampstand that it may shine forth continually to dispel the darkness. The two olive trees are also called the two sons of oil (v. 14), and in Revelation 11 they are also called the two witnesses (vv. 3-4) and the two prophets (v. 10). The two olive trees symbolize Moses and Elijah, the two persons most used by God in the Old Testament to speak and testify for Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. MOSES AND ELIJAH BEING REPRESENTATIVES<br />
OF THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS<br />
IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The writings that constitute the Old Testament are represented by the law and the prophets. The law of the Old Testament, which spoke and testified for God, was preached through Moses, who represents the law. The prophets of the Old Testament also spoke and testified for God, and they are represented by Elijah. Hence, the Old Testament is also called &ldquo;the law and the prophets&rdquo; (Luke 16:16). These two stand before the Lord of the earth testifying for God (Zech. 4:14; Rev. 11:4). Throughout the generations the law, represented by Moses, and the prophets, represented by Elijah, have been the testimony of God on the earth. The Bible also prophesies that Elijah will come again (Mal. 4:5; Matt. 17:11), indicating that he will be one of the two witnesses.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. MOSES AND ELIJAH APPEARING<br />
BEFORE THE LORD JESUS<br />
IN HIS TRANSFIGURATION ON THE MOUNT</h2>
<p>Moses died and his body was hidden by God (Deut. 34:5-6); Elijah was taken into heaven alive (2 Kings 2:11). God purposely did this so that Moses and Elijah might appear before the Lord Jesus in His transfiguration on the mount and converse with Him concerning His death (Luke 9:31), which was spoken of in the Old Testament (Luke 24:25-27, 44; 1 Cor. 15:3). They were preserved by God so that they could be the two witnesses in the great tribulation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE TWO WITNESSES IN REVELATION<br />
DOING THE SAME THING AS MOSES AND ELIJAH</h2>
<p>Revelation 11:5-6 speaks of two witnesses, saying, &ldquo;If anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies...These have the authority to shut heaven that no rain may fall during the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they desire.&rdquo; Devouring the enemies with fire and shutting heaven that no rain may fall are very similar to what Elijah did (2 Kings 1:10-12; 1 Kings 17:1; Luke 4:25). Furthermore, turning water into blood and smiting the earth with every plague are very similar to what Moses did (Exo. 7:17, 19; 9:14; 11:1). This proves that the two witnesses are Moses and Elijah.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE TWO WITNESSES BEING<br />
THE TWO SONS OF OIL BEFORE GOD</h2>
<p>The two witnesses are the two olive trees, the two lampstands, standing before the Lord of the earth (Rev. 11:4). They are olive trees who produce olive oil to supply the need of the lampstands. Hence, they become the storehouses of the olive oil, the sons of oil, to supply the lampstands with the oil needed for their shining. They are called &ldquo;the sons of oil&rdquo; because they are full of oil, that is, full of the Spirit. They are also called the lampstands; in the last three and a half years they will replace the churches as the lampstands for God&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
<p>Moses and Elijah spoke for God to His people and supplied them with His Spirit. The word of God is the Spirit of God, who is signified by the olive oil. Therefore, Moses and Elijah are the two sons of oil standing before God to supply God&rsquo;s people with the Spirit in God&rsquo;s word as the olive oil that they may receive the rich Spirit to be God&rsquo;s lampstand shining and testifying for God.</p>
<p>Moses and Elijah minister not only to God&rsquo;s Old Testament people but also to God&rsquo;s New Testament believers. In the great tribulation, when Antichrist carries out his persecution by his evil power, the two witnesses will prophesy, speak for God, and testify against the evil doings of Antichrist. During the days of the great tribulation, the persecution will become very cruel and intense so that Antichrist will even force the Jews to forsake their religion. Hence, God will send Moses and Elijah, who are filled with the Spirit, to establish the Jews; at the same time, they will also establish the believers who still remain in the great tribulation. According to Revelation 14, once the firstfruits are raptured, Antichrist will come to persecute God&rsquo;s people, compelling them to worship him and his image (vv. 9-12). At that time the two witnesses will come to minister to the believers who will pass through the great tribulation. Their becoming the sons of oil is something real and not vain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Zechariah 4:2 likens God&rsquo;s people, the Israelites, to the golden lampstand, which testifies for God on the earth. There is an olive tree on both the right and the left side of the lampstand to produce olive oil to supply the need of the lampstand. The two olive trees are also called the two sons of oil. In Revelation 11 they are called the two witnesses and the two prophets, signifying Moses and Elijah.</p>
<p>Moses and Elijah as representatives of the Old Testament law and prophets appeared before the Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration. Moses, who represented the law, and Elijah, who represented the prophets, stand before God to testify for God. The Bible also prophesied that Elijah will come again, indicating that he will be one of the two witnesses. Furthermore, one of the two witnesses in Revelation will devour the enemies with fire and shut heaven so that no rain may fall, as Elijah did; another will turn water into blood and smite the earth with every plague, as Moses did. This proves that the two witnesses are Moses and Elijah.</p>
<p>The two witnesses are also called the sons of oil because they are full of oil, that is, full of the Spirit. They are also called the lampstands; in the last three and a half years they will replace the churches as the lampstands for God&rsquo;s testimony that shines forth for God. Moses and Elijah as the two sons of oil live before God to supply God&rsquo;s people with the Spirit in God&rsquo;s word as the olive oil that they may receive the rich Spirit to be God&rsquo;s lampstand shining and testifying for God. They also supply God&rsquo;s New Testament believers. In the great tribulation, when Antichrist carries out his persecution by his evil power, the two witnesses will prophesy, speak for God, and testify against the evil doings of Antichrist. They will be filled with the Spirit to establish the Jews who are being persecuted and at the same time establish and minister to the believers who remain in the great tribulation after the rapture of the firstfruits.</p>

</ol><h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>The Bible uses not only plants to signify God, Christ, the church, the believers, and the world but also stones to signify Christ and the believers. According to 1 Corinthians 3:6-15, plants are for growth, and stones are for building. Plants grow to produce materials, and stones are built to accomplish a purpose&mdash;the building up of the church. The change from the growing plants to the building stones involves a process of transformation. To grow, to be transformed, and to be built involve Christ being life to the believers. This is the intrinsic reason that the Bible uses plants and stones to signify what Christ is to the believers and what the believers&rsquo; function is to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE LIVING STONE TYPIFYING<br />
CHRIST AND THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Living Stone Typifying Christ</h2>
<p>Using stones as symbols, the Bible likens Christ to a living stone, rejected by men but with God precious for the accomplishing of the glorious building in God&rsquo;s eternal economy (1 Pet. 2:4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Possessing Life and Being Living</h2>
<p>A natural stone, being lifeless, is dead and not living. However, as a stone, Christ possesses life and is living to bring forth transformation and building.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being Able to Generate and Transform</h2>
<p>As a living stone, Christ is able to generate us so that we may become living stones.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Being for God&rsquo;s Building and Expression</h2>
<p>The generation and transformation by Christ as the living stone is for God&rsquo;s building and expression, the consummation of which is the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is built with precious stones generated and transformed by Christ as the living stone to be the corporate expression of God in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Living Stone Typifying the Believers</h2>
<p>Not only is Christ Himself a living stone, but He also makes the believers living stones by His life for the building up of the spiritual house of God (v. 5), which is the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Through Regeneration</h2>
<p>The believers were clay in God&rsquo;s creation (1 Cor. 15:47a). After they are regenerated by God with the word, the embodiment of the life of Christ (1 Pet. 1:23), they receive the divine life and nature and become stones (John 1:42).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Through Growth and Transformation</h2>
<p>The word which regenerates us is likened to the seed of a plant (1 Pet. 1:23). As regenerated persons brought forth by the word, we are plants that have been planted and watered by gospel preachers (1 Cor. 3:6-7). By enjoying Christ as our life supply and through growth and transformation, we become materials for God&rsquo;s building (vv. 9-12).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. For God&rsquo;s Building</h2>
<p>The purpose of Christ&rsquo;s being the living stone is for the building up of the spiritual house of God, which is the church. This purpose is accomplished by the believers being regenerated and becoming living stones for the building up of the church as the spiritual house of God (1 Pet. 2:5). These living stones are not separated or scattered and not merely piled together; rather, they are built with one another. Such a building is approved by the Lord, as indicated by the Lord&rsquo;s giving a white stone to the overcomers in Pergamos, who overcome the worldly church (Rev. 2:12-17).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE ROCK TYPIFYING CHRIST IN MANY ASPECTS</h2>
<p>The Scriptures liken Christ to a living stone. They further liken Him to a rock (1 Cor. 10:4).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being Steady, Sure, and Stable</h2>
<p>A living stone, as a figure of Christ, shows that He possesses life and is living. A rock, as a symbol of Christ, shows that He is steady and sure. He is firm, fixed, and stable in order to carry out His various functions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Having Been Tested</h2>
<p>As a sure and trustworthy rock, Christ has been tested. Some of His tests were of God (Isa. 53:4), some of His tests were of men (Matt. 16:1-12; 19:3-12), and some of His tests were of Satan (4:1-11). All these tests confirmed that Christ, as the rock laid by God, was sure.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Being Trustworthy</h2>
<p>As a tested stone, Christ is trustworthy. Hence, those who believe on Him shall not be put to shame (Isa. 28:16; Rom. 9:33).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Being Massive</h2>
<p>As the shadow of a massive rock in a wasted land, Christ is a shelter for men. Thus, the believers have a resting place while walking on the heavenly pathway (Isa. 32:2).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Being Spiritual</h2>
<p>As a massive rock, Christ is also spiritual (1 Cor. 10:4), having God, who is the Spirit, as His content and substance. As such, He is able to minister all the riches of divinity to those who believe on Him. He is not only living, possessing God&rsquo;s life, but He is also spiritual, having God&rsquo;s riches.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Following His Believers</h2>
<p>As a spiritual rock, Christ is able to move (v. 4). Hence, He is a spiritual rock who follows His believers. When His believers move according to the Spirit, He follows and moves with them to supply them with all the riches of God wherever they go and whatever they do.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Having Been Cleft</h2>
<p>As a living rock who is sure, tested, trustworthy, massive, spiritual, and movable, Christ has also been cleft so that all the spiritual riches in Him, signified by the living water flowing out of the cleft rock, might be released to be our supply (Exo. 17:6; Num. 20:11; 1 Cor. 10:4).</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE FOUNDATION STONE TYPIFYING CHRIST<br />
AS THE FOUNDATION OF GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<p>The most important function of Christ as the rock is to be the foundation stone of God&rsquo;s divine building in the universe (Isa. 28:16; 1 Cor. 3:11).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being Firm, Secure, and Unshakable</h2>
<p>As the foundation of God&rsquo;s building, Christ must be firm, secure, and unshakable. This requires Him to be a rock that is firm and secure. Only such a foundation stone can enable God&rsquo;s building to suffer any kind of attack or opposition and not fall (Matt. 7:24-27).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Having Sufficient Strength<br />
to Uphold the Entire Building</h2>
<p>As the divine, massive rock as the foundation of God&rsquo;s divine building, Christ has sufficient strength to uphold the entire building of God in the universe, that is, His universal church. Christ as the firm foundation stands (2 Tim. 2:19a), and the church, which God has built upon such a firm foundation, cannot be shaken by any person, thing, or matter in the universe. The gates of Hades, Satan&rsquo;s power of darkness, cannot prevail against the church which is built upon this rock as the firm foundation (Matt. 16:18).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE CORNERSTONE TYPIFYING<br />
CHRIST AS THE JOINING OF GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<p>As the living stone and the rock, Christ is not only the foundation stone to uphold God&rsquo;s building but also the cornerstone (Isa. 28:16; Eph. 2:20b; Acts 4:11; 1 Pet. 2:6-7) to join the different sides, the different sections, of God&rsquo;s building. God&rsquo;s universal building is His church, the constituents of which are of different sides, including the Jews and the Gentiles. All these believers of different sides need joining in addition to upholding. Therefore, Christ is not only the foundation stone to uphold the church but also the cornerstone to join the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. For Joining</h2>
<p>The most important function of Christ as the cornerstone of God&rsquo;s building is to join together the different sides of God&rsquo;s building. This is to join the believers, both Jewish and Gentile, to the unique church, which is the holy temple of God in the universe (Eph. 2:18-21), so that the Jewish and Gentile believers may become one Body (2:16; 3:6) as the fullness of God (v. 19) to be the great universal, corporate expression of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. For Supporting</h2>
<p>As the cornerstone of God&rsquo;s building, Christ is not only for joining the different sides of God&rsquo;s building but also for supporting the top cover of God&rsquo;s building. By Christ&rsquo;s joining, the different sides of God&rsquo;s building have the strength to stand and become the support of the top covering of God&rsquo;s building. Without Christ&rsquo;s joining, the walls of God&rsquo;s building cannot stand on their own, but through Christ&rsquo;s joining they can stand and become a strong support for the top covering of God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE TOPSTONE TYPIFYING CHRIST<br />
AS THE TOP COVERING OF GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<p>If God&rsquo;s building has only the foundation stone for upholding and the cornerstone for joining but does not have the topstone for covering, it becomes something with open, empty walls and is without any function whatsoever.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. For Covering</h2>
<p>As the topstone (Zech. 4:7), Christ is for covering God&rsquo;s entire building. The church of God enjoys Christ&rsquo;s covering as the topstone.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. For Protection</h2>
<p>As the topstone of God&rsquo;s building, Christ is not only for covering against forces from the outside but even more for protecting the contents of God&rsquo;s building. Without the protection of Christ as the topstone, the contents of the church&mdash;including the spiritual riches and the saints who enjoy the riches&mdash;would have no safeguard and would be damaged and destroyed by the enemy, Satan.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. THE ROCK OF STUMBLING TYPIFYING<br />
THE EFFECT OF CHRIST ON THE UNBELIEVERS</h2>
<p>Isaiah 8:14 and 15 say that Christ will become &ldquo;a stone to strike against / And a rock of stumbling / To both houses of Israel... / And many will stumble at these, / And will fall and be broken to pieces.&rdquo; Isaiah&rsquo;s word is quoted by the apostle Paul in Romans 9:32-33 and by Peter in 1 Peter 2:7-8. All these portions speak concerning the effect of Christ as the rock on the perverted people, that is, on His being a stone to strike against and a rock of stumbling. The unbelieving Israelites truly stumbled and fell on Him and were even broken to pieces (Matt. 21:44a).</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE SMITING STONE</h2>
<p>As the rock laid by God, Christ is not only a stone to strike against and a rock of stumbling to the unbelieving perverted ones but also a smiting stone to those who rebel against God and oppose God (Dan. 2:34-35, 44-45; Matt. 21:44b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. As the Seed of God&rsquo;s Kingdom<br />
to Grow God&rsquo;s Kingdom</h2>
<p>As the stone that smites God&rsquo;s enemy, Christ is for bringing in God&rsquo;s kingdom. Before He becomes the stone to smite God&rsquo;s enemy for the kingdom, He first became the seed of God&rsquo;s kingdom to grow God&rsquo;s kingdom (Mark 4:3, 26).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. As the Stone Cut Out without Hands<br />
That Will Smash the Nations on the Earth<br />
Which Fight against the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>As the seed of God&rsquo;s kingdom in His first coming to the earth, Christ was sown on the earth as the gospel to grow the kingdom of God, which is the church (Rom. 14:17). At His coming again, He will become a stone cut out without hands to smash and completely destroy the nations which fight against the kingdom of God so that the kingdom on the earth may become the kingdom of God and of Him (Rev. 11:15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Becoming a Great Mountain,<br />
Signifying the Kingdom of God<br />
That Will Fill the Whole Earth</h2>
<p>After smashing the nations which are at enmity with God, Christ as the stone cut out without hands will become a great mountain that will fill the whole earth. This indicates that He, as the stone dealing with the nations which are at enmity with God, will become the kingdom of God which will fill the whole earth. This shows that Christ as the reality of the kingdom of God in the church will be enlarged to become the kingdom of God which will fill the whole earth. Both the kingdom of God in the church today and the enlarged kingdom of God in the kingdom age in the future are Christ Himself and both take Christ as the reality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The Bible uses not only plants to signify God, Christ, the church, the believers, and the world but also stones to signify Christ and the believers. According to 1 Corinthians 3:6-15, plants are for growth, and stones are for building. The plants grow to produce materials, and the stones are built to produce the church. The change from the growing plants to the building stones involves a process of transformation. This is the process of Christ being life to the believers, and it reveals the intrinsic reason that the Bible uses plants and stones to signify what Christ is to the believers.</p>
<p>With stones as symbols, the Bible likens Christ to the living stone, the rock, the foundation stone, the cornerstone, the topstone, the rock of stumbling, and the smiting stone. The living stone signifies that Christ possesses life and is living for generating the believers that they may become living stones for God&rsquo;s building and expression, the consummation of which is the New Jerusalem. The living stones portray the believers, who were clay and who have received the divine life and nature through regeneration to become stones with the purpose of building up the church as the spiritual house of God. Such a building is approved by God. The rock portrays Christ as One who is steady, sure, and stable; who has been tested; who is trustworthy, massive, and spiritual; who follows His believers; and who has been cleft for ministering His riches to His believers. Such a Christ is also the foundation stone as the foundation of God&rsquo;s building, who is firm, secure, and unshakable, having sufficient strength to uphold the entire building of God in the universe, which is His universal church. He is also the cornerstone for joining the different sides, the different sections, of God&rsquo;s building, making it one Body as God&rsquo;s fullness. With Christ&rsquo;s joining, the walls of God&rsquo;s building become a strong support for the top covering of God&rsquo;s building. Christ as the topstone is for covering God&rsquo;s entire building to resist the forces from outside and to protect the contents of God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>To unbelieving perverted ones, Christ as the rock becomes a stone to strike against and a rock of stumbling; the unbelieving Israelites truly stumbled on Him. Even more, He is the smiting stone to those who rebel against God and oppose God. Before He becomes the stone to smash God&rsquo;s enemy, Christ came as the seed of God&rsquo;s kingdom to sow Himself on the earth as the gospel to grow the kingdom of God, which is the church. When He comes back, He will be a stone cut out without hands to smash and completely destroy the nations which fight against the kingdom of God, and He will become a great mountain to fill the whole earth. This indicates that Christ will be enlarged to be the kingdom of God which will fill the whole earth.</p>

</ol><h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this last lesson on the types of the Old Testament, we will cover how Christ, the overcomers as His followers, and the totality of God&rsquo;s redeemed people are typified in the Bible by the heavenly luminaries, the three lights created by God&mdash;the sun, the moon, and the stars (Gen. 1:14-18).</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SUN, THE MOON, AND THE STARS<br />
SIGNIFYING THE TOTALITY OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEEMED</h2>
<p>The Bible uses the heavenly luminaries, the three lights, in God&rsquo;s creation as signs to portray God&rsquo;s redeemed, because even though man sees his trespasses, iniquities, defilement, and uncleanness, God sees His people as clean and bright. According to God&rsquo;s eternal view, He sees them as His chosen and redeemed people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Sun, the Moon, and the Stars<br />
Signifying the Whole House of Jacob</h2>
<p>The Old Testament uses the sun, the moon, and the stars to signify the whole house of Jacob, which was chosen and redeemed by God (37:9-10). Jacob and his whole house were chosen and redeemed by God, but God chose and redeemed them not according to what they were and did in their natural life but according to the will of God&rsquo;s supreme sovereignty and His abundant mercy (Rom. 9:10-18). According to man&rsquo;s view, they were evil and defiled, but according to God&rsquo;s view, they were bright and heavenly. Therefore, in God&rsquo;s eternal view, they were as bright as the heavenly luminaries, the three lights. Among them Jacob was like the sun, his wife Rachel was like the moon, and his twelve sons were like twelve stars.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Sun, the Moon, and the Stars<br />
Signifying the Totality of the Saints<br />
in the Old and New Testaments</h2>
<p>The New Testament uses the sun, the moon, and the stars to signify the totality of the saints in the Old and New Testaments with the sign of the universal corporate woman (Rev. 12:1). Both the Old Testament saints and the New Testament believers are the saints chosen and redeemed by God. God looks at them according to His eternal view and the purpose of His economy, not according to what they are and do. In this view, they are clean and bright, like the God-created heavenly luminaries, the three lights, which serve as symbols of them.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The New Testament Believers as the Sun</h2>
<p>The universal woman in Revelation 12:1 is clothed with the sun. The sun signifies God&rsquo;s people in the New Testament age. Before Christ came to the world, the Old Testament age was like a dark night. When Christ, as the rising sun, came from on high (Luke 1:78), the age of the sun came. Since Christ has come, the New Testament believers are living in the day, and since they are a part of Christ, they are part of the sun. The church, which is composed of all the New Testament believers, shines corporately in the day to show forth the glory of God (Phil. 2:15-16). The woman, who is clothed with the sun, indicates also that the New Testament believers constitute the major part of God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Old Testament Saints as the Moon</h2>
<p>Before Christ came, it was the age of the moon, which signifies God&rsquo;s people in the Old Testament age. The moon is underneath the feet of the universal woman because the age of the moon is the age of the law, which, in God&rsquo;s eyes, should not be exalted like the stars.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Old Testament Patriarchs as Twelve Stars</h2>
<p>The stars signify the patriarchs, God&rsquo;s people before the law was given, shining individually in the dark night with the divine, heavenly light. These individual stars are the crown on the universal woman&rsquo;s head, indicating that the glory of God&rsquo;s grace and economy should be exalted. The number twelve signifies completion in God&rsquo;s eternal economy. The patriarchs were under the principle of grace, not under the law; hence, they were a crown exalted on the head of the woman.</p>
<p>All God&rsquo;s people in these three ages, who together constitute the woman, are light-bearers. Hence, she is the bright woman shining throughout all generations.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE SUN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Signifying Christ</h2>
<p>In both the Old and New Testaments the sun is used mainly to signify the Christ of glory.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Rising Sun</h2>
<p>With the sun as a symbol of Christ, the Bible uses the rising, dawning sun to signify Christ (Luke 1:78). Before the first coming of Christ to the earth, the Old Testament was like a dark night; hence, the Old Testament patriarchs are signified by the stars, and the Old Testament saints are signified by the moon. At His first coming, Christ appeared as the rising sun to bring in the day.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Sun of Righteousness</h2>
<p>With the sun as a symbol of Christ, the Bible portrays Him as the Sun of righteousness (Mal. 4:2). At His second coming to the earth, to those who fear the Lord&rsquo;s name, Christ will appear as the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings. This will be the beginning of the days of the restoration of all things in the kingdom age, and there will no longer be a dim, dark night but rather a clear, bright day. Christ&rsquo;s shining is full of the restoring power to eliminate death and decay in God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Signifying the Followers of Christ</h2>
<p>In the restoration in the coming kingdom, Christ will shine like the sun, and the overcomers as His followers will also shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their heavenly Father, which is the heavenly part of the kingdom (Matt. 13:43). Furthermore, those who love the Lord will be like the sun rising in its might, and their path will be like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until the full day (Judg. 5:31b; Prov. 4:18).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE STARS</h2>
<p>In the Bible the stars not only signify Christ but also the overcomers among God&rsquo;s redeemed people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Signifying Christ</h2>
<p>As a symbol in the Old and New Testaments, a star is first used to portray Christ shining over the earth permeated by darkness in the age of the dark night.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. A Star out of Jacob</h2>
<p>Concerning the star as a symbol of Christ, the Bible says that He would be like a Star out of Jacob (Num. 24:17). This word was fulfilled at His first coming. The magi saw His star at its rising (Matt. 2:2), and when they arrived in the land of Judah, the star appeared to them again and led them to worship Him (vv. 9-11).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Bright Morning Star</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals that Christ, who is signified by the heavenly luminaries, the three lights, is the bright morning star (Rev. 22:16). Concerning the types of Christ, the entire Bible begins with Him as the light (Gen. 1:3) and ends with Him as the morning star, a luminary. The morning star appears in the darkest hour, after midnight and prior to the dawn. This indicates that Christ will appear as the bright morning star in the darkest time, prior to the close of this age. His appearing as the morning star and His appearing as the Sun of righteousness will not be at the same time. The former occurs before dawn, and the latter occurs after the dawning of the day. As the Sun of righteousness after the dawning of the day, He will appear publicly to all the people on the earth. As the bright morning star before the dawning of the day, He will appear privately to the overcomers who are watching, preparing, and waiting for Him. While people are sleeping soundly in the night, He will secretly give Himself as the morning star to those who love Him and who watch and wait for Him (Rev. 2:28), that they may have the priority to taste the freshness of His presence at His coming back after a long absence. This will encourage them to earnestly seek the Lord&rsquo;s presence and be watchful so that they will be able to stand before Him in the secret part of His coming, when He will come as a thief (Luke 21:36; Matt. 24:43).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Morning Star Rising in the Hearts<br />
of Those Who Love the Lord&rsquo;s Appearing</h2>
<p>Second Peter 1:19 says, &ldquo;We have the prophetic word made more firm, to which you do well to give heed as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.&rdquo; The day dawning and the morning star rising in the believers&rsquo; hearts is a metaphor. When Peter wrote his second Epistle, the church was already in desolation and had entered into the gloom of the dark night of apostasy. Hence, Peter told the believers who were in the gloom of the dark night of apostasy that they have the prophetic word of the Scriptures, to which they should give heed as to a lamp shining in a dark place. When we give heed to the word of the Scriptures as to a lamp shining in a dark place, the condition within us will be like the day dawning and the morning star rising in our hearts.</p>
<p>Figuratively, <em>the day dawns</em> refers to the coming age of the kingdom as a bright day dawning; <em>the morning star</em> refers to Christ, who, in the darkest hour of the night, prior to the dawning of the kingdom age, will secretly rise in the hearts of those who love His appearing. In this sense, if we keep giving heed to the shining word of the Scriptures, we will have the kingdom as the day dawning in us and Christ as the morning star rising and shining in our hearts. This means that we will have His appearing as the morning star rising in our hearts to shine in the darkness of apostasy where we are today, before His actual appearing as the bright morning star.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Signifying the Overcomers<br />
among God&rsquo;s Redeemed</h2>
<p>Since God&rsquo;s redeemed people have received His perfect redemption, they belong to Christ and are of the same kind as Christ. In the eyes of God, Christ is the shining star and the redeemed of God are bright stars.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Shining Stars</h2>
<p>According to Daniel 12:3, God&rsquo;s redeemed in the Old Testament, that is, those who turn many to righteousness, who lead people to God, and who do righteousness by God, will shine as stars forever and ever. If the redeemed people of God in the Old Testament can shine as stars, the believers who have received God&rsquo;s grace in the New Testament should shine much more as the heavenly stars in today&rsquo;s dark age. The apostle Paul solemnly charges in Philippians 2:15-16 that we should be children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom we shine as luminaries, reflecting the word of life, the embodiment of Christ. The Lord Jesus also said that we are the light of the world, and He charged us to let our light shine over people (Matt. 5:14-16).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Seven Stars</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that the serving messengers in the seven local churches are seven stars (Rev. 1:16, 20; 2:1; 3:1). In the darkness of the church&rsquo;s desolation, the responsible ones in every local church should be like stars in the night shining from heaven over the church in darkness. Without this, one is not qualified to serve and take the lead in a local church. The messengers who lead the churches should shine as heavenly stars, and all the saints under their leadership should imitate them to shine as stars according to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The heavenly luminaries, the three lights&mdash;the sun, the moon, and the stars&mdash;signify Christ, the overcomers as His followers, and the totality of God&rsquo;s redeemed people. The Old Testament uses the sun, the moon, and the stars to signify the whole house of Jacob, which was chosen and redeemed by God. Among the redeemed, Jacob was like the sun, his wife Rachel was like the moon, and his twelve sons were like twelve stars. The New Testament uses the sun, the moon, and the stars to signify the totality of the saints of the Old Testament and the New Testament. The New Testament believers are typified as the sun, the Old Testament saints as the moon, and Old Testament patriarchs as twelve stars.</p>
<p>In both the Old and New Testaments the sun is used mainly to signify the Christ of glory. He appears as the rising sun to bring in the day, and He is also the Sun of righteousness. At His second coming to the earth, to those who fear the Lord&rsquo;s name, Christ will appear as the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings, and His shining will be full of the restoring power to eliminate death and decay in God&rsquo;s creation. Furthermore, the overcomers as the followers of Christ will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their heavenly Father, which is the heavenly part of the kingdom. Those who love the Lord will be like the sun rising in its might, and their path will be like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until the full day.</p>
<p>In the Bible the stars not only signify Christ but also the overcomers among God&rsquo;s redeemed people. The star portrays how Christ shines over the earth, which is permeated by darkness, in the age of the dark night. As the Star out of Jacob, He came to the land of Judah in His first coming. As the bright morning star, He will appear in the darkest hour, after midnight and prior to the dawn. This means that while people are sleeping soundly in the night, He will secretly give Himself as the morning star to the overcomers, those who love Him and who are watching, preparing, and waiting for Him, that they may have the priority to taste the freshness of His presence at His coming back after a long absence. Furthermore, He will rise as the morning star in the hearts of those who love His appearing to shine in the darkness of apostasy where they are today, before His actual appearing as the bright morning star. Since God&rsquo;s redeemed people have received His perfect redemption, they belong to Christ and are of the same kind as Christ. Hence, they also become bright stars shining as luminaries in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation to reflect the word of life, the embodiment of Christ. Today in the darkness of the church&rsquo;s desolation, the responsible ones in every local church should be like stars in the night shining from heaven over the church in darkness, and all the saints under their leadership should imitate them to shine as stars according to the Lord.</p>
