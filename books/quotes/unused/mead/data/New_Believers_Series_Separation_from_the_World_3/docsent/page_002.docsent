   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Many Frustrations from Pharaoh</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The story of Israel's exodus from Egypt shows us how difficult it was for them to leave Egypt!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Egypt tried to hold them back again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Israelites first wanted to leave Egypt, Pharaoh only allowed the strong men to go; the young and the old had to stay back.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Pharaoh knew that if he could hold back the young and the old the strong men would not go far.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After a while they would come back.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Satan's strategy is to prevent us from having a thorough separation from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From the very beginning, Moses rejected Pharaoh's delays.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we leave one thing or one person behind, we cannot go too far; eventually we will turn back.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You may recall what Pharaoh told Moses the first time: "Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land" Exo 8:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Later, he told him not to go too far.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The third time he told him that only the strong ones could go.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fourth time, he told him that all the people could go but the cattle and the sheep had to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Pharaoh's way was to persuade them to serve God there in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was his basic premise.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was willing to allow a person to be God's child as long as such a one remained in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He knew that if a person served God in Egypt, he would not have a testimony and he would have to serve Pharaoh in the end. Even though one wanted to be God's servant, he would eventually end up being Satan's servant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you try to serve God in the world, you will surely end up being Satan's slave.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You will have to make bricks for him, and he will not let you go.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even if he does, he will not let you go too far.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If he lets you go, he may only allow the strong men to go; the rest will have to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Satan is quite familiar with the words in Matthew 6:21: "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The treasure and the person go together.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He knew that if Pharaoh held back the cattle and the sheep, the people would not go too far.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The people eventually would follow the cattle and the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But God wanted the cattle and the sheep to follow the people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He wanted the people to be saved from the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After a person is saved, he must go out to the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moreover, he has to bring all the people and all his treasures with him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Otherwise, he will eventually go back to Egypt, and there will be no separation from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's commandment is that those who serve Him must separate themselves from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>C. Our Way Being in the Wilderness</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Just to confess the Lord with our mouth and say, "I have believed in the Lord today," is not enough for a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must come out from the world and be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This takes us one step further than confessing Jesus as Lord with our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We cannot be dumb Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, opening up our mouth alone is not enough; we must be separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot continue our previous friendships, social ties, or other previous relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must treasure our present position in the Lord and turn far away from our previous position.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The person has to go out, and the possessions have to go out as well.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Others may say that we are foolish, but we should not listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today we have to come out from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From the time we become a Christian, our way is that of the wilderness, not of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In New Testament terms, both Egypt and the wilderness represent the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Egypt refers to the world in its moral sense.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The wilderness refers to the world in its physical sense.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christians are in the physical world but not in the moral world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must see that there are two aspects of the world: the first as a place and the second as a system.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are many things related to the physical world which are attractive, which arouse the lusts of the eyes, the lusts of the flesh, and the vainglory of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But there is another meaning to the world the physical world as a place where one's body resides.</S>
