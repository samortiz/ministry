   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEANS OF THE CHURCH S</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INCREASE AND SPREAD IN ACTS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Acts not only records the facts related to the church s increase and spread; it also shows four important means of the church s increase and spread.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first means is the economical Spirit, the Spirit of power, descending on the lovers of the Lord 1:8; 2:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second means is prayer, which is continued steadfastly 6:4; 1:14; 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The third means is God s word 6:7 , which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s word has power, because the word of God is life, light, and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As such, it brings salvation to man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not preach ourselves or philosophy, and even more, not ethics or theories; we preach and release the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fourth means is the believers homes; this is the practical means for God s increase and spread.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Acts does not contain a record concerning meetings in a chapel, but there is a record of meeting from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The believers broke bread and prayed together from house to house 2:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They also announced the gospel and taught Jesus as the Christ from house to house 5:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Finally, Paul spoke of teaching and admonishing the believers from house to house 20:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The means for God s spread is through His Spirit, by the prayer of the believers, by the release of God s word, and through the believers homes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These four aspects occupy a very important position in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In addition to these four aspects, we need to be His witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 1:8 the Lord clearly said, You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Witness in Greek means martyr, one who lays down his life, who pays the price of his life, to be a witness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Peter, James, and John were the Lord s witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They testified not only by their words but also by their living; eventually, they testified even with their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Each one was a martyr.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every witness should be a martyr.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order for God to have a way to propagate, we must have the spirit of a martyr, willing to sacrifice everything, offer everything, and even lose our lives to testify for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through these five means in Acts, there was a continuous increase and spread of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord can have a way on the earth only through the Spirit of God, through the prayer of the saints, through God s word, through the believers homes, and through living witnesses who are martyrs.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>EVALUATING THE STATISTICS OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we need to fellowship concerning the statistics of the church in Taipei and evaluate them in light of our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It has been thirty-six years since the church in Taipei was established in 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today there are many young people, all below the age of thirty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this we are truly happy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even though the older saints are very precious, the young saints are more important.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every successful business relies on young people because they are the ones who are able to move forward.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this respect, the church in Taipei is a moving church; it is normal in many aspects, and it is full of vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Regrettably, it is not normal enough, because there is almost no increase.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is quite painful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the church in Taipei began to meet, there were only twenty to thirty people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not long afterward, Brother Chang Wu-chen and others contacted me and then came here.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thereafter, the number increased gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In April or May of the following year, I also came here.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At that time the church was meeting in a Japanese-style house on Shanghai Road.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Later I spent some time traveling south by train from Taipei, visiting the saints who were scattered in various places along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After this time of visitation I realized that the Lord had a way to go on, even though the saints were scattered throughout Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After returning to Taipei, we decided to officially start the work on August 1, 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At that time there were between three and five hundred brothers and sisters in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The meetings of the church in Taipei included seventy to eighty saints.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>With these saints as a base, our numbers increased to three thousand over the next six years.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We had an annual rate of increase of over one hundred percent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even when counting all the saints in the churches on the island, we still had a forty percent annual rate of increase.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Three thousand saints is a conservative number.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the past thirty-five years more than fifty-seven thousand information cards have been filled out by saints in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In 1956 there were approximately thirteen thousand eight hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In other words, the church in Taipei included over thirteen thousand saints in 1956.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although we had a large number of people on record, a smaller number regularly attended the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In particular, the church in Taipei was well known for its high percentage of absent saints.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In times of good attendance, approximately one-third would come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At other times, only twenty-five percent would come.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, the actual number of regular attendees, those who were solidly in the church life, was about three thousand in Taipei in 1956.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Nevertheless, the rate of increase was very high in the first five to six years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since 1956 to 1984, this base number of three thousand has remained fairly constant.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>While we do not need annual rates of increase that equal our early years, we do need to increase.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even a twenty percent rate of increase would be commendable.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, over the past twenty-eight years we have not even reached this standard; this exposes a great shortcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I regret very much that I did not pay attention to our statistics when I came back over ten years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we had paid attention to them, perhaps we could have redeemed much time.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For many years the number of people attending the Lord s Day meeting in the church in Taipei has averaged about three thousand one hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On the most recent Lord s Day, however, there were about three thousand five hundred, an increase of four hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This increase reflects the impact of beginning to once again meet in small groups, which has brought in some new ones and recovered some dormant saints.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The actual number of saints in the church life in Taipei may be closer to five thousand five hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But even if this is the case, the number of those in the normal church life in Taipei has increased only from three thousand to five thousand five hundred in a span of almost twenty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is an average annual rate of increase of less than three percent.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is truly not justifiable.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even though we have lost contact with some saints in the last twenty-eight years due to moving, emigration, and death, we have also baptized at least ten thousand people and possibly as many as forty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>According to our observations, we have not lost contact with many as a result of moving, and at most, five thousand have emigrated.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In addition, the increasing life expectancy in Taiwan has limited our losses due to death.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This indicates that we have a high rate of those who are simply absent from the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We cannot comfort ourselves with excuses; rather, we should locate the source of our problem.</S>
