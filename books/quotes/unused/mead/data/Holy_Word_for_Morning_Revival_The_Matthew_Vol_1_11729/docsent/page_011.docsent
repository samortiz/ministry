   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 2 DAY 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 2:1-2, 23</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2 Saying, Where is He who has been born King of the Jews?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For we saw His star at its rising and have come to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>23 And he came and settled in a city called 1 Nazareth</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the time of Jesus' birth, there was a religion called Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was a fundamental, sound, scriptural religion; however, hardly anyone in that religion knew that Christ had come.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We find no record in the New Testament that some of those religious people went to find Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God gave the magi a shining star to guide them 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the wise men experienced the vision of the heavenly star, they got into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This trouble came from their natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The wise men saw the vision and assumed that they should go to Jerusalem vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Their decision to go to Jerusalem did not come from the light of the star.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jerusalem was the wrong place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their error cost the lives of many young ones vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Be careful: you may have the Bible and the star, but do not follow your natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How about today's situation?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many are very scriptural, but they care only for the Scriptures, not for the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all need to pray, "Lord, give me a heart for You.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I want to see the vision and I want to know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But even more, I want to have a heart that seeks You."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we must see how we can have this star, how we can have this heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible tells us that the living star is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was prophesied that Christ would be the star Num 24:17 , He came as the star Matt 2 , and He remains as the star Rev 22:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is shining.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to 2 Peter 1:19, the star is associated with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Peter tells us to take heed to the "prophetic word made more firm."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we take heed to this firm word, something within us will dawn, and the morning star will rise in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today there are only two ways to have the star shining over you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the first way, you must come to the sure Word and open up your whole being to the Word your mouth, your eyes, your mind, your spirit, and your heart until something rises up in you and shines over you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The second way is to come to the shining saints, the followers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you come to them, you will receive light for they will lead you to the place where Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Both ways of having the star are linked to the Spirit and the church see Rev 22:16-17a; 3:1; 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>81-83, 87-88</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>23 1 Under God's sovereign arrangement Caesar Augustus ordered the first census of the Roman Empire Luke 2:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was through that census that Christ was born in Bethlehem Luke 2:4-7 to fulfill the prophecy concerning His birth Micah 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He stayed there a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then, because of Herod's persecution He was taken to Egypt vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>13-15 , and subsequently He was brought back to the land of Israel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because of Archelaus's reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, Christ was brought to Nazareth, a despised city of Galilee vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>22-23; John 1:45-46 , and was raised there.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was born in the esteemed town of Bethlehem but grew up in the despised city of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, He was called a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To follow Christ requires that we heed not only the Scriptures concerning Him but also the instant leadings, such as those Joseph had in his dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Caring only for the Scriptures while neglecting the instant leadings may cause us to miss Christ, as did the Jewish priests and scribes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Heeding the instant leadings requires a seeking heart.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>81-91; Hymns: #1219, #801</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
