   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE PROPER FUNCTIONS OF THE SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SOUL, AND THE HEART Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 5:23; Psa 51:6; Jer 31:33; Heb 8:10; 4:12; Mark 12:30; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>36:26-27; 1 John 3:20-21; Heb 10:22; John 16:22; 2 Cor 11:3; Eph 3:16-17 THE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE SPIRIT, THE SOUL, AND THE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we want to contact the Lord and be mingled with Him, we must know the distinctions between the spirit, the soul, and the heart in more detail.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, we must be clear concerning the difference between the soul and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The teaching that the soul and the spirit are different is absolutely based upon the Holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Thessalonians 5:23 says, The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This verse mentions the three parts of man the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all have an outward body, an inward soul, and a spirit, which is the innermost part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, the soul and the spirit are each composed of three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The soul is composed of the mind, the emotion, and the will Psa 139:14; S. S. 1:7; Job 6:7 , and the spirit is composed of the conscience, the intuition, and the fellowship Rom 9:1; 1 Cor 2:11; Eph 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Regrettably, some Christians say that the soul and the spirit are the same thing and that the terms soul and spirit are synonymous.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 there is the conjunction and between the words spirit and soul, proving that the spirit and the soul are not the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, Hebrews 4:12 says, For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This verse makes it clear that the spirit and the soul are two different things that can be divided from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not our concept; this is the teaching of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must believe the Scriptures, not man s concept.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hebrews 4:12 also mentions the heart, which refers not to the physical heart but to the psychological heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What are the parts of the heart?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First John 3:20-21 says, Because if our heart blames us, it is because God is greater than our heart and knows all things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Beloved, if our heart does not blame us, we have boldness toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Inward condemnation is a function of the conscience, but these verses say that our heart can condemn us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that the conscience is a part of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hebrews 10:22 says, Let us come forward to the Holy of Holies with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This verse also proves that the conscience is a part of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John 16:22 says, Therefore you also now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one takes your joy away from you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rejoicing and being happy are functions of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, this verse indicates that the emotion is a part of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hebrews 4:12 mentions the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thoughts belong to the mind, and intentions belong to the will, indicating that the mind and the will are also parts of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, we may say that the heart is composed of four parts the conscience of the spirit and the emotion, mind, and will of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are going to know the Lord in the way of life, we must be clear about these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Otherwise, it will be difficult for us to be healthy Christians and to make progress with the Lord in the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a person wants to be a doctor, he must study the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise, if we want to be healthy Christians, we must know the inward and hidden parts of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE FUNCTIONS OF THE HEART AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Word tells us that we must love the Lord Deut 6:5; Psa 31:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With what part of our being do we love the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Mark 12:30 says, You shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no mention in the Scriptures of our loving the Lord with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to love the Lord, we must love Him with our heart, but in order to take the Lord, we cannot use our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For instance, suppose I offer you a book.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No matter how much your heart loves the book, your heart does not have hands and cannot take the book.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suppose I give you an apple.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No matter how much your heart loves the apple, it cannot eat the apple.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You must use your mouth to eat the apple.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Similarly, if we love the Lord and want to take Him in, we cannot take Him in with our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must take in the Lord with our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Ezekiel 36:26 says, I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This verse tells us that we have a new heart and a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The function of the new heart is to love the Lord, and the function of the new spirit is to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes we feel that it is sufficient to merely love the Lord without receiving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, this is as foolish as thinking that it is enough to love our food and that it is unnecessary to eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must eat our food and take it into us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Similarly, it would be foolish to merely love the Lord without taking Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Loving the Lord is only the beginning; eventually, we must take Him in. We may love the Lord with our whole heart, but if we do not take Him in, we cannot gain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Of course, we must first love the Lord with our heart in order to receive Him with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For instance, if there is good food on the table, but I do not have the appetite for it or do not like it, I will not take it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, I first need a heart to love the food, but I also need the proper organ to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I cannot take the food in through my eyes or ears.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If I wanted to listen to someone s voice, I would use my ears, or if I wanted to look at some pictures, I would use my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, if I want to take in food and drink, I must use my mouth and stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Which organ of our being do we use to receive the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We cannot use our ears, nose, mouth, eyes, hands, or even our mind to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we want to understand some teachings, we need to exercise our mind, but it is impossible to receive the Lord with our mind, just as it is impossible to satisfy our hunger by meditating on food.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We cannot use our heart to receive the Lord, even though we may love the Lord with all of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need to be clear that the organ we must use to contact and receive the Lord is our spirit.</S>
