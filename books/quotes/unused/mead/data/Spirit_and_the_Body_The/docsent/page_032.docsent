   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED TO KNOW THE SPIRIT OF SONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We can only be a son of God by having the Spirit of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This Spirit of sonship is the Spirit of holiness and the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you do not know what the Spirit of holiness is and what the Spirit of life is, then you cannot know what the Spirit of sonship is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although you may be a son of God, you may not know the meaning of this sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Can you explain what sonship is?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christians may talk about the Body in Romans 12 without seeing that the members of the Body are the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No one can be a member of Christ if he is not a son of God, and no one can be a proper member in the Body of Christ without knowing what sonship is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, to be a proper member of Christ's Body, we must know the meaning of the Spirit of holiness and the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE SPIRIT OF HOLINESS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let us now consider the Spirit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Holiness denotes God's unique nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Greek, the word holiness means to be separated, different, from all common things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, to be holy is to be unique, to be different, set apart from everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, to be holy means to be just like God Himself and to be different from anyone and anything else and any matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's divine nature is unique, different from all other things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the entire universe there is only one nature absolutely different from all other things, and this is the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not an insignificant matter to be holy, for to be holy is virtually to be divine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is to be separate, different, from anything other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Holiness denotes such a condition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is the state of being separated from all other things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only God Himself is in such a condition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Christ came as man, He put on human nature, but this human nature was not holy, for it was exactly the same as our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The only difference was that in our nature there was sin, but in His nature there was no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be sinless is not the same as being holy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A table is not sinful, but it certainly is not holy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sinlessness, or purity, is not holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Holiness refers to a condition, a state of being, in which someone or something is different from everything other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Christ took upon Himself the flesh, He put on something that was common.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His flesh was neither sinful nor holy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was later positionally consecrated, separated, to God Luke 2:22-23 , but dispositionally His humanity remained common.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, the humanity Christ had put on needed to be made holy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was accomplished through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>CHRIST'S TRANSFIGURATION</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ's resurrection was a type of transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You are no doubt familiar with Christ's transfiguration on the mountain Matt 17:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the time of that transfiguration, He was made holy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Prior to that event, He was in the common flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His humanity was common, the same as that of Peter, James, John, and every other man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we have pointed out, the unique thing about Christ's humanity was that there was no sin in it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But as far as the nature of the flesh and blood is concerned, it was exactly the same as our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Christ was transfigured on the mountain, He was sanctified, made holy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was made different from Peter, James, and John.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His transfiguration actually was His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Later, when He was resurrected, He was fully transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In His transfiguration Christ was designated, marked out, to be the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When Jesus was transfigured, His face shone as the sun, and He became separate from all other people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The same thing took place in His resurrection: His physical body became separate, different, from all things other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This was according to the Spirit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Jesus' transfiguration was something inward, not something outward.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was according to the Spirit of holiness within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At the time of His transfiguration, the Spirit of holiness permeated and saturated His whole being to make Him separate, different, from anything other than God.</S>
