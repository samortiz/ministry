   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY THE MINISTERS AND THE MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BECOMING ONE Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:8-9, 16-18; 4:6-7</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we consider the matter of the ministers and the ministry becoming one, we need to consider the words of the Lord Jesus concerning righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When He issued the decree of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens Matt 5:1 7:29 , He said some important things concerning righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Again and again He emphasized righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He declared, Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied Matt 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then He went on to say, Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens Matt 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He also taught His disciples, Unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens Matt 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus also emphasized righteousness when He said, But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you Matt 6:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead of worrying about food and clothing, we need to seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But what is this righteousness emphasized by the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This righteousness is Christ lived out from within us to be the expression of God and the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we have this righteousness, we surely have God s reign.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have God s ruling, administration, and government.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that we have the kingdom with peace and joy in our daily life, family life, and church life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Again and again I would emphasize the fact that the new covenant ministry is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I never grow tired of repeating this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This new covenant ministry is the ministry in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the recovery we only minister Christ as the life-giving Spirit and as our living righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we read 3:8, 9, and 16 through 18, we can see clearly that eventually all the ministers of the new covenant become one with their ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that the ministers are the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Their ministry is what they are, not merely what they do or the work they accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The very being of the new covenant ministers is their ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we may speak of the ministers and the ministry becoming one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>TWO STAGES OF THE NEW COVENANT MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second Corinthians 3:8 and 9 say, How shall not rather the ministry of the Spirit be in glory?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Notice that verse 8 says that the ministry of the new covenant is in glory, and verse 9 says that this ministry abounds in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we see two stages of the new covenant ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first stage is the ministry of the Spirit; the second stage is the ministry of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the ministry is of the Spirit, it is in the first stage.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the ministry in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the ministry is of righteousness, it is in the second stage.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this stage the new covenant ministry not only is in glory it abounds in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The reason it abounds in glory is that righteousness comes forth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These two stages of the new covenant ministry can be applied to our family life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Suppose a brother, his wife, and child receive the ministry of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>With the ministry of the Spirit there is glory, but this ministry does not abound in glory, for there is not yet any righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But perhaps after a period of time the husband, the wife, and the child all live out righteousness according to the Spirit of life within them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the ministry of righteousness abounding in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Anyone visiting that family would be able to realize what a glory there is with them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the initial stage, the stage of the ministry of the Spirit, the ministry of the new covenant is in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But when this ministry becomes the ministry of righteousness, the ministry abounds in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever the ministry of the Spirit is lived out in us with the expression of righteousness, the ministry abounds in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 3:8 and 9 in glory and abounds in glory are both related to the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But in verses 16 through 18 glory is related not to the ministry, but to the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In verse 18 Paul says, And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this verse the word we refers to the apostles, who, as examples and representatives of all believers, are the ministers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, in verses 8 and 9 the glory is related to the ministry, but in verse 18 it is related to the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although the glory in verses 8 and 9 is related to the ministry, and the glory in verse 18 is related to the ministers, there are not two kinds of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is not one kind of glory attached to the ministry and another kind of glory related to the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No, there is only one kind of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This proves that eventually all the ministers of the new covenant become one with their ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What they are in their being, their person, is their ministry.</S>
