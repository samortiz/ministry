   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How does God cleanse us?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He does it with His life through His own word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many times we do not know in which aspect we need to be cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But one day the life within us will not let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before long His rhema comes into us, indicating what must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the one hand, it is the life that touches us, and on the other hand, it is the word that tells us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes we are engaged in something which seems quite good according to doctrine, and our reason for doing it is also quite right, but within there is something which keeps touching us and will not let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually, the Lord speaks to us; rhema comes, the mighty word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It tells us that a certain matter must be dealt with and cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the one hand, this is the life, and on the other hand, it is the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By this we are cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sometimes the order is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the beginning we do not feel anything while we are engaged in a certain matter; in fact, we feel that everything is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when rhema comes, the word of the Lord speaks to us first, telling us that this particular matter is wrong, and then the life within us demands that we deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Either the life of the Lord does not allow us to do something, and the word comes; or first the word comes, and then the life follows, demanding that we deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But it is always the cleansing of the water in the word to sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, the whole matter of our growth and progress depends upon our attitude towards life and rhema.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we have any inner feeling in life, we should never let it go.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must pray, "Lord, please give the rhema that I might know how to deal with this situation."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the Lord first gives us rhema, speaking to us first, then we still need to ask Him to supply us with life to deal with the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we pay attention to these matters and do not take them lightly, the Lord will cleanse us by the washing of the water in the word that we may be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before the Lord, the meaning of the church being cleansed by the washing of water is that the life of Christ deals with every part that is not out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The natural life and all that is not out of Christ must be purged away.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sanctification can only come after cleansing, and the basis of cleansing is the Lord's word, the rhema.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do not know the Lord's word, there is no way for us to be cleansed and sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since the day we became Christians, from where has our knowledge come?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Has it come from an outward source or from an inward one?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do we understand the will of God from within, or is His will still something outside of us?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many difficulties have their root in this very matter the lack of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The reason the Body of Christ cannot be built is because we merely have something outward, not something inward.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The whole basis of the Christian faith depends upon the Lord's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The growth of the church also depends upon the word which the Lord speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, the central point of our prayers should be our longing for the Lord's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Oh, may the Lord speak to us!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord's word being spoken to us will enable us to attain the eternal purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church today is not like Eve in Genesis 2, because the church has fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So the Lord must cleanse us by the washing of the water in the word.</S>
