<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>1</b> The Maker of the universe</div>
<div class='line'>As Man, for man was made a curse.</div>
<div class='line'>The claims of law which He had made,</div>
<div class='line'>Unto the uttermost He paid.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> His holy fingers made the bough</div>
<div class='line'>Which grew the thorns that, crowned His brow.</div>
<div class='line'>The nails that pierced His hands were mined</div>
<div class='line'>In secret places He designed.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> He made the forest whence there sprung</div>
<div class='line'>The tree on which His body hung.</div>
<div class='line'>He died upon a cross of wood,</div>
<div class='line'>Yet made the hill on which it stood.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> The sky that darkened o'er His head</div>
<div class='line'>By Him above the earth was spread.</div>
<div class='line'>The sun that hid from Him its face</div>
<div class='line'>By His decree was poised in space.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>5</b> The spear which spilled His precious blood</div>
<div class='line'>Was tempered in the fires of God.</div>
<div class='line'>The grave in which His form was laid,</div>
<div class='line'>Was hewn in rocks His hands had made.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>6</b> The throne on which He now appears</div>
<div class='line'>Was His from everlasting years,</div>
<div class='line'>But a new glory crowns His brow,</div>
<div class='line'>And every knee to Him shall bow.</div>
