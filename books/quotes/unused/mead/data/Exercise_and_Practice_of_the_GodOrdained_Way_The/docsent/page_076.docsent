   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT BEARING TOO MANY CHILDREN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first item regarding raising up children is that you cannot care properly for too many.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When you baptize someone, you are very happy, but you have to realize that this person is now your babe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You must take care of him and raise him up as your child.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You are now a mother, and you have to assume the responsibilities of motherhood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is very troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every young lady wants to get married and have children, but after she has had three children, she may weep and say, "I do not want any more children."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is because raising up children is so difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, if you have too many new ones to take care of, you will not be able to do it properly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is good to have spiritual children, but do not have too many.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Taipei when we were experimenting with the new way, we broke this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We considered that the more we could baptize, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We baptized so many that we could not care for all of them adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It seems that we had only begetting ones, without anyone to feed these newborn babes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through this we learned that every believer who preaches the gospel must also care for the new ones as a mother raising up her own children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To have home meetings is the way to fulfill this responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>TAKING THE WAY OF INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The home meeting is for raising up the newborn believers, not only as your children but also as God's growing children.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the unique shortage among us and also among all of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Wherever there is a group of Christians, and among them there is the proper care for the new ones, that church will become quite large.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, this work cannot be carried out on a large scale by the church as a whole; it must be done through the individual families.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In society it is difficult to raise up children on a large scale.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If every family raises three or four children in their home, eventually, many proper persons will be produced to benefit society.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every team is a family.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you are a team of three members, you must become a family raising up the new ones as your children, yet considering them as God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You are simply nursing mothers doing the work of raising up these children for God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To carry out this kind of work, you must keep certain principles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You should not leave the raising up of your children to others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not go out to do other things, leaving your children under others' care.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You must "stay home" and take care of your children directly by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To leave your children in the care of others for even a short time may cause some damage; they may suffer and not grow so well.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The work of raising up the new ones must be under your direct care.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then you should not try to care for too many at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a team of three, you should be able to take care of six to ten new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once you have this many to care for, you should stop going out to baptize more and concentrate your energy, time, and attention on these six to ten.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is best to care for these new ones for about two years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For the first half year, you should render intensive care, visiting them twice each week for two months and then once each week for four months.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>During this period of time, to leave your children as orphans to be raised by others would cause much damage.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, you should fall in love with your children and be willing to sacrifice yourselves for them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without the sacrifices of its mother, no child could be raised properly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Based upon my study and our history of nearly sixty-five years, I have found that the only way to raise up a proper church life is by begetting babes and raising them up as children.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the way to fulfill the Lord's commandment to go and disciple all the nations Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To disciple the nations, we must start by discipling individuals, yet we cannot go alone; we must go as a team.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The best number to have in a team is three.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the one hand, to have too many on a team may allow too many opinions to come in, but on the other hand, to have only two on a team would be too few because these two may quarrel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, a third member is needed to balance them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Also, if the members are not the same age, this will help to balance the team.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all must learn how to work together as a team without any opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then our team can become a family, working together year-round to raise up the Lord's children.</S>
