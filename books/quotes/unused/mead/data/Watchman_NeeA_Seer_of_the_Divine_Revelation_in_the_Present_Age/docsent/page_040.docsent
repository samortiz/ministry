   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE EXPERIENCING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS THE GREAT PHYSICIAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because of overwork and lack of adequate physical care, Watchman Nee became sick with tuberculosis of the lungs in 1924.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It became so serious that in some of his open letters to the readers of his papers he said that the pegs of his tabernacle on earth were shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Several times rumors were spread that he had died.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During this time of illness, he was greatly exercised to trust in God for his existence, and God faithfully cared for him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He suffered with this illness for about five years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually, however, he was graciously healed by experiencing God as his Great Physician.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The following is his personal testimony regarding this matter given at Kulangsu, Fukien, October 20, 1936:</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>SICK BUT NOT CEASING FROM WORK</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I first became aware of my illness in 1924, I was feeling feeble, there was pain in my chest, and I had a slight fever.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I did not know what was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Dr. H.S. Hwang said to me, "I know you have faith and that God can cure you, but allow me to examine you and diagnose your disease." After the examination he spoke to Brother Wong Teng-ming for some time in a very low voice.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At first, even though I asked, they would not tell me the result of the examination.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when I informed them that I was not afraid, Dr. Wong told me that I was afflicted with tuberculosis and that my condition was so serious that prolonged rest would be necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I could not sleep that night; I did not want to meet the Lord without having completed my work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I was very depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I decided to go to the countryside for a rest and have more fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I asked the Lord, "What is Your will for me?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If You wish me to lay down my life, I am not afraid to die."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For half a year I could not grasp the Lord's will, but there was joy in my heart, and I believed the Lord could never be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The many letters I received during this time did not convey encouragement or consolation; rather, they rebuked me for overworking and for not taking adequate care of my life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One brother reproached me by quoting Ephesians 5:29, "For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brother Cheng Chi-kwei of Nanking invited me to his home where I could rest and at the same time help him translate Dr. C.I. Scofield's Bible correspondence course.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At this time some thirty brothers and sisters came to me for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I spoke with them regarding the question of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I came to realize that God's hand was on me for the express purpose of turning me back to my first vision; otherwise, I would have ended up walking in the path of a revival preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Day after day passed without my tuberculosis being cured.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Though I exerted myself to write and to study the Bible, I found it exceedingly strenuous.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I had a slight fever each afternoon, I could not sleep at night, and I frequently experienced night sweats.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Upon being advised to take more rest, I replied, "I am afraid that I might rest to such a degree that I become rusty."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I felt that even though I might not live long, I should believe that God would increase my strength and that I must work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I asked the Lord concerning any unfinished work He had for me to do.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whatever He wanted me to do, I would ask Him to spare my life to do it; otherwise, I felt there was nothing upon earth worth living for.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For awhile I was able to arise from bed, but eventually I could not even do that.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On one occasion I was asked to conduct a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I exerted myself to arise and asked the Lord to strengthen me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>While walking to the meeting, I was forced to lean against a lamp post every now and then for rest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Each time this happened I would say to the Lord, "It is worthwhile to die for You."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some brothers who knew that I had done this rebuked me for not sparing my health.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To this I replied that I loved my Lord and would give up my life for Him.</S>
