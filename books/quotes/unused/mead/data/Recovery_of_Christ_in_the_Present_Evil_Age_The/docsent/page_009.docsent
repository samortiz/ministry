   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Being Formed in Us and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our Not Being Separated from Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Galatians 4:19 Paul says, My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 5:4 Paul says, You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we return to religion, we are separated from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ will never go along with religion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is always versus religion, and religion is always against Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we care for religion, we are through with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we care for Christ, we will have nothing to do with religion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, we all have preoccupying religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Any Christian in a new kind of meeting will criticize the meeting according to his or her religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should measure a meeting only according to how much Christ is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need a vision to see that God does not want any religion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God wants only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Gospels show that while the Lord was on the earth, He did not keep any forms.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He ministered in every place the mountaintop, the seashore, homes, and streets.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need such a Christ today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is more real and practical to us than He was to His disciples, for He is within us, but He could only be among them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not add religious forms or concepts to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To decide to function in a meeting without being led by the Lord is to bring in a form.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To avoid bringing in religion, we should simply come to the meeting full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to tell the Lord every day, Lord Jesus, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The disciples followed You outwardly, but today I follow You inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Lord, I will never leave You.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I want to be with You always.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have been a Christian for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the very beginning of my Christian life I picked up many religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I thought that since I was a Christian, I needed to always be gentle and submissive and never lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such concepts are religious.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I read many books to try to learn how to overcome sin and be kind, gentle, humble, and pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, I eventually realized that these books were religious.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now I see that I do not need to strive to overcome sin or to be kind, gentle, humble, and pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>My only responsibility is to love Christ, follow Him, and remain in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not be conscious of anything but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should always be Christ-conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not consider whether or not the elders in our church are good.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This kind of question comes from a religious mind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are Christ-conscious, we will not have such a question.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should care only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Being Christ-conscious takes care of everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the saints in a local church should be Christ-conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many saints today are still more religion-conscious than Christ-conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When someone speaks in the meetings, others may have opinions about the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Recently, I was asked how a brother should deal with someone who is bothering him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This question is in the realm of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because Christ lives within us, we do not need to ask this kind of question.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are Christ-conscious, we will not be bothered by something in our environment such as a troublesome roommate.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Saints have expressed opinions to me about certain brothers or sisters being good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This kind of thinking is also in the realm of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord does not categorize persons or situations according to good and bad.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we are Christ-conscious, we will see that all the saints are lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To someone who is Christ-conscious, every person and situation is about the same.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Questions from a religious mind are endless.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A sister may ask what style of glasses she should wear.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Instead of being conscious of glasses, we need to be Christ-conscious and care only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A brother may ask what kind of diet he should have.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This question too is of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Everything is religion when Christ is neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Apparently, my wife controls my eating, but actually, it is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is only because I have Christ within me that I am able to accept my wife s control of my diet.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even asking how to live by Christ is in the realm of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Living by Christ is like breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We do not first study it and then try to apply it; instead, we learn by doing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Anything that we do to please God apart from Christ is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Christ is real and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He should not be limited to the realm of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The answer to every question is the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Questions concerning relationships, dress, and diet are all answered by Christ within.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we are Christ-conscious, Christ will be everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Christianity today has become a religion of doing things for God apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many Christians serve and worship God but neglect Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should decide on a hairstyle not according to current fashions but according to Christ s speaking within.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We need to see the principle of living by the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If I am about to become impatient with someone, Christ within me will trouble me about this, and I simply need to say, Amen, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In this way I gain the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Christian life is not a matter of teaching, form, regulation, or instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We simply need to follow Christ within.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We need a vision and a revelation to see that God desires nothing but Christ and that Christ today is living, real, and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Galatians 6:15 says, Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The new creation is the mingling of Christ with us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Christ lives within us, we are one with Christ, and we are living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>While we are living Christ, we are Christ, because He is expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When we see this vision, the entire Bible will become light, life, and food to us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In today s recovery God wants a group of people who are Christ-conscious living by Christ, walking with Christ, loving Christ, dealing with Christ, and remaining in Christ s presence all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I believe that the Lord will prepare a good number of saints to send out to Europe and Israel to raise up churches.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He will come back when He can tell the enemy, You have set up many religious things, but look at My church, My bride.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>They all live by Me and are one with Me. They are no longer religious, and they have no tradition, superstition, or falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They have only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They are a group of people who are fully Christ-conscious, and they are My testimony.</S>
