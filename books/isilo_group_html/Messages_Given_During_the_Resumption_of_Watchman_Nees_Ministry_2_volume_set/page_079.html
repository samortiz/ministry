The Holy Spirit was working, and everyone was enlightened to repent in tears and to vow that they would never hold back the gospel again. Many of the saints consecrated their families, their jobs, and everything they had to the Lord. When we met together, there was a time when we had only tears before the Lord. During those days, no one preached much, and it is hard to describe the atmosphere of the meetings. Once a person stepped into the meeting, he would feel the Lord's presence. The brothers and sisters consecrated all that they had. Some saints dared not open up their closets when they went home, for when they did, a voice within would say, "Consecrate!"</P><P>One brother who was a judge observed the consecration of the brothers and sisters, and he remarked that what happened then was even more than what happened at Pentecost. What he said may be too much, but this brother did not say things lightly. He could say such a word because God's work was really prevailing then. At that time, there was a brother in his fifties who at one time saw the Lord Himself standing on the podium. When the brother was giving the message, the Lord was standing beside him. What he saw was something real, not an illusion.</P><P>During one of the meetings, I lifted up my hands to pray for about half an hour. The words just kept coming unceasingly. There was no need for me to think about what to pray; the words flowed out spontaneously. If you ask me to repeat what I prayed then, I cannot do it. At the end, when I lifted up my two arms, one brother sitting in front of me lifted his hands also to hold up my arms. After this, two groups of brothers and sisters migrated out. The first group consisted of over seventy people, among whom over sixty of them had their traveling expenses taken care of by the church. Later another thirty or more saints migrated to Manchuria. Today, the Lord is still blessing them.</P><P>From that time on, many people began to pay attention to us. But we did not know what power it was that was upholding us. At that time, our meeting on Fourth Street became the subject of conversation for many people, and some rumored that we had a sack of gold. After the Japanese came, they spent two and a half months to investigate me.</P><P>After the first group migrated out, we were going to send out the second group; the second group consisted of professionals, such as doctors and merchants. Not long after that, the Japanese arrested me. I was put into prison for a month. When I came out, I contracted a serious illness. After a year, I left Chefoo and have not returned since. The ones who migrated went to Inner Mongolia, Sinkiang, and Ningsia.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Migration Being to Live for the Gospel</H2><P>There is some problem about settling in a place for too long. Some people were poor at the beginning. After they believed in the Lord, they took care of their businesses well and made profits from them. As a result, they offer more. But although they offer larger amounts, the percentage of offering compared with their profits becomes less and less. For example, they may have made a thousand dollars in the first year, and they spent only a few hundred dollars. The offering was fifty percent of their profit. After their business grew to a few hundreds of thousands of dollars, or tens of millions of dollars, they began to keep more for their own use, and they offer less percentage-wise. Although they are clear in their prayer, they become confused in practice. When others come around and persuade them, they invest in real estate again or start more partnerships. When opportunity comes and other businesses relocate elsewhere, they would buy the others' properties. In this way, they become settled, and the heavenly people become rooted on the earth. Their roots embrace the earth, and they have "colonized" themselves on the earth. All the churches begin to take root this way. In the meetings, everyone agrees that we should not love the world. But in practice, it becomes entirely different. When material wealth increases, offerings in the church increase, but so do the luxuries in the saints' homes. Without realizing it, the church has become worldly and secular. Migration is an uprooting in which a person sells all he has and moves to another place to live for the gospel.</P><P>One doctor by the name of Wu once talked with me, and I told him that if he sold everything he had and moved to a certain place, he could practice medicine during the week, preach the gospel on the Lord's Day morning, and have a Bible study in the afternoon. His wife could be a "sister-preacher." In a year's time, he could very well bring a hundred people to the Lord. If he would do this, after a few years, he could move to another place and do the same thing again. After a year in the second place, if he could not save a hundred people again, he could come to see me. If you sell all you have and get only three billion dollars for a five billion dollar business, outwardly it seems that you have lost two billion dollars. Actually, you have gained your soul. In Acts 1, after the Lord's resurrection, the disciples were interested in the question of the kingdom; they were not enthusiastic about going out. In the end, the Lord had to send a fire to burn Jerusalem and force them out in that way (Acts 8:1-4). The Lord's word says that the gospel would be preached from Jerusalem, through Judea, unto the remotest part of the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Need for a Revived Living</H2><P>God's children should be a "moving" people; they should not be a "staying" people. They should go to the frontier lands. Man cares for human relationships, and he is reluctant to move. But God wants man to move. In the past God has gained some good vessels in China. If we will not do this for the Lord, who else will do it? In order to practice this, first we must recover the preaching of the gospel, and we must have a revived living. After this, we should migrate out. The Japanese may have been defeated, but something else may come. In Chefoo, we had the blessing because we sent people out. At present, there are over thirty places with the Lord's table in Sui-yuan province already. These brothers moved out from Chang-chia-kou, station after station, and went all the way from Chefoo to Sui-yuan province.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Migration Being Likened to a Relay Race</H2><P>At present, over a hundred brothers and sisters in Shanghai have signed up already. Whenever the Lord gives us the leading, and whenever there is the opportunity, these ones would migrate out. Today, we need a group of pioneers. When a person moves out, he is really dropping everything. In Shanghai we have about a thousand brothers and sisters. We should have over fifty million dollars in offerings every month. In Chefoo, the more the saints migrated, the more people we saw added to the church. In preaching the gospel, there is the need of stations. This is like a relay race. The Westerners have sent the gospel to the coastal regions of China. Today, we have to carry the gospel from the coastal regions to the interior regions. The Westerners cannot open the door of the gospel in the interior regions. Today, however, God will open this door through us.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_078.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_080.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 79</div><br></body></html>
