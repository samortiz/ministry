For as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness unto lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification.<br><br>Romans 6:22<br>But now, having been freed from sin and having been enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.</li><li>The believers’ mind being renewed—Rom. 12:2b.<br><br>Romans 12:2b<br>…be transformed by the renewing of the mind, that you may prove by testing what the will of God is, that which is good and well-pleasing and perfect.</li><li>Every part of the believers’ soul being transformed—Rom. 12:2b.<br><br>Romans 12:2b<br>…be transformed by the renewing of the mind, that you may prove by testing what the will of God is, that which is good and well-pleasing and perfect.</li><li>The believers being conformed to the image of God’s firstborn Son—Rom. 8:29a.<br><br>Romans 8:29a<br>Because whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son…</li><li>The believers being saturated with the divine glory—the redemption of the body—Rom. 8:30b, 23.<br><br>Romans 8:30b<br>…and whom He justified, these He also glorified.<br><br>Romans 8:23<br>And not only so, but we ourselves also, having the firstfruit of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting sonship, the redemption of our body.</li></ol>
