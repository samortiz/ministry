   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RESURRECTION TRANSCENDING EVERYTHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the Lord resurrected, time and space were no longer constraints to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Death could not contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through His resurrection He broke the barrier of death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lazarus's resurrection was different from the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The former was only a kind of resuscitation to life; it was not actually a resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lazarus was not able to break even the bondage of his grave clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the end he still had to go through death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The limitation of death still remained with him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Lord resurrected, however, He broke the barrier of death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He passed through death but was not held by death Acts 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The gates of Hades could not stop Him; they could not swallow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He resurrected, and He will die no more.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Death has no power or leverage over Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the Lord resurrected, not even His disciples like Peter and Thomas could believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Mary the Magdalene went and told Peter and John about the Lord's disappearance from the grave, the two disciples went to look for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They only found the linen cloths and the handkerchief which had been over His head folded up in one place; however, the Lord was not there John 20:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was like a man who had put on his coat and buttoned it, but who had disappeared out of it altogether!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Lazarus resurrected, he was still wrapped up in his linen cloths and handkerchief; he was still bound and limited.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Lord resurrected, He left the linen cloths and the handkerchief behind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that He transcended all barriers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord's resurrection was fundamentally different from Lazarus's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Mr. T. Austin-Sparks said two things about the Lord in His resurrection: He does not come, but He appears.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Neither does He go away, but He disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Lord resurrected, nothing could hold Him back.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is not limited by death, and He has broken all barriers of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has exalted Him to the highest, and He has given Him a name that is above all names, not only in this age but in the age to come Eph 1:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our Christ has transcended everything in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today the Lord is leading us to be as perfect morally as He is as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the same time, He is leading us to experience as much of the power of resurrection as He experienced after His death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is after a man who is perfect both in moral virtues as well as in power.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE CHURCH AFTER THE LORD'S RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>BORN OF THE SPIRIT TO BE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE BODY OF THE RESURRECTED CHRIST,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>BEING ONE WITH THE HEAD</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ became the Head of the church after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before resurrection, in His status as a man, the Lord was not the Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After resurrection, when He ascended to the Father, received from the Father the promised Spirit, and poured Him out to men, the church was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord resurrected to be the Head to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, He has joined us together to be the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Modern biologists can reconstruct the model of an entire animal from a single bone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today God has made the Lord Jesus the Head, and He has made us His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, the nature of the Head becomes the nature of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's Word shows us that just as the Lord is in resurrection, the church is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What then is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is that which is impregnated in the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church is built upon the ground of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Without this, the church is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Ephesians 1:19 speaks of the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This power is the resurrection power manifested by God in Christ through His resurrection from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today the same resurrection power is operating within us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When this power operated in Christ, it made Him the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When this power operates in us, it makes us the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, unless we experience the resurrection power of Christ, we do not know what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The church is the same as Christ is in resurrection; it should be as unlimited and as victorious over everything as Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We say that Ephesians contains the highest truth in the Bible because it shows us the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In nature and in power, the Body of Christ is the same as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In order for us to know the Body of Christ, we need revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Without this, the Body will only be a term to us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In our experience, we need to stand on the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At least two persons have to come together to touch the resurrection power of the Lord and to pray in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord's Word says clearly that all authority in heaven and on earth is given to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Today the Lord wants us to execute this authority Matt 28:18-20 because we are His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Other than having an earthly body, there is no difference between us and the Lord; we are the same as He is spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is indeed a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>THE NEED FOR A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Once we see resurrection, we will know what the Body is.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After the Lord resurrected, He poured out the Holy Spirit and produced the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Through this act He became the Head, and the church became His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>How great the Body is!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>No thought can be higher than the thought of accepting another person as a member of one's own body.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Lord Jesus has accepted us as His members, and He has given us His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We can freely use it now.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>How high and transcendent He is!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Mr. T. Austin-Sparks said that the work of the Holy Spirit is the operation of the power of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Unless a work bears the mark of the operation of the Lord's resurrection power, it cannot be called a work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This matter is truly beyond man's mental apprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have to pray for a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We need a revelation today to see the power that God has granted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As long as two or three see this revelation and stand on resurrection ground to pray in one accord, they will execute heavenly authority.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Hallelujah, we do not need anything more than what we already have!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>All we need to see is the glory, the riches, and the vastness of what we already possess.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The authority in heaven is glorious and great, but it is limited by the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>As long as there are two persons on earth who know resurrection and who stand on resurrection ground today, they will shake the ends of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Presently, we have only touched the hem of the garment of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Lord has released His speaking on resurrection to us in these years.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Praise Him!</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What He has given us is the topmost portion; there cannot be any further improvement because we have become the same as the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This matter rests entirely on our seeing today.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>May we all pray humbly before God, saying, "O Lord, grant me a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that I can see."</S>
