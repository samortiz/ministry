   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING THE ONE WHO IS RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 11 is the unusual and interesting case of Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Lazarus was seriously ill, his two sisters, Martha and Mary, sent news to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ordinarily, upon receiving the report, Jesus would immediately have gone to care for the sick one, but in this case He did not.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, He purposely delayed His visit for two days v. 6 . After two days, His disciples might have become disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They may have asked, "Why wouldn't You do something for Lazarus?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After they were disappointed, the Lord Jesus told them that they would go to see Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When Jesus arrived at Bethany, Martha came out to meet Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She said, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died" v. 21 . The Lord indicated to her that whether He was late or on time meant nothing because He was there as the resurrection v. 25 . It is as if He said, "Resurrection does not depend on time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whether I come earlier or later, I am the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As long as you have Me, resurrection is here.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not blame Me. I purposely came late to show you something.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not be concerned with time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Your brother will be resurrected."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, Martha replied, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day" v. 24 . She qualified the resurrection with a certain time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord answered, "Everyone who lives and believes in Me shall by no means die forever.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you believe this?" v. 26 . Martha said, "Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ" v. 27 . She answered according to her religious, theological concept, not at all according to the Lord's meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this respect, she was our typical representative.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Resurrection is not a matter of being late or on time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a matter of whether or not we have Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Forget about time, the surroundings, the circumstances, and the situations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All this means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only one thing counts, and that is His presence, whether or not you have Him right now.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The case in John 4 shows us that the worship of God is not a matter of this way or that way, of here or there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is a matter of being in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The case in chapter eight shows us that the knowledge of the regulations of religion means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must realize that we are as sinful as others, and we must be reminded that we need the very One who is without sin, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The criticizers need Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have no right, position, or qualification to criticize because we also have sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, we need One who is without sin, and this One is the living Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today this living Jesus is the very Spirit who is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you are going to criticize others, turn to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Your spirit will tell you, "Don't criticize.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You are the same as that one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She is sinful, and you also are not without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, you need One to rescue you from your sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This One is Jesus Christ, the unique One without sin."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The case in chapter nine shows us that whatever situation we are in should remind us that we need Jesus, and this very Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we seek to learn the cause of our situations, we should realize that the cause is simply God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God intended for you to be in that situation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You do not need to be bothered about the reason.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To seek for the reason is merely something of theology.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>While the case in chapter four shows us that the worship of God is not a matter of place, the case in chapter eleven reveals that the resurrection is not a matter of time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a matter of a living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As long as we have Him, we have the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we expect to have a good church life, we must learn from these four cases.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Forget about the place, regulations, the cause, and the time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Forget about criticizing others, regardless of whether they are right, wrong, or even seriously wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you see their wrongdoing, you must be reminded that you are wrong also.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They may be wrong in one way, but you are wrong in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You are not without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then you must be reminded that you need Christ as the life-giving Spirit to rescue you from your sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we would have a good church life, we surely must learn all these lessons.</S>
