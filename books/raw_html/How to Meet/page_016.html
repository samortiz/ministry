 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">WITH THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</h1>
<p>In meetings with the resurrected Christ, the main factor is the breathing of the Holy Breath, the life-giving Spirit (John 20:22). In meetings for the ascended Christ, the central matter is the blowing of the mighty rushing wind (Acts 2:2). This means the blowing of the Spirit of power. So in all the meetings with the resurrected Christ, we see Christ breathing Himself into His disciples as the breath of life, the Spirit of life. Then in the meetings for the ascended Christ, we see the empowering, the clothing of the Spirit with power. I feel deeply burdened that we still need to see more concerning the meetings with the resurrected Christ. I believe that the Lord will recover more and more regarding this matter.</p>
<p>Most people have simply become familiar with the stories of these six or seven chapters at the end of the Gospels and the beginning of the book of Acts. But, as we have seen, in all the pages of the Bible there is the life supply. In all these stories of Christ meeting with His disciples after His resurrection we must receive something as a life supply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INDIVIDUALLY AND CORPORATELY</h2>
<p>The main point which we must see in all these narratives is that by meeting with His disciples, the resurrected Christ revealed Himself to them. There are two ways He took to meet with His disciples: The first is the individual way. He met with His disciples individually. He met Mary Magdalene, Peter, and James in an individual way. The second was in a corporate way. That means that He had some meetings with a good number of His disciples at once. We are told in 1 Corinthians 15:6 that at one time He met with over five hundred brethren. Of course, we may say that there is still another way. Sometimes He met not just with one person individually, but with several together. Once He met with a few sisters; another time with two brothers as they walked. He met with them individually, in two&rsquo;s or more, and at least five or six times according to the record with them all together. Sometimes He met with the sisters corporately, and sometimes He met with the brothers corporately.</p>
<p>According to the account of the Bible, the Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples after His resurrection, either individually or corporately, about eleven or twelve times. It is difficult to come to a definite conclusion regarding this matter, because it is not so clear. But there are at least from eleven to twelve instances. Let me mention them again. In the morning of the resurrection day, the Lord Jesus firstly appeared to one sister alone, Mary Magdalene (John 20:14-18). After that, in the same morning, He appeared to a few sisters together as they went to tell His disciples that He was risen (Matt. 28:8-10; Luke 24:9-10). Thirdly, during the day, the Lord Jesus purposely appeared to Peter (1 Cor. 15:5). Then, in the afternoon, or in the early evening, He appeared to two disciples on their way to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35). The fifth instance of His appearing was that night, when He appeared to all the leading disciples in the room with the doors shut (John 20:19-23). The sixth was the following Lord&rsquo;s day, seven days later&mdash;at that time He appeared again to His leading disciples including Thomas (John 20:24-29). The seventh was His appearance to His disciples on the mountain in Galilee appointed by Him (Matt. 28:16-20). Eighth, He appeared to His disciples on the shore of the Sea of Tiberius (John 21:1-23); ninth, to five hundred people at once (1 Cor. 15:6). The tenth was His appearance to James, individually (1 Cor. 15:7). Number eleven, according to 1 Corinthians 15:7, was to all the Apostles&mdash;it is rather difficult to decide whether this was another separate appearance. Then eventually He appeared to the disciples on the Mount of Olives, when He ascended to the heavens (Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:6-12). According to this enumeration we have twelve instances. But Acts 1:3 tells us that He was &ldquo;seen of them forty days&rdquo;; so this allows for many additional appearances.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HIS CONTINUAL PRESENCE</h2>
<p>Howbeit, we must learn something here. We should not take these just as stories. Many people no doubt have missed the mark, making the Bible either a story book or a book of teachings. Most people take this account purely as a story, without even deriving much teaching from it. But the Lord&rsquo;s intention is not to tell us some stories. John said that he did not record everything&mdash;if he did, &ldquo;even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.&rdquo; Only certain cases are related to fulfill the Lord&rsquo;s intention. Based upon this principle, we must look at these verses to see not a story, but a portrait revealing something. Here in these few chapters&mdash;Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, John 20 and 21, and Acts 1&mdash;is a full record as a kind of portrait revealing the presence of the resurrected Christ, showing how living He is and how He is with us all the time. If we are alone, He is with us; if we are two or three, He is with us. If you are three sisters together, He is with you; if we are two brothers together, He is with us. If you are one who is seeking and loving Him, He is with you; or if you are one who has failed like Peter, He is also with you. Whether you are strong or weak, He is with you. Whether you are in the room or walking on the road, He is with you. Whether we are on the mountain or by the seashore, He is with us. Whether we understand or do not understand, He is still with us. Whether we are conscious of His presence or not conscious of His presence, the resurrected Christ is with us. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>It is so strange and interesting to see that when we are not conscious of His presence, He is more with us. When those two dear but poor brothers on their way to Emmaus were speaking with Him and even rebuking Him&mdash;&ldquo;You came from Jerusalem, don&rsquo;t you know what&rsquo;s going on there?&rdquo; &mdash;He was so much with them. But once their eyes were opened and they realized it was the Lord, He vanished. Do you think He left them? No, He just disappeared in order to train them, in order to help them realize not only His visible presence, but even more His invisible presence. His visible presence is not so precious as His invisible presence. When you are quite conscious of the Lord&rsquo;s presence sometimes, it is not as good as when you are unconscious of His presence. Can you follow me? Many times we are not conscious of His presence; yet that is the most wonderful time.</p>
<p>By all these stories we realize the wonderful presence of the resurrected and living Christ. Never forget that one verse, &ldquo;Lo, I am with you all the days&rdquo; (Matt. 28:20). He did not say, &ldquo;I have been with you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I was with you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I shall be with you,&rdquo; but, &ldquo;Lo, I <em>am</em> with you.&rdquo; He used the present tense. &ldquo;Lo, I am with you all the days.&rdquo; By what way? By any way.</p>
<p>I wish to point out one thing more regarding His appearances. The Lord Jesus is rather &ldquo;sneaky&rdquo;&mdash;may the Lord allow me to use this word. The sisters were told to go and tell the disciples that He would meet them in Galilee. If I were there, I would have said, &ldquo;All right, the Lord Jesus is going to meet us in Galilee. So I will not go to the meeting tonight; He will not appear then. I will do something else.&rdquo; But in the evening of that very day, the Lord Jesus came and joined their meeting! He came not to Galilee, but into a room in Jerusalem. That visit was not appointed by Him; He came without notifying them&mdash;He just came. He did not even knock at the door; He just came in. When they were so frightened and disappointed, yet with some startling reports of His resurrection, He suddenly appeared. If I were Peter, I would say, &ldquo;Lord, You told us that You would meet us in Galilee. Why did You come tonight without any notice?&rdquo; I tell you, the Lord&rsquo;s presence is visible as well as invisible, conscious as well as unconscious. The Lord sometimes notifies us of His presence and more often does not. We just do not know where we will meet Him. Everywhere He meets us. In any case, however, wherever, whenever, He is with us. He is always with us.</p>
