<h2 class="head2">The Hindrance from Greek Culture</h2>
<p>When the early church was spreading on the earth, it was mixed with Hebrew religion and Greek culture. These two sources of mixture wounded and seriously impacted the church. In the realm of human culture, Greek philosophy is very broad and deep; in particular, it explores the meaning of human life in conjunction with worshipping deities. In other words, Greek philosophy connects the meaning of human life with religion.</p>
<p>Chinese sages, such as Confucius and Mencius, focused on human life. Their philosophies have almost no connection with religious concepts. The teachings of Confucius cannot be classified as a religion because only worship of God constitutes a religion. Therefore, the teachings of the Chinese Confucian school of philosophy do not have a religious basis. Greek philosophy is different because it combines the meaning of human life with religion. Moreover, Greek philosophy absorbed the philosophies of other cultures. Elements of Egyptian, Persian, Babylonian, and even Indian culture were mixed and blended into Greek culture.</p>
<p>The special characteristic of the Greeks was that they studied new schools of thought and added the theories of other cultures to their own, incorporating them into Greek philosophy. Greek philosophy is an amalgamation of world philosophies, which made it a strong influence on the early church.</p>
<p>With regard to human life, Greek philosophy speaks of how to behave as a man, and with regard to religion, it speaks of how to worship God. The truths in the Bible emphasize man&rsquo;s relationship with God, and many of them also concern human conduct. Therefore, Greek philosophy is superficially similar to the truth of the Bible, which makes it easy for the two to be mixed together. This is why Greek philosophy was unwittingly brought into the early church. The Gentiles and even the Jews of that time were deeply influenced by Greek philosophy.</p>
<p>If a person who is steeped in Confucian philosophy is saved, it will be difficult for him not to bring his Confucian philosophy into the church. This is because some Confucian teachings, such as forgiving others and loving all men, are similar to what is taught in the Bible. In the early church, people with a background in Greek philosophy heard the gospel and received Christ. However, because they were not yet saved in their thinking, they spontaneously brought concepts from Greek philosophy into the church.</p>
<p>Church history shows that the Gnostics mixed Persian, Babylonian, Egyptian, and Greek things and came to the conclusion that there are two gods in the universe, a low-level and a high-level god. They thought that the low-level god was the god worshipped by the Jews in the Old Testament and that the dark things and physical things in the universe were created by this low-level god. Moreover, they thought that the bright things and spiritual things in the universe were created by the high-level god. They brought this philosophy into the church and also brought in many ordinances. Paul wrote Colossians in opposition to the mixture of Greek philosophy with the church and to deal with the problem of the Gnostics; the phrase <em>the elements of the world</em> in 2:8 refers to these Gentile philosophies. In reference to the trouble caused by Greek philosophy coming into the church, verse 23 says, &ldquo;Such things indeed have a reputation of wisdom in self-imposed worship and lowliness and severe treatment of the body, but are not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.&rdquo; This speaking indicates some of the trouble that was caused when Greek philosophy was brought into the church.</p>
<p>Some of Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, such as Galatians, deal with Judaism. Others, such as Colossians, deal with Greek philosophy. In Galatians the apostle makes it clear that the Spirit has replaced the flesh and that Christ has replaced the law. In Colossians he uses Christ, the Head of the church, to subdue Greek philosophy. In Colossians Paul also discusses the worship of the angels (2:18a), which was brought in by Greek philosophy. Those who worshipped the angels thought that man could not fellowship directly with God but that he had to pass through the hierarchy of the angels. They thought that man could directly worship only the angels. This thought is also present in Catholicism today. Nevertheless, any teaching or philosophy that departs from Christ reflects &ldquo;the elements of the world,&rdquo; not a revelation from God. The apostle used Christ to deal with both Jewish religion and Greek philosophy.</p>
<p>We need to see that human things, such as religion, literature, and philosophy, can easily be mixed into the church. Like the early apostles, we need to use Christ to subdue human philosophies and religions. As soon as religion or philosophy enters the church, Christ loses the first place. The church is a vessel to contain Christ. The church is not for religion or philosophy. Throughout church history, Satan has never ceased from his destroying work; regardless of where the church is, Satan stealthily injects the best of human philosophy into it.</p>
<p>With respect to human behavior, Confucian ethical teachings related to things like etiquette, justice, honesty, modesty, filial piety, respect for elder siblings, faithfulness, and trustworthiness are very good and have maintained the Chinese race until today. Despite the fact that China is backward in many ways, its existence today should be credited to Confucius. While the Chinese ought to respect Confucius, and while we thank the Lord for him, we recognize that his teachings are different from spiritual teachings and cannot be mingled with them. In the church there is only Christ; we should take Christ not only as our worship to God but also as our daily living. I hope the saints are not confused. When the gospel came to China, the situation was frequently confused because of a lack of light; early Chinese Christians mixed Confucian teachings with biblical truths. This was not a benefit but a loss and frustration to the church.</p>
<p>For example, prior to their salvation, we may teach our children with the words of the Bible to honor their parents, be humble, and love their neighbors as themselves. In principle, these are just like the teachings of Confucius. Since the children are not saved, they do not have the life of Christ and need to learn general principles of human conduct; however, these are not the basis of Christian teachings. Before their salvation, without the life of Christ, children must be taught principles of human conduct or else they will become wild. When they are saved and receive the life of Christ, we must use the Bible to enlighten them. Then they will see how corrupt they are and that Christ lives in them. Next, we must use the Bible to show them how to live in Christ and love God and their neighbors according to the life of Christ. Then they will realize that everything they do should not be a matter of human effort but of living Christ. This differs from Confucian teachings; this is the teaching of the church.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether precepts are from the teachings of Confucius, Mencius, or Wang Yang-ming, they teach people to develop their &ldquo;bright virtue&rdquo; in order to increase the brightness within the human heart. These precepts are in the realm of human behavior. Although they may be good, they are apart from Christ and do not contain Christ. As far as human behavior is concerned, we should keep the principles of morality and ethics, but in the church we should not merely keep moral and ethical principles. All that the church is and has is higher than human ethics and morality. Therefore, we should not only have morality and ethics, we should have Christ. The morality and ethics in the church are of God, not of man. Anything that is not of Christ or replaces Christ, even if it is good, cannot be brought into the church.</p>
<p>The church can accept only one thought and one teaching&mdash;Christ. Apart from Him, the church cannot accept any thought or teaching. If we are merely human beings, we should receive the good teachings left by the ancient sages; however, in our standing as the church, we must shut them outside the door. Our speaking in the church meetings must be Christ alone. Even good things, things that do not contradict Christ, must not be brought into the church. Bringing anything other than Christ into the church causes the church to suffer loss, because whatever is not Christ reduces the element of Christ in the church.</p>
<p>I am concerned that we do not have much feeling regarding this matter. Whoever touches God&rsquo;s feeling for the church will have a sensitivity to bringing foreign things into the Body. If we bring things that are not Christ into the church, it is a loss to the church. Even good things, things that do not contradict the teachings of the church, are a loss. The church is Christ; the church is not Judaism, Greek philosophy, or Gnostic teachings. Therefore, Paul dealt with these foreign things by presenting Christ. Many people bring their old concepts into the church and conceal them with the words of the Bible. This is a subtle and dangerous device that Satan uses to spread poisonous germs in the church.</p>
<p>This is not merely an incident in church history. We need to consider whether our concepts regarding the church are according to the heavenly pattern or our own design. The church according to our design is &ldquo;Greek philosophy.&rdquo; We should examine ourselves carefully to see how much &ldquo;Greek philosophy&rdquo; we have brought into the church. Please forgive me for saying this, but very few people are pure. Once a brother made some suggestions to me regarding how the church should be. I knew that his concepts were from &ldquo;Babylon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Egypt,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Persia,&rdquo; but I still asked him, &ldquo;What should the church be like?&rdquo; He told me that the church should establish orphanages and nursing homes and give alms to the poor; he also said that after the meetings the elders should stand at the doors to shake hands with all the brothers. In deciding whether to take such suggestions, we need to consider their source. Often the source of such suggestions is &ldquo;Persian&rdquo; or &ldquo;Greek,&rdquo; not the New Jerusalem or the heavens. These &ldquo;Persian&rdquo; or &ldquo;Greek&rdquo; suggestions do not bring in Christ.</p>
<p>It is not wrong to say that the church should care for orphans, the elderly, and the poor; however, the source of everything that the church does should be Christ. The source makes all the difference. Sometimes saints tell me their negative views concerning the responsible brothers. I ask them what they think should be done. When we deal with problems in the church, we cannot look only at what appears on the surface; rather, we must determine the source. Do the saints&rsquo; problems with the responsible brothers issue from the heavenly vision or from &ldquo;Greek philosophy&rdquo;? The two are as far removed from each other as heaven and earth. Trouble begins when we cannot discern the source.</p>
<p>With regard to human behavior, the teachings of the Chinese sages are more than sufficient. Not many Christians can compare with a person as refined as Wang Yang-ming. He was perfect in his refinement, actions, self-denial, and accuracy. Moreover, he also taught that self-refinement must originate from the heart; outward actions that do not come from the heart are like water without a spring or a tree without roots. If we read the writings of Wang Yang-ming without a clear, inward knowledge of Christ, we might decide that we do not want the Bible, or we might decide to add the teachings of the Chinese sages into it as its sixty-seventh book. May the Lord open our eyes to discern what is of man and what is of God, what is of the old creation and what is of the new creation!</p>
<p>The church issues out of God; God created the church for Christ. The church has no content other than Christ. Human things&mdash;no matter how good they are&mdash;cannot be part of the church. The issue is not whether something is good or bad but whether its source is God and its nature is Christ. During the course of the church, man has brought the best human things into the church, and this has given the church many difficulties and caused much suffering. Those who have the heavenly vision and light must admit that this mixture is a hidden problem in the church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 2, The Course of the Church &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
