   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Godliness with Contentment</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 6 Paul says, "But godliness with contentment is great gain."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning the expression "contentment," Vincent says, "An inward self-sufficiency, as opposed to the lack or the desire of outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It was a favourite Stoic word."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The expression "great gain" means great means of gain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It mainly denotes the blessings in this age godliness plus self-sufficiency and the ability to be free from greediness and the cares of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul's mention of gain in verses 5 and 6 brings him to the matter of dealing with money lovers in verses 7 through 10.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason, he uses the conjunction "for" to join verses 6 and 7.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once again I would point out that because we pay attention to these details, we have come to know the Bible in the way of life, light, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We do not claim to know the Bible more than others do in geography or history.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Neither do we claim the ability to recite more verses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But we can testify that by the Lord's mercy and through the help of great Bible teachers who have gone before us, the Lord has shown us much light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord has given us light, life, and spirit through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Psalmist once declared, "The entrance of thy words giveth light" 119:130 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, the Lord Jesus said, "The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life" John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We praise the Lord for giving us light, life, and spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus was raised in a carpenter's home in Nazareth and was regarded as one who was unlearned.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But there can be no doubt that He had tremendous light, life, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To have light, life, and spirit does not depend on one's scholarship or degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the contrary, our confidence in our education can hinder us from receiving light, life, and spirit through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 6:7 Paul goes on to say, "For we have brought nothing into the world; it is evident that neither can we carry anything out."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This has been wisely ordained by God that we may trust in Him for our needs and live by Him in order to express Him without preoccupation or distraction.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 8 continues, "But having food and covering, with these we shall be satisfied."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although the word covering refers to clothing, it may include dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be satisfied is to have sufficient provision for our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>D. The Desire to Be Rich</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verse 9 Paul says, "But those who resolve to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge men into ruin and destruction."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The resolve mentioned here is related to the strong desire to be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the love of riches, not the possession of them, that leads the avaricious into temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some are actually rich; others have only a strong desire for riches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This evil desire ruins and destroys them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Ruin here implies destruction, and destruction implies perdition, both temporal and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who resolve to be rich fall into a snare, as into a net, and also into many foolish and harmful lustful desires, which cause men to drown or sink into ruin and destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 10 Paul concludes, "For the love of money is a root of all evils, which some having aspired after have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul says that the love of money is a root of all evils.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He does not say that it is the only root.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Greek word rendered aspired after means craved for, longed for.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those with this craving have wandered away from the faith; they have been led astray from the contents of our belief, from the truth of God's New Testament economy.</S>
