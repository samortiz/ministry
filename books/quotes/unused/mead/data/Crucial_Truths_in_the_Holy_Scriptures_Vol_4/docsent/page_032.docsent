   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our new man is born of God and has the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Just as the old man with his devilish nature lives according to the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts Eph 2:3 , the new man with his divine nature proves what is well pleasing to the Lord 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we live by the new man, we spontaneously know God s preferences, inclinations, and tendencies, and our living has the flavor of God.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whereas the old man obeys the aggregate evil spirit that is now operating in the sons of disobedience, the new man is led by the Spirit of God through the inward abiding of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Just as the aggregate evil spirit operates within the realm of the old man, causing the old man to follow Satan, the Holy Spirit operates in the realm of the new man, causing the new man to follow God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we live by our old man, our living is the result of the operation of the aggregate evil spirit, over which Satan is the ruler Eph 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Similarly, when we live by our new man, our living works out God s good pleasure according to the operation of the Holy Spirit Phil 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just as the old man obeys the aggregate evil spirit and fulfills the evil will of Satan, the new man follows the leading of the Holy Spirit and fulfills the good will of God.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Does not practice sin...and he cannot sin 1 John 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The old man is born in sin, so the old man commits sin spontaneously.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the nature of the new man, the new man does not sin and cannot sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, if we desire to be freed from sins, we must reject the old man and live by the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The new man is out of God, not out of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Consequently, the new man is not capable of sin and can enable those who live by the life which is out of God to not sin.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In righteousness and holiness of the reality Eph 4:24 .</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Holiness refers to God s nature, to God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Righteousness and holiness belong to God s reality; consequently, the Bible speaks of righteousness and holiness of the reality.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the new man there is righteousness according to the reality of God, which refers to His ways, and holiness according to the reality of God, which refers to His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since the new man was created not only with God s life but also according to God Himself, the new man has the righteousness and holiness of His reality.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the new man, however, there is righteousness and holiness and the law of God s holiness, righteousness, and goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This law is the law of the Spirit of life, which is in us as an all-powerful living law of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
