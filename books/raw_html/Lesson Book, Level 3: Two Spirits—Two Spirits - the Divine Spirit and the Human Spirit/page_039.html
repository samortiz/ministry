<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Young Saints Preaching with Power</H2><P>[Perhaps you would say, "Brother Lee, you have been in the Word for over fifty years. How can we be powerful in preaching the gospel if we are still young in the Lord?" Let me testify to you that even when I was young my speaking was powerful because of these three matters of prayer, the Word, and the Spirit, the anointing. This indicates that even the young saints can preach the gospel with power and impact if they trust in prayer, the Word, and the Spirit.</P><P>Young saints, you can take a portion of the Word and preach it to others. Only do not trust in any eloquence you might have. Those who are eloquent in speaking may not have any power or impact. But those who are not eloquent, and who may even mispronounce words, may have impact and power in their gospel preaching. If we trust in prayer, the Word, and the Spirit, the Lord may even use speaking with the wrong pronunciation of words to save others.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. SPEAKING CHRIST</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. To All Our Relatives</H2><P>[Dear saints, now we are in the Lord's recovery and I do believe that now is the time for the Lord to carry out His up-to-date move. All of us in the Lord's recovery have to speak Christ in our daily life to our parents, our children, our cousins, and our in-laws. We all owe so much to our relatives. Try to write a list of all the names of your relatives. Among these names maybe twenty percent are saved, and the rest are remaining in unbelief. They need your speaking. All of your relatives need the real help rendered by your speaking of Christ. Do not preach in a religious way, but speak Christ to your relatives in a living way. Speak to your father. Speak to your mother. Speak to your aunt. Speak to your uncle. Speak to your brother. Even if both you and your brother are Christians, you still need to speak one to another. Let your parents hear your speaking. Do not talk about computers, physics, or mathematics, but only Christ. He is the unique treasure! Speak about Jesus, Christ, the life-giving Spirit, the all-inclusive, processed Triune God. Your parents would marvel at such a speaking.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. To Everyone, Everywhere</H2><P>[Continue to speak Christ every day. All human beings today need Christ, yet we need to speak to them. Speak in a living way, in a practical way, according to your experience of Him.] Speak at your school, [in your office, at the coffee break, at your lunch break, at least five minutes every day, five days a week, four weeks a month. At least twenty times monthly you could speak Christ to them.]</P><P>[We believe that today the Lord is the processed Spirit who dwells in us and also upon us. It does not matter whether this Spirit is sensed by us. We believe that while we are serving Him and speaking for Him, especially as we are speaking Him forth, He is with us. We have the Lord's presence within us as the anointing. Through prayer, the Word, and the Spirit, we can have true power and impact.] If we would be faithful to speak in this way, surely many of our dear friends and relatives would be brought to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUMMARY</H2><P>God desires that we Christians would be a speaking people. We must be a people all the time speaking Christ; we must be witnesses of the One in whom we have believed. To speak we need to have the Spirit. The Spirit is within us and upon us, and so we simply need to exercise our spirit. We get the Spirit through prayer. Then the Spirit is our power and boldness in preaching the gospel. The content of our speaking must be the living and rich Word. Even the young saints can preach with power and impact if they would trust in prayer, the Word, and the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>What does it mean to be a witness?</li><li>What is our power and boldness in speaking? How do we receive it?</li><li>What are the three things that we trust in for our gospel preaching to have power and impact?</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>The Up-to-Date Move of the Lord, p. 53.</li><li>The Divine Speaking, p. 19.</li><li>The Up-to-Date Move of the Lord, pp. 52, 53, 59.</li><li>Life-study of First Thessalonians, pp. 12-13.</li><li>Life-study of Acts, p. 429.</li><li>The Up-to-Date Move of the Lord, pp. 73-74, 78, 75.</li><li>Life-study of Acts, p. 430.</li><li>The Divine Speaking, pp. 25-26.</li><li>Life-study of Acts, p. 428.</li></ol>
