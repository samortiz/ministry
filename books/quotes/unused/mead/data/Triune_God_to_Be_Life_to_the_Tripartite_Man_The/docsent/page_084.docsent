   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE TWO ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BY THE TWO SPIRITS Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 13:14; 2 Tim 4:22; Phil 2:1; Rev 1:10</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hymn #737 in Hymns speaks of the fellowship of life and its relationship to the Spirit and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verses 1 and 6 of this hymn say:</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Life eternal brings us</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Fellowship of life,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Fellowship in Spirit,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Saving us from strife.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Fellowship is deepened</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thru the cross of death;</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Fellowship is lifted</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By the Spirit's breath.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We also need to see that our human spirit is related to the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With the divine fellowship of God's life, three things are involved: the Spirit of God, our human spirit, and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this message we want to see the two aspects of the divine fellowship by the two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE VERTICAL ASPECT OF</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE DIVINE FELLOWSHIP BY THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The divine fellowship has two aspects: the vertical aspect between God and us and the horizontal aspect among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The horizontal aspect of the divine fellowship is by the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The vertical aspect of the divine fellowship is by the divine Spirit, the Holy Spirit 2 Cor 13:14; 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word by is actually not strong enough to express what we mean.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit is not merely involved, wrapped up, or mingled with the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit Himself is the fellowship because the fellowship is the flow, the current, of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is like saying that the current of electricity is just the electricity itself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The current of electricity is electricity in motion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the electricity stops, the current of electricity also stops.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the same way, the fellowship of the Holy Spirit mentioned in 2 Corinthians 13:14 is the Spirit moving.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The grace of Christ is Christ Himself enjoyed by us; the love of God is God Himself tasted by us; and the fellowship of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The divine fellowship is the Holy Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without the divine Spirit, there is no fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit is the very element of the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When a stand is made of wood, wood is the element of the stand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise, if a stand is made of steel, steel is the element of the stand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you take away the element, the stand ceases to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is the same with the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you take away the Spirit, the divine fellowship disappears.</S>
