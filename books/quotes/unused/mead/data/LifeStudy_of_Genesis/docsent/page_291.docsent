   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There are a great many Hagars in the Christian world today.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do you want to live a Christian life by yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is better for you to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do you want to preach the gospel with worldly means?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is better that you stop this as well.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Stop living the Christian life by yourself and stop working for the Lord with worldly means.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then you may say, "If I stop, I'll be finished."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That is right.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is exactly what God expects.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although Abraham fully answered God's call when he was seventy-five, God did not do anything with him until he was ninety-nine because until then he still had his natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He had Lot and Eliezer to rely upon and Hagar to match his natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually God was forced to stay away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, as long as we have a Lot and an Eliezer to rely upon, or a Hagar to endeavor with, God cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as we still have the strength to produce an Ishmael, God cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the producing of that Ishmael, He will stay away for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Abraham was ninety-nine years of age, according to his figuration, he was a dead person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans 4:19 says that "he considered his own body already become dead, being about a hundred years old."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 4 also indicates that Sarah was out of function.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Both Abraham and Sarah were fully convinced that they were finished and could do nothing themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that point God came in.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All of the revival preachers stir up people, telling them to live for Christ and to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But in our ministry we are saying that you have to stop living a Christian life by yourselves and doing a Christian work with worldly means.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not be bothered at our saying this, for regardless how much we tell people to stop, hardly anyone will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If anyone will stop trying to live a Christian life by himself or to work for the Lord by worldly means, blessed is he.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not easy to stop your self-effort in the Christian life and your natural zeal in Christian work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although it is easy to be called by God, it is most difficult to stop your natural zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the Lord would come in to stop you, you might say, "No, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Look at today's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hardly anyone works for You in what I am burdened to do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I'm nearly the only one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How could I stop my work for You?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But blessed is the one who will stop, for when you stop, God comes in. The end of humanity is the beginning of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When our human life ends, the divine life begins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Abraham was eighty-six years of age, he still had too much of his own strength, causing God to wait for another thirteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps God, sitting in the heavens and looking at Abraham, said, "Abraham, you are now eighty-six, but I still have to wait for another thirteen years."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While you are praying that God will do something, God is praying that you will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While you are saying, "O Lord, help me to do something," God is saying, "It would really be good for you to stop."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>While Abraham was so busy on earth, God might have looked at him and said, "Poor Abraham, you don't need to be that busy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Won't you stop and let Me come in?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please stop and let Me do it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since you won't stop, I have to wait until you are ninety-nine years old."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God waited until Abraham was a dying person out of function.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then He came in and could say, "Now is My start.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now is My time to begin something."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The produce of the effort of the flesh was Ishmael, but Ishmael was rejected by God 17:18-19; 21:10-12a; Gal 4:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not only was Ishmael rejected by God, but he also frustrated God's appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our experience today tells us the same thing, for our Ishmael breaks our fellowship with God and keeps us from God's appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We see by this that it is not a matter of what we do or of what we are; it is altogether a matter of whether or not we have God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do you have God's appearance all the time?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must forget our doing and our working and take care of God's appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When God's appearing is with us, we are in the grace, in the covenant of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But most Christians today only care for their doing and work, not for God's appearing and presence.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although they may produce many Ishmaels, they do not have God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What we need is God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What we need is not the outward fruit of our outward work but the inward appearing of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do you have the presence of God within you?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a most crucial test.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>f The Produce Isaac by the Promise of Grace</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The produce of the promise of grace, which is Isaac, is the seed for the fulfillment of God's purpose 17:19; 21:12b .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The seed for the fulfillment of God's purpose is nothing less than Christ Himself wrought by God into, through, and out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What God has wrought into us brings in Christ as the seed Gal 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This seed will eventually become our land.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now we have the seed as our life and the land as our living.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Within we have Christ as the seed by whom we live, and without we have Christ as the land in whom we live.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the church life with Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the only way for us to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No longer should we consider this story in Genesis merely as a kind of prediction but as an allegory of today's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Grace, law, and our natural strength are all here, and we are always being tempted to exercise our natural strength to coordinate Hagar to produce an Ishmael to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But we have a safeguard to check whether or not we have God's presence in our daily life and in our Christian work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The safeguard is not how much fruit we have; it is God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do you have the assurance, the confidence, that day after day Christ is being wrought into your being to be the inner life by whom you live?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Do you have the assurance that this Christ is even becoming the realm in which you live?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This realm is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need to have the seed and the land, the proper Christian life plus the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We need to live by Christ within and we need to live in Christ without.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the proper way for us to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We need to see this not for others but for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Abraham's biography is our autobiography, and the allegory of the two women is a portrait of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As we live today, we need Christ as the seed and as the land.</S>
