   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Meaning of Circumcision</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Colossians 2:11 says, "In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Philippians 3:3 says, "For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two verses show what circumcision is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Simply put, circumcision is the removal of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What should be the attitude of those who are circumcised?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They should have no confidence in the flesh and should not put their trust in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word "confidence" in Philippians 3:3 can be translated "trust" according to the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Who are the circumcision?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and who put no trust in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, circumcision deals with man's inherent energy, his natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How appropriate it was for God to say such a word to Abraham!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God showed Abraham that whatever he did and begot by himself was just Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the flesh is not dealt with, one will have no part in God's covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the flesh is not dealt with, one cannot be of God's people and cannot maintain His testimony or participate in His recovery work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The greatest problem among God's children is that they do not know what the flesh is!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The flesh that many Christians know is merely related to the matter of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is true that the flesh causes us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the flesh does not cause man to just sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Romans 8:8 says that "those who are in the flesh cannot please God."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that the flesh has tried to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many times, the goal of the flesh may not be to try to offend God; its goal may be to try to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Romans 7 shows us that the flesh exerts great effort to keep the law, to do good, to do God's will, and to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, it cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our experience tells us that it is comparatively easy to deal with the sinning flesh, but it is very difficult to deal with the flesh that tries to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the flesh that tries to creep into God's work and service.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the flesh that creeps into all the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some people do not realize that man cannot please God by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They think that even though they were once a certain kind of person, now they can do good because their goal has changed since they have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such people do not realize that God is concerned not merely with changing their goals, but with terminating their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If they want to please God with their flesh, God will tell them that the flesh cannot please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must see that circumcision is the cutting off of the flesh, the very flesh that begets Ishmael, the flesh that tries to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Circumcision deals with the flesh that tries to do God's will and to fulfill His promise by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was what God wanted Abraham to understand.</S>
