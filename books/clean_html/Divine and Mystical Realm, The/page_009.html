<h2 class=head1>II. TO ENTER INTO THE MYSTICAL REALM OF CHRIST’S HEAVENLY MINISTRY</h2><p>We need to pass through the physical realm of Christ’s earthly ministry and enter into something higher—the mystical realm of Christ’s heavenly ministry.<h2 class=head2>A. In the Mystical Realm of His Heavenly Ministry, Christ Being the Christ as the Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>Christ’s being the life-giving Spirit is a most important qualification for Christ to carry out His heavenly ministry. When He was in the flesh, He was not able to enter into us as life. As a young Christian I was bothered when I heard that, according to the Bible, Christ is in us. I wondered how it was possible for Christ to be in me. At that time, I did not realize that, in and through resurrection, the Christ who was in the flesh became the life-giving Spirit. Later I came to see that the New Testament unveils the fact that the One who died on the cross as our Savior was resurrected, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. Now He is qualified to carry out His heavenly ministry in the mystical realm.<h2 class=head3>1. From His Resurrection through Eternity</h2><p>In the mystical realm of His heavenly ministry, Christ is the life-giving Spirit from His resurrection, in which He became the life-giving Spirit, through eternity.<h2 class=head3>2. Accomplishing God’s Organic Salvation Subjectively in Eight Steps</h2><p>As the life-giving Spirit (Rom. 8:9-10; 2 Cor. 3:17-18), Christ is carrying out His heavenly ministry by accomplishing God’s organic salvation subjectively in eight steps. Here we can see a sharp contrast: earthly versus heavenly, physical versus mystical, judicial versus organic, and objective versus subjective. All eight aspects of God’s organic salvation are subjective.<h2 class=head4>a. Regeneration</h2><p>Regeneration is to generate the redeemed believers with the divine life that they may be born of God to be His children of His species (John 1:12-13; 3:6b). As God’s children we are of His kind, His species. Therefore, we are gods, having God’s life and nature but not His Godhead.<h2 class=head4>b. Feeding</h2><p>Feeding is to feed the newborn babes by regeneration in Christ’s shepherding His flock by nourishing and cherishing (Eph. 5:29) that His sheep may grow in the divine life unto maturity (John 10:10-11, 14-16; 21:15-17; Heb. 13:20; 1 Pet. 5:4; 2:25). Feeding surely is organic.<h2 class=head4>c. Dispositional Sanctification</h2><p>Dispositional sanctification is to sanctify the believers who are growing in the divine life in their disposition with the holy nature of God (Rom. 15:16; 6:19, 22; 1 Thes. 5:23). Our natural disposition is crooked, perverted, and distorted, yet it can be sanctified and corrected, not with teaching but with the holy nature of God.
