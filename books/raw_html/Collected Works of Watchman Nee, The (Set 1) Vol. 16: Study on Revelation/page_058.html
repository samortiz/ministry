<P>How do we know that the Babylon mentioned here is Rome? The reasons are as follows:</P><P>(1) There is only one city in the world which is built on seven hills; that is the city of Rome. In history Rome is known as the city of seven hills. This matches 17:9.</P><P>(2) "Fallen" in 17:10 indicates that the ones mentioned in this verse did not have a good end. Some were murdered, and some committed suicide. When John was writing this book, the king who "is" was no doubt the Roman emperor at that time.</P><P>(3) There is no kingdom other than the Roman Empire that has ruled over the kings of the earth. This is a fulfillment of 17:18.</P><P>What are the similarities between Babylon and Rome?</P><P>(1) Babylon was the first to invade the Jewish holy land and enter into the Holy Place. Later Rome did the same.</P><P>(2) Babylon means confusion, and Rome was full of confusion. It mixed the state with the church, the church with the world, the law with grace, man's tradition with God's word, heathens with Christians, Judaism with Christianity, God's promise to the church with God's promise to the Jews, fleshly things with spiritual things, earthly things with heavenly things, things to be rejected in the present with the glory in the future, and so forth. It was the center of all types of mixture and was utterly chaotic.</P><P>(3) The testimony of the church fathers also acknowledges that Rome was Babylon. Tertullian said that Babylon was Rome. Jerome said, "When I dwelt in Babylon and resided within the walls of the scarlet adulteress, and had the freedom of Rome, I undertook a work concerning the Holy Spirit, which I propose to ascribe to the Bishop of that city." Augustine said, "Babylon is a former Rome, and Rome, a later Babylon."</P><P>(4) There were several famous authors of the Roman Church, such as Robert Bellarmine, Cesare Baronius, Jacques Bossuet, Hug, etc., who also admitted that Babylon refers to Rome. According to Bellarmine, when John was writing the book of Revelation, every time he wrote "Babylon" he meant Rome.</P><P>One school says that Babylon simply refers to the political aspect of Rome, not the religious aspect, but that is a mistake. If it refers to only the political aspect of Rome, then the city should have fallen only once. Why does 14:8 say that it is fallen, and then 16:19 say it again? Furthermore, the fall in 14:8 takes place before the setting up of the beast's image, before the three-and-a-half-year period. However, the fall in 16:19 occurs at the time of the seventh bowl, which follows the setting up of the beast's image. Thus, these two falls must be related to the two aspects of Babylon. One is the religious aspect of Rome. (In the religious aspect, Babylon means confusion.) The other is the political aspect of Rome. (In Hebrew the word for "Rome" means the arrogant one, the one who is self-exalting and against God.)</P><P>"MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT" refers to the religious Babylon. The reasons are as follows:</P><P>(1) Revelation 17:1 says, "The great harlot who sits upon the many waters." The woman here signifies Rome. However, the city of Rome was not built on many waters (there is only one river in Rome). Therefore, the woman here must not refer to political Rome.</P><P>(2) Revelation 17:9 says, "The seven mountains where the woman sits." It is true that the city of Rome was built upon seven hills, but if the city of seven hills signifies political Rome, the woman cannot also signify political Rome, for a city cannot sit upon another city. Therefore, this woman must be the religious Rome which rests upon the political Rome.</P><P>(3) Revelation 17:6 says, "And I marveled with great marvel when I saw her." If this woman signifies the political Rome, what is there to marvel at? It is marvelous because it signifies religious Rome. (That people of other religions would persecute Christians is nothing to be marveled at, but it is a marvel that the Church of Rome would persecute Christians.)</P><P>(4) The fornication in 17:2 refers to doctrinal, not physical, fornication. Since a material city cannot commit fornication, this must signify the religious Rome.</P><P>(5) If political Rome rules over the kings of the earth, surely it cannot, at the same time, commit fornication with the kings of the earth. Therefore, 17:2 must refer to religious Rome.</P><P>Listed below are the reasons why Babylon also refers to political Rome:</P><P>(1) According to 17:16, the woman's destiny is to be burned utterly with fire by the beast (Antichrist) and the ten horns (the ten subordinate kings). But 18:8 mentions God's judgment on her. Therefore, 17:16 refers to the religious aspect and 18:8 to the political aspect.</P><P>(2) Revelation 18:7 says, "For she says in her heart, I sit a queen," but 17:16 indicates that the woman has already been rejected by Antichrist and the ten kings. How can 18:7 say that she still sits a queen? Hence, one must refer to religious Rome and the other to political Rome.</P><P>(3) Chapter seventeen uses symbols extensively; however, the latter part of chapter eighteen is mostly literal. This is why, in chapter seventeen, the angel has to give John an explanation, because it is full of signs. However, the latter part of chapter eighteen needs no further explanation, because it does not contain signs.</P><P>(4) After 8:13 mentions "woe" three times, exactly three woes follow. Since 18:2 mentions "fallen" twice, there should be two falls. One must be the fall of political Rome, and the other, the fall of religious Rome.</P><P>(5) In this book, there are two Jerusalems, one on the earth and another in the heavens. In the same way, this book has two aspects of Rome, the political and the religious. Political Rome is different from religious Rome, but the two are inseparable.</P>
