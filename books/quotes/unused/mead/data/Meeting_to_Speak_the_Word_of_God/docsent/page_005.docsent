   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having the Word First, Then the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like to ask, Which do you have first, the Spirit or the word?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I tell you that first you have the word, and then you have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The electric current runs from the power plant to the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I ask you, Do you first have electricity, or do you first have the cables?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You cannot say that, since there is no electricity in a certain place, there is no need to install any cables; neither can you say that, since there is no current, it would be a waste to install cables.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To say this seems reasonable, but you need to know that if you do not speak, the Spirit will not move.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Especially we Chinese have been taught from our youth not to talk very much in public.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Remember the Chinese sayings: Sickness comes from what you eat; calamities come from what you speak, Don t embarrass yourself if you have no goods, and For a person like you, to speak is just to lose face.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Consequently, we have developed a habit of listening to others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have become dumb in public.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If tonight, I would only look at you and you would only look at me, with no one speaking, how could the Spirit move?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But on the contrary, suppose that one by one everyone here would speak.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As soon as one person would speak the Spirit would move, and when another would speak the Spirit would come.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit would be prevailing here and we would all ascend to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How wonderful that would be!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE PROOF OF THE SCRIPTURE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Acts 5:42 proves that meeting is for speaking the word of God: And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To teach is simply to speak the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As long as you speak the word of God, you are teaching, even if you have no intention to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You are not only teaching, but you are also preaching the gospel of Jesus as the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Teaching is speaking; preaching is also speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They taught and they preached.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every day they met from house to house doing just this one thing speaking the word of God, which is simply teaching and preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The second instance which proves that meeting is for speaking the word of God is found in 1 Corinthians 14:23-24: If therefore the whole church comes together in one place, and...all prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul said, All prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that everyone in the church can speak the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The third verse which proves that meeting is for speaking the word of God is 1 Corinthians 14:26: Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Each one here means not just a few, but everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everyone has a psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ephesians 5:19 says, Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A psalm is not merely for singing; it is for speaking, even speaking to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Speak to one another, not in common talk nor merely in Scripture verses, but in psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The fourth proof that meeting is for speaking the word of God is in Hebrews 10:25, which says, Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together...but exhorting one another.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All those who meet regularly are very impressed by not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, yet very few have the concept of exhorting one another in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord s word here indicates that exhorting is a mutual matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only is there proof from the Bible, but the Spirit also manifests that the meeting is for speaking the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First Corinthians 12:8-10 says, For to one through the Spirit is given a word of wisdom, and to another a word of knowledge...and to another prophecy...to a different one various kinds of tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nine items are mentioned in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Among them five are a matter of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first two are the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The last two are tongues and the interpretation of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The most crucial items among the nine are the first two: the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all have to dig into the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When you dig deeper, you will not only gain the word of knowledge but also the word of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I hope that the fellowship in this message has given you a deep impression that our coming to the meeting is for speaking the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only by everyone speaking the word of God in the meeting can clerical rank and religious organization among us be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only by everyone speaking the word of God can death, tradition, and habitual ways of doing things thoroughly be eradicated from among us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This all depends on our rising up one by one to speak the word of God.</S>
