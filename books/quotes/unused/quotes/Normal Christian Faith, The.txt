Appendix One, entitled 'Towards the Church,' was included in an earlier English edition of The Normal Christian Faith as Chapter Sixteen
Both messages were given by Brother Nee and published by the Shanghai Gospel Book Room during this same period
The chapters in The Normal Christian Faith were compiled from notes taken during meetings; they were not edited by the speaker
The result of saying this can be found in the second sentence of the same verse: 'They are corrupt; they do abominable deeds'
Whether you claim to be a Christian, a non-believer, or a seeker after truth, we will start by examining the subject of God
On the one hand, they dare not say there is no God, but on the other hand, they are not clear if God does exist
If a man is upright in his conduct and moral judgment, we can give credibility to his words, but if not, his words lose their credibility
Those who admit their own ignorance have a passable standard, while insistent atheists invariably have a low level of moral responsibility
The fifty-year-old preacher patted the young man's shoulder and said, 'My son, you do not believe in God anymore!
The preacher pressed on I am afraid that you are not really saying that you believe there is no God you are just hoping that there is no God
If you sincerely hope to raise your moral standard by asserting the nonexistence of God, then your arguments are still plausible
The only reason men claim that there is no God is for an excuse for lawlessness, immorality, license, and indecency
The whole population in Hsing Hwa with more than two hundred thousand people have been recruited and rushed to the dykes in a panic
You have not even walked through the whole earth, and yet you consider yourself greater than the whole universe
All thoughtful persons have only two explanations as far as the origin of the universe is concerned; there is no third explanation
One can achieve a specified goal by chance once, but he can never achieve a specified goal by chance all the time
They are without order and structure; they are loose, formless, disorderly, and not directed toward any meaningful purpose
Briefly we can say that the characteristics of chance events are disharmony irregularity inconsistency purposelessness and insignificance
All these things witness one fact to you: the universe, with its macro and micro aspects, is purposeful and meaningful
By observing the arrangements of the house, we concluded that someone was living there, without having seen the occupant
In the same way, we know that God is there by the arrangement of everything in the universe, although we cannot see Him
If you cannot accept the concept of random formation of the universe, you have to admit that it was created by such a God
Before doing so, we should also observe one fact: wherever there is a desire, there must first be an object for that desire
Although one can give all sorts of reasons in the head, there is a belief in the heart that no argument can defeat
Can you prove that not even one of these many prayers, throughout many years and among many people, has been answered?
From nine o'clock in the morning, it rained heavily; the Great King was not able to come out, and the scheduled parade was called off
You should not be so bold to make a sweeping denial of God and a categorical rejection of the credibility of prayers
Is it conceivable that several things which are lumped together, shaken, and mixed with each other can result in a living human being?
For this reason, in the past few thousand years, all kinds of people, theologians and philosophers alike, have done much thinking about Him
When a man cannot find fellowship with another human being, he goes to dogs, cats, fish, or birds and makes friends with animals
Christianity is different from all other natural religions in that it is a religion that comes from revelation
If He speaks to us through thunder or writes to us through lightning, we will not be able to comprehend His message
All means of communication, whether telegraph, telephone, sign, or symbols, are all included in these two categories
If such a book exists, it proves not only the existence of God, but it contains His written revelation to us as well
They do have a high tone of morality, but they fail to give the origin and destiny of the world, the universe, and man
They may be masterpieces in philosophy or morality, but they are not written by God, nor are they divinely inspired
Another book called the Avesta, written by a Persian named Zoroaster, is also extremely influential in the Middle East
If God desires to communicate with man, and if He does so through writing, then this is the only book that can pass the four tests
In addition to the references in the New Testament to the speakings of God, the Bible has more than two thousand claims of divine origin
Human morality condemns an act of killing as murder, but the Bible condemns a slight hatred in the heart as murder
If the Rig-Veda were God's book, then more than half of the world would perish due to a failure in obtaining it
The span from the time the first book was written to the time when the last book was finished is more than sixteen hundred years

More than thirty people of varied backgrounds and ideas in different times and places wrote these sixty-six books
Genesis was written about fifteen hundred years before Christ, and Revelation was written ninety-five years after Christ
One place may tell you that the Bible was once burned there, and another place may tell you that Christians were once killed there
Even if you do not believe that this is God's word, you have to admit that there is something unusual about this book
It was prophesied that if these two metropolitan cities did not repent, they would be destroyed and devastated
If you compare past events with the prophecies in the Bible, you will find that they all correspond one with another
As the prophecies concerning the past have been fulfilled, so the prophecies concerning the future must also be fulfilled
Some perched on the branches of the tree across the balcony and stared at me, as if trying to determine what my intention was
It would mean that in this world, among all the human beings throughout history, one person was not merely a man, but God as well!
We want to base our evaluation on what manner of life a person should possess and what qualifications he must have if he is God
When Jesus of Nazareth one day said, 'I and the Father are one,' it was a statement that no one else could make
The Jews answered Him, We are not stoning You for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a man, are making Yourself God'
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
Again He spoke concerning Himself And no one has ascended into heaven but He who descended out of heaven the Son of Man who is in heaven
Let us read John 3:31-32: 'He who comes from above is above all; he who is from the earth is of the earth and speaks out of the earth
They boasted of being the descendants of Abraham in the same way the Chinese boast of being the offspring of Hwang-ti
At the last judgment, the hour when His release or crucifixion was to be deliberated, He was examined as to who He was
He said that the Son of Man would be seen sitting on the right hand of the Majesty on high, descending on the clouds in glory
As to how He dwells it says that He is full of grace and reality and we beheld His glory glory as of the only Begotten from the Father
To ascertain whether Jesus of Nazareth is an ordinary person or the incarnated God, we need to examine His birth
Do not hastily believe in a person simply because he claims to be God; we have to test him by our second criterion
Before we go on, we have to realize that there are two ways to know God: by natural speculation or by revelation
Twice a day, for four consecutive days, each side took turns delivering a long speech for a total of eight messages
The modernistic theologians asserted that one reason alone was enough to disprove the virgin birth the event was biologically impossible
If we try to study the virgin birth from a scientific point of view, we may conclude that this is an impossible event
At least you have to say that these records have said such a thing and that such an event was recorded in history
Not only was this man different in His way of entering into the world, but His manner of departure was no less extraordinary
Perhaps, in less than five minutes, seven or eight people would immediately rise up to expose his lies and unfaithfulness
There has been a countless number of saints and sages throughout the ages, but none was bold enough to claim to be perfect and sinless
A proud person may talk in an outlandish manner because he does not know himself; he has no realization of what kind of person he is
Jesus of Nazareth is not like Confucius, who said that given some more time, he would be rid of big, moral flaws
Every philosopher or founder of religion, at one time or another, has said, 'I repent,' or 'I regret such and such a matter
To the English, anyone who does not know how to make these two remarks has to be an extremely base person, for he knows not his own mistakes
Again, you see the same Jesus preaching to a ruler at midnight in a house , while choosing to converse with a woman beside a well at midday
If Jesus said no to the question He would have been involved in a political issue and the opposers would have had an excuse to condemn Him
Jesus gave an excellent reply: 'Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar and the things that are God's to God'
It was very late in the night, and men armed with torches, spears, and swords came to arrest this empty-handed Jesus
The fourth qualification we mentioned is that one who claims to be God incarnated must be able to perform what an ordinary person cannot
One thing is sure: the apostles who followed Jesus recorded, preached, and testified the things concerning Him
John 731 says But many out of the crowd believed into Him and said Will the Christ when He comes do more signs than this man has done
John 10:24 says, 'The Jews therefore surrounded Him and said to Him, How long will you hold our soul in suspense?
There is no need to conjure up an untouchable and far transcendent God or imagine what He is like; He has revealed Himself to us
Hebrews 1:1 says, 'God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets'
Rather, we will only draw a comparison between Christianity and other religions in order to see the distinctiveness of our faith
Once he preached to his disciples about evil persons being reincarnated through the Wheel of Rebirth after death
Christ is the very God who was set apart to come to earth to be a man for the manifestation of God, in order that man may know God
Again He said, 'He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me'
The difference between a genuine Christian and a false one lies not in the knowledge of the doctrines of Christ
Prior to the coming of Christ, a forerunner was sent by God to prepare a way for Christ that men might be ready to acknowledge Christ
Concerning this light, verse 9 says, 'This was the true light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man'
Read on from verse 10 to verse 15: 'He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, yet the world did not know Him
Have you realized, after reading the above verses, that all that is recorded here are actual facts, rather than many doctrines?
Not only was Christ before John, He was so much greater than John that he was not worthy to untie the thong of His sandal and be His slave
John 1:29: 'The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world'!
In their teachings they teach that whatever is past is considered as dead yesterday, and whatever is hereafter is considered as born today
If a man is not born of the Spirit, even if he could go into his mother's womb again, the flesh would still beget flesh
For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him
We think that if one was a thief yesterday and returns his booty to the owner today, that this is regeneration
We think that as long as we quit doing whatever was bad in the past considering it as dead and strive to do well hereafter we are born again
God gave His only begotten Son that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life
A genuine Christian feels that his hopes are fulfilled, his aspirations attained; he has no want; he is absolutely satisfied
Contentment is to see things in an optimistic way, to let things come and go by as they are without insisting on anything
As a result, she changed from one husband to another, and then to a third and a fourth, until she came to the sixth
The first thing that a sinner needs to do is not to repent and change his behavior, but to realize who Jesus is
Once we have the Lord Jesus, we will have real satisfaction; we will be filled with the sense of having acquired everything
After Christ spoke such words, verse 52 says, 'The Jews then contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us His flesh to eat'?
On the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink
Many are believing in a distorted Christianity, but we want to believe according to what Christianity really is
If we read the Gospel of John through, we will find that every passage concerns this one point: Jesus is the Christ
Those who do not recognize Him as the Son of God do not have the life of Christ in them; they are not His sheep
In John 11 Jesus said again, 'I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live'
In John 16, the Lord said that one day the Holy Spirit would come and convict the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment
The explanation is in verse 9: 'Concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me,' because they do not believe that He is the Son of God
When the Holy Spirit comes, He will convict men, and they will realize how serious a sin it is not to believe in Jesus being the Son of God
17:3: 'And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ'
Even when some doctrines are mentioned, they are few in number, and when you go about expounding them, they always point back to a person
If you turn to the four Gospels you will be amazed to find that everything recorded is just a description of Jesus of Nazareth
Concerning doctrines, there is also a vast difference between those in Christianity and those in other religions
Observing all the religions that are before us, you will see that all of them emphasize doctrines, not a person
It was after the death, resurrection, and departure from the world of the person Christ that the doctrines began
If you open the Bible to see how this can be, you will see that the source of such a doctrine is the fact that God became a man Jesus
On our side, we are not only dead to sin, disassociated from it; we are regenerated and a new creation in the resurrection of Christ
He does not merely preach a doctrine and ask you to work it out yourself; He is the very life-power to perform what He preaches
Merely to give you some nice, lofty doctrines, while leaving it up to you to work them out, is not the way of Christ
No other founder of a religion is great enough to uphold these three items: the way, the reality, and the life
Whenever you set out to accomplish something, you always have to pass through these three steps: the way, the reality, and the life
When we look at a few passages in the Bible we easily discover that when the Bible mentions a doctrine it always says that it is in Christ
You can be a devotee of other religions, abiding by their every creed, without having anything to do with the founders themselves
All common religions are like this: you need not have anything to do with their founders, but you can apply their doctrines
Romans 3:22, 24: 'Even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe, for there is no distinction;
These verses say that a man receives forgiveness of sins and justification before God by the redemption of Christ Jesus
Romans 5:1: 'Therefore having been justified out of faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ'
Verse 11: 'And not only so, but also boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation'
Everything that we have received, such as justification, reconciliation, standing in grace, salvation, joy in God, etc
When he was at the end of his hopes, crying for deliverance, he saw the way of salvation: liberation by the Lord Jesus Christ
Now the law of the Spirit of life has freed us; we are no longer under the control of the law of sin and of death
Verse 10: 'But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness'
Corinthians 130 But of Him you are in Christ Jesus who became wisdom to us from God both righteousness and sanctification and redemption
At any rate we can see that Christ is our wisdom, righteousness, holiness, and salvation from beginning to end
Corinthians 3:1: 'And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ'
You will discover that not only here, but in numerous passages, it is mentioned that the Christian walk should be one that is in Christ
If, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also have been found sinners, is then Christ a minister of sin?
From the book of Romans on, we have discovered a fact: not one doctrine and teaching concerning our faith is related to our work
Before chapter twelve, however, are all the doctrines that are related to Christ and how we can be joined to Him
Before we come to look at the relationship Christ has with man, we have to investigate the law of heredity a little
A life which bears a particular trait or feature in its nature may transmit that same feature to the next generation
Your life and mine are naturally older than that of Adam, for his ended at the age of a little over nine hundred years
We have to understand these concepts before we can see the salvation of God and the relationship of Christ with man
He whose genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes from Abraham and has blessed him who has the promises
In this passage, the writer of the book told the Hebrews that the priesthood that they depended on came from the lineage of Levi
It shows us that due to the unity of men, when the first man Adam sinned, all sinned in him, although none were yet born
God would still reckon him a sinner because his life is a life that sins; he is the offspring of a sinful life
It is a life without sin, a life that is pleasing to God, filled with the Holy Spirit, and absolutely holy and righteous
In the same way, those who receive life from the last Adam are included in Christ, having all of Jesus' experiences
According to God's reckoning, sin entered the whole human race through one man, Adam, who was the prefigure of Him who was to come
If, through the sin of Adam, all became dead, then when Jesus Christ was made righteousness, grace abounded much more to everyone!
Due to the disobedience of one man, Adam, sin entered into him, and the whole humanity was constituted sinners
Those who are in Christ are not individuals they have Christ as their life and they form the Body of Christ with all who have the same life
Although the methods they employ may be different and what they offer may vary, all of them have something to offer
What we are about to see are not the contributions made by Christianity to nations, governments, the world, and society at large
If we compare the fish with the bird, we can see that though both have life, the expressions of their individual lives are different
Since the mode of living is determined by the life it possesses, the question of life has nothing to do with learning and imitation
He starts teaching a little bird to dive under water, breathe in the water, flap its wings, and exercise its claws in the proper manner
It is true that man should be clean, courteous, and law-abiding and should be taught and cultivated in these virtues
We think that if we rid ourselves of our proud attitude and all our lies and behave in a more refined way, we will be a better person
One day while her niece was visiting in her house, an extremely unreasonable person rebuked her for a length of time
After the person was gone, the niece admiringly said, 'Auntie, that was quite a demonstration of patience to be able to hold your temper
Without regeneration he does not have that other life, and as a result he does not have that power of understanding
Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be
If a man only possesses his natural life, that is, the life that he originally owns as a man, he cannot see the kingdom of God!
Romans 14:17 says, 'For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
Regeneration is not a reckoning of 'everything in the past as dead yesterday and of everything in the future as born today'
If these things are not settled, God can never give life to us, and we will never have the right to receive anything from Him
Unless this life is removed from its root, the possibility of sin remains; it will continue to bear corrupt fruit
They think that although they have committed many sins, the sins can all be pardoned if they repent of their evil conduct
If we sin carelessly and God forgives our sins irresponsibly, then God Himself falls into sin in His forgiveness
Within his department a few persons were known to have engaged in a fraud that involved more than ten thousand dollars
The law of the department said that anyone involved in a fraud that exceeded five thousand dollars was to be executed
The Bible shows us that we not only received forgiveness in our salvation, but we obtained justification as well
In this dilemma there was only one way to take: the principal had to use her own money to repay for the student
On one hand, this fulfilled the law of the school; on the other hand, it showed the love of the principal for her students
Christ came to earth to bear the judgment of our sins and suffer their consequences in order that we may be forgiven
By doing so, He did not degrade Himself in unrighteousness; rather, He proved Himself to be just and righteous
Forgiveness, on the other hand, means that the transgressed, who was the principal, had to take up the loss by paying for it herself
Verse 21: 'Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him'
To become righteous implies that we have done a good work whereas to be made the righteousness of God declares that God Himself is righteous
He passed over the sins committed formerly, reckoning that Jesus would come; in this He proved Himself righteous
He forgives all the sins committed now, basing this upon the judgment of Christ; in this He also declares Himself righteous
Now He has commissioned us to go to the whole world to show others that God has accomplished this work of salvation
A passage that is quite familiar to many people is Mark 10:45: 'For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve'
In Matthew 26:28 the Lord Jesus said, 'For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins'
For scarcely for a righteous man will anyone die, though perhaps for the good man someone would even dare to die
Romans 5:9-10: 'Much more then, having now been justified in His blood, we will be saved through Him from the wrath
For if we being enemies were reconciled to God through the death of His Son much more we will be saved in His life having been reconciled
They held themselves tightly by the reins, fearing that their evil nature would break loose once they let go even a little
It is true that sin is a powerful agent, but when it is met by the old man, the result is an instant collaboration
Sin is the director, the old man submits to its orders, and the body carries them out practically in the form of transgressions
When the old man is put to death, it means that the old life is terminated, and a new life is put in its place
It has an inherent and insatiable love for sin, and no matter how much you suppress it, it will still run after sin
The salvation of God does not depend on how many sins you have committed in the past or how much you have improved
The amazing thing is that you can consider as much as you want that your temper is gone and dead, but in actuality it always comes back
On the negative side, we receive the forgiveness of sins outwardly and the termination of the old life inwardly
Having Christ worked into us and having a vital life relationship between Him and us is the essence of the Christian life
Only when Christ is in us can our union be real and complete, and only then will everything He has be worked into us
He rolled up a piece of paper, and instead of thrusting it into the fire, he touched the red hot iron with the end of the paper
Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ who clothed Himself with human flesh, was also confined by the two conditions of time and space
In order for us to be in Christ or Christ in us, there was the need for Him to be something other than merely in the flesh
At His death He put off this garment, and in resurrection He took on a new body with a different garment the Spirit
The present Christ has been clothed with the Spirit in exactly the same sense as when He was clothed with the human flesh
When He put off His flesh, He entered into the Spirit and can now get inside of us to be our life and live out of us
The meaning of this passage is clear; the Lord will ask the Father, and the Father will send a Comforter to your midst
When Christ was with the disciples on earth, the Holy Spirit was with the disciples already, for the Spirit was inside Christ
He is the God in the heavens; second, He is the God who came to earth to become a man; and third, He is the God in the Holy Spirit
Now God has a just ground upon which He can dispense life to us, and we also have a proper standing to receive boldly this new life from God
Whoever does not have this life in the Son is merely a human; he can only exist on earth, but not survive in eternity
After the Son of God passed through death and resurrection and became the Holy Spirit, He is no longer limited by time and space
At one time he did not realize how Christ can be life to us in the Holy Spirit, nor did he see how to receive this life
The reason this word is mentioned and emphasized repeatedly is because faith is the unique and crucial way of receiving Christ
The New Testament does mention other things such as repentance, baptism, the kingdom of the heavens, behavior, etc
The impulses of the outside world are transmitted to the inside world, and the inside world reacts and projects to the outside world
If a man were deprived of his five senses, it would be extremely difficult for anything of the outside world to come into him
The function of our five senses is to transfer all the objective items into us to become our subjective experience
If we do not have these five senses, all of the outside objects will remain outside of us; they will never be able to come into us
When it comes to these matters, the eyes are blind, the ears deaf, the nose numb, the tongue flat, and all the senses dull
What they lack is what they should have but do not have; it is that sense which substantiates all spiritual matters
Not only is His indwelling a reality; His redemption, His crucifixion of my old man, and my resurrection with Him are also real
To perceive spiritual things through mental consent is like using the eyes to see sound or using the tongue to taste color
If you have this living faith, you can be saved whether you are at home or in the church, in the wilderness or anywhere
That night while he was roaming around the pier he saw a house inside which were a few ladies playing the piano singing hymns and preaching
The next morning, while he was scrubbing the deck, an older sailor came to him and told him that he also was a Christian
It is not infrequent for these people to leave sums of money in the club for the furnishing of tennis equipment
Since they have left and no one knows where they are, the money and belongings naturally would become my possession
Naturally, you may ask, 'If God's purpose for giving us the laws was not for us to keep them, then what was the use of giving them to us'?
The Spirit of God gave the answer through the words of Paul: 'The law entered in alongside that the offense might abound'
Throughout the centuries, God has been teaching us one lesson, that we would know the impossibility of keeping the law
On that day, the Lord did not tell him what we are used to hearing, that if he believed in Him he would have eternal life
He continued, 'All that you have, sell and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me'
For it is easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God'
Even before he came down, the children of Israel had already built themselves a golden calf, saying, 'This is our God'
God's will can only be done by God Himself, and the commandments of Christ can be fulfilled by none other than Christ
You do not have to crawl around the earth day and night like crabgrass telling yourself over and over again that you are not supposed to sin
The young ruler only saw that he was unable and concluded that God was the same and proceeded to leave sorrowfully
The result of God's putting His Spirit within us is to cause us to be able to obey His ordinances and walk in His statutes
We can see from the Bible that in His first coming, He mainly dealt with sin, delivered the sinners, and dispensed a new life to them
Everywhere there are intelligent men trying to tackle these problems, and everywhere you can find more problems
Because all these issues arise in our world, there is an endless train of questions passing through our minds daily
Are we going to overlook things while races are being oppressed, nations are being harassed, and classes are being exploited'?
He will naturally be an asset to his community and nation, and he will naturally not be injurious to others or animals
Our job is not to deal directly with the problems of our nation, reorganize our institutions, or revolutionize our political system
What the Bible shows us is that we should do our best to save others and solve the individual problems of sin and sanctification
Some misinterpret these words and stand up to propose that we should make our world a brighter and cleaner place
To be a light means that formerly others did not know what is evil, but your presence as a Christian convicts them of their vices
We believe that there is absolutely no solution to the problems of the present system, governments, and society
Even though society at large will be somewhat affected after individuals are saved, our commission is not to save the world
Not only was it lawful to trade human beings publicly, but they could also beat or even crucify the slaves at will
He said that the slaves should be obedient to their masters, and not only to the good ones, but to the ill-disposed and cruel ones as well
All who have read Paul's letters would agree that if there was a brave person in this world other than Jesus of Nazareth, it had to be Paul
There are a number of philosophies which are lofty and logical, but under the hand of corrupted man, nothing can be achieved
Matthew 132430 says Another parable He set before them saying The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field
At the end of the world the Lord will gather out of His kingdom all things that cause stumbling and those that cause iniquities
Their presence will be as the sun, whose rays reach the farthest corner and whose power transpires throughout the earth
Later she resigned her political career and wrote some good books concerning the work of Christ and His second coming
Some people think that as long as one is a Christian, it is good enough; there is no need to be part of a church
It is fine to have individual prayers and Bible studies, but it is too troublesome for them to be related to other people
When a person has believed in Christ, not only does he have to negatively reject the world, but he has to positively be part of the church
A Christian who takes such a stand will never be able to touch the riches of God or manifest the glory of the light of life
Now that we are regenerated and have become Christians, we have to realize that we are born into the biggest family of the world
The desire to regard the children of God as one's own brothers and sisters is something that comes from the life of God
We have to fellowship with all the children of God and live in this family of love, which is the church of God
If there was a human leg lying beneath this table, or if you picked up an arm on the road, how would you feel?
It means that those who are already Christians should not be independent; rather, they should be related to others in the church
As a Christian it is not easy to choose one out of the fifteen hundred without being somewhat swayed by others' influence
If you would go according to the Word of God and look at the matter from the biblical point of view, there is still a way
When they all came to Shanghai, the time lapse between their establishments had produced a host of different churches
They are called 'the church in Rome,' 'the church in Jerusalem,' 'the church in Corinth,' 'the church in Colossae,' etc
After a man has believed in Jesus Christ through the mercy of God, he must realize that God has put him into the church
For the sake of knowing and fellowshipping with other brothers and sisters, he should find a church that stands on the ground of locality
Those who hold such a philosophy appear to be more progressive than others in their mentality and more capable than others
Although atheists do not admit that there are different kinds, we outsiders are more objective and can classify them according to their kind
They have become atheists because their conduct requires that they be atheists, not because they have ample reasons to support their views
If a person says I do not believe in God there is no such thing as God in my mind you can hold his hand and ask him Friend are you moral
The atheists among our classmates, colleagues, and friends do not believe in God because they are very evil morally
Once he was preaching in a place, and a college student came and said to him, 'I used to believe that there is a God
If you stop your evil works and if your moral character becomes more noble, God will immediately come back to you'
Many people do not believe in God because they have thousands of sins which hinder them from believing, not because they have many reasons
How can you talk about the gospel when the most crucial question of whether or not there is a God is not settled'?
You can give them a hundred reasons why there is a God, and they will come back a hundred and one times to tell you that there is no God
Even if you argue with them for three days and three nights, and even if they know they are wrong, they will still insist and argue with you
The Bible has not addressed the question of the existence of God; it only mentions Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, etc
If an atheistic friend comes today and talks about the existence of God, he will surely say that there is no God
Is it proper for such a tiny man to stand up and proudly announce, solemnly and assertively, that there is no God?
