Who would think that Christ would be the cornerstone? Prior to the Psalms there is not a verse which speaks of Christ as the cornerstone. Then, all of a sudden, Psalm 118:22 says, "The stone which the builders rejected/Has become the head of the corner."</P><P>Once again I would call your attention to the arrangement of the Psalms into five books. Book 5 begins with Psalm 107. The main psalms in Book 5 that unveil Christ are Psalm 110 and Psalm 118.</P><P>Psalm 110 is on Christ as the exalted One, as the One who in His ascension has been uplifted to the right hand of God in heaven. In this psalm there are two matters which are difficult to understand adequately&#151;"the dew from the womb of the morning" (v. 3) and "the brook by the way" (v. 7). Whereas the brook is for drinking, the dew is for watering. As Christ is on His way to carry out God's economy, He needs to be watered, and He needs something to drink. Christ is watered by those who offer themselves willingly to Him. Whoever volunteers himself to Christ as an offering is a young man likened to the dew conceived in the womb of the morning for watering Christ. When we are thirsty from working or from running a race, dew is not adequate. We need water to drink. Christ also needs something to drink. Thus, in addition to the dew, which is moisture for comforting, Christ needs to drink of the brook flowing by the way.</P><P>As we will see, Psalm 119 is on Christ as the cornerstone. When we come to this psalm, we will consider a number of verses related to Christ as the cornerstone for God's building.</P><P>After Psalm 119 the revelation concerning Christ in the Psalms is closed. Psalm 119, a particular psalm, is followed by fifteen psalms which are called songs of ascents. After these psalms, we have the last sixteen psalms. In these thirty-one psalms we cannot find anything concerning Christ, for Christ has been revealed to us adequately beginning with Psalm 2 and ending with Psalm 119.</P><P>In the next message we will see that Psalm 119 is on Christ's being the reality of the law as the testimony and the word of God. The one hundred seventy-six verses of Psalm 119, arranged in twenty-two sections of eight verses each, are on Christ as the law. Toward the beginning of the Psalms, in Psalm 2, the Spirit turns the reader of the Psalms from the law to Christ. After all the revelations of Christ in Psalms 2 through 118, the Spirit gives us Psalm 119, indicating or implying that Christ is the real, actual, and practical law of God. In the Old Testament, the law was put in the ark, which is a type of Christ. Therefore, the entire law of God is in Christ, making Christ the reality of the law of God.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_288.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_290.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 289</div><br></body></html>
