   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE PROPER EXERCISE OF THE GIFTS Scripture Reading: Acts 2:17-21; 1 Cor 12:7-11, 27-31; 13:1, 2, 8, 11; 14:1, 5-6, 12, 18-19, 23-26, 31-32 AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From the past messages in the last issue, we have seen what the baptism in the Holy Spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is simply Christ putting His Body into the Spirit, which means into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He did this once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course, according to the record of the book of Acts, He did it in two parts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first part was accomplished on the day of Pentecost to the Jewish believers, and the second part in the house of Cornelius to the Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only these two cases in the Bible are called the baptism in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the other cases are an experience of the baptism which was upon the Body already.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They received it by the transmission from the Body through the representing members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have also seen that the baptism in the Holy Spirit is an accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was done once and for all, just as the other steps taken by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The incarnation is an accomplished fact; likewise the crucifixion and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By reading 1 Peter 1:3, we see that the resurrection of Christ was accomplished once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This word clearly tells us that all saints have been begotten by God through the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This does not mean that whenever a child of God is to be born again, Christ must be resurrected again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The one resurrection of Christ is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Regenerations are many, but the resurrection of Christ is only one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the same way, the experiences of the baptism are many, but the baptism in the Holy Spirit was once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the steps taken by Christ to accomplish God s purpose were done once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>SPIRIT BAPTISM AND WATER BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Another point we must see is that the Spirit baptism and the water baptism are two aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit baptism is the reality, and the water baptism is the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The expression without the reality means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Romans 6 tells us clearly that we are baptized into Christ by being buried with Him in baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some say that Romans 6 refers to water baptism; others say that it refers to the Spirit baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, in the normal situation the water baptism should be the expression of the Spirit baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Comparatively speaking, the Spirit baptism is much, much more than the water baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One is the reality, the other is the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the expression is just a form, it means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do believe that in the pure Word the reality of baptism is of the Spirit; but we do need an expression, as seen in water baptism, to express the reality of immersion in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>TWO SCHOOLS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are many concepts regarding the baptism in the Holy Spirit, and many divisions have been created by all these concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The biggest issue is caused by the so-called Pentecostal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are mainly of two schools.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first says that if you do not speak in tongues, you are not regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of course, this is altogether erroneous.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do know of a good number of spiritual giants who never spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The second school says that if you do not speak in tongues, you have not experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To say this also neglects history.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What about C. H. Spurgeon and D. L. Moody? Do you believe men like them did not have the baptism? Yet they never spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The greatest revival in this century took place in Wales at the first of the century.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The leader of this revival was a man by the name of Evan Roberts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The revival was so prevailing that all the people of Wales believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yet there was no speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Does this mean that they did not have the baptism in the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Evan Roberts later worked with Jessie Penn-Lewis, who was absolutely against the so-called Pentecostal movement.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are many spiritual giants in history who had the impact, yet never spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This proves that the second school is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those in the Pentecostal movement insist that all have to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But according to the Bible, this is absolutely not so.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some speak in tongues, and some do not.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the proper revelation we have from the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To say that speaking in tongues is over is too much, but to say that everyone must speak in tongues is also too much.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This forces people to bring forth an imitation of human manufacture.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is hard for people to believe that this kind of human-manufactured tongue is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Speaking in tongues is supposed to be miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If this is so, why do we have to learn to speak?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we must learn to speak, that is not miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Balaam s donkey in the Old Testament certainly did not learn to speak the human language.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>That was absolutely miraculous; it was the genuine tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do you believe that Peter and John and all the others on the day of Pentecost learned to speak in tongues?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>So many tongue speakers say that you must turn your jaw and exercise your tongue, saying something like, Praise Jesus, very fast.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Should the children of the Lord believe this kind of thing?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To say that everyone must speak in tongues will surely discourage and disappoint some of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some could never speak in tongues, even in a manufactured way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yet they can believe in the Lord Jesus and they can praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is why the so-called Pentecostal movement has caused so much division.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must learn to be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are not opposing any genuine tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As long as they do not insist that everyone must speak in tongues, we must be open to them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should not oppose, but they should not impose.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Several times in the meetings of the churches some people have spoken in tongues and even gave the interpretation, but we did not stop them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must take such a general outlook in order to include all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A local church is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But we would ask the tongue-speaking saints not to impose and insist that tongue speaking is a must.</S>
