   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. In His Being a Delight to God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We may experience Christ also in His being a delight to God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus was always a delight to God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On two occasions a voice from the heavens said, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight" Matt 3:17; 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we today live a life of Christ as our burnt offering, we too shall be a delight to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul experienced Christ in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Galatians 1:10 he says, "For am I now persuading men or God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Or do I seek to please men?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If I were still pleasing men, I would not be a slave of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul lived a life which was a repetition of Christ's life, pleasing God all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His life, therefore, was a delight to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may think that Paul was extraordinary, that his living was incomparable, and that his standard is too high for us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet Paul told us to be imitators of him 1 Cor 4:16; 11:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul was the same as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was a human being, he was part of the old creation, and he lived in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whether we imitate Paul in being a delight to God depends on whether we live or Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are the ones living, we cannot be a delight to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if we let Christ live for us and if we live by Christ and even live Christ, our life will surely be a delight to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever our life is a delight to God, we shall have within us a deep sense regarding this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We shall know that we are living a life which is a repetition of the life of Christ and which is a delight to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I believe that all of us have had at least a limited experience of this and have had the deep sense that we are pleasing to God and pleasing also to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Quite often, however, we are not pleasing to God and thus are not pleasing even to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What kind of life is pleasing to God?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The only life that is pleasing to God is the life that is a repetition of the life Christ lived on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A life that experiences Christ in His experiences as the burnt offering is a God-pleasing life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a life is a delight to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Romans 14:18 Paul says, "He who in this serves Christ as a slave is well-pleasing to God."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The "this" here refers to verse 17, which tells us that the kingdom of God is righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He who serves as a slave in this in the kingdom of God is well-pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we live a kingdom life, we live a life that is righteous and full of peace and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a living is a repetition of Christ's life as the burnt offering, which is always a delight to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>G. In His Inwards</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ's inwards denotes all the inward parts of His being, including His mind, emotion, will, and heart with all their functions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The leading part of our inwards, of our inner being, is the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus" Phil 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The mind which was in Christ should be in us today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that we should take His mind as our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should be those not with our own, natural mind but with the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1 Corinthians 2:16b Paul says, "We have the mind of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because we are organically one with Christ, we have all the faculties He has.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The mind is the intelligence faculty, the understanding organ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have such an organ of Christ so we can know what He knows.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, we may have not only the life but also the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ must saturate our mind from our spirit, making our mind one with His.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Romans 8:6 Paul speaks of setting the mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This word is not as strong as his word concerning the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not merely set our mind on the spirit but have the very mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"I long after you all in the inward parts of Christ Jesus" Phil 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Greek word translated "inward parts" literally means bowels, signifying inward affection, then tender mercy and sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul was one with Christ even in the bowels, the tender inward parts of Christ, in longing after the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This indicates that Paul did not keep his own inwards but took Christ's inwards as his.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He took not only Christ's mind but also His entire inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul's inner being, therefore, was changed, rearranged, remodeled, reconstituted.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His inner being was reconstituted with the inwards of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul did not live a life in his natural inner being; he lived a life in the inwards of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"The truth of Christ is in me" 2 Cor 11:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"Truth" here means honesty, faithfulness, trustworthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What was in Christ as truth, that is, as honesty, faithfulness, trustworthiness, was also in the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"My love be with you all in Christ Jesus" 1 Cor 16:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Paul's love for the Corinthians was not his love but the love in Christ, which is Christ's love.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul loved the saints not by his natural love but by the love of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we put these verses together, we shall see that Paul was a man who continually experienced Christ's inwards.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Because he experienced Christ in this way, he surely was able to offer Christ according to his experience of Him.</S>
