   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When I wrote this book, I did not try to group the same kind of truths in the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The reason for this is that I could only mention the different truths as I went along.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although some truths fall under the same category as others, I could only postpone them for later discussions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many times, because of the importance of some subjects, I have mentioned them repeatedly, hoping that God's children will have a deep impression of them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I deeply feel that believers today forget easily.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, I cannot help but mention these matters again and again at the appropriate times so that they will not be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many people receive a truth only after repeated reminders.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"Therefore Jehovah's word to them will be:/Rule upon rule, rule upon rule;/Line upon line, line upon line;/Here a little, there a little" Isa 28:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I also realize that many places in this book appear to contradict one another.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When readers come to these places, they should realize that in actuality, there are no contradictions; they only appear to be so.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because this book concerns things in the spiritual realm, many theories appear to be contradictory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, in experience, they complement one another.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many spiritual things appear to be contradictory 2 Cor 4:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I admit that in many places, they appear to be incomprehensible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But my request is that you try your best to understand, and not to misunderstand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If anyone tries purposely to misunderstand, he may find some things in this book which I never intended to say.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I deeply feel that only one kind of person can understand this book.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My original intention for writing this book was to meet the need of many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, only those believers who have a need will understand this book.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those with a need will find this book to be a guide.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a reader has no need, he will either consider its content to be theoretical or will criticize it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The amount of need determines the amount of understanding of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a reader does not have any need in his experience, this book will not solve anything for him and will only serve as an object for idle criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, the readers should take note of this point.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more profound a truth is, the easier it is to become a theory, because the more profound a truth is, the more difficult it is to attain to it without the operation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once a person fails to attain to it, he will consider it a theory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, when we read a book like this, we have to be careful lest we receive its teachings in the mind only, thinking that we have acquired everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is most dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do this, we will be more deceived by the flesh and the evil spirit day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The reader of this book should also be careful that he does not take the knowledge he has acquired from this book as a tool for criticizing others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is easy for us to say that this person is soulish and that person is fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But it is difficult to know if we ourselves are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The truth is given to set men free; it is not given to criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am afraid that some who are naturally inclined to show themselves off will not change after receiving the truth in this book, but will use the truth in this book to criticize their brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This book is meant to lead men on the right path; it is not meant to judge men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do this, it means that we are no less soulish than the ones we criticize, only a bit more fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This danger is the greatest, and we should guard against it carefully.</S>
