<h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>Our ship left Hong Kong at 4:30 p.m. on the seventh and arrived at Haiphong at 7:00 on the tenth. Brother Tseng, who works at Haiphong, helped us to go on and accompanied us to Ho-Nei (a three-hour train ride from Haiphong). We took a train to Ho-Kou on the morning of the thirteenth. Brother Chen Ho-seng met us at the station and took care of everything for us including acting as a guarantor. On the fourteenth we took another train to Ah-Mei-Jou. On the way we preached the gospel to a clerk with the Communication Broadcast Company and to an official with the railway. God cared for us through them all the way to our destination. We arrived safely in K'un-ming at 5:00 p.m. on the fifteenth. Some brothers and sisters were waiting for us at the station. We are now living temporarily in Brother Huang's house. Along the way we saw beautiful scenery with both mountains and streams. We passed through one hundred eighty tunnels on the three day railroad journey and crossed more than ten iron bridges over mountain valleys between Ho-Kou and K'un-ming. We fully enjoyed the beauty of nature and thought of the words of Psalm 19. We really felt happy. Mountains, streams, flowers, and trees all express God's glory in His creation and His wondrous works. Peace to you all. Greet the sisters.</p><p>Yu Su-jen, Rachel Lee<br />February 16</p><h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>To Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>The ever-living God is constantly planning for His children. In my travels from Ch'ang-sha, the weather was mainly clear and sunny. When the bus I took left, nobody was going to K'un-ming. The bus should have gone to Ch'ang-Teh to stay the night, but it went on to Yuan-Ling. When we arrived, I found that a Mr. Chao was going to K'un-ming. He had left one day before I did (on the seventh) and should have been ahead of me. But God provided for me, and he was waiting for me. He assisted me the entire way. We arrived in Kuei-yang on the twelfth. On the thirteenth I happened to be reading the Bible in the hotel according to my habit of reading consecutively through the Scripture. It was really marvelous how the Word of God gave me great comfort. Exodus 23:20 says, "Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared." I held on to this word. On the fourteenth, I boarded the bus at dawn. The road from this point on was a little different. Sometimes there were no porters when we stopped for the night. On the seventeenth we ran out of gas deep in the mountains. It was already 5:00 p.m., and we were twenty miles from the city. All the men ran into the city, but I and a few other women travelers could only wait. When it was almost dark, the people who passed by on the road exhorted us to go into the city because bandits sometimes would appear in that area. The gas had not arrived at 7:15, and everyone was getting frightened. I could only pray. God placed His precious Word before my eyes again in Psalm 27:1, "Jehovah is my light and my salvation;/Whom shall I fear?/Jehovah is the strength of my life;/Whom shall I be dread?" I held on to God's word tightly. It seemed that the gas came at around 8:00 p.m., and we arrived in Pan-Shian safely. We left Pan-Shian a little after 9:00 a.m. on the eighteenth and arrived in K'un-ming at about 3:00 p.m. We were inspected countless times along the way. Some travelers were questioned at almost every station, but I was only questioned twice, once at An-Shun and once when we arrived in K'un-ming. I can say that God's special care was with me the whole way. The weather was very good. Although it rained for two days, it rained while I was in the bus. After the bus stopped, it never rained on me. Oh, I really must thank and praise God! I am now living with a friend named Hsu. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>A weak one in the Lord,<br />Chu Teh-hwa<br />February 21<br />[Address omitted]</p>
