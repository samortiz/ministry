<h2 class="head2">Letters from Brother Witness Lee, Chefoo</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Peace in the Lord to X:</p><p>After sending the manuscripts for the thirteenth and fourteenth issues of The Christian to Shanghai, I did not prepare many more articles because I knew that it was inconvenient to print and mail the publication. I received the second issue of The Open Door a long time ago, and the third issue came a few days ago. I hope this letter gets to you quickly. (I received this letter on March 18&mdash;Editor.) The brothers and sisters living in Chefoo are all at peace in the Lord's grace! Thank the Lord! It is very quiet in the city of Chefoo. Both the work and the meetings continue as usual. The table meeting is now held after the edification meeting on the Lord's Day afternoon. The Bible study will temporarily discontinue. Only a few of the brothers and sisters who left Chefoo for other places went to the surrounding countryside. Those who did are all safe! Brother Chao Bi-chen left Chefoo for a faraway place&mdash;he went to his ancestral home in Ping-Yin County (southwest of Tsinan). I received a letter from him a few days ago saying that he is well, but I do not have any recent news from him. I think that he is under the Lord's care! Please do not worry about anything! During the Chinese New Year, we had a week of special work. The brothers preached the gospel in the mornings and conducted edification meetings in the afternoons. Thank the Lord. Originally, I had intended to go to Wei-Hai on the seventh of this month for a few days because a brother in Wei-Hai had invited me to go. However, it is not appropriate for me to go there because the brother who was responsible for inviting me has gone elsewhere. Brother Ch'ang-en is still zealous for the gospel. Recently, he has been doing some business on the side with two brothers. May the Lord guide him! I am not very clear as to what I will do! Please do not forget to pray for me! May the Lord bless you according Joshua 1:3! Peace in the Lord! Greet Sister Wang and Sister Chang! My mother and wife also greet you!</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Witness Lee<br />February 17</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>A few days ago I went to Tung County and stayed awhile. I hope the Lord will give me a clear leading for the future. Presently, I need to stay in Chefoo for a little longer. Please pray for me.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Witness Lee<br />March 15</p><h2 class="head2">News of the Co-workers<br />in Several Places in Fukien Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Peace to our dear brother X in the Lord!</p><p>Since the beginning of the war, all the localities in the coastal region of Fukien have continued meeting with the exception of Amoy which has temporarily stopped meeting. The assembly in Kulangsu has increased in number, and the meeting hall can no longer hold all the people. The number of sisters in the assembly in Changchow has decreased because some families have dispersed to the inland regions. The assembly in Chuenchow has progressed because the believers there have faith. They are also expanding into the interior. Work was begun in Hwei-An, and an assembly was established. The assemblies in Shui-Tou and An-Hai are standing firm and have not stopped meeting. Thank and praise the Lord! All areas are being preserved safely by the Lord. Although a few of the believers in the assembly in Tung-An have moved to the interior, the meetings have not stopped, and they preach the gospel to the outsiders every week. Sometimes they engage in outdoor preaching, and sometimes they preach in the meeting hall. Brother Wang You-yi went to Pan-Ling, An-Hsi sometime ago to pioneer the work. Now there is an assembly there. Brother Han mainly travels in the region of Shui-Tou, An-Hai, Nan-An, and Chuenchow. He sometimes visits the brothers and sisters in Tung-An, Ding-Mei, Ho-Shan, Changchow, and Amoy. Brother Wang Deng-ming and Brother Chang Tung-yuan passed through An-Hsi and Chuangshan to work for one month. Then Brother Deng-ming returned to Tung-An, and Brother Tung-yuan continued working. Brother Keh Lien-min went to the region of Pu-Tien and Han-Jiang and worked for a time with Brother Chai Tse-chung. Then he returned to Tung-An and worked with Brother Han for awhile. Afterwards, he went to Pan-Ling and Juang-Shan, passing through Changchow on his way back to Tung-An. He ran into Brother Han who was bringing Brother Chen Bing-hsi to Tung-An to pray for Brother Wang Min-sheng's illness, and Brother Deng-ming had just returned to Tung-An, so they invited Brother Bing-hsi to hold a gospel conference in Tung-An for ten days. Apart from preaching the gospel, he did the work of healing sicknesses and casting out demons. Many people were healed by the Lord. Brother Han came this spring and held a message conference for seven days. Thank the Lord, He Himself does His good work!</p><p>Brother Keh will go to Ting-Mei to work, and Brother Han will go to the interior region of An-Hsi to work. Brother Chen Ke-san will leave Changchow and go to work in Lung-Yen. Brother Wang Deng-ming will soon go to Kulangsu to print gospel tracts, and then he will go to Shui-Tou, An-Hai, Shi-Shee, Chuenchow, Pu-Tien, and the region of Hwei-An to work. Brother Chen Bing-hsi is waiting for the Lord's will in Tingmei. The individual travels of the co-workers were started after they had prayed and understood the Lord's will. We hope you will pray much for us. May the Lord be with you. We will now give you the mailing addresses for all the co-workers: [Address omitted] (The church in Wu-Tu has already moved the meeting place to Brother Keh Shui-chuan's home in Wu-Lu County. He is the responsible brother and is Brother Lien-min's elder brother.)</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Wang Deng-ming, Han Jin-hsiu, Keh Lien-min<br />February 16</p>
