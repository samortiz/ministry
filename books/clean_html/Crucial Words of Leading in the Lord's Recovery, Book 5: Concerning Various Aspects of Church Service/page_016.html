<h2 class="head1">TRYING OUR BEST TO GET INTO THE MINISTRY BOOKS</h2>
<p>While many seminary students are studying in seminaries, they prepare fifty-two topics that they will use weekly after they graduate and become pastors. What we publish in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery contains life and truth, not empty doctrine. We have published quite a number of books and received letters of appreciation from many people. In one letter the writers said that they spent money to buy books from other places but did not gain any benefit even after reading twenty to forty pages; however, they gained something from the first page of our publication. Our publications are the best source to learn the truth, and they are guaranteed not to lead a person into error. Since most Christian books do not contain a controlling vision, a believer can be led astray. However, our knowledge of the Bible affords us a basic controlling vision.</p>
<p>After the apostles, the first group of people to study theology was the church fathers. The last group of believers who thoroughly studied the Bible was the Brethren. In between the church fathers and the Brethren, many believers studied the Bible and put out books, which was their theology. Martin Luther had his theology, and John Calvin also had his theology. There are several schools in today&rsquo;s theology, and the best among them is related to the Brethren. The most orthodox seminaries in America are Dallas Theological Seminary and Moody Bible Institute, both of which are based on the theology of the Brethren. The Scofield Reference Bible is also based on the teaching of the Brethren. If a believer who desires to expound the Bible takes the Brethren theology as his standard, he will not be far off the mark.</p>
<p>We cannot say much concerning other schools of theology. We cannot accept everything from reformed theology. Those in reformed theology do not even speak of regeneration, and they do not accept that believers have two natures within them. In my youth I purchased quite a number of books by reformed theologians, but I eventually threw all of them away. Around 1965 I disposed of five big boxes of books. The books were mainly in English and had followed me from northern China to Shanghai, to Taiwan, and finally to America.</p>
<p>Consulting various schools of theology, especially the theology of the Brethren, has kept us. I was taught by the Brethren for the first seven and a half years of my Christian life. That was my foundation in theology. Later, Brother Nee told me that the <em>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</em> by J. N. Darby would help me the most, and he gave me a set as a gift in 1933. I have used this set whenever I encountered a difficult problem; however, I do not follow it blindly. I also consult others&rsquo; writings. Almost all the notes in the New Testament Recovery Version were written after looking into the writings of others and making a decision about the usefulness of the content. For this reason I have the boldness to say that the New Testament Recovery Version is not my creation. It is the crystallization of Christian theology, which we inherited by standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before us.</p>
<p>We save much time by studying the Recovery Version, because many good points in the expositions of others are included in our footnotes. We should try our best to get into our publications. This does not mean that we should not read books published by others but that reading our publications is the shortest and the safest way to learn the truth. In particular, we should read the Recovery Version.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PURSUING THE TRUTH AND GROWTH IN LIFE</h2>
<p>What we are doing is not out of our own imagination. We have inherited the riches of the past nineteen centuries. We consulted and studied these riches together with the light we received from the Lord, and then we either included or dropped an item. Over the past sixteen years the Lord has given us higher and deeper light. Therefore, we must try our best to pursue the truth. The most important matter for the young full-timers is to know the truth and then to pursue the growth in life. These are two basic matters that we must pursue. If we do not know the truth and do not grow in life, we are lacking the basic condition of service.</p>
<p>There is an older sister in Kaohsiung who received three years of spiritual education in the old meeting hall. At that time she was not married, but now one of her sons is an elder. This shows that the truth is effective. Another sister, who preached the gospel in the schools, was bold and fearless and was not afraid to lose her job. I met her parents when I preached the gospel in Tsingtao, China. Her parents received much help and enjoyed the Lord&rsquo;s grace. This sister is now serving in a church overseas.</p>
