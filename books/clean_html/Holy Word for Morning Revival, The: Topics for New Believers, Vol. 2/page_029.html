<h2 class="head3u">Hymns, #840</h2>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Freed from self and Adam&rsquo;s nature,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, I would be built by Thee<br />
With the saints into Thy temple,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Thy glory we shall see.<br />
From peculiar traits deliver,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my independent ways,<br />
That a dwelling place for Thee, Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be thru all our days.</li>
<li>By Thy life and by its flowing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can grow and be transformed,<br />
With the saints coordinated,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Builded up, to Thee conformed;<br />
Keep the order in the Body,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There to function in Thy will,<br />
Ever serving, helping others,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Thy purpose to fulfill.</li>
<li>In my knowledge and experience<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not exalted be,<br />
But submitting and accepting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the Body balance me;<br />
Holding fast the Head, and growing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With His increase, in His way,<br />
By the joints and bands supplying,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knit together day by day.</li>
<li>By Thy Spirit daily strengthened<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the inner man with might,<br />
I would know Thy love surpassing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know Thy breadth and length and height;<br />
Ever of Thy riches taking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto all Thy fulness filled,<br />
Ever growing into manhood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Thy Body Thou may build.</li>
<li>In God&rsquo;s house and in Thy Body<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Builded up I long to be,<br />
That within this corporate vessel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All shall then Thy glory see;<br />
That Thy Bride, the glorious city,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May appear upon the earth,<br />
As a lampstand brightly beaming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To express to all Thy worth.</li>
