Concerning Dan</H2><P>The word concerning Dan reveals that this tribe was not very much under Moses' care. In verse 22 Moses said merely that Dan would be like a lion's whelp that leaps forth from Bashan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Concerning Naphtali</H2><P>In blessing Naphtali (v. 23), Moses spoke of this tribe as being satisfied with favor and full of the blessing of Jehovah. Naphtali would possess the sea (the west) and the south. According to Matthew 4:13-16, the Lord Jesus, fulfilling the prophecy in Isaiah 9:1-2, came to the districts of Zebulun and Naphtali, beside the sea. Eventually, through the preaching of the gospel, those of Naphtali possessed the Mediterranean Sea. If you study church history, you will see that much was gained for the Lord in the area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. Concerning Asher</H2><P>Finally, in Deuteronomy 33:24-25 we have the blessing concerning Asher. Moses declared that Asher would be blessed above the sons, that he would be the one favored of his brothers, and that he would dip his foot in oil (v. 24). For Asher to dip his foot in oil means that he would be rich in the produce of the earth. Furthermore, Asher's doorbolts would be as iron and copper; and as his days were, so would his strength be (v. 25).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Concluding Word</H2><P>Verses 26 through 29 are the concluding word of the blessing of Moses. This is a blessing not to any particular tribe but to all the people of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. There Being No One Like the God of Jeshurun</H2><P>First, Moses said that there is no one like the God of Jeshurun (Israel), who rides through the heavens as their help and in His majesty through the skies (v. 26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The God of Old Being Their Habitation</H2><P>Second, the God of old would be their habitation, and underneath would be the eternal arms (v. 27a). They would dwell in God as their habitation, and His eternal arms would be underneath them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Driving Out the Enemy before Them</H2><P>God drove out the enemy before them and said, "Destroy!" (v. 27b). The enemy driven out by God was then destroyed by the people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Israel Dwelling Securely</H2><P>Because of the foregoing, Israel dwelt securely, the fountain of Jacob in solitude, on a land of grain and new wine, with the heavens over him dropping their dew (v. 28).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Israel Being Happy</H2><P>In verse 29 Moses proclaimed Israel's happiness, saying, "Who is like you? /A people saved by Jehovah, /The shield of your help /And He who is the sword of your majesty! /So your enemies shall come cringing to you, /And you shall tread upon their high places." This was a total blessing on all the children of Israel.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_119.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_121.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Deuteronomy &nbsp; pg 120</div><br></body></html>
