<p>God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church comes out of God, because He planned it in Himself. This plan is not out of anything apart from God, nor was it produced by any influence apart from God. There was no creation when God made His plan. Therefore, there was nothing to suggest to God that He should have a plan. God&rsquo;s plan was altogether out of His own pleasure. Furthermore, no proposals were made to God related to His plan. The design of the plan was conceived in God; it was His pleasure, His determination, and His plan. Every part of God&rsquo;s plan came out of God and depends on Him. God is the source of this plan and the realm of this plan.</p>
<p>The church is the issue of God&rsquo;s plan; it is not the issue of human intention. Hence, we should not initiate anything related to the church; we should only live in God and allow Him to fulfill His plan concerning the church. Both the establishing of the church and the building of the church should be for the upholding and fulfilling of God&rsquo;s plan, not for the carrying out of man&rsquo;s will through human persuasion. This is a great test and limitation to man. Human opinions, zeal, decisions, and methods must be dealt with and restricted in relation to the church. The church is God&rsquo;s plan, not man&rsquo;s intention. The church involves God&rsquo;s desire, not human opinion. The church involves God&rsquo;s operation, not human initiation. The church involves God fulfilling His plan, not man carrying out his will. For the church our thoughts must be governed by God, and our activities must be controlled by God. This requires us to have a genuine fear of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ACCORDING TO THE GOOD PLEASURE<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S WILL</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:9 says that God&rsquo;s economy concerning the church, His plan concerning the church, is &ldquo;according to His good pleasure.&rdquo; This means that within God there was a good pleasure. God&rsquo;s good pleasure is embodied not only in His will but also in His purpose. Based upon God&rsquo;s will, He made a purpose. In His will and purpose there is His good pleasure. Then God made a plan. The church is God&rsquo;s plan according to the good pleasure of His will; the church is also the target of His purpose. The church is on God&rsquo;s heart and gives Him the greatest pleasure. God loves the church; therefore, He planned to have the church. The church was not invented by God because He had mercy on sinners who have been saved. God planned to have the church because He loved the church. The church came out of God&rsquo;s love and is the good pleasure of His heart. Long before anything was created, God had a good pleasure within Himself. Hence, He made a plan concerning the church according to this good pleasure.</p>
<p>Whenever we touch the church, we should take care of God&rsquo;s good pleasure. The church was planned by God according to His good pleasure to satisfy His desire. Therefore, our preferences and our pleasure must be dealt with when we touch the church. If we keep our preferences and pleasure when touching the church, our heart is not pure, and we are not considerate of God&rsquo;s desire. This is a serious lesson for us to learn.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>Everything that God is to the church is in Christ (vv. 3-23). This great matter needs further explanation. The Lord has two particular statuses. He is the Son of God, and He is the Christ of God (Matt. 14:33; Mark 1:1; Luke 9:20). When Peter received revelation concerning the Lord, he said, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (Matt. 16:16). The Son of God is the Lord&rsquo;s status according to His person. The Christ of God is His status according to His work. According to the Lord&rsquo;s person, He is the Son of God. According to the Lord&rsquo;s work, He is the Christ of God. This is similar to a crown prince of a country being appointed king. The crown prince is his original status, but the kingship is the work to which he is appointed. Christ is the Son of God appointed to be the Christ of God.</p>
<p>The title <em>Christ</em> means &ldquo;the Anointed.&rdquo; When God needs someone to work for Him, He first anoints that person. When God needed the Old Testament priests, kings, or prophets to accomplish His will, He anointed them. Therefore, God&rsquo;s appointing of His Son to be the Christ is His commissioning of His Son to be the Anointed in order to accomplish His plan concerning the church. The accomplishment of this plan is the work to which God appointed His Son in making Him the Christ, the Anointed.</p>
<p>When did God anoint His Son to be the Christ? Hebrews 1:2 says, &ldquo;The Son, whom He [God] appointed Heir of all things, through whom also He made the universe.&rdquo; God appointed His Son in eternity, before the creation of all things. In eternity God had a plan concerning the church, which was according to His good pleasure. He then appointed His Son as the Christ to accomplish His plan. Therefore, God anointed His Son in eternity (v. 9). However, the Son&rsquo;s being anointed was not manifested before men until the Holy Spirit descended upon Him when He was baptized (Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:10).</p>
<p>Three categories of people were anointed in the Old Testament: priests (Exo. 29:4-9), kings (1 Sam. 9:15-16; 16:12-13), and prophets (10:1, 6). These three kinds of people had to be anointed when they entered into office. Therefore, they were the anointed ones. However, it is difficult to find a person who was a priest, a king, and a prophet at the same time. Only David, a king, also wore the ephod of the priest and was called a prophet (16:12-13; 2 Sam. 6:14; Acts 2:30). David typifies Christ because he had the three statuses of king, priest, and prophet. However, these statuses were not fully developed in him.</p>
<p>When Christ came, He was God&rsquo;s Priest, God&rsquo;s King, and God&rsquo;s Prophet; He holds all three statuses (Zech. 3:8; Heb. 5:5-6; Rev. 1:5; Deut. 18:15; John 3:34; 14:24). God anointed Him to be the Priest, the King, and the Prophet so that He could accomplish God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church. God wanted Christ to accomplish everything that He determined to accomplish concerning the church and for the church. Everything that God is to the church is accomplished in Christ; apart from Christ, God is doing nothing related to the church.</p>
<p>God appointed His Son as Christ so that His Son would not only accomplish His plan concerning the church but would also inherit this plan. In typology Abraham typifies the Father God, Isaac typifies the Son of God, and Rebekah, typifies the church. Abraham sent his servant to find Rebekah, who became Isaac&rsquo;s wife (Gen. 24). Abraham&rsquo;s intentions were for his son Isaac. Similarly, God&rsquo;s eternal arrangement, management, and plan concerning the church are for Christ. The church is the counterpart of Christ and the Body of Christ (Eph. 5:25; 1:23). God&rsquo;s eternal plan is to gain the church for His Son by building the church to be Christ&rsquo;s counterpart and to be the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s plan, Christ not only accomplishes God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church and inherits the church. God&rsquo;s plan is also to make Christ everything in the church (vv. 3-23). This is the meaning of the phrase <em>in Christ. In Christ</em> is not only Christ accomplishing and inheriting but also Christ becoming everything. God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church is for Christ to become everything to the church, for everything of the church to be Christ, and for the church to be Christ.</p>
<p>When we meet a brother or sister who is deep in the Lord, we sense that this person has the savor of Christ. Sitting in front of this person is like sitting in front of Christ. This, however, is but a foreshadow and a foretaste of the things to come. A day will come when all things will be Christ, and we will sense Christ in everything we encounter. This is the purpose that God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church will achieve, and this is also the full significance of the phrase <em>in Christ.</em></p>
<p>God Himself is the resources with which He manages the church, the power of God is the driving power with which He manages the church, and the wisdom of God is the method with which He manages the church. But we must ask where God is. Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;In Him [Christ] dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily,&rdquo; and 1 Corinthians 1:24 says, &ldquo;Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.&rdquo; Hence, Christ is God, He is God&rsquo;s power, and He is God&rsquo;s wisdom. Therefore, Christ is the resources, the power, and the wisdom in the management of God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church. God in His eternal plan appointed His Son to be the Anointed, the Christ, in order for Christ to accomplish this plan, inherit this plan, and be everything in this plan. Then everything in this plan will be Christ and will be full of Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
