<h2 class="head3">Praying for the Necessities of Our Living</h2>
<p>The second principle of prayer is to pray for the necessities of our living. Since our prayer is to fight for God, we also need to ask for food for ourselves in order to maintain our living. The enemy tries to undermine by cutting off our food supply so that we cannot live. Hence, the Lord asks us to pray for our daily bread and for the necessities of our living. However, the Lord only teaches us to pray, &ldquo;Give us today our daily bread&rdquo; (Matt. 6:11). The Lord does not teach us to ask for two days&rsquo; portion of food. This matches His subsequent word, &ldquo;sufficient for the day is its own evil&rdquo; (v. 34), and it indicates that asking for daily bread is not only for our living but also for God&rsquo;s warfare.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Confessing Our Sins</h2>
<p>The third principle of prayer is to confess our sins. All proper prayer involves the confession of sins, because all of us have some wrongdoings. Verse 12 says, &ldquo;Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.&rdquo; A person who prays in this way does not have the self. Whoever does not forgive others is full of the self. Only a person who forgives others from his heart is without the self. He can ask God for forgiveness because he can say to God, &ldquo;I have forgiven others.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">Asking God to Keep Us and Deliver Us</h2>
<p>The fourth principle of prayer is to ask for God&rsquo;s keeping and delivering: &ldquo;Do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one&rdquo; (v. 13). To ask for God&rsquo;s keeping and delivering is to ask God to deal with His enemy, Satan, the evil one.</p>
<p>The four principles of prayer mentioned above include four aspects of prayer: first, prayer is toward matters related to God; second, prayer is toward matters related to ourselves; third, prayer is toward matters related to others; fourth, prayer is toward matters related to Satan. Toward God, we pray for the accomplishment of His plan; toward ourselves, we pray for our living so that we can be for God; toward others, we pray to forgive and to be forgiven by God; toward the enemy, we pray for God to deal with Satan. We may say that all prayer includes these four aspects.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Reason for Prayer</h2>
<p>We pray because the kingdom, power, and glory belong to God (v. 13). The kingdom is the realm where He rules, power is equal to His ruling, and glory is His expression. All our prayers should be for God&rsquo;s kingdom to come, for God to rule, and for God&rsquo;s glory to be expressed. If our prayer is not for God&rsquo;s kingdom, power, and glory, it amounts to nothing in God&rsquo;s eyes. Hence, the purpose of prayer is always for God. Genuine prayer involves man praying on God&rsquo;s behalf so that God&rsquo;s kingdom, power, and glory may be manifested.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Condition of Prayer</h2>
<p>At the end of this section, the Lord spoke of the condition of prayer, which is to forgive others. Verses 14 through 15 say, &ldquo;If you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you also; but if you do not forgive men their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses.&rdquo; If we do not forgive others, neither will God the Father forgive us, and our prayer will not be answered. The Father&rsquo;s forgiveness of us is based on our forgiveness of others. Those who do not forgive others cannot pray. Forgiving others implies that there is no self. If we continue to remember others&rsquo; wrongdoings while praying, we are full of the self. The condition of prayer is to have no self.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FASTING</h2>
<p>Fasting represents the righteous deeds of the people of the kingdom of the heavens toward themselves. Fasting deals with our own legitimate enjoyment. Eating is the most legitimate thing to man, but we need to deal with even these legitimate things. This is to treat ourselves strictly.</p>
<p>Giving alms is to treat others generously and to bring them out of suffering. Fasting is to stop our legitimate enjoyment and to treat ourselves harshly. Hence, fasting is a righteous deed of man before God. However, even in such a righteous deed as fasting, there is the possibility of making a show of ourselves. Therefore, we also need to do this without letting anyone but God know (vv. 16-18) so that we may be delivered from the self and terminate the self.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>With each of these righteous deeds, the Lord spoke of reward and repayment (vv. 1-2, 4-6, 16-18). Those who do righteous deeds in public will receive reward from men. Those who do righteous deeds in secret will receive repayment from God, whereas those who do righteous deeds in public seek praise and glory from men (v. 2). Since they have received praise and glory from men, God will not repay them.</p>
<p>In this section concerning the righteous deeds of the kingdom people, the Lord shows that there is the possibility of making ourselves known in anything. Even in divine things, such as prayer and fasting, there may be the element of the self. Therefore, the people of the kingdom of the heavens need to be delivered and freed from the self even in their righteous deeds and to allow the kingdom of the heavens to rule absolutely. The Lord&rsquo;s teaching requires that we be delivered from the self. We should be diligent in this matter.</p>
