   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the progressing stage of God's full salvation, we experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, we touch the experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this lesson we will go on to see other aspects concerning the experience and enjoyment of God as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>GIVING GRACE TO THE HUMBLE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God the Father gives grace, even greater grace, in His love to the humble believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>James 4:6 says, "But He gives greater grace;...</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.'"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here proud refers to our being proud toward God, and humble refers to our being humble toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By being proud toward God, man sides with God's enemy, the devil, causing God to resist man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, by being humble toward God, being subject to God, the believers withstand, stand against, the devil, causing God to give them grace, as He desires.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, we need to draw near to God 4:8 and receive in meekness the implanted word 1:21 that we may receive His greater grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, 1 Peter 5:5 says, "God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Greek word rendered resists is a strong word used for an army preparing to resist the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter uses this term to show how strong God is in resisting those who are proud.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Proud literally means having a show above others .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God resists the one who lifts himself above others and regards himself as better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead of being proud and having a show of ourselves above others, we should be humble toward God that we may receive the grace given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This grace refers to the Triune God Himself as the life supply, which is multiplied in the humble believer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1 Peter this grace is called the multiplied grace, the varied grace, and all grace 1:2; 4:10; 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have received the initial grace, yet this grace needs to be multiplied in us that we may participate in all grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Greek word for humble also means "lowly."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Matthew 11:29 the Lord said, "I am meek and lowly in heart."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be proud is to have a show above others, whereas to be humble is to not have self-esteem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead of uplifting ourselves in the church life, we should always humble ourselves and become lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we will be in a position to receive the Triune God as our life supply, to receive grace, even the greater grace, the grace that God desires to give to the humble.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the previous lesson we pointed out that in order to see God we need to be pure in heart Matt 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That is, being pure in heart is a condition for seeing God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Similarly, in order for God to give us grace, we need to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That is, humility is a condition for us to receive God's giving of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are truly humble toward God the Father, not having self-esteem but becoming lowly, we will receive His grace.</S>
