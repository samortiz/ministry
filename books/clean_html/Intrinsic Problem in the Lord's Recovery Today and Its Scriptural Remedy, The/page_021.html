<h2 class="head1">XXIX. THE TEST OF DEMAS HAVING LOVED<br />
THE PRESENT AGE, FORSAKING PAUL&mdash;2 TIM. 4:10</h2>
<p>Demas&rsquo; forsaking of Paul also should not be considered a division, but was a separation, which is always a damage to the oneness in the Body of Christ. However, Paul was not discouraged even at the time of his martyrdom (v. 6); rather, he was still very active in taking care of his co-workers and all the necessary things (vv. 11-13). This should be a pattern to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXX. THE TEST OF ALEXANDER THE COPPERSMITH<br />
HAVING DONE MANY THINGS AGAINST PAUL&mdash;<br />
2 TIM. 4:14</h2>
<p>The Apostle Paul put his trust in the Lord concerning the evil attacks. He believed that the Lord would deliver him from every evil work and would save him unto his heavenly kingdom (v. 18). He also had the assurance that the Lord will award to him the crown of righteousness at the Lord&rsquo;s appearing for his participation in the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom (vv. 8, 1). This was the apostle&rsquo;s way to face all the adverse situations. We should learn of him.</p>
<p>In facing the above five tests by exposing them to Timothy, the Apostle Paul could not avoid the mentioning of the names of five persons: Phygelus, Hermogenes, Hymenaeus, Philetus, and Alexander the coppersmith (1:15; 2:17; 4:14). This indicates that sometimes in dealing with some negative things that greatly damage the interest of the Lord, we may be forced to mention the names of those who are involved in the negative things, for the building up of the positive saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXXI. THE TEST OF A FACTIOUS,<br />
SECTARIAN MAN&mdash;TITUS 3:10-11</h2>
<p>We should refuse such a one after a first and second admonition, knowing that such a one has been perverted and sins, being self-condemned. To refuse such a one is to exercise to quarantine him. When a believer is divisive, factious, sectarian, he becomes contagious; therefore, we need to refuse him, that is, to quarantine him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXXII. THE TEST OF ANYONE AMONG THE BELIEVERS<br />
 BEING LED ASTRAY FROM THE TRUTH&mdash;<br />
JAMES 5:19-20</h2>
<p>Someone should turn him back, knowing that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save his soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins. This is to restore from his sins a brother who is erring in the truth. To do this requires love, spirituality, and adequate knowledge.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXXIII. THE TEST OF FALSE TEACHERS AMONG<br />
THE BELIEVERS WHO SECRETLY BRING IN<br />
DESTRUCTIVE HERESIES, EVEN DENYING THE<br />
MASTER WHO BOUGHT THEM, AND MANY FOLLOWING<br />
THEIR LICENTIOUSNESS, BECAUSE OF WHOM<br />
THE WAY OF THE TRUTH WILL BE REVILED;<br />
BY COVETOUSNESS WITH FABRICATED WORDS<br />
THEY MAKE MERCHANDISE OF THE BELIEVERS&mdash;<br />
2 PET. 2:1-3</h2>
<p>The false teachers in this case were heretics in the ancient time, like today&rsquo;s modernists. For them the judgment of old is not idle, and their destruction does not slumber. The believers should take Noah, a herald of righteousness, and righteous Lot as examples (vv. 5, 7). In a situation of destructive heresies, we should learn how to follow the faithful saints who stand fast in the truth against any kind of heresies.</p>
