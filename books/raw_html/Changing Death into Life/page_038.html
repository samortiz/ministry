<h1 class="title">THE NEED OF THE DEAD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 11:1, 3-8, 11-17, 20-29, 32-44; 5:24-25; Eph. 2:1-5</h1>
<p>John 11:1, 3-8, 11-17, 20-29, and 32-44 say, &ldquo;Now there was a certain man who was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha...The sisters therefore sent to Him saying, Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick. But when Jesus heard it, He said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it. Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. When therefore He heard that he was sick, He remained at that time in the place where He was for two days. Then after this He said to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again. The disciples said to Him, Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and You are going there again?...He said these things, and after this He said to them, Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going that I may wake him out of sleep. The disciples then said to Him, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover. But Jesus had spoken about his death, but they thought that He was speaking about taking rest in sleep. So Jesus then told them plainly, Lazarus has died. And I rejoice for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; but let us go to him. Then Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with Him. Then when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days...Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him; but Mary sat in the house. Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You. Jesus said to her, Your brother will rise again. Martha said to Him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day. Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live; and everyone who lives and believes into Me shall by no means die forever. Do you believe this? She said to Him, Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, He who comes into the world. And when she had said this, she went away and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here and is calling you. And she, when she heard this, rose quickly and came to Him...Then Mary, when she came to where Jesus was, saw Him and fell at His feet, saying to Him, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. Then Jesus, when He saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her weeping, was moved with indignation in His spirit and was troubled, and He said, Where have you put him? They said to Him, Lord, come and see. Jesus wept. The Jews then said, Behold how He loved him! But some of them said, Could not He who opened the eyes of the blind man also have caused that this man would not die? Jesus therefore, moved with indignation again in Himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying against it. Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who was deceased, said to Him, Lord, by now he smells, for it is the fourth day that he is there. Jesus said to her, Did I not tell you that if you believe you will see the glory of God? Then they took the stone away. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. And I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the crowd standing around, I said it, that they may believe that You have sent Me. And when He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus, come out! And he who had died came out, bound hand and foot with cloths, and his face was bound about with a handkerchief. Jesus said to them, Loose him and let him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John 5:24-25 says, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life. Truly, truly, I say to you, An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:1-5 says, &ldquo;You, though dead in your offenses and sins, in which you once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit which is now operating in the sons of disobedience; among whom we also all conducted ourselves once in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest; but God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved).&rdquo;</p>
<p>John 11 presents the eighth and last kind of people whom the Lord Jesus contacted&mdash;the dead. In principle, every person whom the Lord saves is dead. Furthermore, the Lord&rsquo;s salvation raises people out of death. The first case in the Gospel of John reveals that the Lord Jesus regenerates people. The eighth case reveals that the Lord raises people out of death. The eight kinds of people in the Gospel of John portray eight conditions of an individual person. Although these eight kinds of people seem to be separate cases, they reveal the Lord&rsquo;s full salvation in every person. The beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation involves regenerating man, and the issue of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation involves raising him out of death. Regeneration is the Lord&rsquo;s life entering into man, and resurrection is the issue of the Lord&rsquo;s life entering into man. At the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, every believer is regenerated. As the issue of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, every believer passes out of death into life; that is, every believer is resurrected. The Gospel of John presents the Lord&rsquo;s salvation by showing that the Lord&rsquo;s life enters into man to regenerate man and then raises man out of death.</p>
<p>After someone is regenerated and enlivened with the Lord&rsquo;s life, there will be several spontaneous issues. Initially, his human life becomes meaningful, and he is satisfied. This is portrayed in the record of the Samaritan woman&rsquo;s thirst being quenched by the living water in John 4. Then his weakness is turned into strength. This is seen in the case of the impotent man being strengthened in John 5. Next, he enjoys the Lord as the bread of life and the living water of life to be his life supply. This is seen in the cases of the hungry and the thirsty ones in John 6 and 7. Further, he is delivered from his sins. This is seen in the salvation of the sinful woman in John 8. Moreover, his inward eyes are opened, and he is able to see. This is seen in the case of the blind man receiving sight in John 9. Finally, he is delivered out of death. This is seen with Lazarus being raised out of death in John 11. The issues of the eight combined cases form the full issue of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. The full issue of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is to raise man out of death. Salvation is altogether a matter of life; it is not a matter of improving one&rsquo;s behavior.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
