<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. In His Resurrection</H2><P>Now we come to the third stage of Christ in Psalm 16&#151; His resurrection (Psa. 16:10-11a; Acts 2:27-28a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. God Not to Abandon Christ's Soul to Sheol</H2><P>God would not abandon Christ's soul to Sheol, nor let Him as God's Holy One see corruption, decay (Psa. 16:10; Acts 2:31). This indicates that Christ's soul would be raised up from Hades and also that Christ's physical body would be resurrected from the tomb (Matt. 28:6; John 20:5-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. God to Make Known to Christ the Path of Life&#151;Resurrection</H2><P>God would make known to Christ the path of life&#151;resurrection (Psa. 16:11a; Matt. 28:6). In His incarnation Christ brought divinity into humanity; in His resurrection He brought humanity into divinity. In His incarnation Christ made something divine, human; in His resurrection He made something human, divine.</P><P>In resurrection Christ was also begotten of God to be the firstborn Son of God (Psa. 2:7; Acts 13:33; Rom. 8:29). Through His incarnation Christ put on humanity. In His resurrection He brought His human part into divinity to be begotten of God that He could be the firstborn Son of God. In eternity past and before His resurrection, He was the only begotten Son of God (John 3:16). But in resurrection the only begotten Son became the firstborn Son of God by having His humanity begotten of God.</P><P>In Christ's resurrection the believers were regenerated to be the many sons of God and the many brothers of Christ (1 Pet. 1:3; Heb. 2:10; Rom. 8:29). First Peter 1:3 says that through the resurrection of Christ, God regenerated us, all the believers. Actually, we were not regenerated at the time when we believed. That is merely according to our estimation. According to the divine fact, we all were regenerated together nearly two thousand years ago. When Christ in His humanity was begotten of God to be God's firstborn Son, all His believers were also begotten of God to be God's many sons. Thus, now through the resurrection of Christ, God has a group of sons, a corporate sonship. As sons of God, we need to realize that divinity was brought into our humanity and now our humanity is being brought into Christ's divinity. Christ was divinely human, and we are humanly divine. Thus, we are the same as He is in life and in nature, but not in the Godhead.</P>
