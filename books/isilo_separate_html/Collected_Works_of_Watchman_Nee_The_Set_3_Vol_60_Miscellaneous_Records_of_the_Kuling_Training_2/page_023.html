A man is saved by reaching out his heart to touch the Lord. He is not saved through the knowledge of salvation or through understanding the doctrine of the gospel. When he exercises a sincere heart to touch the Lord, he is saved. As those who are learning to preach the gospel, we should study the way God works on man at the time of his salvation. The more we acquire a subjective understanding of the experience of those who are saved, the easier it is for us to lead men to Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">MAN'S HEART BEING THE CONFLUENCE OF A MAN</h2><p>We have said that a man is saved when his heart reaches out to touch the Lord, but what is the heart? The word heart is a very particular word in the Bible. Man's physical body has a heart&mdash;a physical heart. His soul also has a heart&mdash;a psychological heart. In addition, there is a part in his spirit which relates to the heart&mdash;the conscience. Hence, we can say that the heart is the confluence of the whole person. A man's thoughts issue from his heart (Gen. 6:5; Matt. 15:19). His deliberations&mdash;a function of the will&mdash;also issue from his heart (Acts 11:23). His joy&mdash;a function of the emotion&mdash;also issues from the heart (John 16:22). Hebrews 10:22 says that the conscience is in the heart. Ephesians 3 says that Christ makes His home in our hearts through faith (v. 17). Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks (Matt. 12:34b). The center of man is his heart. Both his soul and spirit are tied to his heart. We can say that the heart is the confluence of the total man, the convergent point of man's entire life. The heart represents his true self. Everything related to his life issues from the heart. This is the reason Proverbs 4:23 speaks of keeping the heart with all vigilance, because out of it come the issues of life. The heart is man's true self, the spot where his spirit, soul, and body converge.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD TOUCHING THE SEAT OF CONSCIOUSNESS<br />FOR MAN'S SALVATION</h2><p>Man's heart is deceitful above all things and it is incurable. Who can know it? (Jer. 17:9). It is full of darkness, and no one can see it. An unsaved person is hardened inwardly because of the darkness of his heart. The spirit of a fallen man is dead, his body can do nothing about his salvation, and his soul is not motivated to seek after God. Every imagination of the thoughts of his heart is only evil continually (Gen. 6:5; Matt. 15:19). A man who is darkened in mind and void of feelings has no intention to choose God; he has no desire for salvation. How can such a person receive salvation? Man's spirit is not the understanding organ, and in fact, it is dead before regeneration. Man's body is useless in this endeavor as well. His mind is darkened, his emotion is indifferent, and his will is uncertain. What should we do about such a man? We can give him good food or fresh air for his body, but these cannot influence his salvation. A man's body has no influence over his salvation. The Lord does not work through man's body because the body has been sold under sin (Rom. 7:14). After man fell and became fleshly, God no longer strove with his flesh (Gen. 6:3). If we try to communicate spiritual things to a fallen man, he will not receive it because his spirit is altogether dead. One whose spirit has not yet come alive will not understand the things related to the kingdom of God. Since the biological side and the spiritual side of a man are helpless in bringing him to salvation, God has to deal with the seat of his consciousness, that is, He has to deal with the mind, emotion, and will. The mind, emotion, and will together make up the conscious part of a man. How does a man with such consciousness interact with God, and how does he react to salvation?</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
