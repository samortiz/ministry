   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a Moving in Accordance</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>with God's Economy</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Abraham moved in accordance with God's economy vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>3-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What he did in obtaining a wife for Isaac was for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We long to see that all the marriages in the churches will be for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This kind of marriage requires a daily living in oneness with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Young brothers, if everything you do is in accordance with God's economy, even your marriage will be the carrying out of His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You need to say, "Lord, what I am doing here today must be in accordance with Your economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am single now, but one day I will be married.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>May my marriage be for Your economy."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the main revelation in Genesis 24.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The primary thing in this chapter is not that Isaac is a type of Christ as the Bridegroom and that Rebekah is a type of the church as the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I say again that the primary thing revealed here is the practical living in accordance with God's economy for the carrying out of His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need a life which resembles that of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His motive, action, and everything he did were in accordance with God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I doubt that Abraham was as clear about God's economy as we are today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, he told his servant that God had called him, had promised to give the land to his seed, and that the servant had to go to his country to find a wife for Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the light of the whole Bible, we can see that this was the carrying out of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How we need such a life today!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our motive, action, and all we do must be the carrying out of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This does not simply require that we know God's will and then do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No, we need a daily living that is in oneness with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must be this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are such a person, whatever we say will be God's expression, and whatever we do will be for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the life that we need for the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not say, "Oh, I don't know the Lord's will concerning my marriage or my schooling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I must fast and pray for three days and nights."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let me tell you honestly that although I tried this for years, it never worked very well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Consider the example of Abraham, the first of God's called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since he was the first called one, we see in his case the principle of the first mention.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Abraham did not act in today's traditional, religious way, fasting and praying to seek the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He did not suddenly have a dream in which he saw Rebekah in the land of Chaldea waiting for Abraham's servant.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As verse 40 indicates, Abraham walked before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a person walking in the presence of the Lord, he did not need to fast or pray in order to know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since he walked in the Lord's presence, whatever he did was God's will and according to God's economy.</S>
