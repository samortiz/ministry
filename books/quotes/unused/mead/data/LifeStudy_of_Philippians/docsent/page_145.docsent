   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD OPERATING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What can save us from our murmurings and reasonings?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2:12 and 13 Paul charges us to work out our own salvation, for it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, the matter of God operating in us may be merely a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we face certain situations at home, we may not have the reality of the inward operation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead, we may be fully in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, if we are to experience constant salvation, we need to realize that this salvation is God Himself operating within us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For years I was bothered by the fact that in 2:13 Paul speaks of God and not of Christ or the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul deliberately speaks of God in this verse in order to indicate that our constant salvation is nothing less than God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, there is a difference between the God revealed in 2:13 and the God revealed in Genesis 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By the time we come to the book of Philippians, God has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to Isaiah 9:6, the child born to us was called the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The One who was born in a manger in Bethlehem and who lived in a carpenter s home in Nazareth was the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By this we see that the living God experienced human life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In a man, the mighty God lived among human beings for more than thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then for the accomplishment of redemption, He was crucified, entered into death, took a tour of Hades, and came forth in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, our God, Jesus Christ, ascended to heaven and was made the Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now He has the lordship, the kingship, and the headship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today our God is not only the Creator, the Redeemer, the Savior, and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word God in 2:13 points to this wonderful, processed, all-inclusive God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indwelling God is now operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The indwelling and operating God is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, He is our pattern, the word of life, and the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indwelling One is not passive; on the contrary, He is active and energetic, moving, working, and operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Greek word rendered operates in 2:13 means energizes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The English word energize is an anglicized form of this word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The indwelling God energizes us from within to be the source, power, strength, and energy for our constant salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be saved from murmurings and reasonings is not an insignificant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Apart from the indwelling and operating God, we have no way to be saved from these things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We also need to be saved from crookedness and perverseness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In certain ways we all are crooked and perverted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be perverted is to be warped, twisted.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not easy to be saved from these things in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A CONSTANT SALVATION FROM REFINED SINS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Philippians 2 Paul refers to murmurings, reasonings, blame, guile, blemishes, crookedness, perverseness, and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By contrast, in Romans 1 he speaks of gross sins such as idolatry, fornication, and murder.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually, to be saved from gross sins is relatively easy, but to be saved from murmurings, reasonings, crookedness, and perverseness is very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may not commit gross sins, but day by day we are still bothered by the negative things listed by Paul in Philippians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need salvation not only from gross sins, but also from sins that may be considered somewhat refined, such as murmuring and reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we would be blameless and guileless, we also need a constant salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The only one who can possibly save us in this way is the Triune God who has been processed to become the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today our God is such an all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This wonderful God now indwells us and is working, energizing, operating, within us, looking for the opportunity to rescue us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I was young, I heard only two aspects of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First, I was told that Christ died on the cross to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Second, I learned that, as the almighty One, He is in the heavens, able to save us to the uttermost if we trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For years I did not know specifically how the Lord Jesus saves us in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now in the book of Philippians we see that we have a constant salvation both for particular situations and for ordinary daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The One who saves us is not merely the almighty One in the heavens; we are saved through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and by the inward operation of the indwelling God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>SAVED THROUGH THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>AND THE PROCESSED GOD</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today our God is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He has become our inward supply to support us in any particular situation with His riches, all of which are now our portion in the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As we enjoy this bountiful supply, we are spontaneously saved from our particular situations.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Furthermore, this Spirit is the God who dwells in us to operate within us to save us from the common situations of daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>During the years I have been in this country, I have continually ministered to the saints the all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit and the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Philippians 1 we have the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound Spirit, and in Philippians 2 we have the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today our God is no longer merely the object of our worship.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As the processed One, He dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God is no longer unprocessed, no longer raw.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Having passed through the steps of a process, He now dwells in our spirit for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hallelujah, we have the processed God as our portion!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He is operating in us to save us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Eventually, He Himself becomes our constant salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Actually, the indwelling God who operates in us is the all-inclusive Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Because He is such, we simply cannot systematize Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This God is Christ and also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The source of our constant salvation is the processed God who is the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>With this Spirit we have the bountiful supply, and with the processed God we have the inward operation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The supply and the operation are the source of our constant salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>By means of this wonderful source we are saved from our particular situation and from the common situations of daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In this way we can be saved from murmurings, reasonings, crookedness, and perverseness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is not a theory; it is practical and experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When we enjoy this constant salvation, we live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We live Christ by enjoying constant salvation in our daily life.</S>
