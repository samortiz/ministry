The Condition during Our Experience of Regeneration</h2><p>Firstly, we see that our nature is corrupt. Although before regeneration our nature was corrupt, yet we did not know it. It is at the time of experiencing regeneration, because of the Holy Spirit&#8217;s enlightenment, that we see ourselves to be corrupt. At this time we see not only that our external deeds are corrupt, but also that our inner nature is corrupt.<p>Secondly, our heart is contrite and repentant toward God. When we experience regeneration and the Holy Spirit enlightens us, we see ourselves as corrupt, sinning against God and man. Our heart then reproaches us and is contrite and repentant before God.<p>Thirdly, our spirit is contrite toward God. Because of the repentance of our heart, the spirit deep within us also feels extremely contrite. Our spirit at this time is like that of Psalm 51:17, &#8220;a broken spirit.&#8221; When we are being regenerated of the Holy Spirit, our spirit deep within feels contrite- indeed, as if it were broken.<p>Fourthly, man contacts God&#8217;s life. Since man sinned and fell and was driven out of the Garden of Eden, the cherubim with the flaming sword guarded the way of the tree of life (Gen. 3:24), so that man could no longer contact it and thereby obtain God&#8217;s life. Not until the Lord Jesus shed His blood and died on the cross, thus satisfying the demand of God&#8217;s glory, holiness, and righteousness, was the way which leads to God&#8217;s life opened. Therefore, at the time of our regeneration, because of our contrition, repentance, and faith in receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior, we can then contact in our spirit the life of God which is in Him. For the life of God is in His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ (1 John 5:11).<h2 class=head2>3. The Condition after Regeneration</h2><p>Firstly, we feel that our nature is corrupt. At the time of regeneration, we see that our nature is corrupt. After regeneration, because of that initial seeing, we always feel that our own nature is corrupt.<p>Secondly, our heart is softened toward God. Our heart, which is as hard as stone toward God before regeneration, having experienced repentance at the time of regeneration, is softened toward God and becomes &#8220;a heart of flesh&#8221; (Ezek. 36:26). Our heart, having been softened, desires to love God and draws near to God; it longs to contact spiritual things and gladly receives and obeys God&#8217;s commands; it is not stubborn nor rebellious; although at times it is unable to obey, yet it is still willing to obey.<p>Thirdly, our spirit is alive toward God. The spirit that was dead before regeneration, because of its contact with God&#8217;s life at regeneration, has been quickened by the resurrection power of God. The spirit, having been quickened, is able to contact God, to fellowship with God, to apprehend the spiritual things of God, and it has the strength to do God&#8217;s will.<p>Fourthly, we have God&#8217;s life. Because we have contacted and received God&#8217;s life during regeneration, we have the life of God within us. At the same time we also have God&#8217;s nature, since God&#8217;s nature is in God&#8217;s life.<p>When we speak of the experience of regeneration, therefore, in regard to the aspects of these four things, our nature, our heart, our spirit, and God&#8217;s life, the changes which have taken place before and after regeneration are all very clear. Our nature before regeneration is corrupt; at the time of regeneration, we see that it is corrupt; and after regeneration, we always feel that it is corrupt. Our heart is hard toward God before regeneration; at the time of regeneration it becomes deeply repentant; and after regeneration, it is softened toward God. Our spirit is dead before regeneration; it is contrite at the time of regeneration; and it is alive unto God after regeneration. Before regeneration we are separated from God&#8217;s life; at the time of regeneration, we contact God&#8217;s life; and after regeneration, we have God&#8217;s life. If we are clear regarding these few points, we then have a thorough understanding of the experience of regeneration.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Experience of Life &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
