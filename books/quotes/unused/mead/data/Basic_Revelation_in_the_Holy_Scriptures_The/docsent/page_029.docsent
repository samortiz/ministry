   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>3:10-11; Eph 2:20</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church is God's ultimate goal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's goal is not just to have many individual believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His goal is to have a corporate church that can be His house and the Body of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This church is God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church is both God's household expressing God the Father and the Body of Christ expressing Christ as the One who is the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What we are going to cover in this chapter is an extract of the divine revelation concerning the church in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE EKKLESIA</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church is firstly an ekklesia.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This Greek word denotes a called-out congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In ancient times when the city called its citizens together for a gathering, that congregation was an ekklesia.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The New Testament, beginning with the Lord Jesus in Matthew 16, uses this word to denote the church v. 18 . The church is a congregation called out by God unto Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Brethren prefer to use the word assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I believe this is a better word to use, because the word church in English has been very much spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I was growing up in China, we understood the word church to mean a building with a bell tower.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To many of us the church was a building.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today many people think the same.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They say they are going to church, meaning to a building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This concept is absolutely off.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must drop this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church is not a lifeless building, but something organic, full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is an assembly of living persons, not a physical building without life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, to consider the church as merely a called-out congregation, an assembly, is still superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There may be a congregation, an assembly, yet without life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today there are many large congregations in our society which are without the divine life.</S>
