The companion volume Truth Messages includes eleven messages given during weekly ministry meetings in Anaheim California in the fall of 1978
God's economy, that is, His way of achieving His eternal purpose, is to dispense Himself into His chosen people
The Moslems have the Koran, but that is largely an imitation of the Old Testament and a little part of the New Testament
The Spirit is mysterious and hard to grasp, but we do have the Word, which is solid, readable, and understandable
The life cannot be seen, but if that seed is sown into the earth, it will sprout, blossom, and bring forth fruit
Who had put it there he did not know, but he recognized it as the Bible of that Western religion which he despised
Though he had never heard the gospel nor been to any Christian meeting, he repented, weeping and even rolling on the ground
If you reject the Bible, that is like throwing away God and all His accomplishments, including redemption, salvation, and life
If you 'let the word of Christ dwell in you richly' , the result will be 'singing with grace in your hearts to God'
If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him'
Do not expect magical results, though; just come regularly three times a day and you will receive the supply you need
Because you are so familiar with the Word and have it always in your pocket, you can tell him what the Bible declares is man's purpose
If this is held on the Lord's Day mornings, relatives and friends can be invited, and eventually others also will be encouraged to come
You may even shepherd your parents if they receive the word you spoke to them as an evangelist and as a prophet when you were Gods sent one
He may lead you to go to some of them, not only to become reconciled but also to say a word about God's economy to them
If you neglect contacting the Lord and take up the exhortation to be instant in season and out of season , you will be keeping a regulation
In our life with the Lord, we contact Him by reading His Word and praying and by being one with Him all day long
Notice the simple words with which it opens: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
The incarnation was not to bring the universe into existence out of nothing; rather, it was to bring God into the existing man
When you first begin coming to the church meetings, you flow just a small river, but in time the rivers will become a flood
Verse 23 says further If anyone loves Me he will keep My word and My Father will love him and We will come to him and make an abode with him
The text implies not only that we shall become the abode of the Triune God, but also that He will be our abode
If you think it is too mysterious that God abides in you, notice verse 7, where it says, 'You abide in Me and My words abide in you'
If you plant a little stone or a piece of rock in the soil, nothing will come up, even if you wait for twenty years
Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever'
He is the Spirit, compounded with divinity, humanity, human living, the death of the cross, resurrection, and ascension
It does not come about from a few concentrated days of praying and fasting and then having something fall upon you from the heavens
Wherever you are, when you have a few minutes, open it and read a chapter or so, then pray over what you have read
There is little need for you to pray about your grades at school or for your business to be successful or for guidance when you go shopping
God became a man with the intention that man might receive Him, that He might become man's life, and that man might be one to express Him
The common teaching is that we were pitiful sinners on the way to hell but that God loved us and sent His Son to be our Redeemer
After He had set up this pattern, Christ went through death and resurrection to become the Spirit in order that He might enter into us
When we receive this Christ into us, we receive creation, incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension into us
As many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name'
With the Word as the ground wire and the Spirit as the antenna, all the riches of Christ will be transmitted to us
Our receiving will last even to eternity, because we shall still have the water of life to drink and the tree of life to eat of
The meaning of this oneness of the vine and the branches is the focus of the entire divine revelation in the Bible
When Cain was driven out of the presence of God and thus lost God, he and his descendants began to invent things
Because the land would not yield its strength to him, he was forced to be a wanderer and to keep cattle in order to make a living
Modern weapons may be more highly developed, but their beginning was soon after Cain 'went out from the presence of the Lord'
Ethics may be desirable from society's point of view, but such teachings are simply one more invention to fill the shortage in mankind
If we visit someone, we do not step over the threshold until we are first invited in; otherwise, we would be intruding
The Lord said that our righteousness must surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, or we are not qualified for the kingdom of the heavens
For two thousand years among the human race, there has been this Word, saving us from confusion, mixture, and darkness
We must not turn aside from the Word and pray for something to fall upon us from the heavens; this is not the biblical way
When our time in the Word seems dry and lifeless, it may be that our heart is not open to Him to give Him our love
The result of our opening to the Lord in this fourfold way is that this living One replaces religion, ethics, and our natural virtues
Are those in verse 11-the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers-greater than the saints in verse 12?
From these seeming contradictions we may conclude that all of us, whether saints or gifted ones, are about the same
The outcome of this perfecting work is that all the saints become apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
Seeing this causes us to think that the gifted ones in Ephesians 4:11 are special ones and that we are insignificant nobodies
Even among us today there is the concept that the apostle is above the elder and that the elder is higher than the other saints
Suppose, among the five hundred or so that are in this meeting, only fourteen are apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers
As you care for them and shepherd them, you will share with them about God's economy, His eternal purpose, and His dispensation
In your religious concept, an apostle might mean a prominent leader, but the Greek meaning of the word is sent one
You may feel burdened, after contacting the Lord through prayer, to go to your relatives, or classmates, or neighbors
For the Word of God to grow and multiply there must be a period of learning, experiencing, and being dealt with
If you do this, within a very few years you will be ready to be sent and to be God's spokesman, speaking for Him and speaking Him forth
If your being is saturated with the living essence of God's Word, not merely with the knowledge of it, you will surely be His sent one
How much you take the Word into you and let it mingle with your inward parts determines the extent to which you can be God's spokesman
When you become the embodiment of God's Word, you spontaneously are one of His sent ones, speaking for Him and shepherding others
In every place where the church is, that church must be a shining lampstand, shining forth the light of the truth of God's Word
We can then advertise the meeting by word of mouth, telling our relatives, neighbors, classmates, colleagues, friends, and acquaintances
Such a meeting with an hourlong attractively given message will bring in a good increase not from among the drifters but from those we know
Timothy 3:2 tells us that one of the qualifications of an elder is that he be skillful in teaching, 'apt to teach'
If the churches feel burdened, they can begin to have a preaching, teaching meeting, as we have suggested here
It may seem humble to say that your church is weak and needs help, but is this wide open door the best way to get help?
She keeps asking one neighbor after another to come and teach her how to manage and show her how to cook for her household
No one has time to be of help until one day a woman comes and offers to cook for her, saying she will be glad to help her out
You must keep the door of fellowship open to all the churches, even while you keep the door of weakness shut to offers of 'help'
It would be good also for the leading ones to consider having a practical training, perhaps on a weekly or biweekly basis
All of us also are to take care of the work that needs to be done, even though strictly speaking this is not the service
As to functioning in the meetings, this is included in the work of the prophets, evangelists, teachers and shepherds
Why did Paul tell us in one chapter that not all are prophets, and then two chapters later say that all may prophesy?
Not all are prophets in the sense of being leading ones, but all can follow the example of the leading ones to prophesy
After the return from the Babylonian captivity, further books, like Daniel, Nehemiah, Ezra, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi were written
As God, He had taken the step of incarnation to become flesh and was confined in this form until released by crucifixion
It is the New Testament which reveals this to us, though for all these centuries the vision has not been as clear as it is today
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John present a composite picture of this wonderful One, each written from a different side or angle
Without the Acts, how could we know that this wonderful Person has been propagated into humanity and become the churches?
Without the Word, all these things would exist, but they would not be understandable or available to our faculties
You can see how incomplete a creed would be with seven of the New Testament books not even regarded as authoritative
They exercised their authority to forbid the common people to read the Bible, claiming that laymen could not understand it rightly
The Bible was opened some three centuries later in the hands of the Plymouth Brethren, under the leadership of J
The scholars who researched the Bible fell into the subtle one's trap, turning unawares from the realm of truth to that of doctrines
We studied the writings of the church fathers and the spiritual writings from the second century down to the present century
By His mercy the Lord has shown us the proper way to open up the Word, not being deficient and not going to excess
You could then repeat the history of the Brethren, with their exhausting, divisive, opinion-creating doctrines
If you use the Recovery Versions with the notes and the Life-study Messages, you will save much time and be kept on the right track
These are not necessary when you are doing your daily reading of three chapters in the Old Testament and one in the New
It requires much prayer and much discernment to make a final decision as to how to translate that word in our Recovery Version
When you want to study Romans, for example, you simply use the Recovery Version along with the notes and Life-studies
The Lord's recovery is to rid us of the clergy-laity system, of hierarchy and rank, and of all the other traditions of today's Christianity
The gospel does include the matter of sin, for 1:29 tells us, 'Behold the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world'!
These things Jesus spoke and lifting up His eyes to heaven He said Father the hour has come glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You
If, however, we preach the biblical gospel, as found in John, we are surely constrained to put our trust in the Spirit
You need to answer according to the instant leading you have for each time, not according to the method you have devised
In John 15:7 He says, 'If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you'
These two, the Spirit and the Word, are the two wires that transmit the heavenly electricity from the power plant into the building!
In the matter of taking care of the church life, it is easy to be concerned with the kind of meeting we should have
Even in todays modern Western culture these three components prevail Roman politics and government the Hebrew religion and Greek philosophy
They would be like the Scythians , who were considered the most barbaric of people, lacking any semblance of religion or philosophy
The result of this Christ living in us, opposed to religion and philosophy, is the church, the theme of Ephesians
Those messages were well received by the saints, and a number of hymns were written on taking Christ as our person
At such times of prayer, when you were one with the Lord, taking Him as your life, you wanted to linger with Him, even to be raptured
When your bank account becomes a factor in your daily living, you will begin to write checks and draw upon the money you have
The word translated spirit in Romans 8:4, and in several other verses in Romans 8, presents a problem to translators
Every day, from morning till evening, cease from your doing and seek to constantly remain in this mingled spirit
The life He imparts to us is not like a set of dentures, which may be worn year after year without ever becoming part of us
The Christian life is a hybrid life; that is, it is the product or result of the blending of two different lives
Instead of heeding this basic commandment, we pay attention to the exhortations that suit our natural mentality
He wrote to the Colossians because they had been distracted from Christ by Gnosticism, including Jewish and heathen philosophies
When we receive the gospel, we of course participate in God's salvation, but that is only an issue; it is not basic
In other words, Christ is the real food, the real drink, the real Sabbath, the real new moon, and the real feast
In the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew circumcision and uncircumcision barbarian Scythian slave freeman but Christ is all and in all
We all need to see that besides our first birth into the kingdom of men we have had another birth into the kingdom of God
He was implying that however wonderful His presence with them was, He could only be among them, not within them
In the evening of the day He was resurrected, He came to where the disciples were meeting and stood in their midst
He talked to the disciples, showed them His hands and side, and even breathed into them, saying, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
The divine part within has the desire to worship the Father; the divine Spirit would worship by your human spirit
Their unceasing prayer is the expression of their constant trust in this living One who is now one Spirit with them
When we abide in this mingled spirit, every spiritual blessing is ours, because it is wrapped up in this dear One
If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him'
It is not for you to evaluate whether the church is high or low, or whether the brothers are spiritual or fleshly
You will be able to testify that you are one with Him and He with you, even that you are abiding in this oneness
Galatians 2:20 will be true of us, that we have been crucified with Christ, nevertheless we live; yet not we, but Christ lives in us
Though the term 'to live by Christ' sounds familiar to us because of our having heard it so much, it is nonetheless a great matter
Humanly speaking, there is no possibility for a wife, for example, to live by her husband, or for a husband to live by his wife
The Father sent the Son, and the Son was now living by the Father; so the one who ate the Son would also live by the Son
Whoever opens himself to this extent will have this life-giving One enter into the inmost part of him, his spirit
Christ today is both in the heavens and in us, just as electricity is in the power plant and also in the building
We must turn away from these distractions, no longer caring for religion, philosophy, ethics, and human virtues
For our growth in Christ, for our help in living Christ, we need Bible reading, prayer, fellowship, and the meetings
There is a mystery, then, hidden in times past but now, according to the command of the eternal God, made known to man
To bring to light what is the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, Who created all things'
The mystery of the universe, Paul tells us, has been hidden 'from the ages' and was not made known 'in other generations'
In verse 26 the three pronouns referring to God are plural: 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness'
One day after His resurrection, just before He ascended to the heavens, the Lord Jesus met with His disciples on a mountain in Galilee
There He charged them to go and 'disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
In answer to Thomas' question, Jesus said, 'I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me'
At this point Philip asked that they be shown the Father; the disciples would be satisfied if the Lord would do this for them
If He had directly said He was the Father, it would have prevented much theological debating all these centuries!
Later on in this same chapter, the Lord says, 'I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter the Spirit of reality'
He chooses to talk in this mysterious way, making us wonder whether there are Two in us, the Spirit and Himself, or only One
Paul, the great apostle who received the revelation concerning this mystery, refers to Christ in the flesh as the last Adam
He is like the electricity that makes the lamps give light; we cannot explain how it works, but we experience its benefits
Even if you are a model human being, living a highly ethical life, if you will not believe in the Lord Jesus, you will perish
As Christians, we should be 'Christ-men,' but from our way of living perhaps we could more accurately be called 'moral men'!
After man was created, he fell; because of the fall, he has his natural life, with its own inclinations and intentions
To live by the culture into which we were born comes naturally; but to live Christ seems like a strange notion to us
Whether we are very set in our religion, like the Moslems, or consider ourselves atheists, we nonetheless are religious
To be pleasant and considerate of others is needed in human society, but in order to live Christ we must be above ethical considerations
To make up our minds to love our wives, or to improve the church life, or to achieve anything, prevents us from living by Christ
As each day goes by, without your intending to do or be anything, you will live and move and have your being in the Spirit
The New Testament centers on the fact that the all-inclusive Christ as the processed God is now dwelling in our spirit
We may try to have an impressive church life, but if we are devoid of this living by Christ, the recovery is still empty
The content of the recovery is this very living by Christ, this Christ who is the all-inclusive Spirit and the mystery of God
The church, then, is the mystery of Christ, who in turn is the mystery of God, who Himself is the mystery of the universe
After entering into death, resurrection, and ascension, He descended to reach His believers and make them one with Himself
By prayreading all the verses we have listed at the beginning of the message your mind and even your whole being will be set upon the spirit
The church is Christ, being all-that is, being you, me, and every other believer-and being in all, that is, being in every one of us
You will see that what God wants is Christ, not the Christ of knowledge and doctrine, but the Christ of experience
Once you have this view, it kills ethics, religion, human culture, natural virtues, and even your spiritual seeking
In verse 9, however, it says that the Spirit of God dwells in you and that one must have the Spirit of Christ to be of Him
He Who raised Christ' is another reference to God, who will also 'give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you'
He firstly comes into the center, our spirit; then spreads into our mind; and eventually saturates our body, the circumference
Do not try to walk according to some verse in the Bible, attempting to obey what it says without walking according to spirit
Let it suffice that any circumstances are good for you to live Christ and for Him to be magnified in your body
As Colossians 3:11 tells us, in this new man there is no room for the natural man with his national characteristics
Pray-read these verses till you see that Christ is the mystery of God and that the church is the mystery of Christ
The Apostle Paul, through whom this mystery has been revealed, tells us that until the New Testament economy this mystery was hidden in God
When the Lord Jesus came, there was among the Jewish people a religion, not pagan, but one formed and established according to God's word
Saul thought he was persecuting the disciples of Jesus; now he found out that he had been persecuting Jesus Himself
While he was surpassing his contemporaries in religious zeal, Christ not only laid hold of him but also imparted His life to him
To say this may make the elders anxious lest the young people become loose and will no longer rise early for morning watch!
When Paul refers to philosophy and the elements of the world, he means especially Gnosticism, mysticism, and asceticism
Paul wrote to declare that Christ stood in opposition to the Jewish religion, to Gnosticism, to mysticism, and to asceticism
In this new creation all others are excluded, both 'Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman'
These seven layers are implied in the religion, law, tradition, and philosophy which Paul condemns so strongly
The fall, the natural life, culture, religion, ethics, morality, virtues, and spiritual seeking-we need to be snatched out of all of these
These two matters, religion and philosophy, are highly esteemed in society and are closely related to each other
Because Paul, in his pursuit of Christ, rejected religion, this book tells of sufferings, afflictions, and trials that came to him
The all-inclusive Spirit renders us the bountiful supply, while the suffering turns out to be a salvation for us
In the very next verse after the unsearchable riches of Christ are mentioned, is the dispensation of the mystery
The mystery, therefore, is the dispensation of the Triune God: the Father as the source, the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the flow
If, on the other hand, we enjoy Christ as our food and drink, His unsearchable riches will make us grow and the church will be the result
The Father strengthens us through the Spirit that the Son may make His home in our hearts that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God
If we find that we are still individualistic, it is an indication that our experience of Christ is not genuine
We must say no to all such considerations and have regard only for Christ, this all-inclusive Spirit who is in our spirit
The key to experiencing Him is to be found in the two spirits, which are mentioned in most of the verses given above
The Old Testament promise was of the good land, but in the New Testament fulfillment the promise becomes the Spirit
There is a further inference of the Spirit as the good land in Galatians 5:25: 'If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit'
The good land was the type of the all-inclusive Christ, and Christ in His resurrection became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
When a paper, for example, has a seal stamped upon it, this indicates that the paper has been reached by the seal
When the Spirit works and our spirit, the inner man, responds, Christ settles down in our heart, becoming our enjoyment
Verse 23, 'And are renewed in the spirit of your mind,' indicates that our mind is now occupied and saturated by the Spirit
Our mind, in contrast, is being renewed from the old creation to the new, so that our mind is a mind of the spirit
In Ephesians 4:30 we are exhorted not to 'grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in Whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption'
Whenever we come to the Bible with a proper spirit, reading, praying, and receiving it, this Word getting into us becomes the Spirit
The next verse, Ephesians 6:18, gives us the way: 'By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit'
It was because of this Spirit's supplying, supporting, and sustaining him that Paul could say, 'Christ shall be magnified in my body'
There are two passages in 1 Corinthians that indicate that the church in Corinth was only in the initial stage of the enjoyment of Christ
Did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ'
When we come to the writings of Paul to the Colossians and Ephesians, however, we find that their enjoyment of Christ was as the good land
Colossians 1:12 says, 'Giving thanks to the Father, Who qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light'
What the Apostle Paul had in mind here was the good land, which was allotted to the twelve tribes of Israel when they entered it
Christ in Colossians is no longer merely the Passover or the manna but rather the final portion of Gods chosen people that is the good land
Such a description does not fit the Passover lamb nor the manna; only the good land can be described in such an inclusive way
Or we may have made our exodus from Egypt and are now in the wilderness receiving revelation building the tabernacle and feasting on manna
Surely it is good to have the tabernacle as God's building, yet the tabernacle lacked solidity; it was portable with no foundation
You remember that before they crossed the Jordan River, the ark preceded them and stayed in the river bed until all of them had crossed over
What the Bible reveals as the ultimate relationship between God and us is far deeper than that of Creator and creature
In the plant kingdom a branch which is not doing very well may be cut off the parent tree and attached to a healthier, more productive tree
You, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in and became a fellow-partaker of the root of the fatness of the olive tree
You were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree '
As you enjoy the root of the fatness of this cultivated olive tree, your poorer life is subdued, and you begin to flourish
These vessels are to have God Himself as their content, thus making them vessels to honor, full of riches and glory
The inferior branch has not given up its poor life in order to get the richer life of the tree to which it is grafted
The branch still retains its same essential characteristics, but its life is uplifted and transformed by being grafted to the better life
We taught that since we are prone to sin, we have to see that we are already dead and then reckon on that fact
Romans 6:3 says, 'Or are you ignorant that as many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death'?
After a few days the skin taken from the leg will grow together with the flesh of the arm; they will be organically joined to each other
We had a co-worker from the northeast of China who, before his conversion, was arrogantly opposed to Christianity
Rather, we have been grafted into Him in the likeness of His death and have grown together with Him all at the same time
Once we are thus grafted into Him, His resurrection life comes into us and removes all the negative elements within
He uplifts the original functions given us at creation, and enriches, strengthens, and even saturates our whole being
By the Lord's grace we have repented, and through repentance and believing we have been grafted into the divine life
When we read the Bible, it is easy for us to understand and even experience those things which fit our natural concept
It is another matter, however, when we come to the matter of God and man being organically mingled, as in grafting
You may have been impressed while you were reading it, but before too long, you began to consider in your mind
What Romans 11 says is that the wild olive branch has been grafted to the good olive tree, and that its root is supporting the wild branch
All true believers among both Jews and Gentiles are grafted to this olive tree, so that it includes Christ and all His believers
He also made man according to His likeness, that is, according to His stature; for this He used the dust of the ground
There is, however, an instance of God's appearing in the form of a body before the Lord's coming to earth in the incarnation
In our spirit, which was formed from God's breathing into man the breath of life, there is not the Spirit of God
Once this breath of life got into man's nostrils, he became a living soul, with a personality that in reality is in the image of God
Notice how the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man are put together as the three important things in the universe
To have man, God first stretched forth the heavens, then laid the foundation of the earth; then He formed 'the spirit of man within him'
When all the physical things in the universe were ready and could provide man with a suitable environment, God put man on the scene
Although man from his creation was designed to receive God, God at that time was not ready to be received into man
It encompasses redemption; the termination of the past; the dealing with the self, with the old man, and with all the other negative things
Besides death, in the Spirit are found also resurrection, ascension, glorification, enthronement, dominion, and power
After the trainer finished the lesson, the monkey tossed away the knife and fork, and resumed eating in monkey fashion
We know Romans 8:28 about all things working together for good, but Romans 8:4, about walking according to spirit, we cannot quite grasp
There are Chinese philosophers, like Wang Yang-Ming, whose standard of morality exceeds that of most Christians
Our children must be raised according to cultural standards; they have not grown sufficiently to experience Christ
The relationship between God and man, as we have seen in the two previous messages, is a matter of life and of the spirit
The term, Spirit of life, indicates that the Spirit is the source, while life is the current or flow that comes from the Spirit
Electricity has been installed in this building but if you do not turn on the switch the function of the electricity will not be manifested
If you want the heat, or the air-conditioning, or the lights, you must activate the electricity by turning on the switch
If you do not turn on the switch, what is the sense of studying how to make the lights shine or how to cool the building?
You search the Scriptures,' the Lord Jesus told the religious Jews, 'and you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life'
They spent time studying and searching the Scriptures from Genesis to Malachi, but they would not come to the One who could give them life
Whether you are young or old, sister or brother-whoever you are, if you turn on the switch, you enjoy the light
The Spirit that we are referring to is the Spirit; that is, it is the Triune God who has been processed and become the life-giving Spirit
The Spirit, in traditional thinking, comes into the believers, while the Father and Son are left on the throne
To split the Godhead into these separate Persons is not the revelation of the Bible, but the doctrine of the Nicene Creed
One was of an old, bearded man sitting down, with a young son standing at his side, and a dove flying overhead
He says the Spirit of God dwells in you; that without the Spirit of Christ you are not of Him; that Christ is in you
We were created in this way so that we could be organically grafted to God and so that the two spirits His and ours could be joined together
In Romans 8:10 it says, 'And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness'
When we set the mind on the spirit, the life and the spirit will be infused into our mind, making it also life
We should not be content with outwardly worshipping Him, loving Him, fearing Him, and doing things to please Him
When every part of us is saturated with this all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, we are in the union that God wants
The groom may be an even-tempered person, but the slowness of his wife nonetheless provokes him beyond measure
These renewed efforts on the part of the groom to be loving and the wife to be submissive cause a great deal of suffering

It is not by being in an impressive-looking church building and acting in a dignified, solemn way that you will touch the Lord

She was the one whose thirst needed to be quenched; the Lord asked her to give Him a drink just to make her aware of this
When the Samaritan woman asked Him for the water, He raised this issue by telling her to come back with her husband
The mention of a husband touched the sinful life she was leading; if she wanted to drink the living water, she had to confess her sins
John 4:14 and 24 strongly show us that to drink of Christ as the living water is the real worship to God as the Spirit in our spirit
After we have eaten our food and it has been digested and assimilated, even a surgeon cannot remove it from us!
When this life comes into us, we are born again and receive 'a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father'
Nee then pointed out to him that the awkward feeling when he called his fatherinlaw Dad was evidence that he was not born of his fatherinlaw
Consider the behavior of those who are of the world, those you see at work or at school or among your relatives
If it is convenient to tell a lie, they have no hesitation about doing so; if they might be caught, then they do not
There is an inward work going on, something growing up and living out of us, that makes us different from others
The trees around it may be withered and lifeless, but this one is showing evidence of life by its newness and freshness
It regulates the assimilation of our food, the discharge of the dead cells, and their replacement with healthy, new ones
When the Scripture tells us, 'Be transformed' , it does not mean that we should try to make ourselves different in an outward way
