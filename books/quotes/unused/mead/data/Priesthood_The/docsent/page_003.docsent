   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRIESTS IN THE BIBLE Adam</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first priest was the first person, Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some may argue with me, because according to the record of the Old Testament a priest is one who offers sacrifices for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But Adam, when he was in the garden of Eden, did not have sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, it was unnecessary for him to offer a sacrifice for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How then can we say that Adam was the first priest?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A priest is not one who merely offers sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was done in the outer court and is only a part of the service of a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The priest must also enter the Holy Place to spread the showbread on the table, light the lamp, and burn the incense on the golden altar.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To enter the Holy Place is a much finer work than to offer sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Spreading the bread on the table, lighting the lamp, and burning the incense are related to the finer experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But there is still something deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After this, the priest must enter into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What work did the priests do in the Holy of Holies?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There was no work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All human activity was stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord does not need us to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What He needs is that we stop our work and be filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although Adam had no need to offer any kind of sacrifice, we must realize that before the fall he was in the presence of God all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After creation, God did not ask Adam to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He simply put him in front of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Adam was to spend his time in the presence of God and enjoy God Himself as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Adam was not to do anything for God, but to take Him again and again as the life supply so that he would be filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then Adam would be saturated and permeated by and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all know that Adam eventually failed God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Abel, Enoch, Noah</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Abel, the second priest, still did nothing for God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He simply approached and worshipped God according to the plan of God s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Abel did nothing but seek God s face by offering the sacrifice according to God s redemptive plan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible then tells us that Enoch walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is a sharp contrast between Cain and Enoch.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Cain was cast away from the presence of God, but Enoch walked in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, Enoch was a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Did Enoch do anything for God?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No. The Bible simply says that he walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To walk with God means to be one with God, to be filled with Him, and to express Him as a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A real priest is one who is always in God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After Enoch, there was Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Noah did a work for God by building the ark, but we must realize how Noah built the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By first walking with God, he came to know the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was through his walk with God that he received the revelation from God to build the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His work came from a priestly revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Abraham was also one who lived in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was called by God, yet he did not know where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is because he was called to live in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The presence of God was his destination.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He did not know where to go, but he did know where to be!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He also offered the offerings to the Lord just as Abel and Noah did.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They were not called priests that early in the Bible, but they really were priests.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Abraham offered sacrifices to God and lived a life in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we read the history of Abraham carefully, we will see that he was a real priest.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His whole life was in the Holy of Holies in the shekinah glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Isaac was one who was brought into the Holy of Holies in the person of his father.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was born in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>So he simply remained there all the time enjoying the presence of the shekinah glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, Isaac was not only a priest, but even the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He lived continuously in the Holiest Place.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Jacob differed much from Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He was neither in the Holy of Holies nor in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many times he was out of the outer court, far from the entrance of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But the mercy and sovereign grace of God brought him back again and again to the outer court, the Holy Place, and eventually to the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then he became Israel, the prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Jacob the supplanter was transformed into a priest of God who lived in the presence of God in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, being a priest, he offered the sacrifices himself.</S>
