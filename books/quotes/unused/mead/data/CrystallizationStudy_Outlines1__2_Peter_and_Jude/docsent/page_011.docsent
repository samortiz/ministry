   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1 Pet 1:22 In the Bible there are two trees Gen 2:9 , two sources John 1:4; 15:1; 8:44 , two ways Matt 7:13-14 , two principles Gen 4:3-4; John 15:5-6; Jer 17:5-8 , and two consummations Rev 21:2, 10-11; 22:1-2; 20:10, 14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Second Peter 2 shows that this Epistle was written in a time of the church s degradation and apostasy: Apostasy is a deviation from the right track of God s truth and a falling away from the straight way of God s economy as revealed in the Scriptures; through such apostasy the church became degraded 2 Thes 2:3; 1 Tim 4:1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Apostasy was the background of 2 Peter, and the burden of the writer was to inoculate the believers against the poison of apostasy 2:1: God s salvation is to impart Himself in His Trinity into the believers to be their life and life supply; this is God s economy, God s plan 2 Cor 13:14; Eph 1:10; 3:9; 1 Tim 1:4.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The apostasy distracted the believers from the economy of God by leading them into the human logic of puzzling philosophies Col 2:8: This did not lead the believers to partake of the tree of life, which gives life, but to participate in the tree of knowledge, which brings in death Gen 2:9, 16-17.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through the serpent s questioning and undermining of God s word, the believers, like Eve, can be carried away to the tree of knowledge and be distracted from the simplicity of eating the tree of life 3:1-6; 2 Cor 11:2-3.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to inoculate against this death-poison, Peter first prescribed the divine power as the strongest and most effective antidote 2 Pet 1:3: This power provides the believers with all things related to the generating and supplying divine life and the God-expressing godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This rich divine provision enables the believers to overcome the satanic apostasy 1 John 5:4; Rev 2:14-15, 17, 20, 24, 26-28.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The antidotes used by Peter in dealing with the apostasy are the provision of life and the revelation of truth 2 Pet 1:3-21: In verses 3 through 11 Peter used the provision of the divine life for the proper Christian life to inoculate against the apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verses 12 through 21 he used the revelation of the divine truth to inoculate against the heresy in the apostasy 2:1, footnote 3.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The present truth is the truth that is present with the believers, which they have already received and now possess 1:12: We need to know the present, up-to-date truth and to uphold the absoluteness of the truth John 18:37.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to be clear whether a particular matter is an item of the truth 8:32: Is calling on the name of the Lord a truth?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No, it is not a truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Calling on the Lord is necessary, and we need to have such a practice in our daily life, but calling on the Lord s name is not a truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Likewise, baptism, presbytery, foot-washing, and pray-reading are not truths Life-study of Ezra, p.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>33 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Justification by faith is a truth.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>33 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because many basic truths have been given up, even by those who apparently are fundamental believers, there is the need for us in the Lord s recovery to fight the battle for the truth 1 Tim 6:12, 20-21.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today, in a time of apostasy, we need to testify the full revelation of the pure Word of God and to fight for the deeper truths revealed in the Word of God, including: The revelation concerning the eternal economy of God Eph 1:10; 3:9.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The revelation concerning the Divine Trinity 2 Cor 13:14; Rev 1:4-5.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to know and testify the highest truth: In Christ God became man to make man God in life, nature, constitution, and expression but not in the Godhead so that the redeeming God and the redeemed man can be united, mingled, and incorporated together to become one entity the New Jerusalem John 1:12-14; 14:20; Rev 21:2, 10-11.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way of the truth is the path of the Christian life according to the truth, which is the reality of the contents of the New Testament 2 Pet 2:2: The way of the truth is the straight way; to take the straight way is to live an upright life without crookedness and bias v. 15.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The way of the truth is the way of righteousness; to take the way of righteousness is to live a life that is right with both God and man, a life which, according to God s righteousness, can receive God s governmental judgment for His kingdom of righteousness vv.</S>
