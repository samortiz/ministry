MAN HAVING THREE LIVES</h2><p>In order to learn more about the divine life and its experiences, we must understand the three lives in man. Man is very complex. Animals only have one life, but we have three. This is strong proof that man is not an animal. Man has three parts—body, soul and spirit. Each of these three parts has a corresponding life.<h2 class=head2>A. The Created Life of Man in the Soul</h2><p>The life in man’s soul is the created human life. It was put into man during man’s creation by God. [When God formed man of the dust of the ground, He breathed into him the breath of life, and “man became a living soul’’ (Gen. 2:7). This means that the human life obtained through creation is in man’s soul.]<p>There are three parts to the soul. The mind is the organ for thinking. The emotion is the organ for love and hatred. The will is the organ for making decisions. The soul is created by God to express God.
