   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RESURRECTING AND BECOMING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT TO BE OUR SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After three days in the grave, the Lord Jesus resurrected very early on the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He overcame the power of death and came out of the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through such a resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit to enter into us to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was the Redeemer until the time of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He made redemption for our sins through His death and accomplished the redemptive work for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, after the fall man did not just have a problem in position, a problem in legal procedure, or a problem of having a record of sins before God; man also had a problem within him in that now Satan s life had entered into him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though a person has been redeemed and saved by believing in the Lord, he has not yet been fully saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He still needs to be saved daily from his sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus precious blood is for clearing our record of sins and redeeming us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be sure, because of His death and the blood shed by Him we have been redeemed, and we will never perish.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, sin still dwells in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Within us we have a great deal of unclean and unrighteous thoughts, and in our outward actions we constantly have trespasses and defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, we still need to be washed by the Lord s precious blood and, at the same time, we also need to be saved by the Lord as the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First John 1:2 and 3 says that the eternal life has been reported to us and that we have enjoyed fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, this fellowship can be interrupted because of our sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we say that after we have believed in the Lord that sin is no longer in us and the root of sin has been eradicated, this is a great error.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should know that after we have believed in the Lord, our sinful nature is still in our flesh and has not been eradicated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It will not be until the time of our rapture, at the redemption of our body, that we can say that our whole being has been fully saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, today this sinful nature is still within us; if we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>MAN S DUAL NEED</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before God, man not only has the problem of the record of sins and the problem of position, but man also has the problem of the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To illustrate, before a mother leaves the house, she may repeatedly warn her child, saying, After I leave, do not drink from that bottle because it contains poison; you will be poisoned if you drink it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even though the mother repeatedly urges the child in this way, he still may take the bottle and drink from it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In doing this, he sins against his mother, so he may come to the mother to confess his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The mother can say, I forgive you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Don t do that again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, even though the case is dealt with, the poison remains inside the child.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not sufficient for a man only to have the outward redemption of sins; he still has the problem of the sinful nature within him; he still has the sinning life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, he needs to be saved in life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not a matter of being redeemed by the precious blood but a matter of being saved in life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, man has a twofold need.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the one hand, there is the outward problem related to position, the law, and the record; for this, man needs redemption by the precious blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the other hand, there is the inward problem related to the old life and sinful nature; for this man needs to have another life, a transcendent life, to come into him to save him that he may be delivered from the fallen life which he had from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since man has this dual need, after the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption by His death, He resurrected from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit as the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Romans 5:10 says, We, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that when we had a record of sins, we were reconciled to God through the redemptive death of the Lord Jesus on the cross, the death in which He shed His blood for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, the record of our sins was cleared, and we were redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the redemptive aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then Paul went on to say, Much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the saving aspect.</S>
