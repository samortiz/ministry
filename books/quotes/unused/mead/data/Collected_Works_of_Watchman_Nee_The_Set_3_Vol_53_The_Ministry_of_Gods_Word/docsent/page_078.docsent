   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEMORY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First, our spirit sees something; second, our thoughts capture it; and third, we have a word within us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is contained in this word?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This word contains thoughts, and it also contains light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God gives us a sentence or two.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These sentences contain thoughts as well as light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What should we pay attention to before God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should know what the word of revelation is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A revelation is a seeing, a removal of the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The light shines through, and we see what is beyond the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Initially, we see what is beyond the veil, even though we cannot articulate it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This light appears to us like the flashing of a camera.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God then gives us thoughts to capture the light; the light is converted into the thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Finally, He gives us a word or two which encompass the entire revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One word from God unlocks all the significance behind the light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can say that the word of revelation is a word of "seeing."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can say that it is a word, yet this word is an inner seeing, an inner revelation; it is not merely a word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When this word is in us, it is, at the same time, a "seeing."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When it is in us as light, we do not understand what it means.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When it is converted into thoughts, we can see its meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When it becomes a word, we can grasp it in our thoughts as well as utter it in our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is the word?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word is a revelation that has become articulated thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A word does not mean just a word alone; it is not just three, five, eight, or ten sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is something within us, an utterance of what we see.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Originally, seeing is a function of the eyes; it has nothing to do with the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But when God gives me a word, the word includes light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I can be very clear within, but I cannot articulate what I see.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today the word enables me to articulate what I see.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we have to be clear that the word is not just one or two sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It embodies a seeing, and it is an articulation of our seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we have both the word and the seeing within us, we can call the word our own.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God first shows us something in a clear way, and then He gives us a word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word explains what we see.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The word can only be retained in the memory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have two kinds of memory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One is a faculty which retains the word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The other is a faculty which retains the seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One retains the word; this is the outward memory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The other retains the seeing; this is the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The problem today is that our outward memory often functions to remember the word, but the Spirit's memory is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We do not remember the seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We remember the few words, but we forget the seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is where the problem lies with revelation: It is not like doctrines which can be memorized word for word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is nothing more to doctrines than simple recitation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Doctrines remain in the outside realm, but the ministry of the word touches life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more doctrinal something is, the easier it is to remember; it can be repeated easily word for word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, the inward vision is related to life, and the more something is related to life, the easier it is to forget.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One can remember the words verbatim but lose the vision of the thing behind the words.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is what happens when the memory of the Holy Spirit is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must bear in mind that the word that God has given us must be nurtured in the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only then will the word remain living.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once the word is separated from the memory of the Spirit, it becomes something physical and is no longer spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is very easy for a spiritual thing to turn into a physical thing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is very easy for the inner word to degenerate into something dead and outward.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is very easy for a spiritual word to degenerate into something outward and physical.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Spiritual words must be kept alive in the Holy Spirit before they can have an effect on us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Words of revelation must be kept alive in the Holy Spirit before we can derive benefit from them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If a word of revelation is not nurtured in the Holy Spirit, a person can remember the words without remembering the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For example, we all know that sin is ugly and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some see this the day they become a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Others see this at the time of their revival.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some see the evil of sin the day they hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Others, who were given to a dissipated living, do not see the evil of sin until three to five years after their salvation, when they experience a great revival of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Once, a brother became conscious of his sins and was very sad.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He prostrated himself and rolled on the ground from eight o'clock in the evening until the next morning.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The rest of the people had left the meeting, but he was still rolling on the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It looked as if he had touched the gates of hell, and he was crying, "Even hell is not big enough to swallow my sins."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>That day the Lord opened his eyes to something; he saw something in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Afterwards, he related what he had seen in his spirit to others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He told them about the evil and abomination of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Another brother testified that when this one talked about sin, others could feel sin like a thick, black cloud overshadowing them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In his consciousness sin was a thick, black cloud; nothing could be worse than it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When he spoke and articulated the inward revelation, others received the help.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But after two or three years, the vision became blurred.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He could still say that sin was like a thick, black cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When he stood up, he could say the same words, but the picture was gone; the revelation of the Spirit was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The revelation was no longer as clear and strong in him as before.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Formerly, he would be in tears when he spoke about the blackness of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But when he spoke about its blackness now, he could laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The taste had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The words were the same, but the memory of the Holy Spirit was gone.</S>
