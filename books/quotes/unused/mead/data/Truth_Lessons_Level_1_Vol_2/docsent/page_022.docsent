   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Accomplished by Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The new covenant was accomplished by Jesus Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross and shed the precious blood, He made the way for God to enact a new covenant with us Matt 26:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Unlike the old covenant which was ordained in the hand of Moses, the new covenant was accomplished by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, God s beloved Son.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Established with the Blood of Jesus,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>the Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After eating the Passover with the disciples, the Lord established His table with the bread and the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He took the cup, saying, This cup is the new covenant in My blood Luke 22:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The new covenant was established with the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First John 1:7 also says that the blood of Jesus, the Son of God, cleanses us from all sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because His blood satisfied the requirement of God s righteousness, it opened the way for God to enact a new covenant with us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the new covenant was enacted through the blood of Jesus, the Son of God; it is not like the old covenant which was enacted with the blood of bulls and goats.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Based upon Grace,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Which Gives Life, as Its Condition</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now that we are in the new covenant, we are not under the law but under grace Rom 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Grace is the Triune God processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to become everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is our redemption, salvation, life, and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The new covenant is based upon grace, which gives life, as its condition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that in the new covenant the processed Triune God intends to be our all.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the new covenant does not require man to keep the law; rather, it deals with man according to grace, which is God as everything to man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Requiring Man Only to Believe, Not to Work</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Romans 11:6 says, But if by grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whereas the law is altogether out of works, grace is absolutely not of works.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Anything that is out of works is not grace but law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 3:15 says, That everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, the New Testament shows us very clearly that God does not require man to work; God requires man only to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the New Testament age, the unique cause of God s judgment on man is man s unbelief, his not believing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God John 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the New Testament, the meaning of the word faith has two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Objectively, faith is what we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Subjectively, faith is our believing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, faith denotes both the act of believing and that in which we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The things in which we believe include God s sending His Son into the world, the Son s human living, His death on the cross to accomplish redemption, His burial, His resurrection, His becoming the life-giving Spirit, His ascension, and His pouring out of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we hear of all these divine matters, we will be stirred up and filled with appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is our faith and this is our believing act.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the new covenant man only needs to have such a faith; man does not need to strive to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Applying to the New Testament Age and Eternity</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The new covenant was established when the Lord Jesus died on the cross and shed His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, to those who believe in Him, that was the beginning of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But as far as the Israelites are concerned, the prophecy in Jeremiah 31 will not be fulfilled until Christ s second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The new covenant will be applied unto eternity, because it is an eternal covenant Heb 13:20 .</S>
