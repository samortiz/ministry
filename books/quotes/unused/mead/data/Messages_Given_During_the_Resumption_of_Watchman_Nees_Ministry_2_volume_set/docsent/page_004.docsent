   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE MERCY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:September 5, 1947</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Foochow, Fukien</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>EVERYTHING DEPENDING ON THE MERCY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we read Romans 9, we have to pay attention both to its principle and to its application as well.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This chapter reveals the principle that everything depends on God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The apostle applied this principle to the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He showed us that everything that happened to the Israelites was of God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today, not only do we need to pay attention to the application, but we need to pay attention also to the principle behind the application.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here it says that "it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy" Rom 9:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Zeal and pursuit are of no use.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Neither will the absence of zeal and pursuit be of any use.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To wait too long, not to wait long enough, to be too quick, or to be too slow none of these is of any use.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be in one place or another, to hear much or to hear little none of these is of any use either.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everything depends on the mercy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only the Holy Spirit is able to lead men to a proper standing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There must be at least one time that a person sees God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning this matter, your eyes must be opened at least once.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of course, it is good if your eyes can be opened more than once.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But there must at least be one time when you see that everything depends on God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whether you see this matter all at once, or you realize it through a process, the minute you touch this matter, you touch a fact not a feeling, but a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This fact is that everything depends on God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's mercy is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A fact is not dependent on feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Take the matter of regeneration as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We often tell sinners that they must have a one-time definite experience of repentance and believing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To the believers, we say that they must have a one-time definite consecration of themselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In principle, it is the same with regard to man's understanding of God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There must be at least one time when a person definitely touches God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE NEED TO DEAL WITH</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE MIND, THE EMOTION, AND THE WILL</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BEING TEMPERED UNDER</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Three kinds of people need God's dealings: those who are strong in their will, those who are strong in their emotion, and those who are strong in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many people are controlled by these three kinds of conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These three things must experience God's breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God deals with man's strong points more than He deals with his weak points.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many times, man's strong points hinder him from spiritual progress, more so than his weak points.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Unless a man is dealt with in these three areas, he cannot know God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After a man has been dealt with by God, he will be tempered in his spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In many things, it is inappropriate either to be too much or to be too little.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some people wait for too long, while others do not wait long enough.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All these require tempering.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some people are not strong enough in their inner man; their outer man is too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is like a man's head taking up one-fourth of his body or one-sixteenth of his body; neither is proportionate.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The right proportion should be one-seventh of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some people are too strong in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Others are too strong in their emotion or their will.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Their inner man is not strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These conditions require tempering.</S>
