         <h2 class="head1">THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE</h2>
<p>In Matthew 19 the Lord Jesus illustrated how difficult it is for us to enter into the kingdom (v. 24). He said that it was even more difficult than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. Humanly speaking, no one can enter into the kingdom. As far as we are concerned, it is impossible. But what is impossible with men is possible with God. God has the way for us to enter into the kingdom. His way is not to enlarge the eye of the needle and make it a wide gate so that even a heavily laden camel can get through. Rather, His way is to reduce the size of the camel until it is thin enough to pass through the eye of the needle. It is possible for thin thread to pass through the eye of the needle.</p>
<p>In order for us to pass through the eye of the needle, the Lord must make us as thin as thread. By nature, we are camels. But God has a way to spin us into thin thread. Although I have been a Christian for more than fifty years, I am still in the eye of the needle. Sometimes I have cried out, &ldquo;Lord, I cannot tolerate Your spinning any longer.&rdquo; But the Lord said, &ldquo;Be patient, for I am helping you. You are still too thick. I am spinning you to make you thinner.&rdquo; There were times when I wanted to be cut off from this spinning process. But at those times the Lord said to me, &ldquo;It is not up to you. You may want to be cut off, but what will you use to do the cutting? The scissors are not in your hands. I shall neither drop you nor cut you off. Rather, I shall keep on spinning you.&rdquo; This is the exercise of the kingdom today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Many years ago we received help regarding this matter of the kingdom. Because we were helped by this, we ministered it to others. There were various reactions to what we ministered concerning the exercise and reward of the kingdom. Some said that it was Hinduism and others that it was similar to the Catholic teaching of purgatory. But this is not Hinduism, purgatory, or any form of asceticism. It is the experience of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MIND OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Philippians 2:5 says, &ldquo;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; The mind of Christ needs to become our mind. After Paul tells us that we need to let the mind of Christ become ours, he speaks of how the Lord Jesus was willing to become small and lowly. This is what we mean by spinning. The heavenly, divine spinning brought Christ down from the heavens to the earth. It caused the great Christ to become less than the lowest and smallest. Christ has been spun. He was willing to be spun in this way, for His mind was that kind of mind.</p>
<p>We need to consider the context behind Paul&rsquo;s word to the Philippians regarding the mind of Christ. To a certain degree at least, the believers at Philippi were not in the kingdom. In their thinking they were regarding themselves as better and higher than others. That was an indication that they did not have the mind of Christ. Thus, the Apostle Paul told them that they needed to allow the mind of Christ to become their mind. He pointed out that although Christ was so high and great, He was willing to become lowly and even to be put to death on the cross. When Christ was crucified, He was made nothing. The enemy even challenged Him to come down from the cross. Those who mocked Him said that if He would come down from the cross, they would believe in Him. What a devilish challenge that was! Instead of coming down from the cross, Christ remained there for at least six hours to be nothing. He did not say one word to vindicate Himself. This is the mind of Christ, the only mind good for the building of the church. Only when we have such a mind are we qualified for the building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WILLING TO BECOME NOTHING</h2>
<p>If we see this vision and compare it with the situation among the Christians today, we shall realize that the building up of the church is a human impossibility. Perhaps you will say, &ldquo;Lord, when You were on earth, You said that You would build Your church. But nearly two thousand years have passed and still we do not see the building. Lord, where is Your building?&rdquo; If we speak to the Lord like this, He may reply, &ldquo;You do not see the building because so few have been willing to care for the exercise of the kingdom.&rdquo; We all love the Lord and the church. But the question is whether or not we are willing to become nothing. As we all know, our spirit is the very depth of our being. To be poor in this part of our being means to realize that we are nothing. Are you willing to be nothing?</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
