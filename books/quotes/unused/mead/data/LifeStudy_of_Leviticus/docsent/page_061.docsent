   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEALING WITH LEAVEN THE SINFUL AND NEGATIVE THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have pointed out that in the meal offering there is neither leaven nor honey.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1 Corinthians both leaven the sinful and negative things and honey the natural life are dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 5:6b-8 we have the dealing with leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For indeed our Passover, Christ, has been sacrificed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us therefore keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and evil, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here we see that leaven is not tolerated in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>DEALING WITH HONEY THE NATURAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians 15:10 indicates that in Paul's experience the honey, the natural life, was dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Recall that in this verse he says, "I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul's labor was not by the I, not by the natural life, not by honey.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul certainly was not a person with a weak character.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before he was saved he was very strong in character, taking the lead to persecute the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But after he was saved, he was made an apostle and he labored more than the other apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, his labor was not in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the church life the natural life and the natural affection should be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that there should be no honey in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all like to be natural and live a natural life, but in the church life the natural life is not permitted.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It must be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The honey of the natural life must be killed by the salt, by the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not put any leaven or honey in the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that in the church life we should not have the negative things or the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>ONE BREAD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church life is a corporate meal offering signified by the one bread in 10:17.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Seeing that we who are many are one bread, one Body; for we all partake of the one bread."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This bread, or cake, signifies the corporate life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We enjoy this corporate life when we partake of the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you take the bread and the cup by yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Of course not!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You partake of the bread and the cup with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a matter of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the reason 10:16 says, "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a fellowship of the blood of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The bread which we break, is it not a fellowship of the body of Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because this is a matter of fellowship, we partake of the bread and of the cup in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This corporate partaking is a sign of the church life; it is also a testimony of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the points covered in 1 Corinthians are related to the church life, to the corporate life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to this book, for this corporate life we need to be a man who is oiled with the Holy Spirit, who lives a life under the cross with the resurrection of Christ as the frankincense, and who does not have leaven or honey.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the church life as a meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The whole church life is a meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this meal offering the top portion is for God's enjoyment, and the remainder is for us to take as our daily food in our service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We, therefore, are a meal offering as food for God's satisfaction and for the nourishment of others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God wants to have a meal offering in every locality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He desires that every local church be a meal offering that satisfies Him and that fully supplies the saints day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our hunger is satisfied not only by Christ but also by the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church life satisfies us because the church life is a corporate meal offering, with the top portion for God and the remainder for us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, we are fed by and with the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church life is the meal offering to be our daily supply.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hallelujah for the meal offering church life!</S>
