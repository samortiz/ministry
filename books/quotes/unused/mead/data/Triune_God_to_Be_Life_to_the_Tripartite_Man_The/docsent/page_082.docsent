   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING THE VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ASPECTS OF THE DIVINE FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The reality of the divine fellowship is one of the most neglected things among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is hard to find many who are in the reality of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Positionally, we all are in this fellowship, but in our daily living, very few of us are in the reality of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may have the matter of fellowship in name, but we may not have it in practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have tried to practice this fellowship, but I have to admit that I have not been completely successful in maintaining this fellowship hour after hour throughout the day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we are not in this fellowship in a practical way, we are out of the Spirit, out of the Triune God, and out of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before we were saved, we were sinners living in sin and dead in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We were not involved in the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One day someone reported to us the eternal life 1 John 1:2 , and we believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From that moment we were brought into the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Two things are very striking about our initial experience of the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, it is difficult to find one person who believed in the Lord directly by himself without the help of someone who preached the gospel to him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nearly everyone heard a report first and then believed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second, there is almost always a deep relationship between the one who reported or preached the gospel and the one who received the report and got saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many years ago in mainland China, I preached the gospel a number of times to large congregations, and many people were saved through me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because I preached the gospel to them and they were saved through my preaching, many of them felt intimately related to me, even though I never talked with them personally.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My point in relating this experience is that there is almost always an intimate feeling between the person who gets saved and the one through whom he gets saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I cannot forget the female evangelist through whom I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She will always be so dear and precious to me because through her I was brought into the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Her preaching of the gospel to me was related to the horizontal aspect of the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After receiving her word, I went to the Lord and was brought into the vertical aspect of the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>OF THE DIVINE FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is a close relationship between the vertical and horizontal aspects of the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our vertical fellowship with the Lord is affected by our horizontal fellowship with others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not have a proper relationship with those around us, it is difficult to have a good fellowship with the Lord vertically.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The reason for this is that the divine fellowship is one fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Each day we should be in the divine fellowship, vertically and horizontally.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Most of us may think that we daily start this fellowship according to its vertical aspect, followed by its horizontal aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Most of the time, however, this is not our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since most of us have spouses, other family members, or roommates living with us, our fellowship usually begins in a horizontal manner.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we have a quarrel with our wife, husband, or roommate in the evening, we will find it difficult to start our vertical fellowship with the Lord in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must maintain both the vertical and horizontal aspects of the fellowship in order to be healthy spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Ephesians 4:25 the apostle Paul said, "Wherefore, having put off the falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbor, for we are members one of another."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this verse the word neighbor refers to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must be right with our fellow believers in order to be kept in the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In our experience we often cannot have vertical fellowship with the Lord without first having horizontal fellowship with other believers.</S>
