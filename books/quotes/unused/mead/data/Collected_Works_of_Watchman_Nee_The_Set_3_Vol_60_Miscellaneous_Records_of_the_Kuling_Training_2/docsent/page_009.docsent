   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION 6 Date: August 20, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Kuling DEALING WITH IDLE TALK</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: In the course of our work, what should we do when we encounter idle talk?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: One basic training a worker of the Lord must go through is to ignore idle talk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those who like to listen to idle talk or who are keen to hunt for idle talk are not qualified for God's work or for the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Their mind and mental energy are wasted on inconsequential things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is no surprise that they are not able to focus themselves on their ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Listening to idle talk is one of the worst habits in the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ephesians was written by Paul, a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is absolutely God's word, and its revelation is very high indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul could be so free, uninhibited, and released in that Epistle because God's word was so heartily received in the church in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In contrast with the book of Ephesians, we have the Epistles to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They were written by Paul also, and they are also God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet they do not reach the same height as the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is because Paul had to deal with so many low things in the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that when we pay attention to the low things, God cannot show us the high things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we have to set our eyes on the high and great things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When our spirit and words are released, they will be high and great.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The spirit discerns all things and knows all things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are new to a local church, we may not know anything about the place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet our spirit can still sense the condition in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to serve by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The spirit has to be the organ with which we contact others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must not merely exercise our ears to listen to others or to deal with people and events.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those whose ears are too open are surely loose and careless.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those whose mouth is too open are surely unbridled in their tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is, of course, different when God wants to direct our ears to hear something.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to learn from the pattern of the Lord Jesus, who was a "blind" and "deaf" servant Isa 42:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The most important thing a minister of the word has to remember is to not seek out gossip or encourage idle talk.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He should instead cultivate his spirit and serve by his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>AND THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Question: How can we exercise our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Answer: In exercising our spirit, we have to realize that the basic requirement is first to break down the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the only way the spirit within can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our need is to be torn down in a fundamental way, to be weakened, and to be broken in the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If our mind, emotion, and will are not broken, they will be released before the spirit is given the chance to be released, and we will never be able to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our spirit must be stronger than everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It has to become the strongest part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only after it has become the strongest part of our being will our mind, emotion, and will become useful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, some brothers are very eloquent, but they are not broken.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When they speak, only their eloquence comes out; their spirit does not have a chance to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Why does God not break the mind or emotion of some people?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The answer involves the matter of proportion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God breaks and deals with the conspicuous parts that come out of a person first.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the part that comes out first is the emotion, God will deal with the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the part that comes out first is the mind, He will break the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He breaks and deals with the parts that come out first.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After He has done this, the spirit gains the preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a man has a very strong spirit, and his emotion is behind his spirit, this emotion can be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a man does not have a strong spirit, however, and his emotion is ahead of it, he will be in trouble; he will not be able to use his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a man is not broken, it is easy for his outer man to clash with others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If his outer man is broken, it will be easy for him to be one with others in spirit, and spontaneously this will eliminate any conflict.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once a man manifests a strong spot in any area, his spirit is hampered.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, strong spots must be broken before a man can release his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we cannot release our spirit, we cannot serve.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the reason we do not admire the gifted or eloquent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Rather, we admire those who are in God's hand, who have passed through His chastisement, and who bear the mark of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only they give prominence to their spirit when they function, and only they are useful in the eyes of God.</S>
