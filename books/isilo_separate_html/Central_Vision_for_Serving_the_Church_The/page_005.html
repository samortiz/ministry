DEPENDING ON THE LORD&rsquo;S MERCY</h2>
<p>Whether we see light and receive revelation depends on the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. Paul did not seek revelation or pray for light from heaven. He was headed in a different direction when the light came. I am not encouraging you to take a different direction. I only want you to know that seeing light and receiving revelation are fully dependent upon the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. Revelation depends on mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts&rdquo; (2 Cor. 4:6). God&rsquo;s shining is related to His mercy, not to our prayer. He will have mercy on whomever He wills to have mercy (Rom. 9:15, 18). Satan was able to use Paul, but God is able to say to Satan, &ldquo;Even though you have been using this man for decades, I will have mercy on him; I will choose him.&rdquo; Shining and revelation depend on the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. He will have mercy on whomever He will have mercy, and He will shine on whomever He will shine.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NO LONGER LIVING ACCORDING TO<br />
TRADITION OR KNOWLEDGE</h2>
<p>This does not mean that Paul no longer had any veils, but the New Testament certainly shows that he learned some serious lessons and no longer dared to serve according to tradition, knowledge, or his own opinion. From his Epistles we can see that he lived in the spirit after being shined upon by the Lord. Paul did not want tradition, knowledge, or his opinion; rather, he was a person in the spirit. In Ephesians 3:5 Paul says that he received revelation from God in spirit. God revealed the mystery of the gospel, the mystery of Christ, and the mystery of the church to him in his spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LACK OF LIGHT AND REVELATION<br />
BEING A RESULT OF LEAVING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We need revelation, light, the opening of our eyes, and the turning from darkness to light. I have a deep sense that the churches in the Far East lack revelation. Yes, there are doctrines. Yes, there are practices. But there is a lack of the spirit and a lack of revelation. Consequently, darkness is falling upon the churches. We are where we are today because we have strayed from the spirit. Once we leave the spirit, we fall into set ways according to what we previously learned. It is easy to follow a learned way, but without our spirit there will be no revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Laziness Being a Problem in Our Natural Disposition</h2>
<p>Laziness is a problem in the natural disposition of fallen human beings. I am certain that if Saul had been a lazy person who slept all day, God would never have shined on him. God shined on him in the midst of his diligent opposition to God. D. L. Moody was a powerful evangelist who led many to salvation, but he said, &ldquo;I have never heard of a lazy man being converted.&rdquo; It is difficult for lazy persons to be saved. This is not because God has no desire to save them, but because they are too lazy to receive His salvation.</p>
<p>Some local churches lose revelation and are without light because of laziness. Other local churches are blessed by God because they are not loose or lazy. In the United States some churches begin the bread-breaking meeting at 7:30 P.M., but many brothers and sisters arrive at a quarter to seven and begin to praise. Some even come at six o&rsquo;clock to arrange and neatly line up the chairs. This shows that they take these matters seriously.</p>
<p>I am speaking of practical matters only to point out their relationship to our heart. If the responsible brothers, who take the lead to break bread, do not dress neatly and do not even button their shirts properly, how can we believe that there is any light in the church there? The brothers and sisters should do things in the church in a proper manner. If some practical things cannot be done properly, then they should not be done at all. A loose person should not take the lead in a church, and the meetings should not be entrusted to such a one. If a bread-breaking meeting begins at 7:30, the seats should be ready before 6:30. The serving ones should take care of the number and the arrangement of the chairs for the convenience of the saints.</p>
<p>In January 1950 Brother Nee went from mainland China to Hong Kong and brought in a revival there. However, since he could not stay in Hong Kong, he asked me to come to Hong Kong to see him. The morning after I arrived, he took me to the elders and co-workers&rsquo; service meeting. There he publicly stated that he wanted me to arrange the matters of service in the church in Hong Kong, including the service of the co-workers, elders, and deacons. I then began to arrange the elders&rsquo; office and the business office and to lead the elders and the deacons in their service. I began by considering the furnishings of the meeting hall and found that many things were old and worn out. It seemed as if the saints&rsquo; homes were furnished better than the meeting hall. The paintings on the meeting hall walls were worn and dusty. The organ was in such poor condition that no one would have taken it if it were left on the street. The doorbell of the meeting hall was not electric; it had only a crude lead string. When someone pulled the string, clanging sounds would go off inside the meeting hall. All the saints had electric doorbells at home, but the doorbell of the meeting hall was made of string. These furnishings were unfit for a city like Hong Kong. I spoke to the brothers and sisters and said that if the condition of the meeting hall was a reflection of our service, we might as well close the meeting hall, go home, and sleep. I am thankful to the Lord that the brothers and sisters had the grace to take this fellowship, and the appearance of the meeting hall changed the next day. This happened on February 20, 1950.</p>
<p>My point is not that we would focus on physical things but that we would take our participation in our service to God seriously. We should offer up not only ourselves but also our lives. If we pray for &ldquo;rain from heaven,&rdquo; we should also prepare vessels to hold the rain. If we do not prepare vessels, everything will leak away when the rain comes. The brothers and sisters have become loose after many years in the church life. Once looseness comes in, however, the blessing will be lost, and only problems will arise. Once there is looseness, restraint is cast off. Proverbs 29:18 says, &ldquo;Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint.&rdquo; People who are lazy cast off restraint; they become loose and incapable of doing anything. From what I hear now, some places are in an unrestrained and shameful condition. When there is no vision or light, people become loose and unrestrained, and they fall into all kinds of corrupt situations. Casting off restraint is an indication that there is no light.</p>
<p>Our idle words and gossip are shameful, and they cause us to lose light and revelation. If, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we are willing to restrain ourselves and live in the spirit, we will receive revelation every day. Revelation is not in our mind but in our spirit. Since the Lord is in our spirit, we must be in our spirit in order to receive revelation.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
