<h2 class="head1">BEING ONE WITH THE MINISTRY</h2>
<p>I received a long letter of twenty-seven pages on the morning of our final day of fellowship in this elders&rsquo; training. The first page is the contents of the letter and all the rest of the twenty-six pages are signatures. All of the signatures are designated from the different churches. After reading the contents, I am so grateful to the four hundred and nineteen brothers who signed it. The contents of this letter follow along with my letter of response to the brothers who signed it.</p>
