   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To say "Amen" in response to others' prayer is a practice taught by Paul in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 14:16 Paul said that we need to pray in such a way that others can say "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If there are no Amens to indicate our one accord, we should not expect that our prayer will be heard.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If only two on earth pray in one accord, their prayer will be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The one accord is the practice, the application, of the oneness, and the oneness is the basis on which we practice the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a church meeting there may be people of different races and colors.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our one accord could never be based on the different races and colors.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We practice one accord based on the fact that we all have a common life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may be different in race and in the color of our skin, but when we come together to pray, we must forget about the different races and colors.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do have a base for our oneness; thus, we can practice the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not only so, if we do not have the same understanding, the same intention, the same purpose, the same goal, it will be impossible to pray together in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There will be no base for such prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we each have our own opinion, our own intention, and our own goal, there will be no base on which we can pray in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when we who are saved and who love the Lord and mean business for the Lord's purpose come together, we surely have the base to pray in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed for the oneness of His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That oneness was only in His aspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A little more than fifty days later, on the day of Pentecost, the oneness in the Lord's aspiration was accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The oneness in the Lord's aspiration became the oneness in actuality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This oneness is called "the oneness of the Spirit" Eph 4:3 , the Spirit here being the consummated Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, as the consummation of the entire Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We, the saved ones, possess this oneness as our heritage.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We possess this oneness, we enjoy it, and we apply it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To apply this oneness is to keep it, and to keep it is to practice one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If in our Christian life and our church life we do not practice one accord, we conduct ourselves as if we are unlearned people who do not know that there is such a thing as the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose you have one billion dollars in your checking account.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you never write checks, it will seem as if you do not have a checking account at all, or that your account has a zero balance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Your writing of checks is the practice of your realization that there is one billion dollars in your checking account.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The one billion dollars in your checking account is your possession.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may liken the oneness of the Spirit to a one billion dollar deposit in our heavenly bank account.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, every day and in every meeting we need to "write checks"; that is, we need to exercise to apply the oneness of the Spirit to the present situation.</S>
