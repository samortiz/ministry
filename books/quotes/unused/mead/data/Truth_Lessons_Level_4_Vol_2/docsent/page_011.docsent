   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING REUBEN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jacob first prophesied concerning his eldest son, Reuben.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 3 Jacob said, Reuben, you are my firstborn, / My might and the firstfruits of my vigor, / Preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, because Reuben was corrupted and defiled, in his prophecy with blessing Jacob specifically changed Reuben s status by birth as the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. Not Having Preeminence</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because Reuben was boiling over with lust, he went up to his father s bed and defiled his father s couch.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, Jacob said that he would not have the preeminence v. 4 . The preeminence of Reuben s birthright was taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. The Birthright Being Given to Joseph</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before Jacob prophesied concerning Reuben in Genesis 49, he had already given the birthright to Joseph 48:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 5 Jacob said to Joseph, Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>C. The Double Portion of the Land</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Being Given to Joseph, the Kingship to Judah, and the Priesthood to Levi</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The birthright is composed of the double portion of the land, the kingship, and the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the firstborn, Reuben should have inherited all three blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, due to his defilement, the double portion of the land was given to Joseph 48:22; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Josh 16 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Genesis 48:22 Jacob said to Joseph, I have given to you one portion more than your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Joseph received the double portion of the land, one for Ephraim and the other for Manasseh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, this prophecy was fulfilled in Joshua 16 and 17.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the children of Israel divided the land by lot, Joseph, who fled from the defilement of lust Gen 39:7-12 , received the double portion of the land; but Reuben, who indulged in the defilement of lust, lost the right to the double portion of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This allotment was not accomplished through human maneuvering but through the sovereignty of God for the fulfillment of Jacob s prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moreover, the kingship of Reuben s original birthright was given to Judah 1 Chron 5:2 , and the priesthood was given to Levi Deut 33:8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>CONCERNING SIMEON AND LEVI A. Receiving No Blessing because of Their Cruelty but Being Cursed Instead</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jacob considered Simeon and Levi as companions when he spoke concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jacob said, Simeon and Levi are brothers; / Weapons of violence are their swords.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>/ Come not into their council, O my soul; / Be not united with their assembly, O my glory; / For in their anger they slew men, / And in their self-will they hamstrung oxen Gen 49:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Glory in verse 6 refers to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jacob was greatly shocked by what Simeon and Levi did in Genesis 34.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jacob had never been so frightened in his whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Simeon s and Levi s disposition left a deep impression in Jacob s spirit that he could not forget.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, although Jacob loved them, he could not give them any blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, he cursed their fierce anger and cruel wrath 49:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>B. Being Scattered in Israel</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jacob was frightened by Simeon s and Levi s cruel disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, Jacob would not allow them to dwell together.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, he exercised judgment over them in his prophecy, dividing them in Jacob and scattering them in Israel v. 7 . In this way, they would not be able to behave cruelly according to their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the record in Joshua, Simeon was eventually scattered among the people of Judah 19:1, 9 , and Levi was scattered among the people of Israel ch.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>C. The Scattering of Levi</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Becoming a Blessing to the Children of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although Jacob prophesied that Levi would be scattered in Israel, the descendants of Levi were blessed because of Levi s faithfulness and absoluteness to God Exo 32:26-28 , and their scattering also became a blessing to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Numbers 35:2 Jehovah said to Moses, Command the children of Israel to give to the Levites some of the inheritance of their possession, cities to dwell in; and you shall give to the Levites pasture lands around their cities.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The selection of these cities was by lot.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Altogether, the Levites were given forty-eight cities v. 6 . Under God s sovereignty, out of these forty-eight cities six were to be cities of refuge Josh 20:7-9 . Three were on the east side of the Jordan, and three were on the west side.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Anyone among the people of Israel who killed a person by mistake could easily flee to one of these cities of refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, the scattering of Levi according to the curse became a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The scattered Levites brought God s refuge to people who sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, in ancient times it was a blessing to have some Levites in your city or in your territory Judg.</S>
