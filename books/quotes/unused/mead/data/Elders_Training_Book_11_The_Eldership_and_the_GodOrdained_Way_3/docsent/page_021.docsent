   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AVOIDING SUPERIORITY COMPLEX, ARGUMENT, OFFENSE, OR ANY FORM OF HUMILIATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In contacting people, the elders must avoid superiority complex, argument, offense, or any form of humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A superiority complex is very common in human society.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everyone has his prestige and desires to show that he excels in certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>People like to show their superiority, but the elders should not have a superiority complex.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>An elder may be fifty-five years old, and the one he contacts may be only fifteen, but the elder should not care for his status.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He should be careful in the way he expresses himself when he speaks with this person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The elder should not feel that he is better or higher than the one with whom he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In contacting people, the elders should avoid arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Arguments do not help people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, the way to contact people is to try to find the opportunity to minister Christ to them, to give them an "injection" of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The elders should also avoid offense in their contact with others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whether one comes to us with a good intention or an intention to cause trouble is not our concern.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On our side, we should still be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are not proper with those whom we contact, we will offend them and cause them to close their heart to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once people are offended, there is no way for us to minister anything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is also possible that the offended persons will remember the offense for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The elders must also avoid any form of humiliation in their contact with people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>ALWAYS REMEMBERING WELL THAT THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>IS NOT A POLICE STATION OR A LAW COURT, AND</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THAT WE ARE NOT THE POLICEMEN OR THE JUDGES</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In their contact with people, the elders must always remember well that the church is not a police station or a law court, and that they are not the policemen or the judges.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A policeman arrests people and a judge judges them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not "arrest" or judge anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should only minister life, the gospel, salvation, and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Regardless of what one has done, if he comes to us, we should take the opportunity to minister something of life into him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not catch him that we might "arrest" him and pass him on to others who may judge him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the leading ones, the elders bear a certain responsibility to consider people's situations, but they must not forget that their ministry is to minister life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we know someone's background, we should not go to others to talk about him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should go to him, not to talk about what he has done, but to take the opportunity to minister life and light into him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then he may be enlightened by the Lord, and when he gets home, he may repent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the way for the elders to take care of the people in the church.</S>
