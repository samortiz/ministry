Although the kingdom occupies a very crucial position in the Bible many Christians have not understood it properly accurately or adequately
The messages in this book, given in a conference in 1972 in Los Angeles, present mainly the life side of the kingdom
According to Genesis 1, God created man in His own image and gave man His authority to rule over all the created things
Man is in the image of God in order to express God, and he has received God's authority in order to represent God
In the first two chapters of Genesis, there is not only image and authority, but also life, signified by the tree of life
In the beginning of the prayer He says, 'Let Your kingdom come,' and at the end of the prayer He says, 'For Yours is the kingdom'
In the New Testament, when John the Baptist came preaching, his first words were, 'Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
When the Lord Jesus went out to preach, He said the same thing: 'Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
The Apostle Paul spent three months in the synagogue at Ephesus disputing and persuading concerning the kingdom of God
Although the kingdom is covered throughout the New Testament, most Christians have not seen it in an adequate way
Most books on this matter of the kingdom say that the kingdom is simply a dispensation or that it is a sphere, a realm, in which God rules
We need to see the matter of the kingdom because it is very much related to the inner life and also to the church life
If we would realize and experience the proper church life, we have to see something concerning the kingdom of the heavens
Also, if we would experience the inner life in a practical way, we must know something of the kingdom of the heavens
The first preacher in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and the first word out of his mouth was, 'Repent for the kingdom'
Because He repeated the preaching of John the Baptist, we have a strong proof that the preaching of the kingdom was very important
Not only did the Lord Himself repeat and continue the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom, but He also charged His disciples to repeat it
John the Baptist preached the kingdom, the Lord Jesus preached the kingdom, and all His disciples were charged to preach the kingdom
Although many of you have read the book of Matthew several times, you may have never noticed the term the 'gospel of the kingdom'
The Lord has opened up this matter to us so that wherever we go with the recovery of the church, the gospel of the kingdom will be preached
Some may argue that the New Testament speaks of the gospel of life, the gospel of grace, and the gospel of salvation
The gospel of life is for the kingdom, the gospel of salvation is for the kingdom, and the gospel of forgiveness is for the kingdom
Since Mark is in many respects similar to Matthew and Luke, we may pass over it for now and come to the Gospel of John
Did the Lord Jesus say, 'Except ye be born of water and the Spirit ye can never see heaven or enter into heaven'?
Acts 1:3 says that the Lord Jesus spoke with His disciples concerning the kingdom for forty days following His resurrection
Romans 14:17 says, 'For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
The kingdom is not merely a dispensation or a sphere; the kingdom is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit
Also, both Galatians and Ephesians tell us the same thing that the kingdom in the Spirit is the proper church life
God has delivered us out of the kingdom of Satan and has 'transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love'
Perhaps you have heard that the church age is now and that the coming age, the millennium, will be the age of the kingdom
All things pertaining to life and godliness, even partaking of the divine nature, are for a rich entrance into the kingdom
It was not a pagan, heathen religion; it was a religion worshipping and serving God, a religion formed according to God's divine Word
If you had lived at the time of the Lord Jesus, would you have taken sides with the Lord Jesus or with Judaism?
Christianity is now five hundred years older than Judaism was during the time of the Lord Jesus and the Apostles
When the Lord Jesus said that the kingdom does not come with observation, He did not mean that the kingdom could not be realized
The Lord Jesus was in their midst as the kingdom, but they were unable to observe Him because they were using the wrong organ
Since the kingdom is the Lord Jesus, and He was present with the Pharisees, why did they ask Him, 'When shall the kingdom of God come'?
By their outward man and by their natural ability they were unable to observe that the Lord Jesus was the reality of the kingdom
If they had observed Him by the exercise of their spirit, this wonderful One would have come inside of them immediately
Whether the Lord Jesus was only in their midst or also inside of them depended on whether or not they exercised their spirit to observe Him
The Lord Jesus said that because He cast out demons by the power of the Spirit of God, this indicated that the kingdom of God was there
Just as the reality of a man is his person, so the reality of the Lord Jesus is His Person, and His Person is the Spirit
Now you need to realize further that since you are in Christ, you are also in the kingdom because Christ is the kingdom
Once in the store, you picked up an item and even though the Lord Jesus told you to drop it, you bought it, and you still have it at home
One day the Lord Jesus told His disciples that some of them would not taste of death until they saw the Son of Man coming in His kingdom
The kingdom was in Him just as electricity is in a building unless the switch is turned on, no one can observe the electricity
He told Peter, James, and John that they would see Him coming in His kingdom that they would see the kingdom of God coming in power
If these brothers are really under the shining of the Lord Jesus, the kingdom will be there in that brothers' house
Suppose, however, they do not live under the shining, but rather they criticize and despise one another while pretending to love one another
The kingdom is a seed that is sown into the earth and that grows until it reaches maturity, at which time it is harvested
The gospel is not only a matter of the forgiveness of sins, redemption, justification, sanctification, or salvation
We come now to 2 Peter 1:3, 4, and 11, which tell us that God's divine power has given us all things pertaining to life and godliness
Since we share the divine nature and all things that pertain to life and godliness, we can have a rich entrance into the kingdom
When the Lord Jesus comes into us, He brings with Him all things pertaining to life and godliness, including the very nature of God
We enter the kingdom by the Lord Jesus coming into us and giving us all things pertaining to life and godliness
The kingdom is one item of the basic structure of the Scriptures, but it has been neglected by most Christians
We have said in the past that the church is God's goal, but the ultimate goal of God is the kingdom, not the church
When the Lord Jesus returns the church in a sense will be completed but the kingdom which includes the church will continue for eternity
Although you may love your wife or submit to your husband or have a good family life, you may not be for the kingdom of God
You may be moral, you may be good, you may be gentle, and you may be religious, but you are not under the ruling of His life
He said that the kingdom is like a seed sown into the earth, which grows until it is mature, and then is harvested
The tender sprout will grow until it reaches the ultimate consummation, the manifestation of the carnation kingdom
The growth process will continue until the time of the full harvest at which time there will be the full manifestation of the Christ kingdom
Because Peter used the keys of the kingdom to establish the churches, it indicates that the churches are the kingdom
The requirements of the kingdom are high because the church is the reigning of Christ, the ruling of Christ, as a King
If we read verses 17 and 20 in the context and put all the aspects together, we will see that the real church life is the kingdom
From this we can see that the kingdom is not merely something in the future, but also something which is present today
It says that the 'kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
Many Christians cannot see that the church is the kingdom because Christianity is full of confusion and division
In the first chapter of the New Testament we have the record of a wonderful One, Christ, who is recommended to us as the seed of the kingdom
You may say that the seed of the kingdom is the Lord Jesus; yet your understanding of who He really is may be quite superficial
If we read only the black and white letters, we will understand that God is the God of these three: the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
Such a spiritual revelation is contained in the black and white letters, but we cannot see it simply by the letters; we need something more
It is not difficult to understand that these were the forefathers of the Lord Jesus, and that Mary was His mother
The One who came out of the mingling of so many human generations with the Triune God is called Jesus and Emmanuel
David is counted as two generations, one as a man to conclude the first section, and the second as a king to begin the second section
King David begat King Solomon, and King Solomon begat another king, and on in succession, one king begetting another
Isaac was, in figure, put to death and resurrected, and he married Rebecca, who was a type of the church as the Bride
The Lord Jesus was also the issue of David, that is, Solomon, who had such wisdom and who built the temple of God
The Lord Jesus was such an issue the issue of Abraham, the issue of David, and also the issue of a woman, a virgin
He was the issue of forty-one generations of humanity mingled with the Holy Father, the Holy Son, and the Holy Spirit
We would never join them, because we have something richer, higher, better, and greater; this is the Lord Jesus
By the revelation of the Scriptures, we understand that the number forty means trials, sufferings, testings, and temptations
For forty years the people of Israel were in the wilderness being tested and tried by God, with a great deal of suffering
There was a period of forty days and nights related to Elijah , and the Lord Jesus Himself was tempted for forty days
Forty-two means that after the period of testing and trial something will be accomplished to fulfill God's purpose
From the time of Abraham to the birth of Joseph's father was a period of forty generations, a period of testing
We would have said that God made promises to our forefather Abraham forty generations ago, but nothing has happened
He is the issue of all the generations of the promised people mingled with the Triune God to be Jehovah-plus and God-plus
In this seed are the receiving of the bride, the wisdom, the building of the house of God, and the bruising of the serpent's head
In this seed are the passing through of all the tests, temptations, sufferings, and eventually the reaching of the goal
The Lord Jesus was accepted by Gentiles who had no religion, no Bible knowledge, no religious forms, no doctrines, and no teachings
When one of my college classmates became a Christian, he and others began to have communion in his home on Sunday evenings
On the first page of the New Testament we see what a wonderful One the Lord Jesus is as the seed of life for the kingdom
If you have a dream of being influential in political circles, you are through as far as the Lord Jesus is concerned
We may know nothing about the prophecy in Micah 5:2, but we do have the 'heavenly star,' the living guidance of the living One in us
Anyone who will be simple and follow the heavenly star to accept the Lord Jesus will certainly take another way
In chapter two of Matthew we have three kinds of people: the simple heathen, the religious people, and the political leaders
The kingdom is not a totality of doctrines or any other things, but of Christ as life, spread into us with all of His activities
Christ not only came as the seed of the kingdom, but He came also as the sower of the kingdom, sowing Himself into the human earth
Many Christians quote Matthew 3:11 about being baptized with the Holy Spirit and with fire, thinking that the fire is something positive
If you are grains of wheat you will surely be gathered into the barn, being the ones whom He will put into the Holy Spirit
The Lord Jesus is the seed of the kingdom to be sown into us, but before He could be sown into us He first had to pass the test
If we had no record in the Bible, we could never realize that His going to Galilee was the shining of a great light
The young ones, the wild ones, the backward ones, the uneducated ones, the dirty ones these followed the Lord Jesus
They were without religion without Bible knowledge and with only a poor background of fishing but the Lord Jesus called them to follow Him
In chapter four of Matthew a group of people were attracted to the Lord Jesus, and in chapter five He brought them to a high mountain
When we have important matters to consider it is sometimes good to get away from everything to go up to a mountain where the level is higher
It is not easy for the Lord Jesus to sow Himself into us because we are not simple; in fact, we are very complicated, with two main problems
For Christ to sow Himself into our being, He must first get into our spirit, and from there spread Himself into every part of our heart
Not only will He sow Himself into our spirit, but He will grow into our inward parts our mind, will, emotion, and conscience
They had the Holy Word, the temple, the altar, the holy rituals and forms, and the holy priesthood to care for the service to God
They felt they had been trained from their forefathers to know God, and they had inherited many traditions which were precious to them
Although they may not know what the human spirit is, or even that they have a spirit, nevertheless their spirit is preoccupied
We should not care only for peace, for joy, for physical blessings, or for spiritual blessings, and we should not seek those things
No matter how many times you repeat this prayer, nothing will happen unless you are poor in spirit and pure in heart
Although this prayer has been repeated by millions of Christians for more than 1900 years, still the kingdom has not come
It is not difficult for the Lord to answer that prayer, but it is difficult for us to allow Him to grow within us
Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
If we are driving on the freeway according to our own concept, a patrolman would not regard our good intention
Righteousness is to be right according to God's will, and there is a blessedness in suffering for the sake of righteousness
These sufferings come because we are driving our car within the heavenly lines, and we cannot get out of these lines
Many of the missionaries who labored in China would not give a good report about us simply because we stood for the oneness of the Body
They had come to build up their denomination and when we could not be persuaded to cooperate with them they felt we were against foreigners
In our natural life none of us can measure up to this standard of righteousness, of being right according to God
In the same way, it is impossible for us to be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect unless we have His life
We need to pray for the Lord's mercy that we may be poor in spirit, pure in heart, right in all we do, and right according to God's will
If we pray in this way, the Lord Jesus will take us over little by little, and He will fill us up part by part
Now we can see in a fuller way that the kingdom is the totality of Christ as life spreading into us with all His activities
When the Lord Jesus rebuked the Pharisees and scribes, calling them serpents and the brood of vipers , He did not speak in a light way
He was saying that Satan was a serpent and they were all the offspring of the serpent; Satan was the father, and they were all his children
When Satan came into man, man not only became sinful, but his inward constitution was also corrupted with the satanic element
Moses made a serpent of brass and put it on a pole so that the people who were poisoned by the fiery serpents might be saved
On the cross the Lord Jesus took the form of the serpent because he died for man who had become a serpent in his inward nature
Although the Lord drew a line to preserve man's spirit, Satan has corrupted man's mind and possessed man's body
We do not speak of the chair kingdom, the stone kingdom, or the brick kingdom, because these things have no life
The human life constitutes the human kingdom, the vegetable life constitutes the vegetable kingdom, and the animal life, the animal kingdom
We Christians are even more complicated than this, for when we received the Lord Jesus we received a third life the divine life
Out of the throne proceeds the water of life, and in the water of life grows the tree of life with fruit to feed and leaves to heal
In Revelation 22, life proceeds out of the throne of God to produce the kingdom, which expresses God and represents Him
The Pharisees hated the Lord Jesus and they criticized His action, saying that He cast out demons by Beelzebub, the prince of the demons
The Pharisees knew that Satan was the ruler of the demons and they scorned the Lord Jesus, accusing him of casting out demons by Satan
They may think that they are working for the kingdom of God, yet unknowingly be working for the kingdom of Satan
When we hear the word 'establish,' we may think it means to assemble various pieces or elements together, placing one next to the other
The kingdom of God is God being life to us, spreading in us, occupying the ground in us, and reigning over our whole being
John 4:24 shows that God is a Spirit, and Ephesians 2:2 reveals that Satan, the ruler of the authority of the air, is also a spirit
He rules the whole earth, and he has many subordinates, many ranks, under him, which Ephesians 6:12 describes as rulers and authorities
If you have ever had the experience of casting out demons, you know that the demons like to take the human body as their dwelling place
From his base of operation in the body, Satan will attempt to control the person's whole being his mind, emotion, and will
After the demon has been driven out, you must help this person turn to his spirit and not to exercise his mentality too much
The more he says, 'Hallelujah,' and the more he pray-reads the Word, the more the Lord Jesus spreads within him
Part of his being is under the reigning of the Lord Jesus, but in other parts of his being there are strongholds resisting His rule
Perhaps this young brother will eventually receive some help from another brother and become freshly stirred up for the Lord
If many Christians who are seeking the Lord would be like this, the full manifestation of the kingdom would come
The fundamental teachings also help people, but eventually they hold people back from fulfilling God's eternal purpose
Although many Christians were helped by them, eventually they were frustrated by the very things which helped them
God's sovereignty is displayed here, for God allowed Satan a certain degree of liberty to do what he wanted with man
If you study world history from ancient times to the present, you will realize that man has always worshipped God
From his base in our physical body, Satan wants to take over our soul, to place our soul under his absolute control
When you preach the gospel to people you should touch their spirit you should touch their conscience which is the main part of their spirit
The more you argue, the more they will have something to say in response and the more their minds will be stirred up
Whenever you are trying to help other people, never touch their mentality, because the human mind is the stronghold of Satan
It is not easy to listen to a sister talk about her husband without being stirred up in your mind or trapped by Satan
Don't talk about his wife at all, because the wife problem is fully occupying his mind and filling his thoughts
In the garden of Eden, Adam had two choices facing him: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Before you were saved you were not that complicated; you were rather simple because you continually went along with Satan
Since Satan has come into us and since the Lord Jesus has also come into us, it is possible for us to be in three kingdoms
Corinthians 10:4-5 reveals that there are strongholds within us, which are our rebellious thoughts belonging to our reprobate mind
The strongholds consist of the concepts, ideas, opinions, judgments, even the very way of thinking all of which are elements in the mind
Paul said that he was very concerned for the Corinthians lest their thoughts be seduced from the simplicity that is in Christ
Most Christians today are not simple; they are very complicated because they have collected all kinds of doctrines
They think that more doctrines they have, the better, but actually the more doctrines they have, the more complicated they become
It is better to translate it this way: 'that your minds would be corrupted by being seduced from the simplicity'
Whenever our thoughts are seduced from the simplicity and singleness that is in Christ, our mind will be corrupt
It is easy to load people with teaching, but once the teaching has entered into them, it is exceedingly hard for anyone to unload it
In Matthew 12:29 the Lord Jesus said that unless the strong man is bound, no one can enter his house and plunder his vessels
Their minds have been filled with vanity, their understanding has been fully darkened, and their heart has been totally hardened
All of those people had acquired many doctrines and teachings, and they fought against the Lord Jesus with the Scriptures
The more we argue, the more we strengthen the stronghold of Satan and the satanic kingdom, which is in the human mind
To set our mind upon the flesh is to be in the kingdom of Satan; to set our mind upon the spirit is to be in the kingdom of God
The practicality of the kingdom life is simply to set our mind upon the spirit and to go along with the indwelling Spirit
We have seen that Satan is in our flesh, that the Lord Jesus is in our spirit, and that we ourselves are in our soul
In the last chapter we pointed out that our mind is the battlefield between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan
The second and third parts comprising the soul are the emotion, the loving organ, and the will, the organ of intention and decision
In some verses the Greek word, psuche, is translated into soul; in other verses it is translated into life soul-life
As we have seen, Satan is in our flesh, operating for his kingdom, and the Lord Jesus is in our spirit, operating for the kingdom of God
Ephesians 2:2 tells us that Satan, the ruler of the authority of the air, is the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience
Our mind, will, emotion, self, soulish life, and relationship with the world have been saturated and permeated with Satan
If there had been no record of the Lord's reply to Peter's suggestion, we would never have learned that Peter's concern was satanic
Can you imagine that Peter could express such a noble concern for the Lord and at the same time be one with Satan?
If we fail to put our mind upon the things of God, but set it upon the things of men, immediately we are one with Satan
These two passages linked together prove that it makes no difference whether you love or hate as long as you are one with Satan
We saw in the last chapter that because our mind is a battlefield we must pray for the Lord to bind the strong man
To deal with our love of the world in our emotions is not a matter of binding the strong man, but of bearing the cross in the soul
Some sisters do not know how many chapters Matthew has, but they remember very well how many dresses they have
Some may have been Christians for more than twenty years and yet be unable to tell exactly how many chapters there are in the book of Acts
We have used these practical illustrations because the Lord has shown us that the kingdom is not merely a dispensation or a sphere
If our soul has never been dealt with by the cross in the matter of love, regardless of what we may think, we are in the kingdom of Satan
The Lord gave you no leading, yet you bought many things, and these possessions are still at home condemning you
Perhaps we have never realized that our ideas and dissenting thoughts are expressions of self and that our self is one with Satan
Although it is true that many concepts are the expression of the self, many times we may have a concept without any trace of self in it
The soulish strength must be dealt with because the more we depend upon it, the more we live in the kingdom of Satan
Because we are believers in Christ, we all have the kingdom of God in our spirit, but we also have the kingdom of Satan in our soul
Whatever we have, whatever we are, whatever we can do, and whatever we keep in our soul must be completely dealt with by the cross
Some Christians consider Matthew a book of stories, while others consider it a book of teachings and doctrines
John the Baptist proclaimed that the 'kingdom of the heavens has drawn near' , but in fact what happened was that the man Jesus came
Never forget chapter one of Matthew which gives us the record of this wonderful Person who is Jehovah-plus and God-plus
The kingdom is also Christ as life spreading into us, growing constantly until maturity, which will be the full manifestation of the kingdom
If we were to dissect a man to examine all his parts, the life would disappear; but if we leave him alive and whole, the life will remain
While it is easy to locate our eyes and nose and ears, it is difficult to locate our spirit because it is a mystery
Although few of us have difficulties with our physical heart, every one of us has problems with his psychological heart
We do have some limited understanding concerning our mind, conscience, heart, spirit, and life, but they still remain mysteries
Other mysteries of the kingdom include the parable of the tares, the mustard seed, the leaven, the treasure, the pearl, and the net
According to the record in John 3, Nicodemus approached the Lord saying, 'Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God'
The Lord Jesus did not come as a teacher to teach us the doctrine of the kingdom; He came to sow the kingdom into us
In the Epistles we see the growth and blossoming of the seed, and eventually there will be a harvest in the book of Revelation
Our human spirit is the place for the Lord Jesus to sow Himself into us, and our heart is the place for Him to grow in us
The Lord Jesus made the human spirit the first item, but most Christians have made it the last item, even counting it as nothing
The truth of the human spirit is sown in Matthew 5, and it is developed in many verses throughout the Epistles
These two items were mentioned first because they are the very places for the Lord to sow Himself and then to spread Himself
When some people listen to the word of the gospel of the kingdom, their hearts are preoccupied by the worldly communication and traffic
Satan never sleeps he is always working on the earth watching for an opportunity to snatch the word of the kingdom from the hardened hearts
The Lord Jesus said that the rocky places are covered with soft soil which is apparently very good for growing something
These rocks do not mainly represent the sinful things, but they represent our natural mind, emotions, and will
Because of hidden rocks in the heart, the Lord Jesus has not been able to spread in some of the brothers and sisters
You may feel that there is nothing wrong with such a mind, but for the sake of the kingdom it must be broken through
If we are going to have Christ as the seed of the kingdom growing within us we need to unload our mind to empty our mind of the old concepts
We must realize that what prevents the Lord Jesus from taking deep root within us is the natural mind underneath the soft soil
If your emotions are very raw and, in a sense, fragile, they have probably never been dealt with or trained by the Lord
The fact that Aaron could control his emotions and hold back his tears indicates he was qualified to be such a high priest
By the Lord's mercy and by His life within us, we can all subdue our emotions and have them thoroughly dealt with
In Matthew 13:22 the Lord Jesus told us that the thorns represent the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches
God's intention is for us to earn a living, but Satan's subtle design is to choke the growth of Christ within us
We will continually encounter the temptation of raising our standard of living, of wanting better cars and bigger houses
He will entice us to work harder and longer to make more money and then to occupy more time to spend the money
The United States is not only for the church life in this country, but for the spreading of the church life throughout the whole world
Christ is in the center, awaiting the opportunity to spread out of our spirit into our mind, emotions, and will
Many think that the kingdom of God will come automatically and that we can sleep while we wait for it to appear
There are three other parables found in Matthew 13: the parables of the tares, the mustard seed, and the leaven
Outwardly, Satan was unable to snatch away the word, but inwardly he held to the mind, emotions, and will, causing them to be huge rocks
Satan worked to produce thorns, causing the anxiety of this life, the love for money, and the deceit of riches to choke the growth of Christ
Regardless of how good a church is, he will attempt to sow the false seed, to grow something which closely resembles the real thing
Even an expert could not discern whether they were genuine or false until the day that they made a certain suggestion
Satan will try to sow tares to cause confusion, frustration, and damage, and to hinder the growth of the real wheat
According to Genesis 1, all the vegetables are to reproduce each after its kind, and the animals each after its kind
We do not need to be concerned that the peach tree might grow into another kind of tree and not produce peaches
Earlier in the same chapter, the Lord Jesus told us the interpretation of the birds, saying that they were the Devil and his angels
We thank the Lord that the move of His recovery in this country has been growing gradually throughout the years
Recently, a reporter from a newspaper contacted one of the brothers, wanting to give us some advertisement and publicity
The hungry world does not need a great tree; it needs a little mustard herb to feed people, to satisfy the hunger in all the human beings
Regardless of how much Satan attempts to frustrate God's farm, it still produces the meal, which is good for making a loaf
If we study leaven in the Bible, we will see that it represents the satanic, sinful, worldly, and fleshly things
In the Roman Catholic Church and in all the denominations, there are many real Christians, yet there is also much leaven
The difference is that this reality was presented by the Lord Jesus to His disciples in a mysterious way and not in an open way
He presented the mysteries of the kingdom in such a way that only those who have a heart after God's desire can understand them
In Matthew 13:11-15 the Lord Jesus told the disciples why He used parables as the means to reveal the mysteries of the kingdom
Previous to this time, in Matthew 12:46-50, the mother and brothers of the Lord Jesus came to see Him, wanting to speak with Him
He considered His brothers and sisters, not according to their flesh, but according to their concern for the will of God
Because the Jewish people cared only for the forms and appearance, with no care for God's concern, the Lord Jesus gave them up
After this, He began to speak about the reality of the kingdom in parables, not in an open way, but in a mysterious way
In this very chapter the Lord Jesus gave us the interpretation of the birds, telling us that they were Satan and his evil angels
The fact that the evil birds lodge in the branches of the great tree proves that this tree is something negative
Others indicated that the leaven also was good and positive, saying that if bread does not contain leaven, it is difficult for people to eat
Catholicism excuses its use of leaven by saying that it is difficult for people to take Christ if leaven is absent
They argued back, replying, 'Without an image of Jesus, it is difficult for people to have some realization of Jesus
You think that the meeting must be conducted by some leading ones and that all you need to do is sit, listen, watch, and discern
When you come to the meeting, do you have the burden or desire or concept that you must function in the meeting?
When the time of this parable will have been fulfilled, that will be the completion, the consummation of the age
Corinthians 10:32 reveals that among the human race today there are only these three peoples the Jews, the church, and the Gentiles
In the eyes of God, there are only two worlds: one signified in the Bible by the earth, the other signified by the sea
At the end of the age, the angels will gather them to the Lord Jesus, and He will exercise His judgment upon them
If the Jewish people are represented by the earth and the Gentiles are represented by the sea, where is the church?
In Matthew 13:44 the treasure is mentioned again, showing that the Jews, as God's treasure are also a part of the kingdom
He first presented the kingdom to the Jewish people, but because they rejected Him, the Lord hid it, concealing it from the unbelieving Jews
God has put these two peoples together to produce a city, the New Jerusalem, which is composed of the precious stones and the pearls
With the seed, the wheat, and the meal there is the possibility for the evil one to damage by bringing in something negative and corrupting
If our growth remains at the stage of the seed, the wheat, or the meal, Satan will have many opportunities to damage and frustrate
The book of Matthew portrays the Lord Jesus as the wonderful One who has come to sow Himself as the seed of life into us
When his brother Andrew brought him to the Lord the Lord did not teach him or instruct him rather He changed his name from Simon to Cephas
The incident recorded in Matthew 16 occurred about two years after Peter's first meeting with the Lord in John 1:42
When Peter confessed that He was the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord reminded him: 'You are a stone'
He used one key on the day of Pentecost to open the door for the Jewish people to enter into the kingdom of the heavens
If the church in Matthew 18 is the universal church, where shall we find it when we have a problem that two or three believers cannot solve?
If you read the New Testament carefully, you will see that this muddy Peter was under the process of transformation
Some Christians insist upon the so-called Pentecostal experiences, saying that without them we cannot have the Holy Spirit
He was so bold, strong, and positive, remaining in Jerusalem with one hundred and twenty, praying for ten days in one accord
They were Galileans who had given up their own country and were staying in Jerusalem in spite of the threatenings of the Jews
Their being in one accord and continuing in prayer indicates they had the Spirit within them before the day of Pentecost
If you lose your temper, it indicates that, at least to a certain extent, you are not yet a stone you are still clay
The builded church has authority, and the gates of Hades, signifying the power of Satan, cannot prevail against it
The universal church is the totality of all the local churches, even as a body is the totality of all its members
Those who talk only about the universal church are afraid of being built up together with others in the local church
We must be able to declare to the whole universe that we have been located and that we are now being built into a particular local church
The amount of transformation depends on the amount of growth, and the amount of building depends on the amount of transformation
In the coming years the Lord will increase both the number of churches and also the number of saints in the churches
May the Lord make us very clear that the local churches in the Lord's recovery are absolutely different from today's Christianity
Formalism stresses correct forms; fundamentalism emphasizes teachings and doctrines; Pentecostalism emphasizes the gifts
Although we may have received some help from formalism fundamentalism or Pentecostalism we must proceed further to seek the growth in life
If the local churches have any streets other than life, we will lose the nature of the local church, and there will be divisions
If we fail to emphasize life, we will repeat the history of Christianity, which is a story of divisions and of many streets
We are not against any positive item in the Bible, but we desire that all the Lord's dear ones will go further and pursue the growth in life
In Matthew 21 the Jewish people were trying their best to find fault with the Lord Jesus to condemn Him and to cause Him to make a mistake
Peter remembered this and when the religious leaders were persecuting him, he quoted the same verse from the Psalms
If we would be built into the local churches, our temper will be terminated and we will have the patience we need
The revelation of God in the Bible follows a very important principle: what is mentioned in the beginning has as its consummation at the end
According to our natural understanding and concept, the kingdom is merely an age, a period of time, or a realm
Although the New Testament meaning of the kingdom does include the concept of time and sphere, it means much more than this
Both time and sphere are included in the New Testament concept of the kingdom, but they are not the kingdom itself
The reality of the kingdom is Christ working Himself into us and spreading Himself through our being until maturity
John did not say, 'Behold, the Messiah has drawn near' or 'Behold, the Savior has drawn near' or 'the Redeemer has drawn near'
He is the wonderful One revealed in the first chapter of Matthew Jehovah-plus and God-plus, Jehovah the Savior and God with us
The seed is sown in Matthew, sprouts in Acts, grows and blossoms in the Epistles, and is harvested in Revelation
We need to pray much over these points, considering the verses in the presence of the Lord in order to see the revelation and the reality
The kingdom is the wonderful Christ who has been sown into us, and who grows in us, transforming us until we reach maturity
We need to look at the book of Matthew from a heavenly angle, not from the angle of stories, doctrines, and teachings
The coming of the kingdom was the shining, the spreading, the release, and the overshadowing of the Lord Jesus
Romans 14:17-18 shows us that the kingdom is present today and that the kingdom is simply the proper church life
He does not say that the kingdom of God shall be; he uses the present tense and says that the kingdom of God is
He goes on in verse 18 to say: 'For he who in this serves Christ as a slave is well-pleasing to God and approved by men'
Some of you have been reading the book of Romans for years and may think that Romans is only about salvation and justification by faith
Romans 14 presents a strategic point: the kingdom of God is the serving of Christ, the ministering of Christ, to others
If we put these two verses together and consider the context, we will realize that the church is the kingdom of God
Many have held the concept that today is the age of the church and that sometime in the future will be the age of the kingdom
We need the whole book of Romans and the whole book of 1 Corinthians in order to know the church as the kingdom
We need to plant vegetables which by growth and transformation will become minerals gold, silver, and precious stones
While the plant grows, it is transformed into gold, silver, and precious stones to be the materials for God's building
The kingdom is something that is planted, that grows, that is transformed, and that is built up into the very temple of God
As we have seen in the last chapter, 1 Corinthians 3 covers the matters of growth, transformation, and building
The gifted persons mentioned in Ephesians 411 the apostles prophets evangelists shepherds and teachers are for the perfecting of the saints
Neither the Lord Jesus nor the gifted persons such as the apostles and evangelists build up the churches directly
Rather, the members who have been perfected, that is, equipped and qualified to function, build up the churches directly
To perfect the saints means to help them grow into a full-grown man, to be no more babes, and to grow up in all things into Christ
After hearing some of my messages a few people were offended and argued saying You say that we dont need teachings gifts or regulations
Speaking in tongues may stir up your heart and your spirit, but once you have been stirred up you must immediately turn to life
Thank the Lord if you have received help from speaking in tongues, but if you remain there you may become independent and individualistic
In the meetings held for the exercise of spiritual gifts most people do not care for others everyone cares for his own practice of the gifts
In spite of this there is a kind of assurance among tonguesspeaking people that if all the believers will speak in tongues all will be one
During the past one hundred fifty years the doctrines and gifts have been recovered but the growth in life has not been recovered adequately
It is good that you have Bible knowledge and that you have spoken in tongues, but do not stop with these things
There is such a danger that those who have Bible knowledge will stop there, and that those who have experienced gifts will stop there
Rather, it stresses the seed of life and the growth of that seed with transformation to produce minerals for the building up of the church
The Lord told Peter that he was a stone, and that He would build His church and give to Peter the keys of the kingdom
In Matthew we do not find gifts or Bible knowledge, and in 1 Corinthians Paul belittled both gifts and Bible knowledge
Neither Ephesians nor Romans says much about gifts, although in Romans the gift of hospitality and other such gifts are mentioned
The tower of Babel was built with bricks , as were also the two cities of Pharaoh built by the enslaved Israelites
The full taste which will be in the New Jerusalem is what we enjoy in the local churches today as the foretaste
Transformation means that the Lord Jesus, the seed of life, with all His rich element, is being added into you
Such a Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit is imparting Himself into your spirit, and from your spirit into your whole being
The element of the food enters the children's blood, and then it penetrates their cells and organic tissues, causing them to grow
Metabolism does not mean an outward change, but an inward change which results from a new element being added into your being
Just as in good food there is the killing power to kill germs, likewise, in the element of Christ there is the killing power
The more you enjoy Christ by eating Him and taking Him into you, the more the divine element will saturate you
The putting on of the new man is the putting on of the kingdom; the putting on of the church life is the putting on of the kingdom
If they would read the last two chapters of Revelation, they would see that the whole city, from every direction, has the same appearance
John the Baptist proclaimed, 'the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near,' and the Lord Jesus repeated the same words
If it were standing alone apart from the rest of the Bible, it would be impossible for us to understand this parable
As we have seen in a previous chapter, from the time of Matthew 13 the Lord no longer spoke about the kingdom in an open way
Whenever the Lord speaks about the kingdom from Matthew 13 to the end of the book, He speaks in the way of a mystery
If we know the way to find them and how to put them together, they will show us a clear picture of the economy of God
We should recall that this parable concerns the kingdom of the heavens, whose number should be twelve and not ten
At the beginning of Revelation three and four are added to make seven at the end of Revelation four and three are multiplied to make twelve
Multiplication means mingling, the mingling of three with four, which signifies the mingling of the Triune God in resurrection with man
The concluding word of these two portions is the same: 'Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes'
Because the two men or two women were working, they represent the believers who will be alive when the Lord returns
The ten, on the contrary, were all asleep indicating that the majority of the believers will have died by the time the Lord returns
In the eyes of God, the dead believers are not actually dead; they are sleeping, resting, and waiting for the resurrection
The foolish ones died and the wise ones, including Peter, John, Martin Luther, and many other saints, also died
Some of the children are wise, conducting themselves in a proper way; some are foolish, behaving in a naughty way
Matthew does not say that the lamps of only the wise were burning and that the lamps of the unwise were not burning because they were false
At the time we were saved, the Lord came into our spirit and we were regenerated , but God cannot be expressed from our spirit alone
The heart is very similar to the soul but somewhat larger since it includes the conscience which is a part of the spirit
When we heard the gospel or when we read the word of the gospel, something shined within us and we received the light
When we called on the name of the Lord Jesus, He came into our spirit as such an oil, the all-inclusive Spirit of God
Without paying the cost it is impossible for the indwelling Christ who is in our spirit to spread Himself into our mind, emotion, and will
Although it is truly marvelous to have God added to us, we must realize that man plus God equals responsibility
Because the Lord Jesus has delayed His return, most of the saints who were mature, saturated, and filled with the Triune God have died
The marriage feast is waiting for you and whether you gain it or not depends on whether you are wise or foolish
If you pay the price today, you will receive a prize in that day, but if you pay the price in that day, you will receive no prize
To be transformed is to be filled with the Lord in all your inward parts, to be saturated with the extra portion of the Triune God
Most of the truths in the book of Matthew were sown there as seeds with their growth taking place in the Epistles
In the parable of the ten virgins, we saw that the human spirit as God's lamp is burning with the Triune God as the oil
Ephesians 1:13 tells us that when we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received the Holy Spirit within us as the seal
The Holy Spirit is God Himself coming into us as the seal because, after believing in the Lord Jesus, we became God's possession
The result of this strengthening will be that Christ will spread Himself from our spirit into every part of our heart
Christ will take full possession of our heart, meaning that He will settle Himself and make His home in our hearts
Ephesians 3 tells us we need an extra portion of the all-inclusive Spirit to fill up our soul, our heart, and every part of our inward being
He spreads Himself from our spirit into our soul, saturating our soul, possessing it, and fully making His home in it
Never forget that regeneration is accomplished in our spirit and that transformation is accomplished in our soul
Regeneration, the start of our spiritual life, means that God has come into our spirit to enlighten us, quicken us, and make us alive
From the book of Matthew we have seen that Christ as the seed has been sown into our spirit and that He will grow within us
If she would drop her buying, on the way home she would be shouting and praising the Lord, saying 'Hallelujah!
Although they may study the Bible or speak in tongues, they have little inward change and little inward transformation in life
Matthew, which is a book of seeds, does not emphasize teachings and gifts, and neither does such a basic book as Ephesians
Everything must serve God's intention of working Himself into our being and saturating us with the all-inclusive Spirit
Although Ephesians is a book on the church, it also refers to the kingdom, because the proper church life is the reality of the kingdom
Do not follow the traditional teaching which says that the church is the church and the kingdom is the kingdom
The seed of the kingdom is sown in Matthew, the sprouting of the seed takes place in Acts, and the growth occurs in the Epistles
The book of Revelation presents the maturity, the harvest, the full coming, and the full manifestation of the kingdom
In 1 Corinthians 3 we also have seen the matter of transformation; the plants have been transformed into minerals
Please remember that twelve is composed of four times three, signifying the mingling of humanity with divinity
The kingdom began to come when the Lord Jesus appeared as the sower to sow the seed, and it has been coming from that time
Although nearly two thousand years have passed, the Lord Jesus has not yet come because the seed has lacked the growth
The Lord has come into us, He is growing within us, and He is transforming us by performing a metabolic work within us
We also studied the different views about the rapture: the partial rapture, the pre-tribulation rapture, and the post-tribulation rapture
By the Lords grace and for the sake of His recovery He has shown us this mysterious way that His coming back is not according to our concept
According to our natural concept, the Lord sits on the throne watching and bestowing blessings until the day when He will suddenly appear
While you are growing, you are preparing the extra portion of the all-inclusive Spirit as the oil in your vessel
In Revelation 14 there are the firstfruit and the harvest; in Revelation 21 there are gold, pearls, and precious stones
In chapter fourteen there is the harvest out of the growth; in chapter twenty-one there is the transformation of the wheat
The wheat becomes precious stones through transformation just as wood becomes stone as a result of being petrified
The local church is a miniature of God's kingdom, with the life flowing to produce and sustain a building composed of precious materials
The following chapters reveal that these transformed items are for the building up of the church, which is the reality of the kingdom
Whether we are males or females, we are all virgins holding a burning lamp and going forth out of this world to meet our Bridegroom
Do you baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus, in the name of Jesus Christ or in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost'?
You must realize that here in the Philippines some churches practice baptism in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost
There was no speaking in tongues and nothing miraculous happened, yet all the people had the deep conviction that the Lord was there
Many Pentecostal friends say that according to 1 Corinthians 12, there are nine manifestations of the Holy Spirit
Actually there are many more, because among the nine manifestations listed in 1 Corinthians 12, there is no mention of dreams
Dreams are mentioned in Acts 2, where it says that in the last days God will pour out His Spirit on all flesh and men shall dream dreams
In Matthew 28 there is the seed of baptism into the Triune God, and in the Epistles there is the growth of the seed
According to Matthew 13 the seed grows and brings in transformation, and transformation issues in the building
Three times we practiced Pentecostalism in our churches, and each time it was a debit to our spiritual accounting
We did have some credit, but eventually our spiritual accounting was 'in the red,' showing more debit than credit
The gift of knowledge must also be proved by the growth in life the transformation in life the building in life and the practical Body life
John 2 tells us that the Lord did many miracles in Jerusalem and, as a result of these signs, many people believed in Him
In John 3 Nicodemus came and the Lord turned him to the matter of life, saying that he needed to be born again
To be baptized into the Spirit means that you are put into the Spirit; to drink of the Spirit means that the Spirit is put into you
Do not think that the Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, and the Spirit is the Spirit as separate persons
If you read 2 Corinthians 3, you will realize that the veil mentioned there is the Scriptures in black and white letters
We need the Lord's mercy to remove all the veils and to give us an unveiled face, without concepts, ideas, and preoccupations
The harvest of the Spirit in the book of Revelation is the seven Spirits and the seven-fold intensified Spirit
The cases in Matthew illustrate the matter of the kingdom, whereas the cases in John illustrate the matter of life
Matthew on the other hand assembles various materials together in order to present a particular picture or revelation
Some incidents which occurred later in the Lord's life, Matthew mentions earlier, and some events which occurred earlier, he mentions later
After three and one-half years these young fishermen became the pillars of the first local church on earth, the church in Jerusalem
Chapter eight, which presents the first case illustrating the kingdom recorded in Matthew, begins after the Lord's descent from the mountain
Corinthians 6:9-11 says that the unclean people in a sense we may call them lepers have no inheritance in the kingdom
The first case recorded by Matthew indicates that the citizens of the kingdom of the heavens are lepers who have been cleansed
Although there is a definition of faith in Hebrews 11:1, we may read it several times and still not understand what faith is
Whenever you realize the Lord Jesus in a certain way, spontaneously you have faith as a result of that realization
The centurion said that there was no need for the Lord Jesus to come to his house, because he realized that He was the highest authority
The case of the centurion illustrates faith, including the principle that we are not qualified or disqualified by our natural birth
The more we look unto Him, consider Him, and trust Him, the more we are in the kingdom and become citizens of the kingdom
Both the cleansed lepers and the people who by natural birth have no share in the kingdom can receive the wonderful matter called faith
Even if you tried to give up the Christian faith, you would be unable to do so because God has chosen you before you were born
Matthew 9:9 says that Matthew was a publican, a tax collector, a Jew who collected taxes for the Roman imperialists
Such publicans were despised by the Jews because they were helping the Roman imperialists to damage the Jewish nation
Both the oldtime religionists the disciples of the Pharisees and the newtime religionists the disciples of John the Baptist were troubled
He also told them that He desired mercy and not sacrifice for He did not come to call the righteous, but sinners
At that time, John's disciples also asked the Lord a question: 'Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but your disciples do not fast'?
The Lord answered them in a wonderful way: 'Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them'?
The first case, the leper, signifies cleansing; the second case, the centurion, signifies faith versus natural birth
As the new garment covering us, Christ is our righteousness, and as the new wine that fills us up, Christ is our life
God created man in His own image so that man could exercise dominion over all the earth, especially over all the creeping things
It is God's desire that man subdue the earth, conquer the enemy, and recover God's authority in order that God could establish His kingdom
The object of our faith is the wonderful Lord Jesus who has all authority and who, in Himself, is the highest authority
The corruption caused by the enemy has been cleared away, and the wonderful and mysterious faith has come into us
The Lord Jesus even revealed the matter of resurrection from the title of God the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
Although the stories recorded in the Bible seem simple, the implications of the revelations contained in them are profound
In Matthew 10:16-22 the Lord said that He was sending the kingdom people forth as sheep in the midst of wolves
The Lord also said that they will be brought before governors and kings, a clear reference to the political people
It is because they have their own kingdoms; religion is a kingdom for religious people, and politics is a kingdom for political people
King Herod was troubled when he heard the news of the birth of the Lord Jesus because he was afraid of losing his kingdom
If you read the Lord's word carefully, you will see that the kingdom people should be the persecuted ones, not the persecuting ones
He created many 'troublemakers' first twelve, then seventy and sent out these 'troublemakers' to create even more trouble
Since Christianity is a strong factor of contemporary culture, it becomes the strongest opposition to the kingdom of God
The more the local churches go on in the kingdom and as the kingdom, the more trouble we will cause to human culture
It was very difficult for anyone to enter into the kingdom at that time because the Pharisees, Sadducees, and priests opposed their entry
Although the entrance was pointed out and even opened by John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus, the Jewish people rose up in opposition
When John came and proclaimed the kingdom, immediately the Pharisees, Sadducees, scribes, and priests rose up to oppose
In speaking about John the Baptist, the Lord Jesus established this principle: in the kingdom, unlike in religion, there are no regulations
When John the Baptist came not eating and drinking in a normal way, people said that he was possessed with a demon
The kingdom has no outward regulations, for the kingdom people are the children of wisdom, the children of God, who have the life of Christ
If we become wise and intelligent, we can no longer participate in the kingdom life or share the enjoyment of Christ
If you receive this revelation, you will know Him in such a rich way, in a way of tasting and in a way of life
If you will be simple and single instead of religiously wise and intelligent you will be unloaded, and you will have rest
When you exercise the principle of forsaking your religious wisdom and intelligence and of being simple, you will be immediately unburdened
We have no outward regulations, and we have no burdens because we do not exercise our religious wisdom and intelligence
At that time' the Lord Jesus answered and prayed to the Father, and 'at that time' He brought His disciples into the grain fields
At that time the Lord Jesus revealed to His disciples the way to find rest and to enjoy Him as rest in the kingdom
In chapter nine we have the way to enjoy the Lord as our feast; in chapters eleven and twelve we have the way to enjoy Him as our rest
Some may consider that the matter of enjoying the Lord should be found in John the book of life and not in Matthew the book of the kingdom
Many Christians who were seeking the Lord very much were simply wandering aimlessly before they came into the church life
In the local church we have the feast and we have the rest because the local church is the reality of the kingdom
They were the 'Sabbath patrol,' out on patrol, trying to find the Lord Jesus and His disciples breaking the Sabbath law
Even if you are suffering from hunger, the religious people would force you to observe the Sabbath regulations
If you were hungry, and the religious people compelled you to keep the Sabbath laws, would that be a rest or a suffering?
Many Christians quote Matthew 11:28-30 without connecting them to the previous verses or to the following verses
When they preach the gospel they use these verses, telling the hearers that they are heavily burdened with sins
Suppose the brothers living in a brothers' house compiled a list of twenty-four regulations and posted it on the wall
The Pharisees considered themselves to be very scriptural; they thought they did everything according to the Bible
He reminded them about the time David and his followers went into the temple and ate the showbread which was unlawful for them to eat
He also asked whether they had read of the priests who were allowed to profane the Sabbath in the temple and be guiltless
What the Lord means is this: even if there is no verse to justify what He is doing, He still has the right to do it because He is the Lord
They need to see that in the kingdom it is not a matter of knowing the Bible; it is a matter of knowing the living Lord Jesus
If we try to become great, if we try to make a name for ourselves, we will become the great tree instead of the little mustard herb
When the flax torches ran out of oil, they quit shining and became only smoking flax, which people would quench and throw away
All these verses reveal an important principle of the kingdom: the kingdom today is not something great in appearance
The sign that is needed today is not a wonder or a miracle; it is the sign of a crucified and resurrected person
At the end of chapter eleven, the Lord Jesus began to show us the way to enjoy Him as rest in the kingdom life
In chapter twelve He revealed that we need to break the religious regulations, but refuse to make ourselves great, public, and popular
The more people require signs of us, the more we should go to the cross, the more we should be buried in the death water
The more people expect us to do something extraordinary the more we must go to the cross to be crucified and to the death water to be buried
If we are today's Jonah, experiencing death and resurrection, we will certainly be today's Solomon, building the temple
It is because Jonah typifies Christ as the crucified and resurrected One, and Solomon typifies Christ as the reigning One
We only need the unique sign the crucified life, the buried life, and the resurrected life that has become the reigning life
Beginning with chapter eight and continuing through chapter twelve, Matthew presents many cases which illustrate the genuine kingdom life
If we see the vision and have an overall view, we will realize that these five chapters are a section showing us the real kingdom life
The way we enjoy Him is not by our natural birth, but by living faith and by breaking the religious regulations
We will be unable to understand the incidents recorded in these chapters if we do not consider them as a group
The Lord made it very clear to His disciples that His relationships with people have nothing to do with natural birth
According to Matthew 12, the Lord Jesus repudiated everything that was according to natural birth, even His own mother
Although the Lord Jesus renounced everything natural, the people in His own country recognized Him in a natural way
In 2 Corinthians 5:16 Paul said that he did not know Christ according to the flesh, that is, according to anything natural
They knew His carpenter father, His mother, His brothers, and His sisters, but they did not know Him according to the Spirit
The transfiguration of the Lord Jesus on the mountaintop in Matthew 17 was a miniature of the full coming of the kingdom
The section of Matthew which we are presently considering goes from chapter thirteen until the full coming of the kingdom in the future
The background for this move into the wilderness was His rejection by religion and His persecution by politics
If we mean business with the Lord for the kingdom, we will certainly be rejected by religion and persecuted by politics
As we have seen, the synagogues rejected Christ, and King Herod killed John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ
In reality we are the kingdom people and we are in the kingdom, but outwardly speaking we are living in the wilderness
The answer to this question is found in the case of Jesus' feeding 5,000 people with five loaves and two fishes
Matthew, however, used this case in a different way, showing how the Lord can afford us a living in the wilderness
As we preached the gospel in the Far East, sometimes the unbelievers would ask us, 'Can Jesus take care of my eating?
While all the religious and political people are busy earning a living, the kingdom people follow the Lord Jesus in the wilderness
They recognized the need of the people, and advised the Lord Jesus to disperse them into the villages to purchase something to eat
After feeding the multitude, the Lord Jesus went to a high mountain to pray, and He sent His disciples to the sea
The life of the kingdom people today is a life in the wilderness, and the way of the kingdom people is a way on the stormy sea
As we follow the Lord Jesus, many times we will not have a comfortable feeling, and we will experience the contrary winds
They began to meet in a small home and eventually had the need to rent a larger place to contain the new converts
He did not say who offered the long gown, but simply brought it to the meeting and announced that it was available to anyone who needed it
The work started in this country in 1963, and we were burdened to publish the little magazine called The Stream
Although we had almost no funds, the brothers transcribed the messages, polished them, and were prepared to put them into print
In Matthew 15 the Lord fed another great multitude in the wilderness, once again showing that He could provide them a living
We must realize that today is still the period between the rejection of the Lord Jesus and the full coming of the kingdom
What we need is living faith to go on with the Lord for the sake of His kingdom until the kingdom comes in full
As we have pointed out, the book of Matthew was not written according to historical sequence, but according to revelation
Matthew selected certain instances of the Lord's walk on earth and compiled them to present a particular revelation
As we have seen in the last chapter, we must follow Him into the wilderness, where we need to have faith in Him for our living
He gave us a promise in Matthew 6:33: 'Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you'
The so-called church services are outwardly very quiet, and they would condemn us for shouting and praising in our meetings
Outwardly religiously and formally the people are quiet and everything is in order but inwardly they are full of confusion and corruption
The Lord, in effect, was saying, 'If you call Me the Son of David, you should be an Israelite, but you are not
Originally, all of the kingdom people were dogs, but by feeding on the crumbs of the Lord Jesus we have been transformed into children
In the first case we have the matter of taking in; in the second case we have the matter of the eating of crumbs
We will be clean, not by the outward washing of hands, but by the inward, metabolic washing of our inner being
It is to be religious, scriptural, fundamental, outwardly right, and yet have no life, no Spirit, no reality, and no sincerity
The leaven of the Pharisees is simply today's fundamentalism; the leaven of the Sadducees is today's modernism
We look to the Lord that in the local churches there may be many crumbs of Christ, but no leaven of fundamentalism or modernism
While we are following the Lord Jesus in the wilderness during the time of His rejection, we must take care of our eating
In Matthew 15 there was a Canaanite woman who was enjoying Christ as the crumbs in a living and nourishing way
At the same time, many priests who were trained in the proper worship of God were worshipping God according to the Scriptures
In a sense, these priests had much knowledge about God and what they were doing in the temple was for God and toward God
Which side would you have taken the side of the priests worshipping in the temple or the side of the 'Gentile dog'?
In the holy city everything was proper and nice, but in the Gentile world there was a Gentile woman who was considered as a dog
By this we can see that from the creation through the establishing of the kingdom, Christ took a number of basic steps
Hades is the place where the dead are kept, and the gates of Hades is a term denoting the authority of death, which is the power of Satan
As the Lord Jesus is the embodiment of life, so Satan is the embodiment of death, represented in Matthew 16:18 by the gates of Hades
Wherever you find the building of the church, there will be warfare, because the power of death will rise up against it
Eventually we can see five points regarding the church the rock the stones the building the defeat of the gates of Hades and the kingdom
If we are going to realize the builded church today not a church in doctrine or in talk the church must be built up with many living stones
If we read Matthew 162326 very carefully we will see the connection between four items the natural mind the self the soulish life and Satan
The Lord Jesus rebuked Peter for being Satan because Peter's mind was on the things of men, not on the things of God
Wherever there is the soullife there is the self wherever there is the self there is the mind wherever there is the mind there is Satan
If in any church there is a dissenting situation, that situation is of the mind, of Satan, of the self, and of the soulish life
In this short portion of the Word, we have two descriptions of Satan: the gates of Hades and the self in the mind with the soul-life
Peter became occupied by Satan because he forgot his spirit and exercised his mind, expressing his dissenting thought
Your dissenting thoughts, like Peter's, may spring from a good intention, but you are nevertheless possessed by Satan
The Lord Jesus told the disciples that He was going to Jerusalem to be killed and to be raised on the third day
Many dear saints have damaged the church and yet claim that they had a good intention, that they loved the church
Constantly, by the grace of the Lord, you need to tell yourself: 'Little self, remember that your place is on the cross
One saint in the Lord said something that is very good: 'If you will bear the cross, the cross eventually will bear you'
The Lord Jesus told Peter that his mind was not set on the things of God and that he needed to deny himself and follow the Lord
We have already considered the five foolish virgins who were truly saved, but who were not allowed to enter into the marriage feast
Philippians 3:20-21 will be completely fulfilled; our physical body will be changed into the likeness of the glorious body of Christ
On the one side is the mountaintop with the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus, and on the other side is the plain with the demons
In Matthew 17:24-27 we have Peter's answer to the poll tax gatherer who inquired if the Lord Jesus paid the temple tax
As we have seen on another occasion , Peter answered wrongly because this tribute was not paid to the Roman Empire but to the temple
The temple belonged to God and as the Son of God the Lord Jesus was the Son of the Owner of the temple and thus had no need to pay tribute
With the Lord Jesus, in a sense, it is permissible to pay the tribute and, in another sense, it is permissible not to pay the tribute
Could you imagine that a great teacher like Paul had such a liberal attitude in the matter of keeping of days and in the matter of eating?
If we asked Paul whether we should observe the days or not, he would reply, 'You may observe them or you may not'
It makes no difference whether you keep the days or not, and it makes no difference whether you are baptized one time or three times
You were required to observe the Sabbath every seventh day and to follow the dietary regulations for your entire life
In Acts 10:9-15 the Holy Spirit abolished the dietary regulations, and in Galatians 5:2-6 the Apostle Paul abolished circumcision
In the same manner Christianity utilizes many such legalities to support itself as a religion but the Lord desires to abolish the legalities
We must exercise our faith and pray for others, sometimes with fasting, to cast out the demons and to rescue some of the possessed persons
The Lord Jesus answered, 'Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens'
If you desire to have the proper church life, the first thing you must realize is that there are no giants in the local churches
In Matthew 18:17 the Lord Jesus said that if anyone will not hear the church he should be considered as a Gentile and a tax collector
If we do not listen to the church, then in the eyes of the Lord and in the eyes of the church, we too become mean and defiled
In Matthew 18 we see a third aspect of the proper church life the little children living at home are quick and ready to forgive others
Peter considered that forgiving his brother seven times was sufficient, but the word of the Lord Jesus was 'seventy times seven'
Matters such as paying tribute and length of hair are not matters of morality, and we may be flexible concerning them
Also, in both the Old and the New Testaments, God never allowed any of His children to be involved in immorality
Following the incident with the children, we are told of a rich man who came to the Lord Jesus seeking eternal life
Now he was seeking after the zoe life, the divine and eternal life, which he thought he could inherit by doing good
The Lord Jesus said to His disciples, 'It is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of the heavens
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God'
When he heard, he compared it to what he and his brother had done in leaving the fishing wharf and following the Lord Jesus
The Lord Jesus had said to Peter and Andrew, 'Follow Me,' and immediately they had given up everything and followed Him
The Lord did not act according to the commercial principle which says that the more you pay, the more you receive
The Lord was washing away that commercial concept by saying, 'Many that are first shall be last, and the last first'
The Lord Jesus next spoke a parable to further illustrate the impossibility of earning the kingdom or of paying a certain price for it
He told of a householder who had a vineyard and who went out early in the morning, as the ancient custom was, to hire workmen
The time early in the morning denotes the time when the Lord Jesus called Peter, Andrew, James, and John to enter into the kingdom
You may be a doctor or a professor, but if you do not give up everything for the kingdom, the Lord considers you an idle person
If we sacrifice all that we are and have for God's kingdom, it means that we have been hired by God to work for Him
We do need to give up all frustrations and entanglements, but the Lord will not give us the kingdom as a commercial transaction
Never consider that what you have given up to follow the Lord amounts to the price that will purchase the kingdom
If He asks us to give up something, we will rid ourselves of all entanglements, frustrations, and distractions in order to go along with Him
Now we need to consider several passages in Matthew which are connected by a single underlying thought: ambition for position
The man which God created did not have the nature of being ambitious, of desiring leadership and greatness, or of possessing authority
Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel 28 reveal that Satan was originally a high cherub, an archangel, who was quite good when he was created
Within the human nature of both men and women is the ambition of being greater than others, of being the 'chief'
The other ten were very indignant over the request of these two, indicating that all twelve disciples were exactly the same
Before He rebuked the hypocrites, He told His disciples not to take the way of the Pharisees who were always ambitious
Eventually he left the Lord's recovery and started a meeting in his home, getting a traveling preacher to be the minister
My concern is not to pass on the doctrinal knowledge of this portion of the Word, but to point out its significance in life
The significance of this instance of the Lord's walk is that, although He was King, He did not assume any form or appearance
The disciples were ambitious for authority and position, but the Lord Jesus conducted Himself in an unassuming way
They reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, he will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?
According to the parable, the rebellious ones realized that the heir had come and were saying, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him'
The Lord went on to say, 'Have you never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the cornerstone
They would kill Him out of hatred, but afterward He would become the resurrected cornerstone for God's building
He is the chief cornerstone for the building of the church, but He is the stumbling stone to the Jewish people
According to Daniel 2:34-35, He will be the stone from heaven that will fall upon the earthly nations and break them into pieces
Matthew 22 continues the Lord's answer to the chief priests and elders who asked Him about His source and authority
He said, 'The kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing the fruits of it'
The parable begins in this way: 'The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man, a king, who made a marriage feast for his son'
After this, He was killed, and as the ox and the fatted beast, He was cooked and prepared for the marriage feast
Some of those who heard were preoccupied with fields and business and made light of the invitation while others abused and killed His slaves
God sent many servants to the Gentile world, to all the earth, inviting people to come into the enjoyment of the kingdom
In Matthew 22:11-12 and in Revelation 19:8, the marriage garment signifies the practical righteousnesses of the saints
One signifies Christ Himself as our righteousness, and the other signifies our practical daily walk as our covering garment
When Christ has become our experience, He will be the subjective, experiential righteousness which qualifies us to attend the marriage feast
Christianity mostly preaches to people about being called, but hardly mentions anything about the Lord's selection
These two parties customarily fought against one another, but on this occasion they cooperated in an attempt to entangle Christ
Regardless of whether or not it is lawful to pay the tax, as long as they had the money, it means they were the ones who had been caught
Next to confront the Lord Jesus were the Sadducees, the ancient modernists, who raised a question concerning resurrection
The Lord acknowledged their answer as correct but then asked them, 'How then does David in spirit call Him Lord'?
He is a human being, a man, and according to his human nature, he is the descendant of David, the Son of David
For the Lord Jesus to sit at the right hand of God means that He has been resurrected and has ascended into the heavens
We see a wonderful Christ: He has humanity and divinity; He is the resurrected One, the ascended One, and the coming One
Many Christians are like those poor Jews who were discussing religion, politics, and the interpretation of the Bible
The Lord Jesus revealed Himself to His opposers, but none of them saw the vision because they were filled with their indignation against Him
Christ is the Son of God, the chief cornerstone for the building of the church, the stumbling stone, and the smiting stone
He has been crucified, resurrected, and has ascended to the right hand of God where He is waiting until all His enemies are subdued
Many of the basic aspects of the kingdom were sown as seeds in the book of Matthew and developed in the following books of the New Testament
The seed is in Matthew the sprouting is in Acts the growth and blossoming are in the Epistles and the maturity and harvest are in Revelation
After being revealed in such a way the Lord Jesus entered Jerusalem for the last time to accomplish Gods eternal purpose by being crucified
The Lord Jesus entered Jerusalem and, like the Passover lamb, was examined by the people for several days preceding the Passover
He was tested by the leaders of the people the chief priests, the elders, the Pharisees, the Herodians, the Sadducees, and a lawyer
As a result of this testing, the examiners themselves were exposed that they were distracted from Christ and occupied with worthless things
All of the people with high attainment, knowledge, and education surrounded the Lord Jesus and examined Him, presuming themselves to be wise
As He answered all of the people who were testing Him, the Lord Jesus revealed Himself in an all-inclusive way
In such a simple and hidden way the Lord Jesus revealed Himself as the Son of God and as the Heir of God's universal inheritance
In Acts 4:11 Peter said that Christ was the stone rejected by the builders and raised up in resurrection to be the head of the corner
The Lord Jesus answered that He was the Son of God the Heir of Gods inheritance the cornerstone the stumbling stone and the smiting stone
We know this because He is also the Bridegroom, the focus of God's pleasure, the very center of God's happiness and joy
A good number did respond, however, by accepting the invitation and coming to the marriage feast with joy and pleasure
In the Bible there are these two aspects of Christ: on the one hand He is our food; on the other hand He is our clothing
The present enjoyment of Christ today is a foretaste, and the future enjoyment of Christ will be the full taste
The Lord Jesus has not saturated them, taken full possession of them, and spread Himself into all the inward parts of their being
At the time of the full manifestation of the kingdom, they will lack a marriage garment and will not be qualified for the marriage feast
In answering the foolish questions of the religious people, the Lord Jesus spontaneously revealed Himself in a full way
When they answered that Christ is the Son of David, the Lord then asked them, 'How then does David in spirit call Him Lord'?
He is man God the resurrected One the ascended One the coming One the victorious One and the One who will set up Gods kingdom over His enemy
Matthew is a book of the living Christ, a rich Christ, a practical Christ, a present Christ, and an experiential Christ
There is the great tree growing up out of proportion and not according to its kind, and there is the leaven corrupting the fine flour
If you do not realize the governing principle, it will be difficult for you to apprehend the real meaning of these verses
The Lord's discourse on the mount is divided into seven sections which reveal seven aspects of the life of the children of the kingdom
They are ruled either by their family, by their school, by their corporation, or by their municipal government
The six items of the inward condition begin with the first condition in the spirit and end with the sixth condition in the heart
The first item of the inward condition is in Matthew 5:3: 'Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
Our spirit is the organ within us created by God for us to contact Him, to take Him in, to receive Him, and to contain Him
To teach people to contact God without using their spirit is like trying to train people to run without using their feet
In the opening word of His discourse on the mountain the Lord said Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens
Peter, John, and the other Apostles surely needed to mourn because of the poor situation among the Pharisees and Judaizers
When we look at Christ we are happy and rejoicing, but when we look at ourselves and others around us, we have to mourn
If we are willing to suffer and are happy to lose something we will receive a reward the inheritance of the earth
In our spirit and in our heart, in our inward being, we have to be right with God and right with others according to God
When we have the proper inward condition toward the Lord, something will spontaneously come out as the outward state
If you exercise to keep yourself right with God and right with others according to God, you will be persecuted
It may be that because you have turned to the Lord's recovery, some of your relatives and friends have spoken evil concerning you
After Matthew covers the character and the influence of the children of the kingdom, he covers the law of the children of the kingdom
The children of the kingdom are not under the written law the law of Moses in the Old Testament but under the restriction of the law of life
We know this because at the end of this section of the Lord's discourse, He said that we are children of the Father
In this section there is a contrast of comparison between living under the law of Moses and living under the law of life
The law of life which says, 'Do not resist one who is evil' , surpasses Moses' law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
Eventually this section of the Lord's discourse ends by telling us that as children of the Father we must be perfect as the Father
Our natural life simply cannot produce the six items of the inward condition and the three items of the outward state
When we read that the kingdom of the heavens requires surpassing righteousness, perhaps our thought is, 'Who can do this'?
In Matthew 5:20 the Lord Jesus mentioned the surpassing righteousness as a requirement for entering into the kingdom of the heavens
Unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and the Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens'
According to Revelation 19, the Bride will be clothed in fine linen, which is the righteousnesses of the saints
As we eat Him and enjoy Him day by day, He will have the opportunity to spread into our being and transform us
To receive Christ into us qualifies us for salvation; to have Christ matured within us qualifies us for the marriage feast
If we give Him the opportunity to mature within us, we will certainly participate in the harvest, the full coming of the kingdom
Receiving Christ into us qualifies us for salvation; allowing Christ to mature in us qualifies us for the marriage feast
The children of the kingdom do good deeds, and in their deeds there is no mixture, falsehood, hypocrisy, or pretension
The rich members, grasping an opportunity to display their wealth and generosity, would stand and offer a large amount of money
In Matthew 6:3 the Lord said that when we give alms we should not let our left hand know what our right hand is doing
When she learned of the church's need for such a piece of property, she had the desire to offer that land to the church
Eventually, she decided to offer the property to the church for one-half of its value, which was between $25,000 and $30,000
The transaction was completed with the church paying half this amount, and the title deed being transferred to the church
Eventually, the deal was cancelled, with the title deed being returned to the family and the money being returned to the church
In all the years in China where there was a different method of taxation we did not allow the saints to use personal checks for the offering
The Lord Jesus said, 'When you fast, anoint your head and wash you face, so that you may not appear to men to be fasting'
The Lord's wisdom will then be with us, and we will be clear how much we should save for the future and for our children
The governing principle is that to lay up treasures on earth is against God's economy and expresses a kind of unbelief in His mercy and care
The children of the kingdom trust in their Father for their living even as the birds of the heaven and lilies of the field do
He used the birds to illustrate the Lord's care for our eating and the lilies to illustrate the Lord's care for our clothing
We should be like the birds in the air and the lilies on the earth, trusting our Father in the heavens to take care of us
Matthew 6:33 says, 'But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you'
Our attitude toward mammon, or riches, is that we do not serve it as we serve God, and that we do not put our trust in it
We need to experience Christ as our practical righteousness in being right with God and right with others according to God
Some of the saints, however, feel free to pick up books, open the drawers, the cupboards, and even the refrigerator
We should not think that after gossiping there is no further problem, for the Lord has said that our idle words will be judged
You may think that there is a little splinter in your brother's eye, but you do not realize there is a log in your eye
Because you have lost your discernment, you will give the holy things to the dogs and cast your pearls before the swine
You will be unable to detect the right times and the right persons with whom you should share the holy things of God
If we are talkative, we will speak without discernment, without restriction, and we will present the holy things of God to the wrong person
In Matthew 7:7-8 the Lord said that if we ask, we will receive; that if we seek, we will find; that if we knock, it shall be opened to us
It is easy to have the Lord's grace, but it is difficult to have the Lord's Person, and even more difficult to have the Lord's presence
Now we proceed to the last aspect of the kingdom life the grounds of the children of the kingdom of the heavens for their walk and work
According to our human concept, we may think that the gate at the beginning is narrow, but the way will broaden as we proceed
Concerning the seed, we need the life to come into us, but concerning the harvest, we need to enter into the life
We are camels by our natural birth, and the eye of the needle is the narrow gate for us to enter into the maturity of the kingdom
As camels we have been fully loaded with worldly things, making it impossible for us to pass through the eye of a needle
When the rain descends from above, when the river rises, and when the winds blow, that house will be destroyed
You yourself will be saved, but that your work all that you have accomplished after being saved will be destroyed
If we enter the broad gate and walk the broad way, our work and walk will be destroyed, and we will miss the marriage feast
If we take the narrow gate and the constricted way this will lead us into life into the maturity of the zoe life the harvest of the kingdom
The second ground of the children of the kingdom for their walk and work is the fruit brought forth of a good tree
In Matthew 7:23, it is not that the Lord did not know them, but that the Lord did not allow them to do those works
Now we can understand why the Lord will not deny the claims of people who will come to Him saying that they have done miracles in His name
The only justification available to us is to seek the kingdom, because the unique will of God is to have the kingdom
If our work is built upon the word of Christ as the rock, it will stand when the rain descends, the floods come, and the winds blow
The rains signify the tests from God; the floods signify the tests from man; and the winds signify the tests from Satan
While Matthew mentions our spirit and our heart in a very brief way, the Epistles mention our spirit and our heart in many verses
Based upon this principle, we can see that Matthew 5, 6, and 7 are not simply related to a future dispensation
In order to understand this matter of the kingdom of the heavens, we must realize that there are three aspects of the kingdom
If we do not see these three aspects we can never fully understand the real definition of the kingdom in Matthew
These three aspects are: the reality of the kingdom, the outward appearance of the kingdom, and the manifestation of the kingdom
The reality of the kingdom and the appearance of the kingdom are present today, but the manifestation of the kingdom will be in the future
They are poor in spirit, pure in heart, hungering for righteousness, meek, merciful, and have the surpassing righteousness
Surrounding this innermost circle is a second circle that represents the church which is composed of all real Christians
Because they have been bought by the blood of the Lamb and because they have been reborn of the Holy Spirit, they are real Christians
They are in the church because they are real believers, but they are not in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
The next largest group are the real Christians who are the church, and the smallest group are the overcoming ones within the church
Following this section there is the second section of the kingdom of the heavens, the manifestation of the kingdom
After the dispensation of the church, the Lord will come back, and the kingdom of the heavens will be manifested
The lower part is composed of the revived nation of Israel in the center teaching the nations how to serve God
Another verse says, 'Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
These three parables are: the parable of the tares, the parable of the mustard seed becoming a great tree, and the parable of the leaven
In contrast to the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, these three parables show us matters which are not real and genuine
In the second parable, Matthew 13:24-30, the Lord Jesus began to use the phrase, 'The kingdom of the heavens was likened to
From the day of Pentecost thousands of believers were added to the church, and some false ones also were added
The Lord Jesus was on the cross for six hours, from nine o'clock in the morning until three o'clock in the afternoon
During the last three hours, from twelve noon until three o'clock, He was suffering, not at the hand of man, but at the hand of God
According to the Lord's clear definition in Matthew 13:38, the field where the tares grow is not our heart or the church, but the world
He said the tares should be allowed to grow and live in the world lest in uprooting them some real wheat be damaged
Some have thought that the field is the church and that it is permissible for the wheat and the tares to be together in the church
By comparing what is mentioned in Matthew 13 with what is mentioned in Matthew 5, 6, and 7, we can see that these are two different aspects
In chapter thirteen with the tares, the great tree, and the leaven there is the outward appearance of the kingdom
The little herb should produce something for eating but the great tree has simply become a lodging place for the evil one
The Roman Catholic Church takes the real things of Christ, represented by the meal, and adds false things, represented by the leaven
Because she was a young Christian and did not know better, she bought a so-called picture of the Lord Jesus and placed it in her room
In the Far East, although many have never called upon the name of the Lord Jesus, they still celebrate Christmas as a holiday
In order not to disappoint the people, the Roman Catholic Church suggested that the festival be kept as a celebration to the birth of Christ
Based upon this principle, the Roman Catholic Church has added many things to Christ in order to make Him easier to take
Among Christians today, there are all kinds of leaven: leaven in doctrine, leaven in practice, leaven in power, and leaven in authority
In Matthew 16:6 and Mark 8:15 three kinds of leaven are mentioned: the leaven of the Pharisees, of the Sadducees, and of the Herodians
We may also say that when the kingdom becomes matured within us, this maturity will bring the Lord's second coming
All three are related to the Lord's second coming, and all three are related also to the manifestation of the kingdom
The parable of the ten virgins is related to the manifestation of the kingdom because it says that the kingdom is likened unto ten virgins
Because of the lack of revelation in past centuries, many Christians have considered that the five foolish virgins were not saved
The five foolish virgins are real Christians, but they will miss something at the Lord's coming in the manifestation of the kingdom
If we would be those who love the Lord and who are waiting for His coming back, we need the infilling of the Spirit for the maturity of life
Those in the first category received five talents, those in the second received two talents, and those in the third received one talent
Because they do not have a large portion, they tend to let the more gifted ones replace them in their function
Rather, when you come in, your sensation may be that you have nothing, but the Lord still requires you to function
Let us also read Matthew 2530 And cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth
To say that a person can be lost due to slothfulness would indicate that salvation is not by grace but by works
The servant who received five talents was made ruler over many things, and he entered into the joy of his lord
In addition, the servant who received two talents was also made ruler over many things, and he entered into the joy of his lord
If we are faithful servants using the talents that the Lord Jesus has given us, when He returns He will reward us
If we are saved and then are slothful and not faithful to use the talents He has given us, when He comes back He will reckon with us
They have picked up verses concerning reward and punishment at the Lord's coming back and applied them to believers losing their salvation
The Bible says all three are servants, and the Bible says that the third servant, because of his slothfulness, suffered some punishment
The first aspect is the reality of the kingdom, and the second aspect is the outward appearance of the kingdom
The last section of Matthew concerns the manifestation of the kingdom when the Lord Jesus will come back to the earth
When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will bring the kingdom with Him, and that will be the manifestation of the kingdom
They show us that, at the manifestation of the kingdom, some of the saints will enter into the joy of the Lord, and others will not
The servant with one talent missed the joy and also was put into darkness where there was weeping and gnashing of teeth
Some Christians today do not like to receive the book of Matthew, saying it relates only to the dispensation of the Jews
If you hang a plaque of John 3:16 upon your wall, then surely you should also hang up a plaque of Matthew 25:28-30
While the nobleman was gone into the far country he distributed his capital to his servants so that they could do business for him
It is difficult for us to realize the significance of these serious verses because we have been saturated with other kinds of teachings
Because of this, when we come to these verses it is difficult for us to be impressed and to absorb them in a proper way
Verses 46 and 47 say that the lord of that servant 'will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers
That servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes'
The Lord went on to say that the servant who knew not and yet committed things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes
Unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required; and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more'
When the Lord Jesus returns and the kingdom is manifested, He will exercise His judgment over all the Christians
According to the parable of the ten virgins, if we are the foolish ones, we will miss the enjoyment of the marriage feast
It tells us that when the Lord Jesus will reign during the millennium, His Apostles such as Peter, James, and John will also reign with Him
In Matthew 19:28 there is something further; that is, when the Lord Jesus comes to be the King, His Apostles will be co-kings
From this we can see that there are three aspects of the kingdom the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation of the kingdom
It indicates that during the time when the Lord reigns in His kingdom, some will sit with Him and reign with Him
In Matthew there is the seed of being co-kings with Christ, and in Revelation there is the harvest of being co-kings with Christ
All those faithful ones the martyrs will be raised up resurrected and will be cokings with Christ ruling over the earth for a thousand years
Many Christians like to talk about the second coming of the Lord Jesus and also about the coming of God's kingdom
Unfortunately, many times they talk about these things according to their concepts, not according to the pure Word in the Holy Scriptures
If, however, we come back to the pure Word, we will see that the above verses are the development of Matthew 16:27
From reading the pure Word in the Scriptures, we can see something of the Lord's revelation and also of His concept
Matthew 16:27 does not say that, when the Son of Man comes in the glory of His Father, He will save everyone who believes in Him
We must be strongly impressed that when the Lord Jesus comes back, He will reward every man according to his doings
You may be so happy that the Lord Jesus is coming and that you are going to meet Him, but when you meet Him, will He reward you?
The best translation of these verses is: 'Wherefore we are ambitious, that, whether present or absent, we may be well-pleasing to Him
Some might argue that because the Lord's redemption is complete, that He died for them, they have no need to suffer any punishment
It is not to decide whether they are saved or lost, but to decide whether they should receive a reward or suffer a loss
Many fundamental Christians do not like to consider that a Christian could be punished or chastised at the Lord's coming
Even those who admit that Christians need some chastisement from the Lord consider that it occurs only in this age and not in the next
That servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes'
These verses show that not only during this age, but also after the Lord comes back, He will still deal with His children
Some Christians think that after they die or after the Lord comes back, the possibility of punishment or chastisement will be past
If you do not repent and confess today, but wait until that day when you stand before the judgment seat, it will be too late
You may try to repent and confess then, but the Lord will tell you that the dispensation, the time for repenting and confessing is over
When the Lord Jesus comes back, no one will be saved by repenting and confessing because at that time it will be too late
If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire'
Please remember this was a letter written to the Gentile believers in the city of Corinth, which was a city in Greece
Near the end of Paul's life, just before he was martyred, he had the assurance that he would receive the reward
He realized that the time of his departure was at hand, and he had the assurance that he had fought a good fight and had finished his course
In 1 Peter 5:4 he said, 'And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away'
The seed was sown in Matthew 16; it grew and blossomed in the Epistles, and now it is harvested in Revelation 22:12
If you do not feed on the Lord today and let Him saturate you, you will have problems when the Lord comes back; He will deal with you
If you do not learn the lessons today, you will miss the manifestation of the kingdom because you will not be qualified to enter
At that time you will still have to be matured, but it will be too late for entering into the manifestation of the kingdom
According to the pure Word of the Bible, we are told clearly that we must be saturated with the Lord, and we must be matured
Although the Lord does not give us the details of how He will deal with us at that time, He does give us the clear principle
The principle is that after we are saved we must go along with Him, enjoy Him, be saturated with Him, and be matured in Him
If we will cooperate with the Lord, when He returns we will receive something in addition to our salvation as a prize
Only those who are living today in the reality of the kingdom will be transferred into the manifestation of the kingdom in that day
Those who have been faithful will be commended and rewarded, but those who have been unfaithful will suffer a loss and a punishment
We have already pointed out that the kingdom has three aspects: the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation
During this present age, the reality of the kingdom and the appearance of the kingdom progress at the same time
At His coming back He will deal first with the appearance of the kingdom by binding it and putting it into the fire
When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will bind the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens and throw it into the fire
The transfer of the reality of the kingdom into the manifestation of the kingdom will be accomplished by the rapture of the saints
Most Christians realize that at the end of this age the Lord Jesus will come back, and the believers will be raptured
Not only have they done much damage to the Lord's kingdom, they also have become an insult and blasphemy to the Lord Himself
These false Christians comprise the appearance of the kingdom which will be burned up at the Lord's coming back
All those who are in the church have been called, but only those who are living in the reality of the kingdom will be chosen
May the Lord have mercy upon us so that we would be neither the false Christians nor the defeated Christians, but the overcoming ones
When the Lord Jesus returns, all of the real Christians, both the overcoming ones and the defeated ones, will be gathered to the Lord
In this parable, the world is signified by the field, and the third heavens are signified by the farmer's home
Thessalonians 4:17 says that those who are alive and remain will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
There is a great difference between the two, just as there is a great difference between the barn and the home of the farmer
The Lord Jesus will send forth His angels to bind the tares to be thrown into the fire and to gather all the wheat into the barn
Matthew 13 says the wheat will be gathered into the barn, and 1 Thessalonians 4:17 says we all will meet the Lord in the air
The firstfruit went, not to the air, that is, to the barn, but directly to the Father's home in the third heavens
The man-child, the overcomers, will not be caught up to the air, but to the throne of God in the third heavens
Most Bible students realize that these three and one-half years will be the second half of the last week mentioned in Daniel 9
The man-child will be raptured in the middle of the last week, which means after his rapture there will be another three and one-half years
After the reaping of the firstfruits, and the reaping of the general harvest, some of the grains will still not be ripe
In a wheat field, the grains which ripen first are those nearer the center of the field, whereas the grains on the edges ripen last
According to the description in Revelation 14, the firstfruit are the saints who are saturated with the Lord Jesus
My heart aches for many of the Lord's children who seem to be somewhat ignorant, careless, and dull concerning the need to be matured
There is no need for us to figure out the time that the firstfruit will be taken away and the time that the harvest will be taken away
May the Lord preserve us so that we will simply care for the pure and real revelation of the principles as a warning
According to this illustration, we can also see that the rapture is not something which will occur as an accident
To use our illustration once more, the crop can be transferred into the barn only by growing and becoming ripe
Philippians 3:20-21 tells us that at His coming back He will transfigure our body, 'conforming it to the body of His glory'
While he was living on the earth his spirit was fully occupied by the Lord, and his soul was fully saturated and occupied by the Lord
At His coming back this troublesome physical body will be transfigured into a wonderful, mysterious, and beautiful body
The rapture is not merely a kind of catching away into the air, but a catching away with the transfiguration of the body
Our whole body will be saturated, fully possessed, and fully transfigured by the Lord Jesus as our life and glory
Their thought is that while we are working here on the earth, suddenly the Lord will come back and snatch us away to the heavens
They would exhort people not to go to the movies lest, when the Lord Jesus comes to snatch them away, He find them there
He will do two things at once: while He is taking us away to the air, He will come from within us to swallow up our bodies
They think that when the Lord Jesus comes back all of the real believers will be taken suddenly from the earth into the air at the same time
In Matthew 13 there is the harvest, and in Revelation 14 there are both the firstfruit and the major part of the harvest
Some who are at the corner or the edges of the field will still be green and need a further time to become mature
When the major part of the crop is ripe and ready for the harvest, that will be the time for the Lord Jesus to come and reap
It is very clear, from Matthew to Revelation, that the New Testament teaches that the rapture will occur not merely once but several times
By reading Revelation carefully we can realize that the great tribulation will probably begin from the first trumpet
Once these four seals are completed, the fifth and sixth seals will come, and after these are finished, the seventh seal will come
Remember that the great tribulation will begin with the first trumpet and will continue until the last trumpet
All the dead believers will be resurrected and all the living believers will be raptured at the seventh trumpet
In Matthew 7:24-27 the Lord Jesus said that the rain would descend, that the rivers would come, and that the winds would blow
They will be so clear that they need to love the Lord and to eat of Christ, not only three times a day, but perhaps ten times a day
At that time, in a sense, the Lord will not have left the third heavens, but His parousia will begin at that time
By studying all the verses which use this word parousia, we can see that the parousia of the Lord is a long-term matter
It begins from the time that the firstfruit are brought into the heavens and it will continue until the Lord appears physically to the world
At that time the Antichrist with his army will be on the earth fighting against the Lord and the Lord's people
After the rapture and after the judgment seat, the Lord will choose all the overcomers to come with Him to fight against the Antichrist
Some Christians would argue for a pre-tribulation rapture and others would argue for a post-tribulation rapture
The majority will be raptured during the tribulation because they need the tribulation to cause them to mature
To say that all the believers will be raptured all at one time before the tribulation or after the tribulation is absolutely unscriptural
If we desire to be matured we must take Christ in again and again, eating of Him, and allowing Him to saturate us all the time
The fighting army of the Lord Jesus is composed of the overcoming saints who are living in the reality of the kingdom
When the Lord Jesus returns the false believers will be bound into bundles and cast into the fire terminating all the tares in Christianity
The overcoming ones will be chosen to fight the battle with the Lord to recover the earth for the Lord's reigning
According to Matthew 22:13 and 25:30, these will be cast into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
When the Lord Jesus returns He will first terminate the false Christians, burning up all the false Christians, the tares
At His judgment seat in the air, He will exercise His judgment over all the real Christians to decide who will be selected and chosen
After defeating Antichrist and his army, the overcomers will be His co-kings reigning with Him in His kingdom on the earth
Only the overcomers, those who are living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today, will have a share in its manifestation
Mankind, according to 1 Corinthians 10:32, is divided into three groups of people: the Jews, the Gentiles, and the church
These verses indicate that, at the time of the Lord's coming back, the nations will be stirred up to attack Jerusalem
According to their realization they will gather to attack Jerusalem, but in God's purpose, they will be gathered there to be judged
These verses also show us that when the Lord Jesus comes back, the nations will be gathered to attack Jerusalem
According to Zechariah 14:3-4, when the Lord Jesus returns to rescue the Jewish people, His feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives
When it seemed there was no escape, the Lord parted the waters of the Red Sea and the Israelites marched through the midst of the sea
According to 2 Thessalonians 2:8 the Lord Jesus will destroy Antichrist and his armies with the breath out of His mouth
The vision of that great image covers the entire Gentile period beginning with Babylon and ending when the Lord Jesus returns
Due to their idolatry and degradation, God sent King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon to destroy Jerusalem and the temple
In Ezra and Nehemiah, God is called the God of the heavens because His kingdom on the earth had been terminated
Both Daniel and Revelation tell us that after the Roman Empire there will be ten nations, signified in Revelation by the ten horns
While there are many other verses in the Old Testament concerning this matter, these are the representative verses
According to Revelation 14:17-20, the clusters of the vine of the earth were gathered and cast into the great winepress of the fury of God
The winepress was trodden outside the city, and the blood came out of the winepress up to the bridles of the horses
While the Gentiles are preparing and collecting an army, the Lord Jesus will sound out a warning to the believers
The kings from the rising of the sun will not be Europeans or people from the Middle East, but they will be from the east of the Euphrates
The four angels were loosed who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they might kill the third part of men
The third part of men was killed by these three plagues, by the fire and the smoke and the sulphur proceeding out of their mouths'
It says that one-third of the part of men will be killed and that the number of cavalry troops will be two hundred million
Remember that these are not the armies under the Antichrist, but the armies from the East who have passed through the river Euphrates
These armies from the East will first come to the area of the Euphrates River, today's Iraq and Iran; then they will come to Jerusalem
While the Antichrist will be attacking Jerusalem, the two hundred million horsemen from the East will also come to Jerusalem
The armies of the earth will be gathered together at one time just like grapes from the vineyard are gathered into the winepress
According to Revelation 11:15, the kingdom of this world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ
During the age of the church the Lord has temporarily given up the people of Israel and treats them like the Gentiles
At the end of this age, according to Zechariah 13 and Romans 11, the Jewish nation will be revived and will turn to the Lord
Although the Jews will be regenerated and saved, they will not be transformed and their bodies will not at that time be transfigured
Yea, many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the Lord
During the millennium, the Gentiles will be the nations and the converted Jews will be the priests, teaching them to worship God
Today the focus of the world's attention is upon the Middle East situation with the little nation of Israel as the center
At the same time two hundred million horsemen will come from the Far East, passing through the river Euphrates
The armies will be formed in the territory of Europe and the horsemen will be assembled in the Far East during the time of the tribulation
We have seen that some of the more matured saints will be taken as firstfruit to the third heavens before the tribulation
They will come with the Lord Jesus to the air, and the rest of the harvest will be caught up to the air to meet with them
Some of the Gentiles will be left alive after the battle of Armageddon, and they will become the peoples, the nations, upon the earth
The Lord Jesus will set up Jerusalem as His capital, and from His throne will reign as King over the whole earth
The matured ones will be caught up into the air, along with the resurrected believers, where the Lord will exercise His judgment over them
At that time some of them will be chosen to be the overcoming ones who will be the Lord's army to fight against the Antichrist
Some of the Christians will be the defeated ones and, because they are defeated, they will suffer some punishment
Although so many horsemen and soldiers will have been destroyed by the Lord, some people of the nations will be left alive
If it is a judgment according to the gospel, it will be because they did not repent and believe in the Lord Jesus
The judgment of the nations at that time will be based upon how they treated the Lord's little brothers during the time of the tribulation
One group will be the real Christians, represented by the sheep; the other group will be the false Christians, represented by the goats
According to their concept, the good ones will be saved to enter into the kingdom, and the bad ones will be cast into the lake of fire
With the Gentiles gathered before Him, the Lord will separate them one from the other as the shepherd divides the sheep from the goats
They will be told to fear God because the time of judgment is coming and to worship God because He is their Creator
The eternal gospel will be preached by the angel at the very time when the Antichrist is forcing people to worship him
While Antichrist is forcing people to worship him, an angel from the air will warn people not to worship him, but to worship God
The saints here will include two peoples: the Jews who keep the commandments of God and the Christians who have the faith of Jesus
In other words, during the time of the tribulation the Antichrist will set up his image, forcing people to worship it as an idol
Those peoples of the nations who care for the little brothers of Christ during that time will be considered as the sheep
The first six parables in Matthew 13 are related mostly to the Christians, with a small part related to the Jews
Both Acts 10:42 and 2 Timothy 4:1 tell us that the Lord Jesus was appointed by God to judge the living and the dead
After the thousand years all the dead people of the nations will be resurrected and the Lord Jesus will judge them at the great white throne
From among the Jews the Lord Jesus desires to get a group of priests to teach people how to serve Him during the millennium
The nations who will be considered as sheep at that time will be preserved not by regeneration but by restitution
Today all the unbelievers on earth are degraded persons, but during the millennium all the nations will be restituted, restored persons
When applied to believers, the word regeneration means to be reborn, but when applied to the age it means restitution or restoration
After the Lord fully deals with the Christians, the Jews, and the nations, He will bring in the millennial kingdom
At the end of the millennium, however, some of the nations will be induced by Satan to rebel once more against God
During the time of the new heaven and the new earth, everything will be made new and the New Jerusalem will be the center
To the sheep, the nations, the millennial kingdom will be the kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world
We have also pointed out that the kingdom has three aspects: the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation
The first aspect of the character of the children of the kingdom under the ruling of the heavens is that they are poor in spirit
We need to read Romans 8:16 and 1:9: 'The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God
Matthew says that we need to be poor in spirit, and Romans 8:16 says the Spirit is bearing witness with our spirit
If we are not poor in spirit, empty in spirit, there is no way for the Spirit to come into us and witness in our spirit
By putting all these verses together, we can see from Romans and Revelation a rich development and harvest of the seed of the human spirit
For Paul to warn the church with tears night and day indicates he was mourning for the condition of the church and the believers
Ephesians 4:2 develops the matter of meekness: 'With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love'
From the context of Romans 12, showing mercy is listed as a gift along with teaching, leading, exhorting, and prophesying
The seed of being pure in heart is developed in 2 Timothy 2:22c: 'With them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart'
That is, you must pursue righteousness, peace, and love with all those that call on the Lord out of a pure heart
The matter of making peace is developed in Hebrews 12:14: 'Pursue peace with all men, and holiness without which no one shall see the Lord'
To suffer for righteousness is simply to suffer for the kingdom, because God's kingdom is one of righteousness
These verses indicate that Paul was a brother willing to suffer everything for Christ, even the loss of his life
In Matthew 5 there is merely a lamp; in Revelation there is the full development of the lampstands shining in the darkness
Romans 14:17 says, 'For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
It was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints'
We have already pointed out that this righteousness will be the garment qualifying the Bride to attend the marriage feast of the Bridegroom
Peter 3:13 says, 'Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness'
Ephesians 4:32: 'And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as also God in Christ forgave you'
Because we are members one of another, we should put off the falsehood and speak truth each one with his neighbor
It continues in 12:17: 'Repaying no one evil for evil, taking forethought for things honorable in the sight of all men'
Paul develops this point further in 1 Corinthians 412b13a Being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we entreat
Corinthians 6:7 says, 'Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another
Concerning fasting, Acts 13:3 says, 'And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away'
These verses may be considered as the growth and development of the words spoken by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 6
From these verses, it is clear that the believers in the early church were not anxious concerning material things
They that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition
Let us judge one another no longer, but rather judge this, not to put a stumbling block or a cause of falling before the brother'
James 5:9 says, 'Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest you be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door'
James 2:13 says, 'For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath showed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment'
We must remember that if we are unmerciful to others now, one day the Lord Jesus will also be unmerciful to us
We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honorable, but we are despised
In 2 Corinthians 11:23b-27 Paul says: 'In labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft
Let us also read Ephesians 5:8-9: 'For you were once darkness, but now light in the Lord; walk as children of light '
According to the context of Romans 12, it is clear that the will of God is to have the Body life, the church, or we may say the kingdom
The Lord Jesus said that we must build our house on the solid ground which is able to stand testing from three directions
We know this because the conclusion of the Lord's word in His discourse on the mount concerning the reality of the kingdom is the building
We should not consider that all these aspects of the reality of the kingdom are something we ourselves can work out
We simply need to open ourselves to Him, to cooperate with Him, to take Him in and enjoy Him, and to let Him out
Some people are indifferent, considering that it does not make much difference whether Christians are real or false
The Lord Jesus will send His angels to bind the tares into bundles and to throw all of them into the lake of fire
The Lord Jesus clearly said He would bind them into bundles and throw them into the fire, which means the lake of fire
Today many pastors and ministers are indifferent as to whether their members are real Christians or false ones
As long as they have a good membership, a good crowd, good attendance, and as long as the money is coming in, they are satisfied
He said that some of these would even arise from among them to speak perverse things and draw away disciples after them
Let us also read 2 Corinthians 111315 For such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ
It is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works'
Truly, if we have false brethren in the church, they will really be a kind of suffering and a real peril to us
Paul mentions the same kind of thing in Philippians: 'Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision'
Verses 17-22: 'These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved forever
What awful, terrible, and ugly terms are used to describe these kinds of false Christians: the wolves, the dogs, and the swine
Now let us read 2 John 7: 'For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
Let us continue in Jude with verses 816 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignities
These speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves
For they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah
Now let us read Revelation 2:2b: 'You have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false'
Although we will read only a few verses concerning the development of the great tree, they are all very, very significant
Although these two verses do not mention the great tree, they do have the word Pergamos, which means a high tower
According to church history, the church at Pergamos represents the state of the church beginning in the fourth century
313, Constantine, the emperor of the Roman Empire, embraced Christianity as his religion, causing the church to become very great
By the marriage of the Roman Empire with the church, the church increased greatly in both numbers and popularity
The result was that many, many unbelievers were baptized into Christianity, causing Christianity to become a great tree full of false ones
The harvest of the seed of the great tree is in Revelation 182 And he cried with a strong voice saying Fallen fallen is Babylon the great!
She has become a dwelling place of demons and a hold of every unclean spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird'
It is very meaningful that the reality of the kingdom ends with a city, and the appearance of the kingdom also ends with a city
Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?
Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things
Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money
Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee
For Simon to consider that the gift of God could be purchased with money indicated that his heart was not right
Ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you'
Are the antichrists like those mentioned in 2 John, who have gone forward and do not abide in the teaching of Christ
They do not believe that Christ died on the cross to accomplish redemption, was resurrected, and today is enthroned in the heavens
We should not allow them to remain among us unless they repent because it is an insult to the testimony of God
If even we or an angel out of heaven should preach to you a gospel besides that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed
In the ancient times, some pretended to be authorities in speaking or writing something concerning the Lord's coming back
In 2 Timothy 2:16-18 Paul says, 'But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness
Now let us read 2 Timothy 3:5-9: 'Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith
Hebrews 12:16 reads: 'Lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau, who for one meal gave up his birthright'
Now let us read 3 John 9-10: 'I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not
The Roman Catholic Church has repeatedly picked up something evil, pagan, dirty, satanic, and demonic to put into the truth of Christ
It holds a golden cup that in outward appearance seems right, but many abominations and fornications are hiding within
The gold, precious stone, and pearls are not the substance and inward reality of the great Babylon, but merely an outward covering
With the exception of Matthew and Revelation, Hebrews has more related to the kingdom than any other book in the New Testament
In that chapter a stone is cut out without hands which smites all the Gentile world, and eventually becomes a great mountain
It may sound strange to hear that the kingdom is the enlargement of Christ, but according to Daniel 2 the stone became the great mountain
The nation of Israel as a type begins with the first chapter of Exodus and ends with the last book of the Old Testament
They passed through the Red Sea and went into the wilderness where they ate manna and drank the water out of the cleft rock
The book of Hebrews does not tell us that the good land is Christ; instead it tells us that the good land is a rest
God's intention in bringing His people, Israel, into Canaan was not only for rest, but for the building up of the kingdom
Before that time, God was the God of heaven , and He was anxious and desirous to come down to earth to express Himself
Eventually, He brought His people out from the dominion of Satan, out of Egypt, and through the wilderness into the good land
God finally had a house upon earth within a city as a symbol of the kingdom in which He could dwell and express Himself
From that time we began to eat more and more of the Lord Jesus until eventually we enjoy Him to the full all the time
We receive Christ into us as our life, and this life rules in us gradually a little today and a little more tomorrow
Let us read Hebrews 18 But as to the Son Your throne O God is forever and ever and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom
The kingdom is the maturity of Christ as life to us, and it is the ultimate consummation of the enjoyment of Christ
If they were distracted from Christ and should neglect so great a salvation, they would suffer a kind of punishment from the Lord
The second section of the book, which is mainly chapters three and four, tells us that Christ is far superior to Moses and Joshua
Our body corresponds to Egypt; our soul corresponds to the wilderness; and our spirit, with Christ in it, corresponds to the good land
If we will forget about our soul and take care of our spirit, we will enjoy Christ in our spirit as the good land
Verse 11 says that we need to be diligent to enter into the rest, and verse 12 tells us how we may enter into the rest
Two living ones of that generation, Joshua and Caleb, and two dead ones, Jacob and Joseph, entered the good land
The third section of the book of Hebrews begins with the last verses of chapter four and goes through the end of chapter seven
He ministered not according to any regulation or commandment of the law, but according to the power of an indestructible life
He says that some of the saints have been enlightened, have partaken of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the heavenly gift
Paul's concept is that since the Hebrew believers had already laid the foundation, they simply needed to go on
We may illustrate this with a couple who are married: suppose after a time they are divorced and then later come back together
While they might say they were remarried, actually it is impossible for them to remarry because they are already married
After a year, the work is renewed, and instead of building upon that foundation, another foundation is laid beside the first
You have to tell that subtle one that you have the blood of the Lord Jesus and that you have the foundation already laid
He is our High Priest, not according to the order of Aaron, but according to the order of Melchisedec, able to save us to the uttermost
The fourth section, chapter eight through chapter ten, shows that Christ with His blood is much superior to the Old Covenant
At the time Hebrews was written, there was the danger that the Hebrew Christians might be convinced to go back to Judaism
They may have pointed out to the New Testament believers that the Old Covenant was given by God and was so wonderful
Hebrews 1026 says For when we sin willfully after receiving the full knowledge of the truth there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins
The proper understanding is that all of the sacrifices in the Old Testament were fulfilled when the Lord Jesus died on the cross
Paul also indicated that if the Hebrew Christians went back to offer the animal sacrifices, God would judge them
To go back to Judaism and offer the blood of an ox or a sheep for the sacrifice of sin is to make the blood of Christ common
In addition to this, to go back to Judaism and the animal sacrifices would constitute a kind of disobedience to the indwelling Spirit
To go back would make the Lord's blood something common and would constitute a kind of disobedience to the indwelling Spirit
If we do not go on to enjoy Christ in such a wonderful way, we will miss something, and we will suffer something
All these points in Hebrews are the development of the seeds sown in the book of Matthew concerning the kingdom
In 1:9 John told us that he was our brother and joint partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus
Revelation begins with the kingdom in chapter one and also declares the coming of the kingdom in chapter twelve
We have seen previously that the manifestation of the kingdom will simply be the maturity and the ultimate growth of the kingdom life
When we live in the reality of the kingdom in its ultimate state, that will be the manifestation of the kingdom
We all must come back to the pure Word of the Bible to see that the redemption of Christ is to bring in the kingdom
The church in a normal way is simply the reality of the kingdom, and this reality will consummate in the manifestation of the kingdom
In the last book of the New Testament, Revelation, the Lord Jesus sounded forth a call, not to the unbelievers, but to the believers
Many are still short of the Lord's purpose and not up to the normal level which is adequate to bring in the manifestation of the kingdom
Although the life of the Lord Jesus is within the believers, it has no possibility to grow because they are below the normal level
In chapters two and three of Revelation, in those epistles to the seven churches, the Lord Jesus issued a call to the overcomers
In His calling to the overcomers, the Lord Jesus revealed the proper condition of the church which is for the kingdom
They are still good at working for the Lord and doing many things for the Lord, but they do not love the Lord as they did at the beginning
The tree of life is also in the New Jerusalem, which shows us that the New Jerusalem is the real paradise of God
During the thousand years of the millennium, the New Jerusalem as the paradise of God will be a kind of reward
After the millennium, in the new heaven and the new earth, the New Jerusalem will be a blessing to all the saved ones
In the millennium it will be a reward to the overcomers, but eventually it will be a common blessing to all God's people
The Lord's promise is that if we will be overcomers now, we will be given to eat of the tree of life in the New Jerusalem
Foxe's Book of Martyrs tells how that many of these early Christians were persecuted and martyred for the sake of the Lord Jesus
The Lord Jesus came in to call out the overcomers and to promise them two things: the hidden manna and a white stone
The idols, the fornication, the evil teachings, and the practices of Jezebel are the leaven within the Roman Catholic Church
The outside of the cup is covered with gold, pearls, and precious stones, but the inside of the cup is full of abominations
The young man who will be the next King of England is daily and constantly under strict training and discipline
By this we can see that just to be a believer is not sufficient to be an overcomer and to rule and reign with Christ
In verse 2 He said they needed to be watchful and establish the things which remained, which were about to die
Nearly everything with fundamental Christianity the prayer, the Bible reading, the gospel preaching is weak and about to die
To have our name erased out of the book of life does not relate to the losing of salvation, but to the losing of a reward from the Lord
They are very proud, thinking that they have everything, that they know everything, and that they have seen everything
Eventually, the overcomers among them will feast with the Lord and will sit on the Lord's throne during the millennium
From these seven epistles, we can see that whether we receive a reward or suffer a loss is related to the kingdom
We may talk much about the Lord's coming and the prophecies related to it, but if we do not grow, He cannot come back
Hebrews 18 says But as to the Son Your throne O God is forever and ever and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom
Revelation also begins with the kingdom: 'I John, your brother and joint partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus'
Revelation continues with the church in the reality of the kingdom and ends with the kingdom in its manifestation
The way for us to realize Christ as the kingdom is to eat and drink of Him as the tree of life and the water of life
By reading these verses, we can see that the kingdom of God was there already, but that the kingdom of the heavens had not yet come
In Matthew 13:43, there is the Father's kingdom: 'Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father
Christ will be the Son of David to build up the house of God, and God will set up His throne with His kingdom forever
Before the Lord Jesus was born, the angel told His mother that her Son would be the successor to the throne of David
The kingdom of the heavens is divided into two periods: the period of its appearance and reality, and the period of its manifestation
Matthew 3:2, 4:17, and 10:7 show us several things: first, they show us that the kingdom of the heavens had a beginning
Even when the Lord Jesus sent out the twelve and the seventy disciples to preach the kingdom of the heavens had not yet arrived but was near
The period from John the Baptist to the formal arrival of the kingdom of the heavens was a period of transition
In the parable of the sower in Matthew 13, the Lord Jesus did not say, 'the kingdom of the heavens was likened to'
On the other hand once the church came into existence, Satan mixed the false Christians, the tares, with the real Christians
The reality and the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens began nearly at the same time with the church after Pentecost
Wherever there is the church, there are also the overcoming believers in the church living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
At the same time there are the false believers mixed in to produce the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens
The reality and the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens started together with the church and progressed together with the church
The reality and appearance of the kingdom of the heavens go along with the church and are dependent upon the church
When the Lord Jesus comes back and ends the church age, the reality and appearance of the kingdom of the heavens will also be ended
At that time the Lord Jesus will burn the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, that is, the so-called Christendom
At the same time the reality of the kingdom of the heavens will become the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
Daniel 2:44 shows that at the end of this age, the Lord will smite the nations of the earth into pieces in order to establish His kingdom
Corinthians 15:24-26 tells us that when the end has come, at the end of the millennium, the Lord will have destroyed all the powers of Satan
To summarize briefly, the kingdom of the heavens started with the church and ends together with the millennium
Before the church, there was not the kingdom of the heavens; and after the millennium, there will not be the kingdom of the heavens
The kingdom of the heavens is contained in the two dispensations of the church and the millennium, and it embraces these two dispensations
Matthew 21:43 shows that before the kingdom of the heavens came, the kingdom of God was already in the midst of the Israelites
They shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God'
Ephesians 5:5 and Revelation 11:15 reveal that the kingdom of the heavens in the future is also a part of the kingdom of God
According to the Scriptures, the kingdom of God stretches from eternity to eternity, without beginning and without ending
The kingdom of the heavens, which has a beginning and an ending, is a part of the kingdom of God, but its scope is narrower
Matthew 133133 1111 and 811 compared with Luke 131821 728 132829 prove also that the kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of God
We may call the kingdom of the heavens the kingdom of God, but we cannot call the kingdom of God the kingdom of the heavens
The kingdom of the heavens is the ruling of the heavens from the birth of the church to the end of the millennium
The millennium refers to the time after Christ comes again as King to rule the world and before the new heaven and new earth
The Lord will sit on the 'throne of David' and 'reign over the house of Jacob' , ruling over the nations on the earth during the millennium
The people to be ruled over by the kings in the future kingdom of the heavens are the ones who will be in the kingdom of Messiah
In the future, the kingdom of the heavens is the manifestation of the ruling of the heavens during the millennial kingdom
The church is neither a physical building, nor a place, nor an organization, nor a denomination, nor an evangelistic group
In the eyes of God and in the eyes of those who know God, there is a great difference between Christianity and the church
Christianity is that which men have organized in the world; the church is that which God has delivered out of the world
The church is the Body of Christ and the house of God as well, while the kingdom of the heavens is a heavenly kingdom
A believer in the church is a member of Christ enjoying Christ as life and also a child of God enjoying the blessing in the house of God
As long as one has the life of God, he is in the church, but he must have a heavenly living in order to be in the kingdom of the heavens
A saved one merely participates in the church; a saved and overcoming one participates both in the church and in the kingdom of the heavens
Not all of those who are in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens are in the church because not all of them are saved
The scope of the church and the scope of the kingdom of God during the dispensation of the church are the same
Not all of those who are in the church are in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, because not all of them are overcomers
The scope of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is narrower than that of the church and the kingdom of God
The scope of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is equal to the scope of the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
The reality of the kingdom of the heavens and the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens are related to the overcoming believers
The kingdom of God denotes the life of the believers which is of God and is capable of living within the realm of God
The kingdom of the heavens denotes the living of the believers who are submitting to the heavenly ruling and receiving heavenly discipline
According to God's intention, the definitions of these three may be different, but their scope should be absolutely the same
Why is the scope of the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens wider than the scope of the church and the kingdom of God?
Why is the scope of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens narrower than the scope of the church and the kingdom of God?
Although they are still children of God they are children who have fallen away from Gods standard the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
The scope of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens has become narrower than the scope of the church and the kingdom of God

Of being under the rule and control of God, the earth has come under the rule and control of Satan and fallen man
In the church there is the heavenly rule and government, and there is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
During the period of the church age, however, the kingdom of the heavens, the heavenly rule, is not manifested in an open way

The kingdom of the heavens will become the ruling power and will govern in a manifested, open way, not in a mysterious and hidden way
They are willing to live and walk and do things according to the teachings of the Lord concerning the reality of the kingdom in Matthew 5 7

If the rules say that the lights must be off by 10:30, you should not need someone to come by and enforce this rule
The unbelievers and the defeated Christians may even cover the light and continue to study until two o'clock in the morning

If you are a defeated Christian, not living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, where will you be when the Lord Jesus comes back?

In the Bible there is surely the side of enjoyment and grace, but there is also the side of exercise and responsibility
Many Christians simply enjoy the family life of the household of God, but they neglect the exercise of the kingdom life
If we exercise ourselves in a proper way after we are saved, we will enjoy the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens as a reward
He saves us by His grace, but in His wisdom He causes us to be exercised by the kingdom, and He will reward us with the kingdom
These verses show that the Lord Jesus will come back, not as a visitor, but as a thief, either to steal you away or to leave you here
The phrase, 'Then shall the kingdom of the heavens,' indicates that the previous discourse is also related to the kingdom of the heavens
In chapter twenty-five, the kingdom of the heavens is likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom
Besides this portion of the Spirit, we need to have another portion, that is, the filling of the Spirit in our soul, our vessel
When the Lord Jesus returns the majority of the Christians will have died, and only a minority will still be living
We must see that the ten virgins represent the majority of the Christians who will have died by the time the Lord comes back
While they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut
Afterward, the foolish virgins came desiring to enter into the marriage feast, but the Lord's reply was that He did not know them
When the Lord Jesus returns, all the dead saints will be resurrected, and those who are ready will enjoy the marriage feast
In other words, as the Lord's crop , they are matured and ripe, so they are ready to enter into the marriage feast of the Lamb
If you are ready, if you are ripened, if you are victorious, the Lord will invite you into that marriage feast
In Matthew 25:12 the Greek word is translated into 'know,' but in Romans 7:15 the same Greek word is translated into 'allow'

If we are defeated Christians, when the Lord Jesus comes back we will suffer a loss and we will be punished so that we may become mature
If our exercise has been proper in the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord will reward us with the manifestation of the kingdom
If we have not exercised in the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord will render a certain kind of punishment to us
We need forgiveness of sins so that we can have eternal life, and we need eternal life so that we can be under the heavenly rule
If we are going to meet the requirements of such a high standard, we must have a life that is on an equally high plane
The kingdom is the requirement of the New Testament gospel, and the eternal life, which is Christ Himself, is the supply
Also, apart from the truth concerning the kingdom, it is very difficult to solve the debate between Calvinism and Arminianism
We need to read a number of passages which indicate that in addition to salvation there is the exercise of the kingdom
If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire'
These few verses show clearly that if we exercise properly we shall receive a reward but if we do not exercise properly we shall suffer loss
Because we are born again we must be under the control of the heavenly kingdom, under the heavenly rule and government
That servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes'
Some Christians would argue that when the Lord comes back we all will simply be resurrected and taken up to be with Him
There was the age of Adam to Moses , the age of Moses to Christ , the age of the church, and the age of the millennium
If we are willing to be dealt with by the Lord to the fullest extent in this age, we will enjoy the reward in the next age
If we are not willing to be dealt with by the Lord to the fullest extent in this age, He will still deal with us when He comes back
If we are not matured in this age by the time the Lord comes back, He will cause us to be matured in the next age
If we want to enter into the manifestation of the kingdom in the next age, we must live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today
The kingdom is the requirement of the gospel, and the life we receive at regeneration is the supply of this requirement

Verse 5 goes on to say, 'And besides this, giving all diligence, develop in your faith virtue; and in your virtue, knowledge
We have received the precious faith, but we need to develop many things by cooperating with His life within us
We need to develop the first thing and then the second thing and then the third thing and then the fourth thing
If day by day we will follow Him, go along with Him, and obey His inward leading, something will be developed within us
Don't consider that you can pray and fast for three days and nights and that will enable you to enter into the kingdom
Satan knows that God's way to have the kingdom is through the church, so he does his best to damage the church
The Lord knows that some of His dear children who have really been saved will not be faithful to Him and will not cooperate with Him
He holds forth a section of His kingdom as a kind of a reward and prize to encourage them to seek Him in a desperate way
The Lord will make the heavenly part of the millennium a prize and reward to all His faithful and overcoming ones
