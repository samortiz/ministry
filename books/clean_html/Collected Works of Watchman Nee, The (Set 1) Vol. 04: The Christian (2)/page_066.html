<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Fifteen</H2><P>Verse 15: "In the same way you also have some who hold in like manner the teaching of the Nicolaitans."</P><P>After reading the Lord's letter to the Ephesians, we should realize what the works of the Nicolaitans are. Now we want to consider in detail the meaning of this word "Nicolaitans." At the beginning, there were only the works of the Nicolaitans, and the church in Ephesus was still opposed to this kind of works. However, now it is no longer a work but has become a teaching. Sinful works are done only in private. But when a new teaching is invented to support this kind of works, man becomes bold and open to commit those sins. The church in Pergamos was not as that in Ephesus, hating this kind of "works." On the contrary, she was holding this kind of "teaching."</P><P>Who were the Nicolaitans? Although many theories exist, some considering that there was such a person as Nicoli who was the originator of the evil teaching, all of these theories remain only theories. All writers throughout the ages have had much doubt concerning this matter. No one can prove that a man called Nicoli existed in history and no one can identify the sin of the doctrine he taught. But one thing we know: the Bible never tells us to read church history or to expound the Scripture with other histories. The word of God explains itself, and there is no need of outside help. Otherwise, only the wise and the knowledgeable would be able to understand God's word. The Scripture is revealed to babes. If it were not, only a few would need to study and to expound it, while the majority would only need to follow their decision. Hence, we should not care for what history says. Since the Lord Jesus mentioned this group of people twice, and we know that His word does not fail, the people of this group must be of much significance. According to the principle of all the other names of people and places recorded in Revelation 2 and 3, no name is without meaning. Thus there must be the Lord's intention in using this name.</P><P>The word "Nicolaitans" is composed of two words in the original language. The first word, "Nico," means to conquer and to subdue. The second word, "laitan," means the people or the common man. The two words are combined to form "Nicolaitans," which means those who conquer the people or those who subdue the common man. Hence, the Nicolaitans are none other than those who oppress, control, and subdue other brothers in the church because they are found in the church. The teaching of the Nicolaitans says that there should be hierarchy in the church and there should be a distinction between the rank of the clergy and the laity. As far as the meaning of the word goes, there is another significance which is very obvious: the Lord Jesus mentioned the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans together. Balaam is a Hebrew word, while Nicolaitans is a Greek word. We have seen that in Greek, the word "Nicolaitans" has the sense of subduing the people, but in Hebrew, the word "Balaam" also has a similar meaning. The word "Balaam" means "those who devour the people"! As Balaam taught Balak to induce the Israelites to join themselves to the world, the Nicolaitans in the same way turned the church organization into a worldly community.</P><P>We have covered the teaching of Balaam already. Now we want to concentrate on the teaching of the Nicolaitans. In the beginning, they were only engaged in the works of subduing others. This was not yet official and legal. Now this work has evolved into a teaching. There is a difference between "teaching" and "work." "Teaching" can be translated as "doctrine." Hence, these ones had made their work of a hierarchical distinction a doctrine in Christianity. With this teaching they made their acquired position fully legal. Now with such a doctrine that teaches a hierarchical distinction, they were able to protect their works. What we want to ask is how this happened between the time when there were only the works and when the teaching was there. In other words, for what reason was this work turned into a teaching? Why is it that in Ephesus there were only the works, but in Pergamos it had turned into a legal, acceptable doctrine? We have said something concerning this already. Between Ephesus and Pergamos there was the age of Smyrna. In the church in Smyrna, we saw the development of the Judaistic teaching. We have also pointed out what the Judaistic teaching was and how it had turned the church into a hierarchical organization. Hence, the work of the Nicolaitans in Ephesus, through the cultivation of the Judaistic teachings in Smyrna, became the teaching of the Nicolaitans in Pergamos.</P><P>We have seen that the Judaistic teachings are only a kind of measurement. They measure to see if man has achieved righteousness or not. While God is measuring man, man cannot draw near to God. The Judaistic teaching puts everybody under the same category. Hence, no one can be separated from the world. All those who were born of the flesh were able to join the Jewish religion.</P><P>Now we have to consider how this Judaistic teaching helped the teaching of the Nicolaitans. If the church becomes a Jewish "synagogue," then naturally Christians will become "Jews." The Jews were not able to draw near to God. Even the High Priest, who was a type of Christ, could only enter the Holy of Holies once. While he was in it, he still needed the incense to cover the mercy-seat in order for him not to perish. It was out of the question for the other priests. They could only enter the Holy Place; the Holy of Holies was forbidden to them. For the common citizens, even the Holy Place was unapproachable. Because of the Israelites' failure, they could not draw near to God. God's original intention was that the whole nation would be priests (Exo. 19:6). Yet they became fallen and broke the covenant. As a result, God established a family as priests, to take the place of a whole nation. From this we can see that the characteristic of Judaism is a separate and intermediate priesthood. God was in obscurity; man could not approach Him directly. As a result, God revealed Himself through a special group of people, and man approached God through this special group of people. Between the two, there was no direct fellowship. This is Judaism.</P>
