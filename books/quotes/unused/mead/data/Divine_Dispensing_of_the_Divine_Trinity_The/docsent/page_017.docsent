   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX GOD S DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE MINISTRY OF CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: John 12:24; 3:15; 10:10b; 2:19, 21; 1 Pet 1:3; John 3:29; 14:16-20; 17:21-23; 20:22; 14:23, 26; 15:4a, 5a; 7:38-39; Rev 22:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The ministry of Christ is the main ministry in the New Testament to dispense God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is clearly of two parts: the first part is for Him to come to us, and the second part is for Him to go back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a two-way traffic, a traffic both coming and going.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He came to bring God to us, and He went back to God to bring us into God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By this coming and going God has dispensed Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus coming began from His incarnation and ended with His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From His incarnation to His death was the first part of the Lord s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second part of His ministry began from His resurrection and has no ending, so it will last for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the last message we pointed out that in the first part of the Lord s ministry He brought God into humanity, He was the tabernacle of God among men, He brought the divine grace and reality to us, and He expressed God in full.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These items were the work of the Lord Jesus while He was on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After accomplishing this work He went to the cross and was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His death on the cross did much to enable God to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He died on the cross as the Lamb of God to take away our sin; He judged the satanic world; He destroyed Satan, the power of death, in His flesh; and He dealt with our serpentine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All these negative things have been annulled by Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the positive side the Lord s death on the cross released the very divine life concealed within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Incarnation brought Him into confinement.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His humanity was like a shell that confined His divine life within it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He likened Himself to a grain of wheat John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A grain of wheat has a shell which confines the wheat life within it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The only way this confined life can be released is by death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, the life within the shell is released.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>So on the negative side the Lord s death dealt with all the negative things, but on the positive side His death released His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Crucifixion released Him as the divine life from His human shell.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Both of these aspects of His death are so that God can dispense Himself into you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the first part of the Lord s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is His coming from God to us through incarnation and death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If He had not gone through incarnation and death, God could never have reached us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s dispensing reaches us through Christ s incarnation and death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the negative things have been put away, and life has been released.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not only has life been released, but it has also been presented to us so that we may receive it by calling upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This divine life is just the life-giving Spirit Rom 8:2 , and the life-giving Spirit is just the Lord Jesus Himself 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So when we say, O Lord Jesus, He as the air gets into us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When He gets into us, that is God dispensing Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although this is marvelous, this is just one way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the way of Christ coming from God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The second way is Christ going from us back to God to bring us into God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This began from His resurrection and goes on in resurrection, not only for this age, but for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to realize that since the Lord Jesus has gone through incarnation and death, He is now in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In typology resurrection was typified by the wave offering, something waving and moving Lev 23:10, 11, 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Revelation 1:18 the Lord Jesus said, I am the living One, and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jesus Christ today is the living One, the One who is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First He was incarnated to be in the flesh; then He was put to death, but today He is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you sow a grain of wheat into the ground, it will die and grow up out of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Where then is the grain of wheat?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus passed through death, and now in resurrection He has brought forth much fruit.</S>
