   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECOND STEP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RECEIVING A BURDEN TO SPREAD ABROAD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the history of the past two to three hundred years, one out of every twenty believers can be sent out for the gospel, while the remaining nineteen are responsible for supplying his material needs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the condition of the church is very good, one out of every ten can be sent out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Recently, the elders in the churches in California met and fellowshipped, and they considered that since there are fifteen hundred saints there, one hundred fifty saints should migrate to other places, and that it would be best if they could support themselves financially.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the principle of one out of every twenty, the church in Taipei, which has five thousand saints, should send out two hundred fifty saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If each of the remaining saints would offer five percent of their income to supply the daily needs of those who are sent out for the gospel, there would be more than enough to meet the needs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Perhaps you never had the thought that the church in Taipei should send people abroad to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On August 1, 1949, we formally started the work here.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that time, the meeting hall was very small, and we erected a shed outside.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we preached the gospel, there were so many people that there were not enough seats.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So we bought some long wooden boards, placed some bricks on the ground, and put the boards on top for people to sit on.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even under these circumstances, we were able to lead quite a number of people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church in Taipei has a history of over thirty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is really inexcusable for a church with such a long history to fail to send out one worker because it only cares to receive blessings for itself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the past the shortcoming of the church in Taipei could be seen in its meetings that would drag and often lack much content in terms of life and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the last Lord s Day meeting, however, all the prayers, testimonies, and fellowship were quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This proves that something has been wrought and constituted into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even the elderly saints who stood up to speak used precise words and cited proper references.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Their speaking was weighty and full of life and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am very happy about this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, I also am sighing because we are not going out; we are not spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is our present shortcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have been richly endowed in that we have all the aspects of a good environment public security, transportation, industry, agriculture, commerce, and education.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We also have many spiritual riches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How long should we enjoy all these things before we are willing to go out?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, I would ask you to dream about this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Consider whether you should go abroad, perhaps to India, Burma, South America, or Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even if your thoughts do not include places abroad, you should remember that there are three hundred eighteen towns in Taiwan but only eighty local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is no church in three quarters of the towns in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God says that the earth needs to be filled, so we should fill every town in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have cared for ourselves but not for the Lord s testimony outside our locality; this is our greatest shortcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, we have not multiplied much.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the first seven years the rate of increase of the church in Taipei was at least forty percent a year, but the annual rate of increase for the past twenty years is less than three percent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>WANTING HIS WITNESSES TO REACH</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE UTTERMOST PART OF THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord s recovery among us emphasizes two things: knowing the truth and growing in life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, we must realize that knowing the truth and growing in life are not for truth and life themselves but for the increase and spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today we pay attention to the church only in the matters of knowing the truth and growing in life; we do not pay attention to the increase and spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, we have to study the book of Acts to check our condition, because the contents of this book concern the propagation, increase, and spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In reality, the increase and spread of the church are the increase and spread of Christ, because the church is Christ 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The book of Acts provides us with a good pattern; it speaks of the propagation of the resurrected Christ in His ascension through the multiplication of His witnesses that reaches the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 1:8 the Lord said clearly to His disciples, You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To be the Lord s witnesses is actually to be the Lord s propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This propagation needs to reach to the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At this moment we do not need to talk about the uttermost part of the earth, because even India, Burma, and the Arabic-speaking countries, which are quite close to us, all need the Lord s propagation to reach them.</S>
