   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ as the hidden manna is the center of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The hidden manna is in the golden pot; the golden pot is in the ark, made of acacia wood overlaid with gold; and this ark is in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The hidden manna, which signifies Christ, is in the golden pot, which refers to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The manna in the golden pot indicates that Christ is in the Father John 14:10a, 11a .</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today, our spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit is the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From this we can see that Christ as the hidden manna is in God the Father as the golden pot; that the Father is in Christ as the ark with His two natures, divinity and humanity; and that this Christ as the indwelling Spirit lives in our regenerated spirit to be the reality of the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that the Son is in the Father, that the Father is in the Son, and that the Son as the Spirit is the reality of the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This implies and corresponds to the four ins in John 14:16-20.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 20 says, "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you," and verse 17 says, "The Spirit of reality...shall be in you."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Son is in the Father, we are in the Son, the Son is in us, and we are indwelt by the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the incorporation of the processed God with the regenerated believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The way to be incorporated into the tabernacle is to eat the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more we eat Christ, the more we are incorporated into the Triune God as a universal incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By eating the hidden manna we are incorporated into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The tabernacle in the Old Testament was a figure of the New Jerusalem, which is called the tabernacle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the tabernacle of God the New Jerusalem is the universal incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This universal incorporation is God's eternal goal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God, and the center of this tabernacle is Christ as the hidden manna for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The way to be in the New Jerusalem is to eat Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more we eat Christ, the more we are incorporated into this universal incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have pointed out that the church in Pergamos signifies the worldly church, the church which has married the world to be in union with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The world will perish in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Are you a part of the world, or are you a part of the New Jerusalem as God's tabernacle, the universal incorporation?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord promised the overcomers in the church in Pergamos that if they ate Him, they would be incorporated into the universal incorporation, the consummated New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not be joined to the world we should be incorporated into the New Jerusalem by eating Christ as the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let us now begin to consider the three aspects of the incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers.</S>
