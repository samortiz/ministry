   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A PRESENTED BODY, A RENEWED MIND,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND A LIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This transformation requires that our body be presented and that our spirit be burning Rom 12:1, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 12 refers to the body, the soul, and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For the Body life, our body must be presented, our soul must be transformed, and our spirit must be set on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You may love the church and present your body to the church, but you may not have much transformation in your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Your mind may be natural, and your concepts may be old.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You need to be transformed and renewed in your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is also possible to have transformation, but yet be cold in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to advance in the Body life, we need our body presented both to the Lord and to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should present our body to the Lord for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We also need our mind to be renewed so that our soul may be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Finally, our spirit must be set on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we have all these things, we shall have a proper and solid Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such a Body life is not simply a matter of uplifting the inferior ones, of lowering the superior ones, of tempering the members, adorning the uncomely parts, and of strengthening the more feeble members.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is too superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we care only about the head, the tail, and the proper sequence, we are being too outward.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need a solid church life with much transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this, we need to have our body presented, our soul transformed, and our spirit burning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that we need to be transferred from 1 Corinthians 12 to Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then we shall not have as many toys, and we shall not care for the miraculous things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what the Lord desires in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I realize that this will not take place overnight and that it cannot be accomplished by a mushrooming development.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, I have been burdened to share with you a view of what is to come in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all need to have such a view.</S>
