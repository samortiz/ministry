This is especially true when the concept in question is not allowed elsewhere in the Bible. Lately, there have been many of God's children everywhere who consider it wrong to have Christ's Body divided. However, what is the profit of having the outward name changed to "the Church of Christ in China" while the system within is still unscriptural? If we truly desire to have the oneness of Christ's Body, there is no need for us to have committees and discussions. We should repent and cry to God for the pitiful condition of division among God's children. Instead of criticizing with our mouth, we should be those beseeching God with tears on our faces. Still, we who search God's Word realize that as time goes on, both the church and the world will progressively deteriorate. We cannot hope that the entire church will change, but let us first love all of God's children. We ourselves should not have any barrier of denominationalism within us. We ourselves should first be free from denominationalism in reality, in concept, and in name. May the Lord show us the way. My heart is poured out for all of God's children everywhere. I hope my speaking does not fall on stony ears. I hope you will forgive me for saying this.</P><P>Now then if this messenger is a real messenger, what kind of messenger is he? We know in the Bible there are two different types of messengers: one is the angels from heaven (Matt. 22:30, etc.) and the other one is the messengers from men (Mal. 2:7; 3:1; Hag. 1:13). Which type of messenger is referred to here, angel or man?</P><P>According to the general usage in the New Testament, messenger mainly refers to a heavenly spirit who often is charged by God to help men. Hebrews 1:14 says, "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth for service for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?" The "salvation" here does not refer to our initial salvation from perdition to eternal life. It refers to the salvation of the sabbath of Canaan, that is, the millennium. Therefore, from this verse we know the messengers here are spirits sent by God to minister to us. In the same manner that Satan's evil spirits try to destroy us through their power, God's benevolent spirits are protecting us through their might. How our God is caring for us! Only when we realize this will we have peace even in the midst of various trials and danger. However, it is a pity that we are either ignorant of this fact or else we doubt God's care for us.</P><P>Matthew 18:10 says, "Their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of My Father who is in the heavens." We know that the angels that God sent to serve us are not limited to one. They not only stay with us, but for our sake, they always ascend to the Father with our prayer and descend to us with His grace.</P><P>In the Old Testament, we see that God appointed the angels to be the rulers of the nations. Although men ruled as kings on earth, God appointed angels to be kings in heaven to administer the spiritual affairs of those nations. Daniel 10:21 says, "There is no one who holds strongly with me against these ones except Michael your [Israel's] prince." Here it says the angel Michael was the prince of Israel. Chapter twelve, verse 1 also indicates the same thought. Not only were the good angels the rulers, but the fallen angels were also rulers of the Gentile nations. Therefore, besides kings on the earth, the heavens also have "the prince of the kingdom of Persia" and "the prince of Grecia" (Dan. 10:13, 20). This matter is very important. It is interesting and full of spiritual implications, but we can only briefly mention it here.</P><P>Our question is this: if in the Old Testament God sent the archangel Michael to be the king of the chosen people of Israel, while all other nations had Satan's fallen angels as their kings, then in the New Testament, would God not send His angels to minister and to protect the churches in all places? We know that God has sent angels to minister to individuals. Would God not also send angels to minister to the whole church? When we see God's way of redemption, we will answer affirmatively that God must have done so. We are certain of this. However, do the messengers here (in Revelation 1:20) refer to the ministering and protecting angels? Even though we dare not say they are not, we believe they refer to men as messengers for the following reasons.</P><P>If the messengers here refer to the angels, then how can John write letters to them? A human being cannot send a letter to a spirit in heaven. Also, if they were the angels, then how could they receive material things such as letters? The intangible spirit cannot receive a tangible letter. Another convincing point is that our Lord spoke to the messenger in Smyrna that he should be faithful unto death (Rev. 2:10). If this were an angel, how could he die? Angels do not and cannot die. With these few points, it seems to indicate that these messengers are not angels, even though we cannot say that this is absolutely so.</P><P>If they are the messengers of men, what position would these men occupy in the churches? To answer this question, we first need to see if the term messenger exists within the churches. Second, from the context of chapters two and three we need to see what position they occupy in the churches.</P><P>We have already said that the messenger must be literally "messenger" because our Lord used this term to expound the mystery of the "star." If a mystery is expounded, then it is no longer a mystery. Since it is no longer a mystery, it must be known by all. The messengers are just messengers. We need not give another explanation to what our Lord has already explained. After we understand that they are messengers, then we should ask who are called the messengers in the churches? The Bible is not silent regarding this matter. Second Corinthians refers to the two brothers as "the messengers of the churches" (2 Cor. 8:23 KJV). Paul also said in Philippians, "Epaphroditus...your messenger" (Phil. 2:25 KJV). Therefore, we can see in the Bible that there is such a title as "messengers" in the churches.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> </body></html>
