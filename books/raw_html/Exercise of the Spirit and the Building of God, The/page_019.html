        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">BLENDING DEPENDING ON PRAYER</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:1-11; Rom. 12:11</h1>
<p>Blending in spirit is crucial for the building of the church. Hence, we need to encourage the saints to blend in the spirit in all the meetings. In order to practice something, we first need to understand its basis; otherwise, we will have difficulty practicing it. We avoid confusion by understanding what we are doing and why we are doing it. In order to encourage the saints to practice blending in spirit, we need to understand the concept of blending. For this reason, we will fellowship concerning six crucial points related to blending in spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOD<br />
AND THE BELIEVERS BEING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The relationship between God and His people is altogether in the spirit. God is Spirit, and we have a spirit. Therefore, all our dealings with God, whether prayer, fellowship, or service, are in the spirit. This is the first thing that we need to know.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING SLOTHFUL TO EXERCISE THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We must confess that we are lazy and loose in the matter of exercising our spirit. In this matter the children of God tend to be slothful, just like some children are too lazy to use their mind to study. Most children can play all day without feeling tired. But they are unwilling to do their homework, because they are slothful in using their mind. They are accustomed to exercising their body, but they are unaccustomed to studying with their mind. This also applies to us as God&rsquo;s children in relation to exercising our spirit. We are willing to spend a good amount of time reading newspapers, conversing, and doing many other things, but we are not willing to pray. Prayer requires that we exercise our spirit, but our spirit is slothful, unwilling to move.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;Do not be slothful in zeal, but be burning in spirit, serving the Lord&rdquo; (Rom. 12:11). The word <em>slothful</em> here is in relation to the spirit because Paul goes on to say that we need to be burning in spirit, serving the Lord. Some saints are diligent outwardly, but their spirit is slothful. They are diligent and energetic in doing things, but they are slothful and seldom moved in spirit to pray. This is the result of being slothful to exercise the spirit and being unwilling to pray more with the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT EXERCISING THE SPIRIT<br />
BEING AN OFFENSE TO THE LORD</h2>
<p>Being slothful in spirit and not exercising the spirit greatly offend the Lord. In John 4:24 the Lord said, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit.&rdquo; Verse 23 says that God seeks such to worship Him. God is longing for persons who will fellowship with Him in spirit. We offend God by not exercising our spirit to worship Him or by rarely exercising our spirit.</p>
<p>God is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit so that we can receive and enjoy Him. God created us with a spirit and redeemed us so that the Spirit could enliven our spirit. Now the Spirit dwells in our spirit so that we may absorb and enjoy God with our spirit. However, we put Him aside, ignore Him, and turn our back to Him when we do not contact Him with our spirit. Many of us do not enjoy the Lord much, and some have never enjoyed Him. Some co-workers serve fervently in the church and visit other saints. They are fervent in many things other than exercising their spirit. They do not enjoy the Lord. As a result, the Lord is unable to reach the goal of His salvation among us.</p>
<p>Since we seldom exercise our spirit, we do not have a rich supply for the saints; we are not channels for them to receive the Lord. We may frequently visit the saints, but we can neither enliven their spirit nor supply them, because we do not exercise our spirit to pray with them. We are unable to render the saints real spiritual help.</p>
<p>Even in the meetings we do not exercise our spirit to contact one another. Most of our activities have the flavor of rituals and formalities, not the flavor of the Spirit or the moving of the Spirit. We cannot expect to worship and gain God, who is Spirit, in such meetings. How can we speak of exercising our spirit to open the spirit of the saints and bring them into the Lord? These shortages are the result of our not exercising our spirit, not praying enough, and being unwilling to open ourselves to pray with others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ACTIVE TO RECEIVE THE MOVING<br />
OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the past we blamed our lack of worship, enjoyment of the Lord, and supplying others on the Holy Spirit not moving in us. This sounds spiritual, but it is incorrect.</p>
<p>We have a wrong concept concerning the move of the Spirit. We think that when the Spirit moves in us, He takes the initiative, and we are passive. Some saints rarely pray or fellowship in the meetings, because they are not moved by the Spirit, and they dare not behave recklessly in the meetings. Such an explanation indicates that they have misunderstood what it means for the Spirit to move in them.</p>
<p>In order to understand how the Spirit moves, we must know a few matters that have been accomplished by God in the universe.</p>
<p>First, the Spirit is flowing. When the Lord Jesus was put to death on the cross, His side was pierced, and out flowed blood and water, just as living water flowed out of the cleft rock (John 19:34; 1 Cor. 10:4). This means that the Spirit has been released. This is as great an event as the accomplishment of redemption on the cross. In order to be forgiven of his sins, a sinner needs only to receive in his heart what the Lord has accomplished; there is no need for him to ask the Lord to die again on his behalf. Likewise, in order to obtain the Spirit, a believer needs merely to claim the accomplished fact; there is no need to beg, because the Rock has been cleft, and the Spirit is flowing out as living water.</p>
<p>Second, the Spirit has been sent. The Spirit has not only flowed out of the Lord, but He has also been sent. There were two steps in the sending of the Spirit. In the first step the Lord breathed into the disciples on the evening of His resurrection. In this step the Spirit entered into man as the Spirit of life (John 20:19, 22). In the second step the Spirit descended like a violent wind and like a flame of fire. In this step the Spirit descended upon man as the Spirit of power (Acts 2:1-4). These two steps are accomplished facts. Now the Spirit of God is not only before the throne but has also been sent forth into all the earth (Rev. 5:6). For example, radio waves are transmitted from a radio station to the whole earth. A person simply needs to turn on a radio, and he will receive the radio waves. Likewise, when a person opens his heart and his spirit, he will receive the Spirit.</p>
<p>Not only so, the Spirit has contacted our spirit. The moment we received the Lord, the Spirit contacted and enlivened our spirit. The Spirit is subjective to us, for we have contacted Him.</p>
<p>Finally, the Spirit is in our spirit. After we were regenerated, the Spirit remained in us; He now dwells in us. Hence, we should know with assurance that the Spirit is flowing because the Lord Jesus died on the cross, the Spirit descended from heaven, He contacted our spirit at the time of our regeneration, and He is dwelling in our spirit.</p>
<p>In view of these four great accomplishments, we can say that the Lord has done everything. We do not need to wait for the Lord to do anything else. We do not need to wait for the Spirit to move. When the wind is blowing, we just need to open the windows in order for the wind to blow into the house. If we want a draft, we should open windows that face each other. If we wait passively for the windows to open, the wind will never blow fresh air into the house.</p>
<p>The Spirit is like the wind. When the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The wind blows where it wills&rdquo; (John 3:8), He was referring to the Spirit. On the day of Pentecost, the move of the Holy Spirit was like a rushing violent wind (Acts 2:2). If we desire to have the blowing of the Holy Spirit, we should not wait passively; rather, we should take the initiative to open ourselves. Once we are open, the Spirit will blow and move in us. We may wait to be moved by the Spirit, but the Spirit is waiting for us to open ourselves. It is not a matter of whether or not the Spirit is moving but of whether or not we are willing to be open. The Spirit always wants to flow, but He has no way because we are not willing to open ourselves. Sometimes we are somewhat open, but we are open only on one side instead of two sides; we are open to God but not to the saints. Consequently, the Spirit can flow only in but not out. Eventually, He will no longer be able to flow in.</p>
<p>God is abounding in grace. He was incarnated, died, resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit in order to dwell in us. Now our spirits are subject to us (1 Cor. 14:32). As long as we are willing to move, the Spirit will move. If we do not move, the Spirit has no way to move. Therefore, the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;Be burning in spirit&rdquo; (Rom. 12:11). The word <em>be</em> here means that we need to take the initiative. Whether or not we are burning in spirit is our responsibility, not the Spirit&rsquo;s responsibility. If we are willing, we will be burning, but if we are not willing, we will not be burning. Once we turn on the switch, the electric current will flow.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12 speaks of spiritual gifts. Does the Spirit need to take the initiative in order for us to exercise these gifts, or do we? The Spirit spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12 has already been breathed into the believers and poured out upon them. This Spirit is dwelling in us. As long as we take the initiative to apply Him, not according to our feeling but according to faith, He will be manifested. It is not a question of whether or not He will give us a gift but to what extent we would let Him be manifested. If we open our mouth wide, He will fill it (Psa. 81:10). If we are closed and passive, His work will be limited. Therefore, the problem lies with us, not with the Spirit.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:1-2 says, &ldquo;Concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant. You know that when you were Gentiles, you were always being led away to dumb idols, whenever and however you were led.&rdquo; In his New Translation of the Bible, J. N. Darby translates the beginning of the first sentence as &ldquo;Now concerning spiritual manifestations.&rdquo; This translation makes it clear that the gifts are manifestations of the Spirit. In these verses the apostle seems to be saying, &ldquo;The false gods that you worshipped in the past could not speak; they were dumb idols. As a result, while you were serving them, you were also dumb. But now the God whom we worship is the Spirit. He is living, and He speaks; when He moves, we receive different kinds of gifts.&rdquo; Then the apostle goes on to present the manifestations of the Spirit. These do not depend on the Spirit&rsquo;s taking the initiative but on our taking the initiative. If we do not take the initiative, He has no way to be manifested, even though He is in us.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must change this wrong concept concerning the moving of the Spirit. We must not be passive and slothful in exercising our spirit. We should be diligent to rise up and exercise our spirit. The indwelling Spirit will follow us and manifest His unlimited riches and inexhaustible power.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
