   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FLEEING INTO THE REFUGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE ANCHOR AND THE FORERUNNER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to the capstone of all we have covered in these messages fleeing into the refuge with the anchor and the Forerunner 6:9-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. THE REFUGE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 18 speaks of having fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Have you ever heard that the New Testament tells us to flee into a refuge?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Greek word translated have fled for refuge means to flee intensively; it refers to an intensified fleeing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Greek word does not have the meaning of refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The simple English equivalent is fled.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Greek word is the same word used in Acts 14:6, where we are told that the Apostle Paul fled the persecution in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although it is not wrong to add the words for refuge, it may be better not to use them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are not only river crossers; we are also fleers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From what are we fleeing?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From everything other than Christ and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must flee from the world, Judaism, Catholicism, Protestantism, and from ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must flee the department stores, the course of this age, religion, our old concepts, and every kind of tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must flee anything that keeps us away and holds us back from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have consulted a number of translations of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some versions say, fled the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must flee our old position, ambition, and self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must flee everything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The writer of this book undoubtedly wanted the Hebrew believers to flee Judaism, their old religion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It would have been dangerous for them to remain in it; they had to flee.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Greek word for flee implies fleeing to a safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the reason the translators added the words for refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The writer seemed to be saying, Hebrew Christians, you are in a very dangerous situation and you need to flee to a safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Where is this safeguard, this safety, into which we must flee?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is in the spirit, in the church, and in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is there in the heavenlies?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Holy of Holies within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Hebrew Christians were in danger of being held back in the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They had to flee into the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The writer seemed to be saying, Flee within the veil, into the Holy of Holies, into your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Don t stay in your staggering soul.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Flee your wandering mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Flee into your spirit where you can be safe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although it is difficult to say definitely what the refuge is, we may say that it is the heavenlies where the Lord Jesus is today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE ANCHOR</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the context of 6:9-20, the writer, using the word anchor, pictures us all as being on a stormy sea.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since we are in a boat sailing on a stormy sea, we need an anchor.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Undoubtedly, the safeguard into which we must flee is our haven.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This haven is in our spirit, in the church life, and in the Holy of Holies in the heavenlies where the Lord Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we would stay in this haven, we must have an anchor.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The anchor is our hope vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>18-19 which is constituted with two unchangeable things God s promise and God s oath vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>12-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God s promise is confirmed by His oath.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God s promise is God s word, and God s oath is His final confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By God s promise and oath, both of which are unchangeable, we have our faith and patience, issuing in our hope which is the anchor of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our hope, as a secure and firm anchor, has entered into the Holy of Holies within the veil and holds on to it, and we may now enter in spirit 10:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By this anchor of hope we are held to the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Without it, we may shipwreck 1 Tim 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must flee whatever situation we are in. Every situation is a stormy sea.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Are you rich?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Your riches are a stormy sea.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Are you poor?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Your poverty is a stormy sea.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To say that every situation is a stormy sea simply means that it can hold you back, keeping you from entering into today s rest.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the danger.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Consider the type of the children of Israel who came out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although maybe two million came out of Egypt, only two of them entered into the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All the others were distracted.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do we not face the same possibility today?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is not one thing which cannot hold us back.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even the eldership in the church can hold you back.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Elders, you must flee the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are the fleers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We even must flee our own country and locality.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The writer included himself in this matter of fleeing, for he used the word we in verse 18.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After saying so many good things in the foregoing chapters, he concluded with the word flee.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>THE FORERUNNER</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The writer now tells us that Christ is not only the Captain of our salvation, but also our Forerunner.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord Jesus as the Forerunner took the lead to pass through the stormy sea and enter the heavenly haven to be the High Priest for us according to the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As such a Forerunner, He is the Captain of our salvation 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As the Forerunner, He has cut the way to glory, and as the Captain, He has entered into glory, into the Holy of Holies within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In order to enter into the Holy of Holies within the veil, the Lord Jesus fled everything.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He fled His mother.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He fled His brothers Matt 12:46-50 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He fled Judaism and entered within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Here we are not told that Jesus entered into the heavens, but that He entered into that which is within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He entered into the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He fled everything to enter into the presence of God within the veil, where we anchor our hope with full assurance vv.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>19, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>After covering so many messages thus far in our Life-study of Hebrews, we must pay attention to this one thing fleeing.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must flee everything because everything is a danger.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Flee your old concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Flee your non-church life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you do not have the church life, you are on the stormy sea without a safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Your wandering mind is a stormy sea.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Flee into your spirit and into the church life that you may have a safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This fleeing is the real river crossing.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I am concerned that many of those reading this message will not flee and cross the river.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Let us flee into our spirit and into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Let us flee into the veil, into the Holy of Holies.</S>
