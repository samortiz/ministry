<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>Today the Lord is recovering the organic building up of the Body of Christ. The contents of the outlines in this book are from the writings of Brother Witness Lee that have been published during the past four years. The outlines cover the matter of speaking poems&mdash;psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs&mdash;in the meetings of the church for the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ. Our desire is that the Lord would use these outlines to help perfect the saints unto the work of the ministry, equipping them to carry out God&rsquo;s eternal economy to build up the Body of Christ.</p>
