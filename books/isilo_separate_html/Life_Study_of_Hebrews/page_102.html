Firstly, Christ is the High Priest of God typified by Aaron, and secondly He is the High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec. Christ&rsquo;s ministry is of two main aspects, the one typified by Aaron on earth and the other according to the order of Melchisedec in heaven.</p><h2 class="head1">I. A TURN IN THE BOOK OF HEBREWS</h2><p>According to the work and ministry of Christ, this book has a turn at 7:1, a turn from earth to heaven. To the end of chapter six, what is mainly revealed is Christ&rsquo;s work on earth typified by the priesthood of Aaron. That section is the word of foundation. From 7:1, Christ&rsquo;s ministry in heaven according to the order of Melchisedec is unveiled. This section is the word of perfection, which shows us how the heavenly Christ ministers in the heavenly tabernacle. His purification of sins is typified by the work of Aaron, while His sitting down on the right hand of the Majesty on high (1:3) is according to the order of Melchisedec (Psa. 110:1, 4). His work on the cross on earth typified by the work of Aaron affords us forgiveness of sin. His ministry on the throne in heaven ministers to us the overcoming of sin. His cross delivered us out of Egypt; His throne brings us into Canaan. Although the Hebrew believers had participated in His work on the cross, they had to press on to enter into the enjoyment of His ministry on the throne.</p><p>We may say that the forgiveness of sin is on the ground floor and that the overcoming of sin is on the second floor. During the past centuries, a great many Christians have sought for the overcoming of sin. However, not many of them ever succeeded in this matter because they were seeking something that is on the second floor while they were on the ground floor. How could you ever have the things on the second floor while seeking for them on the ground floor? The forgiveness of sin is on the ground floor. Every saved Christian can testify that he has fully, successfully, absolutely, and thoroughly experienced the forgiveness of sin. But we must be on the second floor in order to experience the overcoming of sin. The forgiveness of sin is related to Christ&rsquo;s work on earth typified by the work of Aaron. This is on the ground floor. The overcoming of sin is related to Christ&rsquo;s work today in heaven according to the order of Melchisedec. This is on the second floor. Are you on the ground floor or on the second floor? I am quite sure that I am on the second floor. How wonderful it is to be on the second floor enjoying not only the forgiveness of sin but also the overcoming of sin! Sin is beneath our feet! If you are going to overcome a certain thing, that thing must be underneath you. Although in terminology it sounds like a small thing to speak of the overcoming of sin, in experience it is tremendous. How good it is to enjoy the overcoming of sin! If you want to have the overcoming of sin, you must come to the second floor to experience the heavenly ministry of the heavenly Christ according to the order of Melchisedec.</p><p>As I have already mentioned, Christ&rsquo;s cross delivers us out of Egypt and His throne brings us into Canaan. Where are you&mdash;in Egypt or in Canaan? How do you know that you are in Canaan? It is easy to tell. I know that I am in Canaan because I am no longer around the cross but around the throne. The sermons, messages, conversations, and fellowship of most Christians is around the cross. I hardly ever heard of a group of Christians fellowshipping around the throne. Is your Christ today on the cross or on the throne? I can testify to you that my Christ today is on the throne. I am not seeking Him at the cross; I am enjoying Him on the throne. This is marvelous. Today our Christ is no longer on the cross but on the throne. The Passover in Egypt signified Christ on the cross. But today our Christ is on the throne, and where the throne is, there is Canaan. We are in Canaan. We are in the Sabbath rest because our Christ is on the throne. Although we have participated in Christ&rsquo;s work on the cross, we must now press on to enter into the enjoyment of His ministry on the throne. The Christ who is with me in the present ministry is the Christ on the throne. Oh, may the fact that Christ is now on the throne be experienced by us! We need to see all the details concerning this enthroned Christ. When we enjoy such a Christ, we are on the second floor, in Canaan, and around the throne.</p><p>This message is on the heavenly ministry of the heavenly Christ. As we have seen, the book of Hebrews makes a great turn at 7:1. Not many readers of Hebrews have seen this point clearly, but by God&rsquo;s mercy and grace He has shown us this turn. My burden in this message simply is to impress you with this turn. May the Holy Spirit inscribe this turn deeply into your spirit. This turn is not merely a doctrinal turn; it is a turn in our experience of Christ in an active way, even in a subjectively objective way. In the next message I shall explain what I mean by subjectively objective. For the time being, I ask you to keep in mind that at 7:1 we must make a turn so that we may experience Christ in a subjectively objective way.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_101.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_103.html">Next</a> </body></html>
