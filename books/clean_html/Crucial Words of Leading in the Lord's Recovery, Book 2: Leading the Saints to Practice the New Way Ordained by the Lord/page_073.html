<h1 class="title">A REVIEW OF OUR GOING ON<br />
IN THE NEW WAY</h1>
<p>It is rather easy for the church to gain many new ones and reach a goal of increase, but it is more difficult to stabilize these new ones and bring them into the church life. It is possible to gain someone with just a little effort, but we may not be able to keep him with even ten times that effort. We may be able to gain one hundred people, but if we hope to bring them all into the church life, we need to spend at least ten times as much effort.</p>
<p>As a result of our studying and experimenting, we have found a direction. We have discovered from numerous testimonies that it is best to be selective in our door-knocking. This selectiveness has several aspects. First, we should begin by knocking on the doors of those whom we know, that is, our friends and relatives. Second, we should knock on the doors of the friends and relatives of the saints. Third, we should knock on the doors of the friends and relatives of the newly saved ones. Hence, we should begin with these various groups of friends and relatives. The elders and leading ones in all the churches should spend some time to arrange and organize a list of names so that the saints who knock on doors will not waste any time. At the same time, the new ones whom we bring in will be more stable. In the matter of door-knocking, we also need to be selective in regard to the districts we choose to labor in. We need to consider which districts we should labor in and how we should labor in them. This does not mean that the gospel of God is selective; rather, proper selection and preparation will provide a foundation for our work.</p>
<p>When we go out to gain people, we should not gain too many at one time. If we do this, we will not be able to shepherd them well. In the past we had activities that some called &ldquo;blitzes&rdquo; and &ldquo;festivals.&rdquo; They were necessary steps in the process of our study; however, after passing through a number of experiments, we learned that we do not need a &ldquo;blitz&rdquo; to gain people in a speedy way. If we beget too many children at one time, we will not be able to shepherd them well. For instance, if someone begets five or seven babies in one delivery, only one or two may survive; hence, we need to labor according to our capacity.</p>
<p>As far as the church is concerned, not everyone needs to knock on doors. It would be ideal if one-third, that is, one out of three, were able to knock on doors. Twenty to thirty percent of the brothers and sisters can knock on doors, not only for themselves but also for their companions, that is, for those who cannot go door-knocking. After gaining some people, they can then distribute these ones to those who are not able go door-knocking and let them take care of the new ones. For example, if a brother gains five new ones in two weeks through door-knocking, he can take care of one and introduce the remaining four to other brothers and sisters. The first time he may need to knock on doors by himself, but after the second time, when he begins a home meeting, he can bring his companion along and introduce his companion to the new one, saying, &ldquo;This is our brother. From now on, I hope that he will have more contact with you. Since I still have many things to take care of in the coming days, I have troubled him to share my burden.&rdquo; After this kind of proper handover, the situation of taking care of people will be quite balanced. Every brother and sister will be able to care for one or two; it does not need to be many. If there are too many, we will not be able to take care of all of them.</p>
<p>A normal, or proper, brother or sister should at least come to the Lord&rsquo;s table to remember the Lord and learn the truth every Lord&rsquo;s Day. His or her meeting life should also include attending the prayer meeting on Tuesdays, preaching the gospel one evening a week or going to people&rsquo;s homes for a home meeting, and attending a group meeting on another evening. We should be able to reach this standard in terms of meetings. As for those whom we have gained through door-knocking, besides the one or two under our personal care, we should give them into the care of other brothers and sisters. In principle, we should visit the new ones once a week. Moreover, according to what we have said earlier, if we exercise some selection in our door-knocking, it will not be that difficult for us to bring people to salvation. Perhaps after three or four months we will be able to bring them into the church life and introduce them to the brothers and sisters so that they may have some mutual fellowship. At this point, we can go out again to gain more new ones through door-knocking. This can be likened to farmland in Taiwan that yields three times a year; we too may be able to have three harvests a year. The rate of increase will then be very high. Although not every one of us can go out to knock on doors, if thirty out of a hundred people in the church life are able and succeed in gaining a threefold increase, there will still be a one hundred percent increase overall.</p>
<p>Concerning our going out to visit people and to preach the gospel, there is still a need for further study; we not only need to develop the practice but also to find out the most effective ways. Up until this point, the best way is not to gain too many people at one time through door-knocking. In the past we sought to gain people with speed and in great numbers; however, not many survived. This was due to the lack of people to care for them. The result of the endeavor and practice of the churches is that we gained some experience and now realize that although it is easy to gain someone, it is difficult to retain him and even more difficult to bring him into the church life. Hence, we have studied the situation further and discovered that we should not gain too many too hastily; if we gain many without taking care of them, it is a waste of effort. Therefore, after we have gained some, we need to first take care of our capacity to shepherd them. Once we take care of this capacity, we can continue to gain more.</p>
<p>The principle is the same in regard to the natural law of reproduction given by God to human beings. A woman cannot give birth to a child today and deliver another child tomorrow or the day after. She needs to wait for at least nine months to deliver another baby. It is a great thing for a woman to give birth once a year. Moreover, it is rare for a woman to give birth twice within a single year. This is a natural law. If a woman delivered too many babies at the same time, she would not be able to raise them well. This is why God has provided human beings with a natural law that requires a woman to wait nine months to deliver another baby. We should learn from this law. After we gain some people through door-knocking, we need to wait three or four months, that is, until we have brought them into the church and handed them over to the church, before we go out to knock on more doors. If we have two or three harvests each year and everyone practices according to his personal environment, capacity, and situation, I believe this will help the church to increase.</p>
<p>We need to build up an atmosphere of going out to preach the gospel. After several decades, we realize that no other way is more effective for gaining people. As long as we are willing to go out, pay the price, expend our energy, and spend the time to knock on doors, we will surely gain people. Moreover, the brothers and sisters do not need to labor all year long and go out every day to knock on doors; they can go out once every three or four months. Once they have gained some people, they should nourish them properly and then go out again to preach the gospel several months later. In this way they will build up an atmosphere of constant gospel preaching in the church. This does not mean, however, that we use only one way to preach the gospel. As in doing many other things, there are many ways to preach the gospel. For instance, there are often many routes one can take to get to a certain destination. Hence, in some localities we may go out to preach the gospel, and in other localities we may preach the gospel in the small groups; this also is powerful. In short, we need to decide which way to preach the gospel based on the condition and situation of our particular locality. There are many ways; hence, the churches should labor according to their capacity.</p>
