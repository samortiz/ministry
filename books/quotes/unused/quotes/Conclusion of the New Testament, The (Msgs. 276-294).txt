In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in the Gospel of John
The Word is the definition, explanation, and expression of God; hence, the Word is God defined, explained, and expressed
Whereas the light for the old creation was the physical light , the light for the new creation is the light of life, mentioned in John 1:4
When we receive Him as the expression of God, He becomes our life, and this life becomes the light that shines within us
For the Word as God to become flesh, that is, to be incarnated, is for God to have the human life and the human nature
The Word, by being incarnated, not only brought God into humanity but also became a tabernacle to God as God's habitation on earth among men
The law makes demands on man according to what God is; grace supplies man with what God is to meet what God demands
The Word is God expressed, life is God imparted, light is God shining, grace is God enjoyed, and reality is God realized, apprehended
According to 1:29, John the Baptist declared concerning Christ, 'Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world'!
With Christ as all the offerings we have God's full redemption, and we may experience and enjoy this redemption
Through Christ as the Lamb of God fulfilling all the offerings, we may now enter into God and participate in the divine life and nature
We may boldly come into God, knowing that He does not have the right to reject us, because we come through His Lamb
We have full redemption in Christ as the Lamb of God, and therefore we are enabled to enter into God to enjoy all that He is
To be baptized in the Holy Spirit is to be baptized into Christ , into the Triune God , and even into the Body of Christ
John the Baptist testified that He saw the Spirit descending as a dove upon the Lamb of God and abiding upon the Lamb
As the Baptizer Christ puts men into the Triune God , bringing them into a spiritual and mystical union with the Triune God
Our Christ, who is the ladder bringing heaven to earth and joining earth to heaven, is now not only in heaven but also on earth
Christ has been set up on earth, and He is reaching into heaven for the purpose of coming to us and joining us to Him
The love of the Father, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit are the reality of this ladder for going up and coming down
We need to realize that as the duplication of Christ, we are the heavenly ladder bringing heaven to earth and joining earth to heaven
As the universal, heavenly ladder, Christ brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven, thereby making God and man one
On this ladder the angels of God ascend and descend as they do their service 'for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation'
Christ's being the heavenly ladder is not only for joining the earth to heaven but also for producing stones for the house of God
He poured oil upon the stone which he had used for a pillow, and he called the name of that place 'Bethel,' which means 'house of God'
The name Peter means 'a stone,' signifying a work of transformation that brings forth material for God's building
In this message we will consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in chapters two and three of John
Life here is the eternal life of God which is given to all believers in Christ and which is the main element of the divine grace given to us
Christs being the Lifechanger is indicated in John 2111 by the sign of His changing water into wine at the wedding feast in Cana of Galilee
The fact that all six of the stone waterpots were full of water signifies that all humanity is naturally full of death
The genuine Christian life is a life of having our water changed into wine, of having our death changed into life
When Jesus Christ was in the flesh, His body was the tabernacle and the temple of God, both of which are God's dwelling place
Realizing this, Satan did his best to destroy the Lord's physical body, and he did destroy it on the cross through the Jews
What was raised up by the Lord Jesus in resurrection was not only His physical body but also everyone who is joined to Him by faith
The Christian life consists of two matters: changing death into life and building up of the Body of Christ, the temple, in resurrection
In verse 14 the Lord Jesus said, 'As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up'
The people came to Moses, confessed that they had sinned, and asked him to pray that the Lord would take away the serpents
Christ was made in 'the likeness of the flesh of sin,' but He did not participate in any way in the sin of the flesh
When He was lifted up in the flesh on the cross by His death Satan the old serpent the devil the embodiment of sin and death was destroyed
Regeneration is accomplished in the human spirit by the Holy Spirit of God with God's life, the uncreated, eternal life
To be regenerated is to have the divine life, the eternal life as the new source and new element of a new person
The regeneration revealed in the Bible is not a religion, nor is it a set of moral teachings for improving oneself
Verse 21 goes on to say, 'But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be manifested that they are wrought in God'
The word of John the Baptist in verse 29 indicates that Christ is the Bridegroom: 'He who has the bride is the bridegroom'
The increase in verse 30 is the bride in verse 29, and the bride is a living composition of all the regenerated people
Our regenerated human spirit is part of the increase of Christ, and this increase is Christ's multiplication and reproduction
All of the reborn people are the increase of Christ, and this increase is the bride, which becomes the counterpart of Christ
Adam was a bachelor, a single man, but one day the Lord opened His side, took out a rib, and built that rib into Eve as a wife to match Adam
Gradually and steadily with the proper care, we as their parents should feed, nourish, and cherish them day by day through the small groups
The clause the Father loves the Son implies that apart from Christ, or besides Christ, nothing is pleasing to God
Verse 35 says not only that the Father loves the Son but also that the Father has given all things into the Son's hand
The unique way for us to become the increase of the unlimited Christ is to receive the Spirit and be filled with the Spirit
According to John 4 we may experience and enjoy Christ as the gift of God, the Messiah, and the Savior of the world
Our thirst can be quenched only by the living person of Christ, the Son of God, who has been given to us by God
The water of life signifies God in Christ as the Spirit flowing Himself into His redeemed people to be their life and life supply
In John 4:14 the Lord Jesus said that the water that He gives us becomes in us a fountain of water gushing up into eternal life
As the spring of living water, Christ quenches our thirst, satisfies us, makes us happy, and becomes our pleasure
The Samaritan woman said to the Lord Jesus, 'I know that Messiah is coming ; when He comes, He will declare all things to us'
To contact God the Spirit with the spirit is to drink of the living water, and to drink of the living water is to render real worship to God
Whenever we exercise our spirit to contact God, the living Spirit, we drink of Him as the living water in His Son, Jesus Christ
In their consideration that was blasphemy to God, yet the One whom they accused of blasphemy had enlivened the impotent man
Although God's work in creation was finished , the Father and the Son were still working for redemption and building
Whatever the Father wants to do in the matter of life-giving, the Son does it accordingly, working with the Father
In John 5:21 the Lord Jesus said, 'For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wills'
The Lord Jesus came to visit us, and we heard the living word of the gospel that enlivened us and made us alive
The regeneration in our spirit is a resurrection caused by the Lord Jesus with the divine life, which is Himself
In John 5:26 the Lord Jesus said, 'For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave to the Son to also have life in Himself'
He is one with the Father in the matter of life's enlivening, and He is also one with Him in the matter of judgment
In John 6:53 the Lord Jesus said, 'Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves'
To eat the Lord's flesh and to drink His blood, therefore, is to receive the Lord's flesh and blood into our being
To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life
As the Passover Lamb Christ not only shed His blood for our redemption; He also imparts His life into us for our nourishment
Bread is of the vegetable life and is only for feeding; flesh is of the animal life and is not only for feeding but also for redeeming
After man fell into sin, the Lord became the Lamb , which is not only for feeding man but also for redeeming him
We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that we need Christ as the true bread of life sent by God to bring us eternal life
In verse 33 we see that Christ is the bread of God who, through incarnation, came down out of heaven and gives life to the world
Bread of life refers to the nature of the bread, which is life; living bread refers to the condition of the bread, which is living
According to the word of the Lord Jesus in verse 29, the work of God is that we 'believe into Him whom He has sent'
The Lord's concept concerning God is that man should believe into Him, that is, receive Him as life and the life supply
If this word had not been spoken by the Lord Jesus, we surely would not have the boldness to say that we must eat the Lord
Just as we need to eat three meals a day in order to live, so we need to eat the Lord so that we can live by the Lord
Now we must exercise our spirit to feed on Him receiving Him digesting Him experiencing Him enjoying Him and applying Him moment by moment
In verse 58 the Lord Jesus declared that the one who eats the bread which came down out of heaven shall live forever
When we receive Him as the crucified and resurrected Savior, the Spirit who gives life comes into us to impart eternal life into us
In addition to the Spirit, who is wonderful, we need something solid, visible, tangible, and touchable-the word of life
The Greek word for words in verse 63 and also in verse 68 is rhema, which denotes the instant and present spoken word
The Spirit is living and real yet He is very mysterious intangible and difficult for people to apprehend the words however are substantial
If we receive the Word, we will have the Spirit; and if we have the Spirit within, we will have Christ as the inner supply of life
May we all realize that our need is Christ as our life supply and then daily contact Him as the life-giving Spirit embodied in the Word
In the scene of the Feast of the Passover in John 6, the Lord Jesus presented Himself as the bread of life, which satisfies man's hunger
After the full harvest of their crops, the Jewish people observed the Feast of Tabernacles to worship God and enjoy what they had reaped
The Feast of Tabernacles, therefore, was held at the time of the reaping of the harvest of the good land given by God
The physical aspect of the blessing that God promised to Abraham was the good land , which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ
The Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God's bountiful supply for us to enjoy
John's word indicates an expectation-expectation that although the Spirit was 'not yet,' the time was coming when the Spirit would be there
John 737 says Now on the last day the great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried out saying If anyone thirsts let him come to Me and drink
If anyone thirsts and comes to the Lord Jesus and drinks, believing into Him, 'out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water'
One river is the river of peace, and other rivers are joy, comfort, righteousness, life, holiness, love, patience, and humility
Satan's subtlety was not only to cause us to do something wrong but to inject himself into us as the sinful nature
As a result, anything that is outside of our nature cannot help us in dealing with the sin that is in our nature
For this reason we must have the instant and constant fellowship with Him, not only every minute but even every second
The bondage of our sin is not a chain on our shoulders; it is something in our constitution, in our being, in our fallen nature
Nothing outward can set us free from such bondage except the inward life which is Christ Himself working and shining in us
The Son frees us from sin not only by shining as the light of life but also by being the reality of what God is
Truth here is not the so-called truth of doctrine but the reality of the divine things, which is Christ Himself
In this message we will consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in chapters nine and ten of the Gospel of John
The words out of the Lord's mouth , being the anointing Spirit , mingle with humanity to bring sight to the blind
If we would understand this, we need to know the significance of the clay, the spittle, and the anointing itself
Spittle here, as something that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord , signifies the Lord's words, which are Spirit and life
The Lord's making clay of the spittle signifies the mingling of humanity with the Lord's living word, which is the Spirit
From experience we know that immediately after we receive the Lord through His word, we have the anointing of the Spirit
John 9 also reveals that we receive light for our sight through our obedience, which washes away our old humanity
In verse 7a the Lord Jesus said to the blind man whose eyes had been anointed with the clay, 'Go, wash in the pool of Siloam '
If he had not gone to wash off the clay after having been anointed with it, the clay would have blinded him even more
After we receive Him in His word and have His anointing He puts us in the position of being sent and we must now be obedient to His sending
In John 10 Christ is unveiled as the Shepherd of the sheep, the door of the sheep, and the pasture of the sheep
As the Shepherd Christ takes the sheep out of the fold through Himself as the door and into Himself as the pasture
The good Shepherd, Christ, laid down His soul-life for the sheep that they might have the zoe life, the eternal and divine life
As we are under Christ's shepherding, there will be a life-consciousness within us and also an instruction, a guidance, in life
The life within us, which is actually Christ Himself, will indicate that the Lord intends to lead us in a certain way
Christ is the door through which His believers may come out of any kind of fold and come into Him as the pasture
For Christ to be the Shepherd of the sheep, He has to be the door for the release of many sheep of God's flock in Judaism
Now after setting them free from the Judaistic fold as the door of the sheep Christ feeds them with Himself as the rich pasture of the sheep
John 10:9 says, 'I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture'
Now that Christ has come, all God's chosen people must come out of the law and come into Him to enjoy Him as their pasture
He laid down His life for His sheep, dying for the sheep in order to minister Himself as life to them and thereby be the pasture to them
Christ is the pasture of the sheep for the Old Testament saints, who go out of the custody of the law, to feed on
Christ is the pasture for the New Testament saints, who become one flock with the Old Testament saints under one Shepherd, to feed on
The fold is Judaism, which is of letter and regulation, and the flock is the church, which is of life and spirit
The Lord supplies the sheep with Himself as life so that there may be one flock and one Shepherd, one Body and one Head
If we feed upon Christ as our pasture in the morning, enjoying Him as the feast, we will eagerly go to the meeting in the evening
The result is that we are preserved, and nothing can snatch us out of these two hands-the Son's hand of grace and the Father's hand of love
In this message we will consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in chapters eleven and twelve of the Gospel of John
When the Lord wanted to go into Judea , He encountered the frustration caused by man's opinion, which is a sign of walking in darkness
The disciples said to the Lord that the Jews were seeking to stone Him and therefore He should not go into Judea
The Lord's word to His disciples in verses 9 and 10 indicates that their opinion was a sign that they were walking in darkness
In other words, as long as Christ is present, we are not in darkness; if Christ as the light of the world is present, it is daytime
As long as we express an opinion of any kind, that opinion will be a sign that we are in darkness and that we do not know what we are saying
Christ as the resurrection has been tested by death and has conquered death, and Christ as the life remains unchangeable and lasts forever
Christ nullified death, making it of none effect, through His devil-destroying death and death-swallowing resurrection
By itself, life can only have existence, but resurrection can withstand any kind of attack, even the attack of death
All matters which contain the touch of death are a test because these matters prove whether or not the Lord is the resurrection
Throughout the whole universe this will be the greatest victory, the victory that will testify that the Lord is the resurrection
After resurrecting us through regeneration, the Lord is now continuing this process of resurrection by sanctifying and transforming us
A great crowd of Jews esteemed Him highly and welcomed Him warmly , and even the Greeks were seeking after Him
Just as a grain of wheat releases its life by falling into the ground, so Christ released the divine life within Him through death
Through His death on the cross, the shell of His flesh was broken, and the divine life contained and concealed within it was released
Christ, who as a grain of wheat fell into the ground and died, grew out of death to produce many grains, which are the believers
His falling into the ground was to produce the many grains; His being lifted up was to draw all men to Himself
The many grains produced by His falling into the ground are the believers, the 'all men' drawn by His being lifted up on the tree
All those who are drawn to Him eventually become the many grains, the fruits produced by His death and resurrection
Verse 23 indicates clearly that the Lord was concerned for His glorification, and verse 24 explains what this glorification is
In verse 24 He went on to say Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies it abides alone but if it dies it bears much fruit
As the many grains, we also must lose our soul-life through death that we may enjoy the eternal life in resurrection
One difference between Christ as the one grain and us as the many is that He was willing to fall into the ground, but we are not
There might be a huge crowd, but there might be very little life because few are willing to experience the death of Christ
The shortage of life among the believers is due to the fact that we have not died enough to minister life to one another
We need to enjoy Christ as the grain of wheat by experiencing His life-releasing death for the multiplication of the divine life
Walk while you have the light so that darkness may not overcome you; and he who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going
The Lord was making a declaration to the religious crowd that He is the manifestation of God coming to them as light
If they receive Him, they will become sons of light, and if they do not receive Him, they will be overcome by darkness
Christ is the light into whom we believe, that we may become sons of light who do not remain in darkness and are not overcome by darkness
In this message we will consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in chapter thirteen of the Gospel of John
The Father had given the disciples, and the Lord had brought God into them, but now He was going to leave them
By His coming forth from God and His bringing God into them, a relationship between the disciples and God came into existence
Foot-washing is to wash from the feet all the dirt that frustrates the fellowship of the relationship between God and man
Although we have the divine life and have become the church, we are still living in this fallen flesh on the earth
Day by day we are touching the earth with our feet, and by contacting the earth with our feet, our feet certainly become dirty
For things that are sinful we need the cleansing of the blood, but for things that are dirty and not sinful we need the spiritual washing
In John 13:31 and 32, the Lord Jesus said, 'Now has the Son of Man been glorified, and God has been glorified in Him
For Christ to be glorified was to have His divine element released from within His humanity through death and resurrection
His death not only broke the shell of His humanity and released His divine life; it also terminated the old creation
In the next verse, Paul said, 'For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters'
These two verses reveal that by the cross of Christ we are separated from the world and are thus qualified to live in the new creation
The Fathers house is Christ enlarged with His believers to be Gods fullness through His goingHis death and in His comingHis resurrection
According to 2:16, My Father's house in 14:2 refers to the temple, the body of Christ, as God's dwelling place
In Christ's resurrection the church is the Body of Christ, which is the house of God , God's habitation , God's temple
As members of the Body of Christ raised up with Him, all the believers in Christ are the abodes, the rooms, in the Father's house
The Father's house is Christ enlarged with His believers to be God's fullness, the Body of Christ as the full expression of God
The Lord's going was to pave the way for man to be in God, that is, to bring man into God for the building of His dwelling place
Between man and God there were many obstacles, such as sin, sins, death, the world, the flesh, the self, the old man, and Satan
He had to go to the cross to accomplish redemption that He might open the way and make a standing for man, that man might enter into God
Anyone who does not have a standing, a place, in God does not have a place in the Body of Christ, which is God's dwelling place
His death-His going in order to accomplish His redemption-was to prepare a place in His Body for the disciples
After His resurrection the Lord came back to His disciples to be with them forever, thus not leaving them as orphans
The Lord's resurrection was a further step of coming into us to enlarge the Father's house, a mutual abode of God and man
Apart from the death and resurrection of Christ, there is neither a way for us to enter into God nor a place for us in God
John 14:4-6 reveals that Christ is the way for man to enter into the Father's house, that is, for man to get into the Father
According to verse 6, Jesus said to Thomas, 'I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me'
To take the Lord Jesus as the way means that when we walk in Jesus as the way, we arrive at the destination, which is the Father
Since the way is a living person, the place to which the Lord brings us must also be a living person, God the Father Himself
Although the disciples thought that both the place and the way were places, not persons, the Lord said to them, 'I am the way'
We are also involved with sin the world Satan and other negative things all of which are obstacles that make access to the Father impossible
The Lord has taken away sin, He has judged the world, He has destroyed Satan, and He has terminated the old creation
When we get into Christ as the way, we arrive at the Father as our destination, because the Son is one with the Father
From experience we can testify that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are immediately in the Triune God in an experiential way
If we were to call on a name other than that of the Lord Jesus we would not have a way into God because all other names are void of reality
Because Christ the Son is the embodiment of the Father, when we call on the name of the Lord, we have both the Son and the Father
If the Lord is going to be our way, He must be our reality, and if He is going to be our reality, He must be our life
By having Him as life, we have Him as our reality, and by having Him as our reality, we have Him as our way into the Father
In John 14:6, the Lord Jesus clearly said, 'I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me'
Because Christ is the way, the reality, and the life, when we have Him, we have the life, the reality, and the way
If we have Christ, we possess the divine element, which is His divine constitution of all the attributes of what God is
In John 14:7-26, Christ who is the Father's house is also revealed as the expression of the Father realized as the Spirit
Christ the Son is the embodiment and expression of the Father , and the Spirit is the reality and realization of the Son
The Father in the Son is expressed among the believers, and the Son as the Spirit is realized in the believers
The New Testament says not only that Christ the Son and the Father are with each other but also reveals that the Son and the Father coinhere
It is easy to see the matter of coexistence, but it is much more difficult to realize the matter of coinherence
The coinherence of the Son and the Father means that the Son is in the Father and that the Father is in the Son
Everything that the Son does is in coordination with the Father who abides and works in Him for the accomplishment of His economy
In verse 7 the Lord Jesus pointed out to the disciples that if they had known Him, they would have known His Father also
To this the Lord Jesus answered, 'He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father'?
If we have seen the Son, we have seen the Father because the Father is embodied in the Son to be expressed through Him
He came in the flesh to be among us, but He had to be transfigured into the Spirit before He could come into us
In verse 16 the Lord said, 'I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever'
The Greek word for 'Comforter,' paracletos , means 'advocate,' 'one alongside who takes care of our case, our affairs, and all of our needs'
Today we have the Lord Jesus both in the heavens as well as the Spirit within us as our Paraclete taking care of our case
He is the Spirit of reality because whatever the Father in the Son is and whatever the Son is, are realized in the Spirit
After becoming the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of reality in His resurrection, He is able now to abide not only with us but also in us
Christ is realized as the Spirit so that we may realize that He is in the Father, we are in Him, and He is in us
On the day of resurrection the disciples were to know that the Lord was in the Father that the disciples were in Him and that He was in them
By being in us and by bringing us into the Father, the Lord can build us together in the Triune God to be His eternal abode
As the expression of the Father realized as the Spirit, Christ comes to us with the Father and makes an abode with us
The Father and the Son come to the believer to make an abode with him that he and They may have an abiding place
We all have had this kind of experience, either in a deep way or in a shallow way, either for a long time or just for a few minutes
The Father responds to our love for the Son, and then the Father and the Son come to us to make an abode in our spirit
In this way the Father and the Son settle within us to make an abode with us, that is, to build the Father's house
The Holy Spirit comes not only from the Father but also from the Son, and He is the reality not only of the Father but also of the Son
When the Spirit comes from the source, it does not mean that He leaves the source but that He comes with the source
Everything that God the Father is and has is for the center, is embodied in the center, and is expressed through the center
Whatever God the Father is in the Son and whatever He has centralized in Christ the Son will be realized by the Spirit
Christ and the believers, the vine with the branches, form the organism of the Triune God in the divine dispensing
Now as branches we are filled with Christ as life, for to be a branch in the vine means that Christ has become our life
No plant other than the vine can illustrate adequately the living relationship between the believers and Christ
The branches, the believers in Christ the Son, are for the expression of the Son with the Father through fruit-bearing
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me
Because we are branches to the Lord and the Lord is the vine to us, we must abide in Him and let Him abide in us
Once we see the fact that we are branches in the vine, we need to maintain the fellowship between us and Christ as the vine
A little disobedience, a sin, or even a sinful thought can be the insulation that separates us from the riches of the vine
As far as we, the branches, are concerned, Christ, the tree, lives to be our support, our supply, and our everything
In the carrying out of God's economy-that is, growing a vine tree-without us Christ is unable to act, work, or to have any kind of activity
In particular Christ as the vine tree is the organism of the Triune God with the divine life for the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity
He is the source, the founder, and the first one to accomplish certain things according to His mind and purpose
Just as a farmer's economy is farming, growing things, so God's economy is growing a vine tree, a vine with many branches
With the vine we have the glorification of the Father through the expression of the riches of the divine life in fruit-bearing
In John 15:8 the word glorify means to have the intent, content, the inner life, and the inner riches released from within and expressed
Today the Triune God is within us as our life and nature and the expression of the life and nature of the Triune God from within us is glory
In 14:26, He says that the Father will send the Spirit; now in 15:26, He says that the Lord Himself will send the Spirit
Regardless of who it is who sends the Spirit, the Spirit is always sent with the Father and in the name of the Son
All that God the Father is and has is centralized and embodied in Christ the Son, and all of this is realized in the Spirit of reality
In other words, God the Father as the source is embodied in God the Son as the center who is now realized as God the Spirit as the reality
According to Acts 13:33, the Lord Jesus was born, begotten, in resurrection to be the Son of God with respect to His humanity
When Christ was born of Mary, He was born as a man, and His humanity had nothing to do with His being the only begotten Son of God
After the Lord's resurrection this 'woman' had a newborn child-the resurrected Christ as the firstborn Son of God-and she rejoiced
After His resurrection He was the 'child' with the divine life and the human nature with both divinity glorified and humanity 'sonized'
Christ's being the firstborn Son of God implies that He has many brothers and that He is the Firstborn among these brothers
We, as human beings, were all divinely sonized through His resurrection to be many sons of God to participate in His divine sonship
In the unique resurrection Christ was born and we were regenerated; hence, we were His 'twins' in the same delivery
Rather, all of us should declare, 'I am a part of the new man through the wonderful death and resurrection of the Son of God'
In resurrection Christ was born as a newborn child to be the firstborn Son of God with His believers to be His many brothers
According to John 16, it is by the work of the Spirit that we become the many brothers of Christ, the members of Christ
John 16 unveils the two categories of the work of the Spirit: the conviction of the Holy Spirit and the transmission of the Holy Spirit
John 16:8-11 reveals that the Spirit works to convict the world-mankind-concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment
Sin entered through Adam , righteousness is the resurrected Christ , and judgment is for Satan, who is the author and source of sin
Because Christ was accepted by God in His death, God raised Him up from the dead, and now He becomes righteousness to all who believe in Him
In verse 9 the Lord says that the Spirit would convict the world 'concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me'
If people wish to remain in Adam, it means that they want to remain in the old realm and not move into the new realm, which is Christ
The Father has been fully satisfied with the Lord's redemptive death on the cross and has accepted Him in His resurrection
As the resurrected One, He is also in us to live for us the life which can be justified by God and which is always acceptable to God
Justification includes the fact that God has resurrected Christ, accepted Him, and that He has been satisfied with His redemptive death
In John 16:11 the Lord said that the Spirit would convict the world 'concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged'
Satan, the devil, is the author of sin, the origin of death, the father of all sinners, and the ruler of the world
If we refuse to come out of Adam into Christ, we will share the judgment that is for Satan, because we prefer to remain as his followers
On the cross the Lord as the Son of Man was lifted up in the form of a serpent , that is, 'in the likeness of the flesh of sin'
Through His death on the cross 'in the likeness of the flesh of sin,' the Lord has destroyed Satan who is in the flesh
Sinners, who are born in Adam, must believe in the resurrected Christ so that they may have Him as their righteousness
When the gospel is preached in a proper way, those who hear should have the desire not to remain in Adam but to be transferred into Christ
To them the convicting Spirit will become the regenerating Spirit , the Spirit of life , and the Spirit of reality, dwelling within them
Now we can be filled and saturated with the Triune God who is dispensing Himself into us and mingling Himself with us
It is also through the transmission of the Holy Spirit that we become the many brothers, the members of Christ as the newborn child
As we have seen the first category of the Spirits work is to convict people that is to convince sinners to repent believe and be regenerated
What the Father has is a reality, what the Son has is a reality, and what the Spirit receives is also a reality
What the Father has becomes the Son's, what the Son has is received by the Spirit, and what the Spirit receives is disclosed to us
The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is transfigured to be the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reaching of the Divine Trinity to us
John 16:13-15 unveils to us the transmission of the Divine Trinity-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-into the believers
The Son not only has what the Father has He also has all the riches in His incarnation human living crucifixion resurrection and ascension
We have received everything that the Triune God is and has, but we have been too veiled to see and experience what we have received
The many brothers of Christ produced by the conviction and transmission of the Holy Spirit are for God's full glorification
The glorification of the sons of God will be accomplished by the Lord's coming back , at which time we will be manifested with Him in glory
In John 17 we come to the fourth aspect of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God-the Father's glorification
The main point of the Lord's message in John 14 through 16 is that the Son may be glorified so that the Father may be glorified in the Son
For the Son of Man to be glorified is for Him to have His divine element released, expressed, and multiplied through death and resurrection
After speaking the words recorded in John 13:31 and 32, the Lord Jesus went on to give the lengthy message recorded in John 14 through 16
Both the Lord's message in chapters fourteen through sixteen and His prayer in chapter seventeen are on the subject of glorification
In John 17:1 the Lord Jesus prayed, 'Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You'
His divine element was confined in His humanity, just as God's shekinah glory had been concealed within the tabernacle
Once, on the mountain of transfiguration, His divine element was released from within His flesh and expressed in glory
Before the prayer recorded in John 17, the Lord indicated that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him
He would also resurrect that He might uplift His humanity into the divine element and that His divine element might be expressed
The Lord participates in the divine glory, not separately by Himself, but along with the Father, for He and the Father are one
Before His incarnation Christ as the only begotten Son of God was with the Father in glory and enjoyed this glory with the Father
His humanity was a shell that covered and confined the divine life and nature, along with the divine glory, that were within Him
The divine glory, the expression of the divine life and nature, was therefore confined and concealed within the Lord's humanity
In Luke 24:26 the Lord said of Himself, 'Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory'?
According to the New Testament thought, resurrection is a release in life, and this release in life is a matter of glorification
Just before He was about to be crucified the Lord Jesus prayed not that the Father would resurrect Him but that the Father would glorify Him
The Son of God will be glorified in the oneness of the church, and the Father at that time will also be glorified in and through the Son
John was very strong to unveil the glorification of the incarnated Jesus, that is, the glorification of Christ by God with His glory
In His being glorified, He as a grain of wheat passed through death unto resurrection, and that is glorification
When Christ was resurrected, He was glorified to produce us as His many grains to form and constitute His Body
When the believers as the branches bear much fruit the Father is glorified for in fruitbearing the Fathers life the divine life is expressed
In John 15:8 we see that glorification is in fruit-bearing: 'In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit'
He prayed so that we would realize that we are in Him just as He is in the Father, and He is in us just as the Father is in Him
The oneness of the believers is by the Father's eternal life conveyed in the Father's name and in the Father's word
Our oneness is also by the Fathers sanctifying word as the truththe divine realitythrough the coinhering of the Triune God and the believers
The oneness is the glorification, the glorification is the new man, the new man is the vine, and the vine is the Father's house
One day the Lord Jesus will come in a physical manifestation of glory, and we shall be brought into that glory
The New Jerusalem will be the completion of the new man, the consummation of the vine, and the full building of the Father's house
In His crucifixion, after He was pierced by a soldier, blood and water, two elements which are critical to human life, came out of Him
Blood is to wash away our sins for redemption, and water is to dispense the divine life into us for life impartation
The blood which flowed out of the Lord's side was for redemption ; this was typified by the blood of the passover lamb
The blood of Christ is for Gods judicial redemption in His redeeming the believers forgiving the believers sins and washing away their sins
Christ is the life-imparting One who as the life-giving Spirit released His divine life signified by the water
The redemptive aspect is for the life-imparting aspect, which is even more wonderful than the redemptive aspect
God's purpose is that redemption be followed by the imparting of life, for God's intention is to dispense Himself into us as life
Redemption prepares the way for the release of the divine life so that this life may be dispensed into us for the producing of the church
Because His divine life has not only been released out of Him but also imparted into us, His death was a life-imparting death
The river of water of life signifies the Spirit of life, and the tree of life signifies Christ as the embodiment of the divine life
The blood was typified by the blood of the passover lamb , and the water was typified by the water that flowed out of the smitten rock
The Lord's word to Mary indicated that in resurrection His disciples had become the same as He insofar as they also were sons of God
By receiving His life they were reborn, regenerated, and became His brothers, having the same life as the Lord
His many brothers are the many sons of God and are the church , a corporate expression of God the Father in the Son
The many brothers are the propagation of the Father's life and the multiplication of the Son in the divine life
In John 20:17 the Lord Jesus also said to Mary, 'I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God'
By making His Father and His God theirs, He has brought them into His position-the position of the Son-before the Father and God
In life and nature inwardly and in position outwardly they are the same as the Lord, with whom they have been united
The Christ who breathed Himself into the disciples is the life-giving Spirit, and the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is breath
After the Lord Jesus accomplished all of His processes, He became the life-giving Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit is the pneumatic Christ
Such a One, the pneumatic Christ as the Spirit, came to His disciples and breathed Himself as the Spirit into them
From that time onward, He was truly one with His disciples, for He became the intrinsic being of His disciples essentially
The Gospel of John clearly reveals that Christ became flesh to be the Lamb of God and that in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit
The Holy Spirit in John 20:22 is the Spirit expected in 7:39 and promised in 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; and 16:7-8, 13
In resurrection Christ worked and walked with the believers as the Chief Shepherd to build up the church by shepherding His flock
We have to learn to shepherd people not by ourselves in the old creation but by Christ as the shepherding Chief in resurrection
Lamb-feeding is by the nourishing with the riches of the inner life, and sheep-shepherding is for the building up of the church
According to John 10, the Lord laid down His soul-life that His sheep might have His divine life and be brought together as one flock
Finally, in 1 Peter 5, Peter, as one of the elders, charges the elders to care for the sheep by feeding and shepherding them
In John 21:15 the Lord said, 'Feed My lambs'; in 21:16 He said, 'Shepherd My sheep'; and in 21:17 He said, 'Feed My sheep'
While we are serving the Lord today, we must not only care for His sheep but also feed them with spiritual food
If the Lord has committed to us the burden of His flock, we must be sure to do two things-to feed them and to care for them
In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in Acts
On the day of His resurrection angels told the women that Christ could not be found in the tomb, for He had risen from the dead
Like Paul we should aspire not only to know Christ in His death but even the more to know Him in His resurrection
The Lord's presenting Himself alive was for the purpose of training the disciples to practice and enjoy His invisible presence
In the Gospel of John there is no word or hint indicating that the Lord left the disciples after breathing Himself into them
From the time that He breathed Himself as the Spirit into the disciples on the day of His resurrection, the resurrected Christ dwelt in them
Rather, it means that He made His presence visible to them, training them to realize and continually enjoy His invisible presence
He was one with His disciples intrinsically and essentially, but the disciples were not used to such an invisible presence
Because of their weakness, He appeared to them and disappeared in order to train them to realize His invisible presence
He wanted them to know that even though they did not see Him or feel His presence, He was still with them all the time
In these forty days, the Lord trained the disciples to know their new being, to know that His essence had become their essence
He trained them to know that He had become them, that He had entered into them, and that He had brought them into Him
They were no longer separate from the Triune God, but they could now live a life in which they were one with the processed Triune God
They were no longer merely men, but God-men, divine men, with the Triune God as their intrinsic essence to become their divine being
The Lord was training them to live and behave in this life and to be persons in this life, the divine persons on this earth
When the Lord Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil, He fasted forty days and forty nights
In Acts 1 the Lord appeared and disappeared during a period of forty days in order to test and train His disciples
During these forty days, Christ as the One in resurrection also spoke to the disciples the things concerning the kingdom of God
It is not likely that during the forty days after His resurrection, He gave the disciples something new concerning the kingdom
When the Lord spoke regarding the kingdom in the Gospels, the disciples were not able to understand what He was teaching them
They did not have the spiritual insight to understand the kingdom of God, because the Lord was not yet in them
As a result, in Acts 1 they were very different, for Christ, the life-giving Spirit, was now within them as their life and person
Because they had the life-giving Spirit within them, they were able to understand the Lord's speaking concerning the kingdom of God
The kingdom of God is the spreading of Christ as life into His believers to form a realm in which God rules in His life
As the One in ascension, Christ poured out the Holy Spirit upon all flesh to baptize all His believers into one Body
The exalted Christ's receiving of the promise of the Holy Spirit was actually the receiving of the Holy Spirit Himself
By these two steps, these two instances, Christ the Head of the Body, baptized His entire Body into the Spirit once for all
Now what we need is not to be baptized in the Holy Spirit again but simply to experience the baptism already accomplished in the Holy Spirit
As the One in ascension, He was made Lord-the Lord of all to possess all -and Christ-God's Anointed to carry out God's commission
The pouring out of the Holy Spirit is a proof that God has exalted the Lord Jesus and has made Him both Lord and Christ
As the Lord, Christ now possesses the whole universe, God's chosen people, and all positive things, matters, and persons
In this kind of bold and extraordinary prayer, we claim what the Lord has obtained in His ascension-His lordship
Of begging the Lord to do something for us, we need to learn to pray by claiming what the Lord has obtained in His ascension
The Greek word rendered 'Author' is archegos, meaning 'author,' 'origin,' 'originator,' 'chief leader,' 'captain'
In 3:15 it denotes Christ as the origin or Originator of life, hence the Author of life, in contrast to the murderer
Only the Lord Jesus can be called the righteous One, because only He is right with God and with everyone and everything
To those who were selling the doves He said, Take these things away from here; do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise'
To you first, God, having raised up His Servant, has sent Him to bless you in turning each of you away from your wicked deeds'
Christ is the One in whom all the families of the earth, all races, colors, and nationalities, will be blessed
At the time Peter was speaking the word recorded in Acts 3:26, Christ, God's Servant, had ascended to the heavens and was still there
In these verses, Peter indicates that God has sent His Servant first to the Jews to bless them by pouring out His Spirit to them
There is salvation in no other, for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved'
His word unveiled the Jewish leaders rejection of Him and Gods honoring of Him for the building of His habitation among His people on earth
By this word Peter learned to know the Lord as the precious stone held in honor by God, as he expounded concerning Him in his first Epistle
As the cornerstone of God's habitation, Christ joins the wall of the Jewish believers and the wall of the Gentile believers
Christ is not only the holy One, the righteous One, the Author of life, and the Servant; He is also a stone for God's building
In Acts 53032 Christ is revealed as the Leader and Savior The God of our fathers has raised Jesus whom you slew by hanging Him on a tree
Christ, exalted by God to be the Leader and Savior, was also witnessed by the disciples and the Holy Spirit, who was one with the disciples
The Greek word rendered 'Leader' is archegos, meaning 'author,' 'origin,' 'originator,' 'chief leader,' 'captain'
It has been translated a number of different ways in various versions because there is no precise English equivalent to the Greek
He rules sovereignly over the earth with His authority so that the environment may be fit for God's chosen people to receive His salvation
He has been exalted to be the Leader over all the kings to arrange the environment so that His chosen people will believe in Him
According to Peter's word in Acts 5:31, the Lord is the Savior 'to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins'
To give repentance and forgiveness of sins to God's chosen people requires Christ to be exalted as a ruling Leader and Savior
Repentance and forgiveness are major gifts, and only the Lord Jesus as the Leader and Savior is qualified to give them
We need to realize that in this universe He is the only One qualified to give repentance and forgiveness of sins
Although the title 'Savior' is applied to Christ in His earthly ministry , He was not officially the Savior until His ascension
In Acts 5:32 Peter goes on to say, 'We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him'
Because a member of His Body was suffering on earth, the Son of Man was seen standing at the right hand of God
Now we are told that Stephen saw the glory of God and Jesus as the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God
The earth rejected Stephen and was closed to him, but the heavens opened up to him, indicating that the heavens were with him and for him
The resurrected Christ at His second coming will be the Judge of the living before the millennium on His throne of glory
Through such a One, forgiveness of sins is announced, and whoever believes in Him is justified from all things
In His first birth He was born of Mary to be the Son of Man, and in His second birth He was born in resurrection to be the Son of God
We who believe in Christ are the many sons of God and the many brothers of the Lord, the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God
The Gospel of John emphasizes that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that as the Son of God He is the embodiment of the divine life
He was the only begotten Son as the embodiment of life; now He is the firstborn Son for the propagation of life
Through His second birth, His birth in resurrection, Christ became the firstborn Son of God for the propagation of the divine life
Verse 33 indicates that Christ's resurrection was His second birth to bring Him forth as the firstborn Son of God
The resurrected Christ, who is God's firstborn Son brought forth through His second birth, His resurrection, is the holy and faithful things
It is very difficult to understand that the resurrected Christ is the holy and faithful things given to us by God
The holy and faithful things cover a wide span, a span much wider than that covered by the titles 'Savior' and 'firstborn Son'
According to the New Testament, Christ is life, light, grace, righteousness, holiness, sanctification, and justification
Chronicles 6:42 mentions 'the mercies of David,' the Lord's servant, and Psalm 89:1 says, 'I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever'
In chapter ten of the Gospel of John we have the door, the pasture, and the Shepherd, all of which are mercies
We all need to see that the resurrected Christ is all the holy and faithful things as mercies given to us by God as an all-inclusive gift
What Paul proclaimed here in his preaching of the gospel requires all the Epistles written by him for its definition
If we want to see more concerning Christ as the holy and faithful things, we need to study the fourteen Epistles of Paul
Through the One who is the firstborn Son, the Savior, and the holy and faithful things, forgiveness of sins has been announced to us
Through this One we are justified from all the things from which we could not be justified by the law of Moses
The One by whom we are forgiven and justified is not only our Savior; He Himself is our forgiveness and justification
Both forgiveness and justification are mercies from God to us, and these mercies are aspects of the resurrected Christ
Both forgiveness and justification are aspects of Christ Himself as mercies from God to us, and these mercies are holy and faithful things
Acts 1667 indicates that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the Spirit of Jesus the Holy Spirit who guided the apostles in their ministry
We need to pay careful attention to two divine titles in verses 6 and 7-'the Holy Spirit' and 'the Spirit of Jesus'
In order to understand the first usage of the title the Holy Spirit we need to see that this title is involved with the Lords incarnation
As a man, Jesus first lived a human life and then was crucified and resurrected, and He ascended to the heavens and was made Lord and Christ
In Acts 16 we see that the move of the apostles in their evangelistic work was, strictly speaking, not by the Spirit of God
These two divine titles indicate strongly that Paul's move in his evangelical work was not something in the way of the old dispensation
If it had been a move in the old dispensational way, then the Spirit of God or the Spirit of Jehovah should have been mentioned
God's New Testament economy is carried out through the Lord's incarnation, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension
Elsewhere we have pointed out that after His resurrection and in His resurrection Christ became the pneumatic Christ
The pneumatic Christ is constituted of certain elements: incarnation, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension
In Acts 16 Paul and his coworkers were moving under the direction of such a Spirit the Spirit who is the totality of the allinclusive Christ
These verses prove that the apostles were moving under the direction and guidance of such an all-inclusive Spirit
The kind of work we do for the Lord depends on the kind of Spirit by whom we are guided, directed, instructed, and constituted
Paul was not constituted of the Spirit of God or of the Spirit of Jehovah but of the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus
Christ as the Lord Jesus is the object of the believer's faith for the salvation not only of the believer but also of his household
Christ is a man to judge the world, designated by God in righteousness, and proved by God's raising Him from the dead
He was designated by God to execute this judgment, and God's raising Him from the dead is strong proof of this
In their preaching to the Gentiles, both Peter in 10:42 and Paul here and in 24:25 stressed the coming judgment of God
The resurrection of Christ is proof and assurance of His coming back to judge all the inhabitants of the earth
Because he was constituted of the Spirit of Jesus his goal no matter what the subject in speaking was to preach Christ and His resurrection
Gods redemptive work acquired the church now Gods person the allinclusive lifegiving Spirit cares for the church through the overseers
In the conception of the Lord Jesus, the God-man, the divine essence out of the Holy Spirit was generated in Mary's womb
Paul speaks of light instead of life because both the religious people and the Roman politicians were in darkness
After we have seen the vision, we need to contact people, telling them that Jesus has appeared to us and that we have seen Him
Whether or not our word, our ministry, could open other people's eyes depends upon how much we have seen and how much we have experienced
Acts 26:18 speaks not only of the opening of the eyes but also of the turn from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God
He has his authority and his angels , who are his subordinates as principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world
To be transferred to God is to be transferred to the authority of God, which is God's kingdom belonging to light
In Colossians 1:12 Paul says that the Father has qualified us 'for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light'
In the Old Testament the twelve tribes of Israel each received an allotment, a portion, of the good land for an inheritance
