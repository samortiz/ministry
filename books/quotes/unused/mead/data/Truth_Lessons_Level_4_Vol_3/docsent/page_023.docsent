   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>X. Reigning in the Coming Age with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>through Endurance in This Age</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By the experience of the divine dispensing, we will reign in the coming age with Christ through endurance in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 2 Timothy 2:12 Paul says, If we endure, we will also reign with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Enduring is related to life in this age, and reigning with Christ is related to the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Endurance is the entrance into the coming reign with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we would reign as co-kings of Christ, we need to endure sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Y. Being Given the Crown of Life</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>for Their Sufferings, Trials, and Tribulations</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Under God s sovereign arrangement, many trials, troubles, tribulations, and sufferings have been assigned to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They may wonder why trials come one after another like waves in the ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, in principle, everything that happens to them is assigned from their Father for their good.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, it is a basic principle that we should not try to escape sufferings, trials, and tribulations.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must believe in God s sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, we should not be foolish in dealing with people and in handling matters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the contrary, we should be wise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, no matter how wise we may be, we still need to believe that our Father in the heavens is sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Just as certain trees grow through the hardship of cold weather, Christians grow through hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our Father manages everything, and He assigns tribulations to us for our maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, sufferings afford us the best opportunity to enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God assigns to us the sufferings needed for our growth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, this growth will take place only as we remain under the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we need to contact the processed Triune God all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our contact with Him should be a continuous matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to keep ourselves always in the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our fellowship with the Lord should be as continuous as our breathing and as the circulation of blood in our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we fellowship with Him deep within us, we will receive and absorb the dispensing of the processed Triune God in a fine way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This dispensing comes from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By the nourishment that we receive through this dispensing, we will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, the crown of life will be given to the believers for their sufferings, trials, and tribulations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Revelation 2:10 says, Do not fear the things that you are about to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation for ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To the church in Ephesus, the Lord promised to give the overcomers to eat of Himself as the tree of life v. 7 . To the church in Smyrna, He promised to give the overcomers the crown of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The eating of the tree of life is inward for supply, and the crown of life is outward for glory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both promises are wrapped up with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This life first must be our food, and then it will be our expression and our glorification as the crown of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A basic lesson that we all need to learn is that everything in our circumstances and environments depends not on us but on the sovereign Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we should be at peace and not worry or be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our worry and anxiety do not help us at all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we worry or are anxious, we simply waste our energy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are not only in the Lord s hand; actually, we are also in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is the place in which we should remain, and He is also our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Day by day we should simply remain in His dispensing to have a direct enjoyment of the divine supply of the processed Triune God in His embodiment, which is Christ, and through His ultimate consummation, which is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The believers in Christ are appointed to suffer persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, we should count it all joy when we fall into various trials, because God, through the divine dispensing, uses them to perfect us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are pressed on every side but not constricted.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do not lose heart, for though our outer man is decaying, our inner man is being renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By experiencing the dispensing of the processed Triune God, we can also accept with joy the plundering of our possessions, knowing that we have a better and abiding possession.</S>

   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we love the Lord, we will be under trials.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are blessed if we endure trials, because when we have been approved by testing, we will receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to those who love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not regard the fiery ordeals that we experience as strange but rather rejoice in sharing the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord uses persecutions and trials to serve a positive purpose the purification of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As Christians, followers of Christ, we should be those who undergo the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we suffer from persecutors who contemptuously call us Christians, we should not feel ashamed but should glorify God in this name.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The sufferings His chosen ones undergo in fiery persecution are used by Him as a means to judge them so that they may be disciplined, purified, and separated from unbelievers so as not to have the same destiny as unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>While He is judging us as His household in His government, in His love He cares for us faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, we will suffer with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we suffer with the Lord, we will be glorified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The present sufferings mean nothing compared with the coming glory.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By the experience of the divine dispensing, we will reign in the coming age with Christ through endurance in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God has assigned to us many trials, troubles, tribulations, and sufferings for our maturity.</S>

   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Eventually, the crown of life will be given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>QUESTIONS How is the trial mentioned in James 1:2 different from suffering?</S>
