First of all, Moses is a type of Christ as the Apostle who brought God to us (Heb. 3:1) and the Prophet who spoke forth God (Acts 3:22-23).</p><h2 class="head1">I. MOSES TYPIFYING CHRIST<br />AS THE APOSTLE</h2><p>The Apostle is the One who was sent to us from God and with God (John 6:46; 8:16, 29). As the Apostle, Christ came to us with God to share God with us that we may partake of His divine life, nature, and fullness. This is typified by Moses, who was sent by God to serve the house of God (Heb. 3:2-6).</p><h2 class="head2">A. Sent by God</h2><p>In Exodus 3:10 God said to Moses, &ldquo;I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.&rdquo; This shows us that Moses was sent by God to the children of Israel to deliver them out of the tyranny of Pharaoh and the Egyptians. Christ as the Apostle sent by God came from God and with God to us (John 8:16, 29) that He might deliver us from the usurpation of Satan and the satanic world (John 17:15-16).</p>
