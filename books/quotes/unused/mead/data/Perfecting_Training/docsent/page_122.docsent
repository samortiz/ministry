   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SIDE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 9 Paul says that the Spirit of God dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He does not say that the Spirit of God is of you, or for you, or with you, or even merely in you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He says that the Spirit of God dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Greek, the root of the word dwell means a house.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So actually it could be translated that the Spirit of God houses in you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not the word that is used for abiding or remaining.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is the word that is used for housing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Spirit of God dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No husband can dwell in his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The most he can do is dwell with her.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sometimes he may dwell with her, and yet not do anything for her.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>So perhaps it is better to say that he dwells for her.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For you and me the best condition is to be in. This means to be in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And for the Spirit, the best condition is to dwell in. Concerning us, Paul used a form of the verb to be, but concerning the Spirit he used a strong and proper verb, dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, in the last part of verse 9, Paul picks up another predicate, the verb has.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So, in these two verses Paul uses two kinds of prepositions and three kinds of verbs.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have already mentioned the significance of the prepositions of and in. What is the significance of the use of the different kinds of verbs? If I ask whether or not you have the Spirit of Christ you would answer that you do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if I ask whether you are in the Spirit of Christ you would answer sometimes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The preposition in indicates a situation like the California weather.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It has a lot of fluctuation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the phrase dwells in is like Mount Rainier, standing there with no change.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When you are of Him, He dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When you are in Him, He dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is no change.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether it is raining or not, Mount Rainier still stands.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whether the sky is clear, or cloudy, or stormy, Mount Rainier stands solid.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the California weather changes quite often.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verse 9 the verb has indicates stability.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, the fact that you have a wife is settled forever.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But whether she is with you in the meeting tonight or not is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you are going to know the indwelling Spirit you must see these three prepositions in, with, and of and these three predicates are, dwells, and has.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some of these indicate an unchangeable standing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Others indicate fluctuations.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To say that we have the Spirit is altogether unchangeable, with no fluctuation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And to say that the Spirit dwells in us even the more indicates no change and no fluctuation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But even these two terms which indicate no change and no fluctuation have a slightly different meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To have something means to possess it, while to dwell means to occupy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>OUR EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus far we have been speaking according to the words, according to grammar, according to position, to possession, to occupation, and to condition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now we need to consider the matter of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the facts, we, the believers in Christ, all have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Also this Spirit dwells in all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have Him, and He dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These are the unchangeable facts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is no fluctuation with these facts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot lose Him, and He would never leave us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have Him forever, and He dwells in us forever.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>With these two points, there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But whether or not we are in Him is a matter of condition.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How then can you care for the condition?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is a crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you say that you want to be in, right away you are out.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But if you dare to say that you are in, right away you are in. You have to believe that you are in. Let me tell you why: you have Him, and He dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These are facts.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In a sense you don t need to turn to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You are in already.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Don t turn; just remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You are in. It is the same with the matter of abiding in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you see that you are in Christ, you don t need to abide.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you still need to abide, it means you are still outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you have seen that you are in Christ, you are in already.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You don t need to abide.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You just need to remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Right now He is dwelling in you, and right now you still possess Him.</S>
