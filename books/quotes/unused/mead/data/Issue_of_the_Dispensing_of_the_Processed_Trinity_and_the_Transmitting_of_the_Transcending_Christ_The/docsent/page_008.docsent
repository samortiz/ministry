   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2.The Father's dispensing in His choosing and predestinating of the believers issues in His sonship through His sanctifying of His chosen people, making them holy as He is in His life and in His nature, to make them like God in the divine life and nature, but without His unique Godhead.</S>
