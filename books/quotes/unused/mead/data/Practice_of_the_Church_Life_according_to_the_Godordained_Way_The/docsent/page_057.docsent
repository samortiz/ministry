   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Then, third, after one has been saved and nourished for several months, he surely will have a certain amount of growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At that time he will have entered into another stage, a stage in which he can be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The perfecting of the saints takes place in group meetings Heb 10:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For the group meetings, we can group together a number of the saints who have grown in life by being nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This should not be something done officially and formally by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This kind of grouping of the saints does not work well.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To group the saints together in a spontaneous way is another definite step in the practice of the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The last definite step in the practice of the God-ordained way is to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some of the saints may not have the burden to take up the step of offering the saved sinners as members of Christ, or the step of feeding the young believers, or the step of taking care of the grouping of the grown saints, but they may have a burden to practice prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who have such a burden should dive into this matter, learn it, and investigate it day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before giving a message, I often consider how to give the message for two or three days, morning and evening, before writing the message outline.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some of the saints need to dive into and become soaked with the matter of prophesying, leaving the other steps of the God-ordained way to others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They need to pick up the definite step of studying, improving, and carrying out one thing, that is, to prophesy in the Lord's Day morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some of the young people need to take the lead to set up a model, an example, of how to prophesy in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The elders, especially, should take a definite step in the practice of the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One elder should set up a pattern to be a gospel preaching priest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such an elder must still take the responsibility of caring for the affairs of the church, but he should have the attitude that he cannot sleep well or eat well or even pray well unless he contacts sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everywhere in America there are "ponds" full of "fish."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every city in America is a fishing pond.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, it is certainly wrong to say that in the United States there are no people to whom we can preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everywhere there are fish.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In carrying out the gospel priesthood, we should not do anything in a formal way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must do something in a desperate way; then we will see the result.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To get people saved, you must have "thick skin"; that is, while you are preaching the gospel, you must have no sense of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When people reject you, you need to say, "Thank you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Good-bye.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps I will see you next week."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day Brother Nee told us publicly that if we did not have thick skin, we were finished in the matter of gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are going to preach the gospel, we must not be shy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some saints were born shy, but they need to learn to have a thick face.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In China, Peace Wong was such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I was saved through her preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I was twenty years old at the time, and she was about twenty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although she was naturally a shy person, when she stood on the platform before a thousand people, she had the power and the boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When she spoke to people, regardless of their social status, she spoke with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some of the elders should take a definite step to feed the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Often those who are very good in carrying out the first step of the God-ordained way, the step of gospel preaching, are not suitable for the second step, the step of feeding the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They have the interest to get people saved, but they are not qualified to nourish the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To take the second step, you must have a genuine love and concern for people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A good mother knows how to cherish her children.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To cherish children is to make the children happy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When a child is naughty and will not eat, a mother should do something to make the child happy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then he will be willing to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do not know how to make a new believer feel comfortable and happy, we will not be able to feed him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To nourish and cherish people, we must have patience, we must have love, and we must give them whatever we want to give ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are not able to give people what we want to give ourselves, we are not qualified to nourish the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you have a good Bible in your hand and you are feeding a new one, and the new one sees the Bible and says, "This is a good Bible," you should be able to say, "This Bible is yours."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the way to feed the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some of the elders should also take a definite step to practice the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The most difficult among the four steps of the God-ordained way is to group people together.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we practice this step we will find that there are many things that we must do.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may need to be a medical doctor, a teacher, a carpenter, and even a shoe repairman.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the groups we will find many people with different needs.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, the members of our group will need our care in many different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Finally, some of the elders should take a definite step to practice prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Concerning the way to practice this step, I hope that all the saints will apply the principles in the messages given earlier in this series.</S>
