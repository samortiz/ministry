   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWING INTO THE LORD S IMAGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the church that the Lord wants today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church that the Lord wants is not just a church with saints who are standing on the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church that the Lord wants is a church in which the saints are standing on the ground of oneness and also eating Christ, enjoying Christ, absorbing His rich supply, and receiving His bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This bountiful supply first enters into their spirit, then into their mind, emotion, will and every part of their being, transforming their very essence.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What we believe in is not a doctrine but a living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am not just preaching messages of doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am preaching a living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After speaking to you for an hour, I do not care if you do not understand what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What I do care about is that your spirit has touched Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I do not expect you to remember everything you have heard.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>My only hope is that your inner being has been touched by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once your inner being has been touched by Christ, your spiritual understanding will increase, and when you go home, you will be able to contact the Lord yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You will also fellowship with Him a little, pray to Him a little more, and spend more time with Him so that your inner being will get the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then little by little His essence will enter into your essence and transform your essence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This transformation is not the result of a change in behavior but of organic metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Transformation goes together with growth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually, transformation is growth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The result of transformation is conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we are transformed, we will be conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At this juncture God s original intention in creating man will be achieved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When God first created man, He created man in His image so that man would express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, those who are redeemed by God will not only have His image but also His life and His essence.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His essence will be mingled with us, causing our entire being to undergo a metabolic transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moreover, after we have been transformed continuously, we will grow into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every living thing has a definite life, and every life has definite characteristics, a definite power, and a definite shape.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The seed of a henna flower, for example, has a life and a power with a particular shape.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All you have to do is to plant this seed into the ground and allow it to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The seed not only has the power to grow, but after a period of growth, it has the power to form that seed into the shape of a henna flower.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A flower is different from a factory-made plastic product.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Something made in a factory must be pressed into shaped by an outward mold.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The shape of a henna flower, however, does not come from a mold.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The shape of a henna flower comes through growth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The shape of a chrysanthemum also comes through growth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is true for plants as well as for animals.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When a puppy or a kitten is first born, it may not be easy to distinguish whether it is a dog or a cat.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, there is no need to worry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You simply need to allow the puppy or the kitten to grow, and while the puppy or the kitten is growing, you need not find a carpenter to make a mold to put on its body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you just allow the puppy or the kitten to grow, eventually, it will grow into the shape of a dog or a cat.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No matter how a puppy grows, it will never grow two horns like a cow, and no matter how a kitten grows, it will not grow into the shape, image, of a horse.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is because the life within each one of them has a definite shape.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God s image is in God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The image of the Lord Jesus is in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, if you just let the life of the Lord Jesus grow within you, His life will produce an image.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After a period of growth, His image will be manifested through you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, you may call this process growth, transformation, or conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We were all created, and we have all been redeemed and regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thank and praise the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now we are in the process of enjoying His bountiful supply and receiving His rich essence.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His supply and His essence cause our natural element to have a metabolic transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This organic transformation causes us to grow, to be transformed, and to be conformed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No doctrine can accomplish this; only the Spirit can.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hallelujah that He is the Spirit and that He is in us as our bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Dear brothers and sisters, from deep within I hope that every one of you would put aside the messages that you have heard for so many years.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It does not matter whether or not you remember those messages.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What you and I have to see today is that the all-inclusive Spirit with His bountiful supply is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This supply is an organic supply, a supply that is able to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As long as you enjoy Him continuously, allowing Him to add Himself into you more and more, then spontaneously you will grow, you will be transformed, and you will be conformed into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all should pray for this, and look to the Lord for this.</S>
