to Contact and Receive Him</h2>
<p>Furthermore, Genesis chapter two continues to show us that when God created man, He breathed into man&rsquo;s nostrils the breath of life. This breath of life became man&rsquo;s spirit (v. 7; Job 32:8). After reading this, many people do not understand why God created man with a spirit. However, little by little it has been uncovered to us through the books of the Bible that the human spirit is for contacting and containing God. For example, we all have a stomach. The stomach is a container to contain food. Man&rsquo;s body requires food for nourishment; however, for the food to be put into man, there needs to be a container. Hence, God created man with a stomach. The stomach holds the food that has been eaten, and then through a metabolic process the nutrients are transported through the blood to become the elements within man.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said that He is the bread of life and that he who eats Him shall live because of Him (John 6:48, 57). Like the Jews in those days, many Christians are puzzled when they come to this portion of the Word, having no idea what the Lord meant. When I was newly saved and came to this portion of the Word, I also wondered, &ldquo;After we eat the Lord as the bread of life, where is He in our being?&rdquo; Of course, He could not be in our stomach. I asked different ones but was not able to get an explanation. Some told me that the Lord&rsquo;s being the bread of life refers to the words written in the Bible and that to eat the Lord is to read and take in His written words. Hence, I tried my best to put the Lord&rsquo;s written words into my mind. I did not feel, however, that I had eaten of the bread of life. On the contrary, the more I read, the more I became perplexed. Formerly I did not know what the Bible was all about. After reading it with my mind, I gained knowledge but had no sense that I had received any supply within. Therefore, after many years I still did not know the meaning of eating the Lord.</p>
<p>Then one day I read where Paul tells Timothy, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:22). At first I did not understand what it was for the Lord to be with my spirit. First, I wondered how the Lord could be with my spirit since He is in the heavens. Second, I really did not understand what my spirit was. I knew that in my body there was a stomach and intestines and that in my head there was a brain, but I did not know what my spirit was. I really did not understand. Subsequently I read that the Lord had said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (John 6:63). Again I did not understand how words could become spirit. Then I read John chapter three where the Lord told Nicodemus, &ldquo;Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Nicodemus thought that to be born anew was to return to the mother&rsquo;s womb, so he said, &ldquo;How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born, can he?&rdquo; The Lord answered that to be born anew is to be born of water and of the Spirit because that which is born of the Spirit is spirit (vv. 3-6). The more I read, the more I became puzzled. When the Spirit entered into my spirit, I was regenerated. Then, where was my spirit? What was my spirit? After reading those verses, I was absolutely confused and without a clue as to what they referred to.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Mystery of the Divine Trinity</h2>
<p>After many years I gradually began to see the clear light and was able to thoroughly understand the revelation, realizing that God Himself is Spirit (4:24). Our God is triune; He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. However, the Father, Son, and Spirit are not three different Gods but one God. One day this God became flesh and came to the earth as a man. It was not just the Son who came, but the Son came with the Father and the Spirit. Therefore, in incarnation, it was not just the Son who came, but the Father, Son, and Spirit all came together.</p>
<p>Most Christians have the concept that when the Son came, He came alone, leaving the Father in the heavens. However, the Gospel of John says clearly that the Son came with the Father. John tells us that while the Lord was on the earth for over thirty years, He was never lonely because the Father was always with Him (8:29; 16:32). Not only so, John also says that the Son was in the Father and that the Father was in the Son (14:10-11). The Father&rsquo;s being with the Son is easy to understand and describe. For example, when the Son went to Galilee, the Father went with Him; when the Son went to Jerusalem, the Father went with Him; and when the Son went to the cross, the Father was also there with Him. This is very easy to describe. However, it is impossible to describe the Son&rsquo;s being in the Father and the Father&rsquo;s being in the Son. The coinhering of the two is truly a mystery.</p>
<p>In John 14:8 Philip came forward and said, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us.&rdquo; The disciples had been with the Lord, beholding Him for three and a half years. They had often heard Him speak about the Father yet had never seen Him reveal the Father to them. They thought that if the Lord would simply show them the Father, they would be satisfied. This is similar to the way we believe into the Lord. We also feel that if the Father were to come to us, we would definitely rejoice. However, the Lord was amazed by Philip&rsquo;s question, saying, &ldquo;Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?&rdquo; (vv. 9-10). This statement indicates that the Son and the Father are one. Therefore, when a person sees the Son, he sees the Father. Not only so, the Son is in the Father, and the Father is in the Son.</p>
<p>Following this, the Lord said, &ldquo;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter&rdquo; (v. 16). Then He also said that the Comforter is &ldquo;the Spirit of reality, who proceeds from the Father&rdquo; (15:26). The word <em>from</em> in Greek has the sense of <em>from with.</em> In other words, the Comforter does not come alone but comes with the Father. Moreover, since the Father is in the Son, the Son also comes. The result is that when the Spirit comes, the Father, Son, and Spirit all come. This is the Triune God.</p>
<p>Most Christians think that the Father is in the heavens and that when the Son resurrected and ascended, He also went to the heavens, sat down at the Father&rsquo;s right hand, and then sent the Spirit down upon the believers so that they could prophesy and speak in tongues. However, the Gospel of John clearly says that the Son is joined to the Father; that the Son sends the Spirit from the Father; that the Spirit does not come alone but comes from the Father and with the Father; and that since the Father is joined to the Son, the Spirit also comes with the Son. When a sinner repents on earth and prays to the Lord, calling on His name, immediately the Spirit comes, bringing the Father with the Son. It is impossible to thoroughly explain such a mystery.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
