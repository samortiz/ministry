   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LIVING WATER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the negative side we are burned, but praise the Lord, on the positive side we are being watered.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Something new, refreshing, strengthening, and enlightening waters us within.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are no human words which can explain what is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is like rivers of living water, as John mentions in his Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we really mean business with the Lord when we say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah, there will be something flowing within.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes it is a river of comfort, sometimes it is a river of love, sometimes it is a river of humility, sometimes it is a river of patience, and sometimes it is a river of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even when we are in a kind of darkness, if we will just say, O Lord! the light will shine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is the river of light flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes there is a river of rebuke within us when we say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Something within tells us that something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no need for someone to rebuke us outwardly; there is an inward rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the flow of the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The age has been changed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord will never honor mere doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord has turned the age from the doctrines to the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What we need is not the doctrines but the burning and the watering of the sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Doctrines do not work so well.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why there is no doctrine in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, there are the seven Spirits of God as the lamps of burning fire and the river of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah, we touch the throne, and something within burns and waters us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever I say, O Lord Jesus, I really enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is even better than reading a passage of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah a few times is so refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the watering of the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>TOUCHING THE THRONE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to continually touch the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not think that the throne is so far away.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In a sense it is in the heavens, but in another sense it is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hebrews 4:16 says, Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Where is the throne of grace?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must open our spirit and say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we will be burned and watered.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is very interesting how the Lord gave us these four words: O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In one of the Lord s Day morning meetings in January 1968, I told the brothers and sisters that they all had to function and say something in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then I said that everyone could at least say four words.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But I did not know what the four words were.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I was surprised at what I had said and thought to myself, What are the four words?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then I said, The four words are: number one O, number two Lord, number three Amen, and number four, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These four words simply came in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do not think that before I spoke I had some kind of consideration regarding these four words.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No, I did not have these four words before I spoke that morning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But these four words spontaneously came out: O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We will never know how much these four words have helped the brothers and sisters, not only in the United States but also in the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>While we were visiting Taiwan, wherever we went, we mentioned these four words, and the enjoyment and power we had was much better than that of any kind of message.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Suppose that in the meetings of the local church we did not do anything but say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the Lord were to lead us to do this for two hours, I believe we would all be set on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everyone would be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is much, much better than any kind of prevailing message.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is because when we say these four words, we are touching the seven Spirits of God which are before the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Try it and see if the seven Spirits will not burn you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I want to say something about a brother who was caught by the Lord here.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is a young man from San Francisco.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At the time the Lord caught him, he was a hippy and a boyfriend of a young sister in San Francisco.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At the winter conference of 1968, this young sister came to Los Angeles, and this hippy boyfriend came also.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But before he came, he made up his mind not to respond.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then in one of the meetings we all suddenly stood up and clapped our hands with singing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Before that time we had not clapped our hands, but in that meeting we all clapped our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He was standing in the meeting but said to himself that he would never clap his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After a short while, however, he started to clap his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He told us that once he clapped his hands, he was caught by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Immediately after he clapped his hands, he was caught by the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He was set on fire, and when he returned to San Francisco, there was a real transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He cut off his beard and his long hair.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There was such a change within him that he influenced his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>How was he caught by the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It was not by preaching or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It was just by touching the Spirit through calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is really wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have seen that to reach the unbelievers, no preaching is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we help them to say O Lord three times, they will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If they open the window, the air will get in. All they have to do is to open their mouth and say, O Lord, O Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Even if they have no intention of believing, still they will be caught.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Regardless of whether they have the intention or not, as long as they open the window, the air will get in. It is not a matter of teaching; it is a matter of touching the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>NO FORMS OR REGULATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The book of Revelation also has no forms or regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Can you find any regulations or forms in this book?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I cannot find any, but I can find, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God, who sits upon the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>And a voice came out from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all His slaves and those who fear Him, the small and the great.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>19:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You may say that this is something which takes place in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But we need it on earth as it is in heaven Matt 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>However, even this is not a regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Sometimes the seven Spirits will lead us to be silent, and at other times the seven Spirits will lead us to shout.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We have no regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In the last book of the Bible there are no doctrines, no forms, and no regulations for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>There are only the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is all we need.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If we come to the throne of God and say, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, the seven Spirits of God will burn and flow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Today is the day of the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Do not talk anymore about doctrines or you will be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The letter kills.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Knowledge kills.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Doctrine kills.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Teaching kills.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>All the written code kills.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The word of the Bible must not be the letters but the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The Lord said, The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>It must not be the knowledge, the doctrines, or the teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It must be the Spirit, and even more, the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Let us all open ourselves to the Spirit to be really burned and watered so that the Lord may have a free way among us in the local churches.</S>
