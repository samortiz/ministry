   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Later, there was a second split among them.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This division was between the so-called closed Brethren and the open Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>George M ller was one of the leading brothers among the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was a real man of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was called the king of faith in the nineteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was so much with the Lord, but there was a big discrepancy between his understanding and Darby's realization.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Darby and his followers insisted on not accepting any Christian who was still joined to a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They considered all denominations as sin, evil.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, in their eyes, regardless of how good or spiritual a person was, as long as he remained in a denomination, he was considered by them as a companion of this evil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They considered a Christian in a denomination as an evil companion, and they would not receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>George M ller, however, said that this was not fair.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He said that many dear saints who were involved with the denominations were still very close to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He maintained that these believers could not be rejected and that they had to be received.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was the discrepancy between Darby and M ller, which led to another division among the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, by this time there were three main groups among the Brethren Benjamin Newton's group, the closed Brethren, and the open Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The so-called Plymouth Brethren in this country mainly refers to the open Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Within ninety years after the formation of the Brethren in 1828, they were divided into over one hundred divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today there are all kinds of divisions among the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I was told by one sister among them that one group of Brethren was divided over whether or not to have an organ in their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Saints throughout the church's history have had different kinds of concepts concerning the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some believed in pre-tribulation rapture, others believed in post-tribulation rapture, and still others believed in a partial rapture, which takes place before and after the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Forty years ago, I spent much time to study which school was the most scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At that time Brother Nee gave us a number of messages on the truth concerning the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He gave us a list of well-known believers who were found in all three schools of truth concerning the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>J.N. Darby, William Kelly, R.A. Torrey, Phillips Brooks, James Gray, Arno C. Gaebelein, J.A. Seiss, D.L. Moody, and C.I. Scofield are some of those who believed in pre-tribulation rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>George M ller, A.J. Gordon, A.B. Simpson, W.J. Erdman, W.G. Moorehead, Henry Frost, James Wright, and Benjamin Newton believed in post-tribulation rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hudson Taylor, Robert Chapman, Robert Govett, D.M. Panton, G.H. Pember, and Paul Rader believed in the rapture of the overcomers, which is called the partial rapture, or the mid-tribulation rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul Rader was the successor of R.A. Torrey in the Moody Memorial Church of Chicago.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The doctrinal differences among the saints concerning the truth of the rapture caused much division.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although the beginning of the divisions among the Brethren started over a disagreement concerning the rapture, the truths that were revealed to them greatly benefited all of the Lord's children.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I would say that over ninety percent of the theology of fundamental Christianity came from the teaching of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the United States, many fundamental seminaries use the teachings of C.I. Scofield.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Dr. Scofield was a great scholar and a student of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nearly ninety percent of what he wrote in his reference Bible and his Bible correspondence course was adopted from Brethren teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>D.L. Moody said that if all the books in the entire world were to be burned, he would be satisfied to have a copy of the Bible and a copy of C.H. Mackintosh's notes on the Pentateuch.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>C.H. Mackintosh was a great teacher among the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Regardless of whether the fundamental denominations agreed with the Brethren move or not, their fundamental teaching was very much influenced by the Brethren teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a sense, the Brethren teaching helped the so-called church, but in another sense, these teachings issued in divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The move among the Brethren at the beginning was really marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This was a golden time that was a great help to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many spiritual, seeking Christians agree that this may have been the beginning of the fulfillment of the prophecy in the Lord's epistle to the church in Philadelphia in Revelation 3.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, due to the Brethren's overemphasis on doctrines, they were divided again and again.</S>
