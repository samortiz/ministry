   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHILD BEING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE SON BEING THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Any healthy mind would understand that the mighty God must refer to the child and that the everlasting Father must refer to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As no one would twist the words child or son, no one twists the name mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every Christian believes that the child Jesus born in the manger at Bethlehem is the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No Christian twists this part of the verse.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Anyone who does not believe that the child born in Bethlehem is the mighty God is not a genuine Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, he is an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although he might be a Jew, he is not a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Based upon the same principle, we must also believe that the Son is the everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In brief, the child is God and the Son is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Who can twist this?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One day, Martin Luther declared that as long as he stood with the Bible no one could condemn him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although I would not compare myself with Martin Luther, I also say the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As long as I stand with the pure word of the Bible, no one can accuse me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If anyone accuses, he does not accuse me; he accuses the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I do not teach about Isaiah 9:6 or interpret it I simply quote it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Isaiah 9:6 reveals clearly that the child is the mighty God and that the Son is the everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not merely a word written by Isaiah; it is an utterance inspired by the Holy Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Holy Spirit says that the child is called the mighty God and that the Son is called the everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why does the Holy Spirit speak this way?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The reason is that the child came for the purpose of bringing God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The little child Jesus came to the human race to bring God to man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Was He a child or God?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Certainly He was both, for the child and God are one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because He is the mighty God, when people contact Him, they contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The child was the embodiment of God and brought God to man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The principle is the same with the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Son brings the Father to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without the child, no one can touch God, and without the Son no one can reach the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The child brings God to us, and, in the same principle, the Son brings the Father to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you want to contact God?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You have no way except through the child Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do you want to reach the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You have no way except through the Son John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we receive the child, we have God, and when we receive the Son, we have the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>OUR GOD AND FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here we see the basic truth that God is not only our God, but also our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God s being God to us is mainly a matter of His creation, but His being the Father to us is mainly in regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As God s creatures, we need to have God as our God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But as the children of God, we need God to be our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are not merely God s creatures having God as our God; we are also His children having God as our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today, is God only God to you and not the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many times I say, O God, my Father, I worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I say, O God, my Father, I imply that I am a little creature, yet I have been regenerated to be a child of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am not only a little creature of God; I am also a child of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This absolutely corresponds to the basic truth in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Old Testament God is rarely called the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The few times that this is mentioned are found mainly in Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, in nearly every epistle in the New Testament, the writers speak of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The apostle Paul also said, God our Father Rom 1:7; 1 Cor 1:33; Gal 1:4; Eph 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Praise the Lord that we are not merely creatures of the creating God, but also children born of the begetting Father!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today, our God is not only the creating Creator; He is also the begetting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the basic truth of Isaiah 9:6, and no one can argue with it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I believe that the Lord Jesus was the child, and I believe that He was also the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As the child He brought God to us, and as the Son He brought us to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, our God today is God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I invite you to exercise your spirit and your mind over Isaiah 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This verse firstly says that a child is born to us and that His name is the Mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then it also says that a son is given to us, and that His name is the everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Oh, Jesus is both!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He not only brought God to us, but He also brought us to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How balanced He is!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was not only the child, but also the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As you believe that the child is the mighty God, do you also believe that, according to Isaiah 9:6, the Son is the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do not say that this is Brother Lee s teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is not fair to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You must say, Isaiah 9:6 tells me that the Son is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is not modalism.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is the pure revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I beg our critics to exercise their conscience concerning who is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Who is heretical a man who believes exactly according to the pure word of God or those who twist this verse?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Be fair!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I like to be honest and exercise my conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I beg you to exercise your conscience and to be fair.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Can you honestly say that Witness Lee is a heretic when he points out that, according to Isaiah 9:6, the Son is the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I would like now to quote a portion from the transcription of a tape recording of a discussion held regarding us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The speaker is the author of a tract against us:</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Anyway, Isaiah 9:6: For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and the government shall reign upon his shoulders...his name shall be called the Wonderful Counsellor, the Prince of Peace, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There Jesus is called the Father, right?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>So, He is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>That s Isaiah 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Now, we don t normally say this because tradition is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Jesus is called the Father; He must be the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>After admitting the truth, the speaker then begins to twist this verse:</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We were taught that there should be another interpretation of the Hebrew word.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Instead of everlasting Father, it should be Father of eternity, the originator...a figurative term in that case, the one who begot eternity, the one who set it forth.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>And so...as you look at the Bible, it does reveal these two distinct persons, so Jesus can t be the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Many verses they give you on this subject you have to look at very carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It can t be.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is impossible this way.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Hence, the speaker concludes that it is impossible for Jesus to be the Father.</S>
