   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The teaching of this illustration is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Jesus has died and has given to us all His righteousnesses, divine virtues, perfections, victories, beauties, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By these we become the same as He is before God, and God accepts us in the same way that He accepts the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is what He has given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These things are facts from the moment we become Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As far as the fact goes, we are already as perfect as the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But as far as experience goes, we may not be this way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The meaning of this "fact" is none other than the grace that God has given to us and accomplished for us through the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This grace has been given to us through our union with the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is possible for us to have the fact of inheriting the inheritance without having the experience of enjoying the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is a big difference between fact and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many believers are very rich in fact because everything that is God's is theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, in experience they are the poorest because they do not practically use and enjoy their riches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The older son in Luke 15 is a good example of this condition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As far as the fact goes, he was the child who was "always with me, and all that is mine is yours" v. 31 . But as far as experience goes, he never had "a goat that I might be merry with my friends" v. 29 . He was the son of a rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was his position, a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet it was possible for him not to have enjoyed even a goat.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was his condition, his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should be very clear concerning the distinction between the fact and the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These two things are two different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the first case, it is what God has accomplished for us; it is the position that God has given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the second case, it is what we practice; it is our enjoyment of what God has given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At present, believers tend to go to the extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some actually the majority do not know the riches they have in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They do not know that everything that the Lord Jesus has accomplished is theirs already.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They plan and scheme to secure grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They try to work out all kinds of righteousnesses by their own strength in order to meet God's demand and satisfy the inclination of their new life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Others not a few think that they understand God's grace all too well.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They think that the Lord Jesus has already exalted them to a matchless position.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They are satisfied already and do not seek to put into practice experientially the grace that they have received from the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Both kinds of people are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who pay attention to experience and forget the facts are bound by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who pay attention to the facts and despise experience take grace as an excuse for indulgence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the one hand, a Christian should understand through the Scriptures his lofty position in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the other hand, he should examine under God's light whether or not his walk matches the grace of his calling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God has placed us in a most lofty position.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through our union with the Lord Jesus, all of the Lord's accomplishments and victories are ours.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is our position in fact.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The question now is how we can experience all of the Lord Jesus' accomplishments and victories.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Between the fact and the experience, that is, before the fact can be turned into experience, before God's accomplishment can be turned into man's practice, there is still the step of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This step of faith is nothing other than the "utilization" or "management" of the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord has left us a will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He has died, and the will is now in effect.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should no longer hold an indifferent or unconcerned attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead we should rise up to "utilize" the inheritance that we have received so that we can enjoy, or experience, the blessing of the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are God's children already.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All that God has is now ours 1 Cor 3:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not be like the older son who vainly possessed the promises without entering into the enjoyment of them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Due to his foolishness and unbelief, he did not ask nor did he utilize.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, he did not have anything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If he would have asked to exercise his right as a son, he would have had not just one goat but thousands upon thousands of them!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What we need now is nothing other than the utilization by faith of what God has promised to us; we should "cash in" by faith what God has prepared for us in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For the one who is to inherit a will, there are two things he has to do before he can enjoy and experience the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First, he has to believe that there is an inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Second, he has to rise wholeheartedly to manage this inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Of course, if one does not believe that there is an inheritance, he will not rise up to manage it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, we must first acknowledge that God has indeed made the Lord Jesus our "wisdom...righteousness and sanctification and redemption" 1 Cor 1:30 , that all of the Lord's accomplishments and victories are our accomplishments and victories.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we do not have this faith, not only can we never expect any spiritual experiences, but we are sinning against God and doubting His work!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Second, those in the world manage an inheritance with their physical strength.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But for us to manage our spiritual inheritance, we have to use our spiritual strength, which is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As this spiritual inheritance is already ours, we must advance one step further by faith to "cash in," to utilize, and to manage our inheritance in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the Old Testament we see another instance which can adequately show us the relationship between fact, faith, and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the history of the Israelites entering Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the old days, God promised the land of Canaan to the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He mentioned this to Abraham, to Isaac, to Jacob, and even to the tens of thousands of people who left Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To God, the land was already given.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God promised to fight for them and that they would overcome all their enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It was a fact that God had given the land and the peoples of Canaan to the Israelites already.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Although the fact was there, they did not yet have the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As far as the fact was concerned, the land was theirs already, yet in experience they still did not own an inch of it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is why they had to "go up at once and possess it," for they were "well able to prevail" Num 13:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, due to their unbelief, despite the fact that God had given them the land, they were not able to possess it in experience.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After one generation, God told Joshua, "Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses" Josh 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They were to inherit the land that God had given them with the soles of their feet.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Later when they went up, they inherited the land.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This shows us the secret of substantiating the perfection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God has already given us what Christ "is," "has," and "has done"; they are all ours already.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Now what we have to do is to experience all that He is, has, and has done.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There is no other way to experience all this except to acknowledge that Canaan is good; if we will realize every inch of God's land with the soles of our feet, we will indeed find ourselves inheriting the land that God has given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God gives; we believe and receive.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is fact, faith, and experience.</S>
