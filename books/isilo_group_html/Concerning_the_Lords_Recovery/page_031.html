Furthermore, Paul was travailing until Christ would be formed in the believers (Gal. 4:19). Christ not only needs to live in us, but also to be formed in us. To have Christ formed in us means to have Christ saturate every part of our inner being&#151;our mind, our emotion, our will, our thinking. Christ may be in you, but He is still not formed in you. Christ needs to be formed within you so that you can express God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TRIUNE GOD IN US</H2><P>Romans 8 tells us that the Spirit of God is in us, the Spirit of Christ is in us, and the Spirit of the One who raised up Jesus from among the dead is in us. Colossians 1:27 tells us that Christ the Son is in us, and Ephesians 4:6 tells us that the Father also is in us. So the Son is in us, the Spirit is in us, and the Father is in us. The Father is not only in us, but above us and through us. How wonderful! The Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;is in us so that we might be His expression. When we love, it must be the Triune God loving in us, with us, and through us. When we are speaking it must be the Triune God speaking in us, through us, and with us. The church life is just the Triune God doing everything in us, through us, and with us. Such a church life is the expression of God. This is the central thing that the Lord is going to recover. The Lord has no intention to recover the trivial things. The Lord is working to recover the Triune God wrought into our being and living in us, with us, and through us for His expression. This expression is just the church life.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Concerning the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 31</div><br></body></html>
