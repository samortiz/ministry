This makes it possible for us to live to God.<h2 class=head1>GOOD MEN AND EVIL MEN BOTH LIVING TO THE LAW</h2><p>The Gentiles, however, who do not believe in God and do not have God, still live to the law. They live to the law because they do not have God, just as those who do not have a car have no choice but to walk. In addition to not knowing God and not having God, they have the evil power of Satan within them that incites them to sin and to do evil. They know that they ought to do good and to stay away from evil, so naturally they establish certain rules and determine principles for human conduct. Although they do not have God and even have Satan within them, as human beings they still have a desire to be good and to do good. In this contradictory situation certainly they will live under the law and attempt to keep the various principles of human conduct under the law. Their hope is to be successful in their attempts to keep the law. They do not think about God; rather, their thoughts are altogether on the law.<p>Their practice is most displeasing to God because it puts God aside. In their attempts to keep the law in order to be virtuous, well-behaved, and good people, the unbelievers act by themselves and thus put God aside. They do not acknowledge that there is God-they deny the existence of God, yet they try to maintain a high standard of conduct by being very careful in their speech and actions. In this way they put God aside, conducting themselves and trying to do good by themselves. Just as those who sin and do evil, such as robbers, swindlers, and extortioners, are without God and put God aside, so those who are proper, upright, and well-behaved can also be without God and put God aside.<p>This shows us that some people have fallen into evil and thus have put God aside, while others have fallen into good and thus have also put God aside. In our society there are these two categories of people. One category consists of those who are capable of committing every crime under the sun, including being treacherous, cruel, deceitful, and evil. There is no doubt that such ones have put God aside and that God has no place in them. The other category consists of people who are well-behaved, who conduct themselves properly, who are trustworthy, and who possess high morality yet at the same time vehemently deny the existence of God. Such ones have also put God aside, and God has no place in them.<h2 class=head1>DOING GOOD AND DOING EVIL BOTH BEING RELATED TO THE LAW</h2><p>Therefore, there are two different kinds of people: one kind does evil, and the other kind does good. According to good and evil, these two kinds of people are absolutely different. Yet in the matter of putting God aside and not giving God any place, they are absolutely the same. Just as those who do evil put God aside, so those who do good also put God aside. Just as those who do evil do not give God any room, so those who do good also do not give God any room. These two kinds of people behave differently-one does good and the other does evil; nevertheless, they have exactly the same kind of attitude toward God. Those who do evil give up the law, thereby rejecting God, and those who do good keep the law, thereby also rejecting God. The former forsake God by violating the law, while the latter forsake God by observing the law. Both groups of people have problems because of the law. The first group of people gives up God because they have broken the law, whereas the second group forsakes God because they consider that they have kept the law. Hence, we can see that both these conditions of rejecting God are related to the law.<h2 class=head1>GOD DESIRING US NEITHER TO DO EVIL NOR TO DO GOOD</h2><p>Then what should we choose? Should we choose good or evil? Should we choose to break the law or to keep the law? On the surface, it seems that it is much better to keep the law than to break the law, because it appears that breaking the law alienates us from God while keeping the law might bring us closer to God. Thus, it seems that we should choose to do good. However, although doing good might appear to be a worthy goal, yet it is not the right goal, and in fact it is the wrong goal. Doing evil is an unworthy goal and the wrong goal as well. Therefore, both good and evil are wrong. Of course, God has absolutely no intention for us to do evil, but neither does He intend for us to do good. God&#8217;s intention is neither for us to be responsible to do evil nor for us to be responsible to do good.<p>Those who sin and do evil, such as bandits, robbers, and fornicators, put God aside and do not care about God. If they were aware of God, they would be afraid to do evil things. The reason they dare to do evil things is that they do not acknowledge the existence of God; they have put God aside. Those who conduct themselves in an upright and proper manner are moral and good in others&#8217; eyes. They are often boastful, saying, &#8220;What are heaven and hell? Who is God and who is the devil? Such things do not exist! Everything depends on our conducting ourselves according to our conscience. We should do things according to proper reasoning. We should not do things that would hurt others, nor should we do things that would harm ourselves. We should take care of others as well as ourselves. It is good enough that we conduct ourselves in an upright way.&#8221; People like this have good behavior, their words are trustworthy, and their character is good, but they do not acknowledge the existence of God. This is to be good. People who are good in this way are commendable but mistaken because their goal is incorrect.<h2 class=head1>MAN BEING CREATED TO CONTAIN GOD</h2><p>In the beginning God created man neither to do good nor to do evil. Rather, God created man for His purpose. He wanted man to have fellowship with Him, to be filled with Him, to live in Him, and to be mingled with Him as one entity. Man was created for God as a vessel to contain God (Rom. 9:21, 23). This is similar to a glass being made as a vessel to contain water. It is wrong to put dirty things into the glass, but even if we put gold into it, it is still wrong. This is because the glass was made as a vessel to contain water, not other things.<p>Human beings were created neither to contain evil nor to contain good. We were created neither to be evil persons nor to be good persons. Then what kind of people should we be? How can a living person do neither evil nor good? Can anyone escape from good and evil? None of us can. A person who is without God cannot escape from good, evil, and death in his life. Only a person who has died does neither good nor evil.<h2 class=head1>BEING NEITHER GOOD MEN NOR EVIL MEN BUT GOD-MEN</h2><p>Praise the Lord that those who have God&#8217;s life have another choice-to be God-men. As those who have the life of God, we would not do evil, neither would we do good; even the more, we would reject death. We are afraid of good, evil, and death. However, there is One of whom we are not afraid, and not only are we not afraid of Him, but we even desire Him. This One is God. Why do we desire God? It is because God is man&#8217;s goal and content, and man was created for God.<p>In the garden of Eden there were two trees: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 2:9). Concerning the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the Bible says that he who eats of it shall surely die (v. 17). When someone eats of this tree, it may seem to be evil, but it is actually death, or it may seem to be good, but in reality it is still death. The issue of evil is death, and the issue of good is also death. These three-good, evil, and death-are inseparable. Then what is the tree of life in the middle of the garden? This tree of life is life itself. What man sees is life, what he eats is life, and the issue of his eating is also life. Who is this life? This life is God Himself.<p>Please remember that in the garden of Eden the first tree- the tree of life-is God Himself, and the second tree-the tree of the knowledge of good and evil-is good, evil, and death. People on earth who do not have God choose the second tree instead of the first. The result of choosing the second tree is good, evil, and death. They are good men, evil men, and eventually dead men. These three kinds of persons are all in the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Then, as saved ones, are we good men, evil men, or dead men? Praise the Lord, we who have been saved have the life of God in us, so we are God-men.<p>However, is our real situation like this? Are we God-men in our daily living? This is a big problem. It is very difficult for us to be freed from the law in our human living. We are always turning back to the law, and the law is always following us. Even today, having become Christians, we still cannot easily break away from the law, and instead of living to God, we still live before the law to be people of the law. Although we have been saved and we have God in us, we do not live to God.<p>As human beings we were created for God Himself. We are vessels to contain God. We should not take good or evil into us; rather, we should take God into us. How can God be put into us? It is by means of the Holy Spirit. The Scriptures tell us clearly that when the Holy Spirit is in us, God is in us (1 John 3:24; 4:13; Rom. 8:9a, 11). What does God want us to do? God wants us to be dead to the law so that we may live to God. Before we were saved, we lived to good and evil; that is, we lived to death. Now that we are saved, we should start learning to live to God. This means that as vessels to contain God according to His purpose in creating man, we should live to God instead of living to the law. We should be neither good men nor evil men but God-men.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>BEING DEAD TO LAW BUT LIVING TO GOD</h1><h2 class=head1>THE LAW BEING VERSUS GOD</h2><p>Galatians 2:19 says, &#8220;For I through law have died to law that I might live to God.&#8221; This verse mentions two goals: one is the law, and the other is God. Philippians 3:6b-8 says, &#8220;As to the righteousness which is in the law, become blameless. But what things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ. But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ.&#8221; Here Paul counted the righteousness in the law as loss, and even cast it aside, that he might gain Christ. Then in verses 9 through 11 Paul said that he was found in Christ, not having his own righteousness which is out of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith, so that he might know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, if perhaps he might attain to the out-resurrection from the dead.<p>These two portions of the Scriptures refer to the question of the law, and they both point out that the law is versus God. The apostle Paul was previously a keeper of the law; as such, he declared to all that as to the requirements of the law, he was blameless. He served God zealously according to the law, thinking that in this way he could please God. One day, however, while he was zealously serving and doing things for God, the Lord came and shone upon him, saying, &#8220;Why are you persecuting Me?&#8221; (Acts 9:3-4). Paul was a person who was serving God zealously and keeping the law of God, yet he turned out to be a persecutor of God. Whether or not we are as good as Paul according to the law, we have offended God. Even if we were as good as Paul was, we would still turn out to be persecutors of God.<h2 class=head1>LIVING TO THE LAW BEING A PARADOX</h2><p>Because we are all living under the law, whenever we transgress the law and its regulations, we are convicted inwardly. In addition, afterward we may be afraid that we will transgress again, so we confess, make a resolution, and pray to ask for the Lord&#8217;s help. Before we were saved, we were loose and careless. However, on the day we were saved, we became religious. In putting ourselves under the law, we daily face the difficulty of being good and moral. We put the Lord aside in order to improve our behavior and to do good. Not only so, we even ask the Lord to strengthen us to do good. In reality, this is a paradox. We ought to take the Lord as our goal by living to Him, yet instead we take goodness, which is outside of the Lord, as our goal by living to the law. We even ask the Lord to help us to attain to goodness and to live in the law.<h2 class=head1>MAN BEING CREATED TO CONTAIN GOD</h2><p>In the beginning when God created man, He did not designate goodness as man&#8217;s goal. Rather, He made Himself the goal of man. We may use a glass as an illustration. A glass is for containing water; thus, the goal of the glass is water. If we put other things in the glass, the glass loses its meaning. Likewise, man was created to contain God; therefore, God is the goal of man. Why is this? It is because God wants man to be mingled with Him, and He also wants to be one with man. We really need the light of the truth to see that man was created not for goodness but for God.<p>In the garden of Eden after Adam was created, God placed him in front of the tree of life, which denotes God Himself. At that time Adam knew neither good nor evil; to him God was everything. Adam was before God, but God had not yet entered into him. At that time Adam did not have the thought of sin, nor did he have the thought of good. It was not until the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil had entered into Adam that the elements of good and evil entered into man. Thereafter, man began to know love and hate, because good and evil are the two sides of one thing; the two are actually one. We must remember that good and evil are one. They both entered into man at the same time after man had failed, sinned, and fallen. Since then, man has had both good and evil within him.<h2 class=head1>TWO GOALS AND TWO KINDS OF DEALINGS</h2><h2 class=head2>Being Dead in Relation to Law and Living in Relation to God</h2><p>Galatians 2:19 says, &#8220;Died to law...live to God.&#8221; This verse is very important and has a special place in the truth. Why is this verse so important? It is important because here it says, &#8220;Died to law...live to God.&#8221; There are two goals here: one is the law, and the other is God. Moreover, there are two kinds of dealings: one is to be dead, and the other is to live, that is, to deal with the law by being dead and to deal with God by living. We cannot have dealings with the law and God at the same time, and neither can we deal with them in the same way, because they are absolutely different.<p>Galatians 2:19 says, &#8220;For I through law have died to law that I might live to God.&#8221; What does I through law have died to law mean? As through law is not too easy to understand, we can first look at died to law...live to God. On the one hand there is the law, while on the other hand there is God. To the law, I have died; to God, I live. This means that we deal with the law by being dead, and we deal with God by living. Whenever we live to God, not only do we live, but God also lives in us. Whenever we are dead to the law, not only are we dead, but the law is also dead. The two die together. When we live to God, both we and God live. We and God, God and we, live together. This is really wonderful and is truly a mystery.<h2 class=head2>Living to God Only by Being Dead to Law</h2><p>On the other hand, for God to live in us, the law has to die: &#8220;I through law have died to law that I might live to God.&#8221; Through is needed here; only by being dead through law can we live to God. We all know that the God in whom we believe is the living God, but is this living God living in us? If we want God to live in us, the law has to die. Only when the law is absent can God live in us. If there is a place for the law, then there is no place for God. Living to God is the result, whereas being dead to law is the cause.<h2 class=head2>The Law Being Dead Ordinances</h2><p>What is the law? Ordinances, letters, resolutions, determinations-all these are included in the law. For instance, suppose I consider myself to be a Christian, yet I do not have the desire to know God. There are, however, obligations and responsibilities to being a Christian. Since this is the case and since in the church we are encouraged to visit the saints, I decide that every Wednesday or Saturday I will go out for visitations and that I will visit at least two persons every week. As another example, a sister may feel that she has a bad temper, so she makes up her mind to endeavor to change herself. She is determined that from now on she will learn to be as gentle as a lamb in dealing with others. Such a determination, such a decision, and even such a desire to love the Lord and the brothers and sisters are also part of the law. The law not only includes the Ten Commandments and other commandments found in the Scriptures; it also includes all our hopes, decisions, resolutions, expectations, aspirations, longings, and desires, including the desire to have a certain kind of living.<p>We all acknowledge the fact that whether we are unbelievers or Christians, as long as we are human beings, we cannot avoid facing the law in our human living. We will surely encounter the law. The law requires us to do good, to cultivate our conduct, to improve ourselves, and to pursue good. In our youth we acquire the law from our parents. We have to be quiet when visitors come-this is a law. We have to be polite in front of others-this is also a law. Then later we also make our own laws. We think it is wrong to cause our mother who loves us so much to be so angry and cry, so we determine not to make her angry again. This is also a law. Then when we grow older, we have the laws of the older people. For example, I was doing very well when I was praying a short while ago, but then a few minutes later, when my grandson talked back to me, I became angry. After thinking about it, I regretted it, so I made up my mind that I would never lose my temper again but rather would be patient and forgiving. What is this thought? It is still a law. Therefore, laws are innumerable; they are present everywhere. We make laws not only for ourselves but for others as well. For human beings, this is both proper and commendable; however, for Christians, this is a problem.<h2 class=head2>God Being the Living Law</h2><p>God and the law are opposite to each other. Although the law includes ordinances, regulations, resolutions, expectations, and longings, the Scriptures teach us to be dead to law and living to God. This is because the law consists of dead ordinances, while God is the living law. The law and God are always present in our daily living. Just as we cannot escape from the law, so we also cannot escape from God. Therefore, we often put these two opposing things, the law and God, together. For instance, we may decide to be humble and gentle; this is the law. Yet we also discover that there is no way for us to be gentle and that it is also difficult for us to be humble, so we pray, asking for God&#8217;s help. Usually we make a law first, and then we ask God to help us fulfill the law. Actually, God does not want this. Rather, God wants us to be dead to law. God wants both us and the law to die.<h2 class=head1>THE GARDEN OF EDEN HAVING TWO TREES</h2><p>This situation is the same as the situation in the garden of Eden. Adam was standing in front of the two trees-the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God told Adam not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for in the day that he ate of it he would surely die (Gen. 2:17). What does the tree of the knowledge of good and evil denote? There was good and there was also evil. What is this? It is the law. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil is in front of us every day. The law in front of us is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; God in front of us is the tree of life. Do not think that only Adam faced these two trees. We are in fact facing them daily. Unfortunately, we mistakenly think that we must reject that which is evil but must try to fulfill that which is good. This has resulted in man&#8217;s failure to reject the tree of the knowledge of good and evil throughout the ages.<h2 class=head1>BEING DEAD TO LAW</h2><p>We consider ourselves to be capable of rejecting that which is evil and fulfilling that which is good. However, according to God&#8217;s command, we should touch neither good nor evil. Whenever we touch good and evil, we touch death. To be dead to law is to be dead to good and evil. We can understand what it means to be dead to evil, and it is also easy to do; however, to be dead to good is not easy. For example, when the thought of hatred comes, we deal with it by being dead. Of course, this is right. However, when love comes, should we also deal with it by being dead? We may have doubts. Therefore, please remember that God wants us to be dead in dealing with evil and with good as well. Whenever we draw nigh to God and touch God, unconsciously we have the thought of doing good. This comes between God and us. Being dead to the law means that we reject any good thought that enters into us, just as we reject any evil thought.<p>Because the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is beautiful and pleasant to the sight, when any good thought comes, we are always attracted to it. However, we have to be careful and afraid of that which is good, such as humility and meekness. As long as it is from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, we have to be afraid of it. We only want the Lord Himself. Although humility and meekness are good, they are not the Lord; therefore, we do not want them. This is to be dead to law. We have to realize further that just as pride causes us to be severed from the Lord and to become independent of Him, so humility also can cause us to be severed from the Lord and to become independent of Him.<h2 class=head1>LIVING TO GOD</h2><p>To live to God is to be filled with God and to have fellowship with God by putting aside all the ordinances of our human life as well as all our hopes, resolutions, and longings, so that God can have the ground in us to reign and operate in us, thereby living in us. If we live to the law, we are dead to God. If we maintain a relationship with the law, our relationship with God is severed. If we fellowship with God day by day and allow Him to live in us moment by moment, then we are dead to law, our relationship with the law is severed, and we are living to God. Living to God is not ordinances, hopes, letters, or methods, but it is the living God being our life within us. We need to contact Him every day and enjoy Him every moment so that He can be our life and power within to live with us and to lead us in walking the path before us. This is to be dead to law and living to God.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST BEING EVERYTHING</h1><h2 class=head1>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SALVATION AND RELIGION</h2><p>In Philippians 3:6-7 the apostle Paul says, &#8220;As to zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness which is in the law, become blameless. But what things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ.&#8221; The things that were gains to Paul in verse 7 included his zeal mentioned in the previous verse. Formerly Paul had considered his zeal for religion and his being blameless according to the righteousness that is in the law as gains to him, but now on account of Christ he counted them as loss. Verse 8 goes further to say, &#8220;But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ.&#8221;<p>Moreover, in Galatians 1:11-16 Paul said, &#8220;For I make known to you, brothers, concerning the gospel announced by me, that it is not according to man. For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation by Jesus Christ. For you have heard of my manner of life formerly in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it. And I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more abundantly a zealot for the traditions of my fathers. But when it pleased God, who set me apart from my mother&#8217;s womb and called me through His grace, to reveal His Son in me....&#8221; The revelation referred to at the end of this passage should be put together with the revelation mentioned in verse 12. In verse 12 we see that the gospel preached by Paul came through a revelation by Jesus Christ; in verse 16 Paul said that it pleased God to reveal His Son in him.<p>Mark 1:32-38 says, &#8220;And when evening fell and the sun had set, they brought to Him all those who were ill and those who were demon possessed. And the whole city was gathered together at the door. And He healed many who were ill with various diseases, and He cast out many demons and did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him. And rising very early in the morning, while it was still night, He went out and went away to a deserted place, and there He prayed. And Simon and those with him hunted for Him, and they found Him and said to Him, All are seeking You. And He said to them, Let us go elsewhere.&#8221;<p>John 2:23-24 says, &#8220;Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed into His name when they saw the signs which He did. But Jesus Himself did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew all men.&#8221; Verses 25-27 of chapter six say, &#8220;And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, Rabbi, when did You get here? Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek Me not because you have seen signs, but because you ate of the bread and were filled. Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you.&#8221; Verses 33-35 say, &#8220;For the bread of God is He who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world. They said therefore to Him, Lord, give us this bread always. Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst.&#8221; Verse 60 says, &#8220;Many therefore of His disciples, when they heard this, said, This word is hard; who can hear it?&#8221; Verses 66-68 say, &#8220;From that time many of His disciples went back to what they left behind and no longer walked with Him. Jesus therefore said to the twelve, Do you also want to go away? Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE ORIGINS OF RELIGION</h2><h2 class=head2>Man Seeking for Material Blessings</h2><p>The Lord&#8217;s salvation is greatly different from any religion. Religion has been widely practiced mainly because of three reasons: firstly, man&#8217;s seeking for material blessings, next, man&#8217;s pursuit for improved behavior, and lastly, man&#8217;s search for inner satisfaction. From a shallow point of view, everyone hopes for material blessings because everyone seems to need them. At the same time, man does not have the power to handle many of the situations of human life, so naturally he tends to seek some other power or way. Under such circumstances, religion came into being. Man pursues religion, believing that there is a supreme being who is above all men and who exercises supernatural power to solve the problems in human life and to meet human needs. Do not think that religion is practiced only by village men and country women. In fact, innumerable people who are famous and successful have also accepted religion in hopes of obtaining the material blessings of human life.<h2 class=head2>Man Pursuing the Improvement of Behavior</h2><p>Not only so, as the noblest and highest being among all living creatures, man naturally pays much attention to the question of morality and therefore tends to pursue the improvement of behavior. Thousands of years of human history have proved that religion is the best place for the practice of moral culture. Throughout the generations those who have been occupied with the improvement of behavior have always attached themselves to a religion. People pursue and seek a noble religion to help them with the cultivation of their morality. In human society many upright people have accepted religion for the sake of self-improvement. This is why religion is popular among upper-class people.<h2 class=head2>Man Searching for Inner Satisfaction</h2><p>The third reason for the widespread acceptance of religion is that man has an inner need. Within man there is a spirit, and within the spirit there is a need. In the beginning God created man with a spirit for man to receive God. To illustrate, for man to drink water, he needs a stomach to contain water. Without a stomach, man would have no need for eating and drinking. According to the same principle, there is a need deep within man which can neither be touched nor seen. We all have this kind of experience. We may be rich in outward material things and may have sufficient psychological enjoyment, yet in the deepest part of our being we are still not satisfied, and we still have a need. That need is the need of our human spirit. Throughout the generations many people who were thoughtful, moral, and idealistic have repeatedly discovered this need deep within man. In seeking to satisfy this need, man continually seeks after religion. People seek religion not merely for outward blessings and not even for the cultivation of morality. Rather, their seeking religion is for the need deep within their being.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD'S SALVATION NOT BEING FOR MATERIAL BLESSINGS</h2><p>With a little effort, we can easily discover that in every religion there are people with these three types of needs. Generally speaking, in every religion there are crowds of people who are seeking to obtain material blessings. They worship and even fear a supreme being, and in their fear they turn from doing evil to doing good, lest they incur misfortunes or retributions for their evil deeds. Their religious piety is for the purpose of pleasing God in exchange for His blessings. Their religious pursuit is for nothing but happiness, longevity, peace, and prosperity. These people are relatively shallow in that they seek only the outward things.<p>Those who are a little deeper study their religion to a great extent. The purpose of their study is mostly for the cultivation of their morality. Those who make an effort to meet the need in the deepest part of their being are very few; rarely is there even one among a hundred.<p>This is religion. Regardless of whether the object of worship is true or false, and regardless of whether the way of worship is right or wrong, the above three points are the main reasons for religious belief. In light of this we can ask, &#8220;Do Christians receive a religion or do they receive the Lord&#8217;s salvation?&#8221; As Christians, do we have a relationship with religion, or do we have a relationship with the Lord Jesus?<p>Please remember that when the Lord was on the earth, He was not here to give people material blessings. Perhaps some will ask, &#8220;Does not the Bible tell us that the Lord healed the sick, cast out demons, and fed people? Are not these things for the welfare and peace of the people?&#8221; We can use three portions of Scriptures to prove that the Lord did not come to the earth to provide people with material blessings. The first portion is in Mark chapter one. There we see that one day, when the sun had set, all those who were ill were brought to the Lord (v. 32). Yet the Bible does not say that the Lord healed all of them; it only says that &#8220;He healed many who were ill&#8221; (v. 34). The next day, rising very early, the Lord Jesus went away to a deserted place, and there He prayed until the crowd came looking for Him. The disciples, out of their good heart, pitied the crowd and went to report to Him, &#8220;All are seeking You&#8221; (vv. 35-37). How did He react? He went away. The Lord did not heal the sick all the time, and if we think He did, we are wrong. Many times, because of our weakness, the Lord will sympathize a little with us, and He will heal us to demonstrate His power and to prove that He is God. However, if we keep considering Him as a healer and keep asking Him to care for our own welfare, then the Lord will not do it anymore but rather will depart.<p>It seems that the Lord should not have departed on that morning because that was a rare opportunity. All the crowds had come to seek Him; it was certainly a good opportunity. He should have come out to heal them of their diseases and to save them. Instead, He went away. Why? It is because He came to the earth not to heal people. Even if He had healed them, one day they would be sick again. The Lord did not come to the earth for this.<h2 class=head1>BELIEVING IN THE LORD FOR MATERIAL BLESSINGS NOT BEING TRUSTWORTHY</h2><p>The second portion of Scriptures is in John chapter two. Many believed into the name of the Lord because they saw the signs which He did (v. 23). Yet how did the Lord react? The Lord did not entrust Himself to them (v. 24). They believed in the Lord, but the Lord did not trust them. Why? It is because their faith was not a genuine faith but a faith for their own well-being, for their sicknesses to be healed. Hence, it was a faith which was not trustworthy. Therefore, the Lord did not entrust Himself to them. The situation is still the same today. Many have believed in the Lord because they were healed of their sickness. This believing, however, is not reliable. Believing in the Lord due to miracles, blessings, or benefits is not trustworthy. When trials come and those who have this kind of belief do not see any blessing or any answer to their prayer, they may no longer believe.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD DESIRING THAT MAN GAIN HIM INSTEAD OF RELIGION</h2><p>The third portion of Scriptures is in John chapter six. The Lord Jesus fed five thousand with five loaves and two fish. Thousands of people saw that miracle. The next day the crowd came to look for the Lord Jesus and found Him on the other side of the sea. Then the Lord said to them, &#8220;You seek Me...because you ate of the bread and were filled&#8221; (v. 26). The Lord told them not to seek the food which perishes but to seek the food which abides unto eternal life, which He could give them. When they heard this, they did not quite understand, but within they knew that there is a kind of food which is eternal and which lasts forever. Therefore, they asked the Lord to give them this food. Then the Lord immediately said to them, &#8220;I am the bread of life&#8221; (v. 35). This meant that this food was the Lord; it also meant that aside from the Lord there was nothing else to be given to them. The Lord is the bread of life. He who comes to the Lord shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into the Lord shall by no means ever thirst. If they truly wanted to be satisfied in their human life, they needed to gain the Lord. Material blessings could not satisfy them; only the Lord could satisfy them. The Lord came to the earth not to give people blessings; He did not come to feed people with bread or to heal people of their sicknesses. The Lord came to the earth to dispense Himself into people so that they may gain Him instead of religion.<h2 class=head1>SALVATION NOT BEING PROSPERITY BUT THE LORD HIMSELF</h2><p>The Lord came to the earth for man to gain Him; everything outside of Him is just religion. We should not consider prosperity as a small thing; to be prosperous is a very personal matter. Many have believed in the Lord for prosperity, but little do they know that prosperity is a matter of religion. The Lord&#8217;s salvation is not a matter of prosperity; rather, the Lord&#8217;s salvation is altogether apart from prosperity. In the first century, because of their faith in the Lord, countless Christians suffered the loss of their homes, their loved ones, and even their precious lives. Were they for their own prosperity? Of course not! The more faith they had in the Lord, the less prosperity they had in their human life. In the end they even sacrificed themselves and were martyred. Not prosperity, but martyrdom-this is the Lord&#8217;s salvation. Prosperity belongs to religion. The Lord&#8217;s salvation is the Lord Himself.<h2 class=head1>THE IMPROVEMENT OF BEHAVIOR NOT BEING SALVATION BUT RELIGION</h2><p>Now let us go on to the matter of the improvement of behavior. Many people believe in the Lord because they find it difficult to conduct themselves properly in a human society which is so dark and fallen. Not knowing what to do, they want to find a better environment and seek better protection so that they may enjoy peace and stability both physically and spiritually. From the viewpoint of society, Christianity is the best place to have such an environment. People who go to church are very proper. During the week they work hard on their jobs and study diligently in school, and then on the Lord&#8217;s Day they go and sit in the church to worship. This lifestyle is quite refined and quiet. The unbelievers think that they can benefit greatly by being with such a group of people, so they accept the Christian religion. Afterward, they go to listen to sermons regularly. They may not understand what they hear, but they feel quite good and seem to profit just by sitting there. Then one day when the pastor announces that the church is ready to receive new members, they feel that since they have been coming to worship services regularly, they ought to join the church as members. Therefore, they become church members. However, they are totally ignorant of where God is and who Christ is. So why do they believe in Jesus? It is simply because they want to be good persons. Each one of us more or less has this kind of concept, the concept of behavior improvement.<p>Even in our prayers we often say, &#8220;O Lord, my temper is so bad; I really have no way to deal with it. I cannot change it; I cannot improve myself. But, Lord, as the almighty One, You are omnipotent; nothing is impossible with You. Please help me.&#8221; It is so strange that the more we pray this way, the worse our temper is. This is because when we ask God to change our temper, we are not being Christians but religious people. Christ is different from religion. Whereas in religion there is behavior improvement, in Christ there is no such thing. In Christ there is only Christ, and there is only salvation.<p>Paradoxically, when we preach the gospel, we often begin with personal prosperity, saying, &#8220;Oh, it is so good to believe in Jesus! If you believe in Jesus, you will have peace and joy.&#8221; This is the first step. What is the second step? Very naturally it is the improvement of behavior. We may tell those who have believed in Jesus, &#8220;Since you have believed in Jesus, you have to be proper in your conduct and walk. After believing in Jesus, your temper has to be changed, and you have to start a new life.&#8221; When we preach the gospel to others, we often cannot avoid the concept of being prosperous and the idea of improving our conduct, as if it is hard to preach the gospel unless we attract people with these two things. The gospel seems to have become a bitter medicine, requiring it to be sugar-coated not only with prosperity but also with behavior improvement. Therefore, up to the present time many Christians still have not escaped from the concept of self-improvement.<h2 class=head1>NOTHING BEING ABLE TO SATISFY US BESIDES CHRIST HIMSELF</h2><p>In addition to the concept of obtaining material blessings and the thought of improving our behavior, the third reason that religion came into existence is man&#8217;s need for inner satisfaction. A person who seeks for inner satisfaction is a person with more depth; this kind of person seems to be more noble. However, besides Christ Himself there is nothing which can satisfy our inner being. These three things-seeking for material blessings, pursuing the improvement of behavior, and searching for inner satisfaction-are the three main reasons why man produced and practices religion. Even up to now we still may not have freed ourselves from these three things. This is a very pitiful and serious matter.<h2 class=head1>PAUL BEING AN EXAMPLE</h2><p>The life of Paul prior to his salvation may be considered the best illustration of this. Paul was one hundred percent a religionist. As a religionist, he did not pay much attention to being prosperous; rather, he was a person with ideas, wisdom, a future, and accomplishments. He paid attention not to prosperity but to two other matters. One matter was behavior improvement. He exerted great effort in this matter; hence, he dared to boast that he was blameless according to the law of the Old Testament (Phil. 3:6) and that he was more zealous for the God of the Jews and for their traditions than anyone else (Gal. 1:14). No one could find fault in him. By this we can see the extent of his behavior improvement. However, as such a one, Paul was an opposer of Christ and a person who persecuted and devastated the church of God.<p>One day on the road to Damascus Christ met him and said to him, &#8220;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads&#8221; (Acts 26:14). As a person chosen by the Lord, Paul should have taken the way of the Lord; instead, he took the way of religion. He was a religionist in the Jewish religion, and he was opposing the Lord. He thought that he was serving God; little did he know that he was actually offending God. Paul was not a person who did not believe in God and who did not fear God. On the contrary, he believed in God with all his heart and kept the law of God. He was actually very zealous for God. However, such a man who was so zealous for religion was one who opposed Christ. Besides being a person pursuing improved conduct, Paul was also a person who sought for the satisfaction of his inner being, yet ultimately he was a person who offended and opposed Christ.<h2 class=head1>RELIGION OFFENDING CHRIST AND OPPOSING CHRIST</h2><p>A person might be zealous for religion, fear God and pursue God, keep the law of God as Saul did, and be very zealous for God, yet he may be the person who offends Christ the most. Never think that to fear God, to seek after God, and to be zealous for God is to be a Christian. Although as Christians we fear God and are zealous for God, our living might not be the living of a Christian because we might actually be merely a religionist. We may have proper conduct, we may be zealous, and we may do our best to keep the teaching and commandments in the Scriptures, but can we be more zealous than Saul was in those days? Can we be more earnest in keeping the words of the Scriptures than Saul was in his time? Even if we were able to do it, we still would not be a Christian. Instead, we would be those who offend Christ.<p>Often when atheists oppose Christ, their opposition is obvious and easily seen. But very often those who are apparently zealous Christians are actually enemies of Christ in the eyes of God; they are opposing Christ every day. We have to see that anything that is not Christ is against Christ. Whether zeal, good deeds, or the righteousness of the law, as long as it is not Christ, it is against Christ. Please remember that everything outside of Christ, everything that is not Christ Himself, is against Christ.<h2 class=head1>ALL THINGS OUTSIDE OF CHRIST BEING RELIGION</h2><p>What then is religion? In brief, anything that is outside of Christ yet appears to be rendering worship to God is religion. Anything that is not Christ yet teaches people the teachings of God is religion. In the universe, only Christ Himself is not religion; only Christ Himself is the salvation of God. What is religion? Religion is any kind of worship and any kind of work outside of Christ. If our worship to God is not related to Christ, is not mingled with Christ, and is not Christ doing it with us from within, then it is religion.<h2 class=head1>REAL SALVATION AND WORSHIP BEING CHRIST MINGLED WITH MAN</h2><p>Then, what is the salvation of Christ? And what is real worship to God? The salvation of Christ is Christ mingled with us. The real worship to God is the Christ who is in us, who puts us upon Himself, and who fills us with Himself, worshipping God with us. In this worship we are mingled with Christ. In this worship Christ is there. This worship not only comes from Christ but also contains Christ. Christ is in this worship. He is mingled with us, He fills us with Himself, and He puts us upon Himself. To illustrate, we may say that a cup of tea is water, and we may also say that it is tea. Since tea has been blended into the water, the water is no longer pure water but tea-water. The true Christian living is also like this. A Christian still conducts himself as a man, but he has Christ mingled with him. Although a cup of tea is water, the element of tea has been added into the water; hence, if someone drinks this cup of water again, the taste will be different because the element of tea has been added into the water.<h2 class=head1>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SALVATION AND RELIGION</h2><p>Please remember that a Christian is a person who has Christ mingled with him. Christ has entered into this person to be his center, his goal, his content, and his everything. Christ is within him living out a mingled living, a mingled human life. Christ is in his worship, his conduct, his humility, and his love toward others. This is to be a Christian. Sometimes we may meet someone who is so proper and upright and who is a genuinely good person, but in him we cannot sense Christ or taste God. Other times we may meet someone, and as soon as we contact him, we touch Christ. That person is not only good and proper; he is more than good and proper. Within him there is an element which is not found in others and which is hard to describe. This is the salvation of Christ. Christ being mingled with man is the salvation of Christ. Worship without Christ and improved behavior without Christ are religion. Worship with Christ mingled within and improved behavior with Christ mingled within are the salvation of Christ. If we can discern this matter, we are blessed.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>EXPERIENCING THE REALITY OF THE TRUTH</h1><h2 class=head1>SPIRITUAL REALITY BEING THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN US</h2><p>The understanding of a spiritual matter is not equivalent to the experience of that spiritual matter itself. We may have listened to very good messages and may have a thorough understanding of the truth, but what we have gained is merely the understanding of spiritual matters and the knowledge of spiritual truth, not the spiritual reality itself. Spiritual reality is the work of the Holy Spirit in us. Therefore, spiritual work is not done by us. Only the Holy Spirit can do it. In other words, none of us can make another person spiritual; only the Holy Spirit can. For example, suppose we are paying attention to our naturalness in the old creation. Previously, due to our ignorance, we were not aware of the existence of our naturalness, but now we have heard and now we know about it. However, in the spiritual realm knowing does not equal seeing. At most, our hearing of the truth can lead us to understand the truth; it cannot lead us to touch the spiritual reality of the truth itself. Not until the Holy Spirit works in us and gives us the sense can we really see and touch what it means to be natural and truly sense that being natural is condemned. At such a moment we not only have a mental understanding of the truth, but we also are touched within by the Holy Spirit. The result is that we have the spiritual reality.<p>When we first heard the gospel, we may have heard a very clear message on the truth of the gospel and truly appreciated it. However, we can be clear about the truth yet still not be saved. What does it mean to be saved? We are saved when we touch God after receiving the revelation of the Holy Spirit in our spirit through the message we heard. Only when the Holy Spirit comes to us can we have faith; such faith is the issue of the work of the Holy Spirit in our spirit. It is at such a moment that we can be considered saved. Spiritual reality does not come from our own work or endeavor. It is altogether the work of the Holy Spirit.<p>For example, perhaps someone preaches the gospel to us, telling us that the Lord Jesus died for us on the cross and shed His precious blood for the washing away of our sins. Although this truth of redemption may genuinely win our appreciation, it does not necessarily generate faith in us. A few days later, however, after the Holy Spirit has worked in us, causing us to feel that the Lord Jesus really did die for us, we may pray, &#8220;Lord Jesus, thank You that as my Savior You bore my sins and died for me on the cross.&#8221; At this moment salvation becomes our experience. The vicarious death on the cross is now no longer merely a truth but a spiritual reality to us. The doctrine itself cannot accomplish this work; this is altogether the work of the Holy Spirit, working by and through the doctrine we heard.<p>This is true not only in our experience of being saved but also in all our spiritual experiences after we have been saved. For instance, suppose someone has a heart to pursue the Lord after he has been saved, yet he discovers that he is always eager to express his opinions. Thus, he is determined to stop this habit. Another person may feel that he is very individualistic and has very little fellowship with the other saints, so he is determined to have more contact with others. However, this is just a doctrine to him. He has heard and understood the doctrine, but he has not yet touched the fellowship of the Body. We may understand that as Christians we should not loosely express our opinions or be individualistic, yet we may not have touched the real meaning of not having opinions or being individualistic. If we merely understand a doctrine but lack the spiritual reality, we will employ our own effort. What is human effort? Human effort denotes behavior. This means that having been convinced by a message that we have heard, we work out a certain kind of behavior accordingly. This kind of behavior, however, is not spiritual reality. If one day, perhaps a month or even a year after hearing a message, we are touched and enlightened within concerning our natural life and our natural disposition through the work of the Holy Spirit within us, then this is spiritual reality. From that moment onward we do not need to depend on our own work.<p>In a training meeting in 1940 Brother Nee spoke strongly on the experience of Jacob. He said that Jacob wrestled not only with men but also with God, and even God could not prevail against him (Gen. 32:28). On that day at the ford of the Jabbok, God had to touch the socket of his hip. From that time onward he limped. With much burden Brother Nee related the story of Jacob&#8217;s being crippled, saying that our natural life must be touched by God and must become limping. Then a brother testified, &#8220;My hip has been crippled also; my natural life has been crippled; this natural life of mine has been touched by the Lord.&#8221; In response Brother Nee said, &#8220;A person who has really been crippled does not need to remember that he is crippled. Moreover, he does not need to tell others that he is crippled, because as soon as he walks, people will notice that he is crippled. A person who acts crippled has to always remember that he is crippled, because once he forgets, his real condition is exposed. As a result, he has to repeatedly adjust himself, endeavoring to make himself crippled.&#8221; This may sound like a joke, but this is our situation.<h2 class=head1>OUR FAITH BEING A MATTER NOT OF BEHAVIOR BUT OF LIFE</h2><p>Our faith is true, is spiritual, is of revelation, and is of life. Our faith is not a method for our behavior. However, many mistakenly think that the Scriptures teach us doctrines, which naturally produce behavior. What are doctrines? Doctrines involve teaching and obeying. This teaching and obeying issue in behavior. Actually our faith is real; it is not behavior but life. Doctrines can bring forth only behavior, but the Holy Spirit brings forth life in us.<p>For instance, suppose there is a person who is saved and has God&#8217;s life. No one tells him not to drink wine and not to play mah-jongg, but amazingly, when he goes to drink and to play mah-jongg again, there is a restriction within prohibiting him from doing so. Therefore, he stops drinking and playing mah-jongg. His outward behavior is not due to his own decision or some teaching; rather, it is because he is forbidden by the sense of life within him.<h2 class=head1>THE HOLY SPIRIT, NOT WE, BEING ABLE TO DO THE SPIRITUAL THINGS</h2><p>Because the emphasis of training is on teaching people and on opening their understanding, the danger of training is that it tends to teach people to practice the truth that they have heard by using their own strength. Although training encourages people to endeavor, to be serious, and to make an effort to know the truth, its purpose is merely to prepare people that they may become experienced in cooperating with the Spirit within them. However, even when a person has become experienced after a great deal of practice, this does not mean that he is spiritual, because spiritual things cannot be achieved by training. None of us can do the spiritual work; the spiritual work is carried out solely by the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit moves a little in us, then we have a little measure of spiritual reality in us. If the Holy Spirit does not move in us, then no matter how much truth we understand, we still do not have any spiritual reality in us. This does not mean, however, that training is useless. The greatest use of training is in preparing us to cooperate with the Holy Spirit. If we are prepared, then whenever the Holy Spirit moves in us, we will be able to follow and cooperate with Him.<p>Therefore, none of us can do spiritual things; only the Holy Spirit can. On the one hand, if we have a proper attitude and the right intention, then after we have been trained and have become clear concerning spiritual doctrines, it will be easier for us to touch our spirit and for the Holy Spirit to work in us. On the other hand, if we think that because we have received some training, understood the doctrines, and learned the methods, we have a complete grasp of all the spiritual things and are therefore spiritual, then the training we have received will become the greatest hindrance to our being spiritual. Training cannot give us the spiritual reality; training can only prepare us to cooperate with the Holy Spirit. It is not until the Holy Spirit works in us that we begin to have the spiritual reality. Spiritual reality is not doctrine and not even objective truth; spiritual reality is the particular work done by the Holy Spirit within us.<h2 class=head1>OUR MENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF DOCTRINES BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>Do not think that understanding spiritual matters is equal to obtaining the spiritual reality. As an example, consider the matter of being saved. Suppose that after hearing the gospel, a person confesses that Jesus died for him and also believes that Jesus is his Savior. Moreover, he acknowledges that he is sinful and prays. Like him, another person confesses that he is sinful and also seems to believe in Jesus. However, in the end one is saved while the other is not. How can it be that two people can have the same thoughts and could say the same things, yet one is saved while the other is not? Although they both heard the same truth, they ended up differently before God. The crux of the matter depends on whether or not the Holy Spirit works in them after they hear the word. If the Holy Spirit works in them, then they will be saved because they will have the reality of the word they heard. If there is no work of the Holy Spirit, then they will not be saved because there will not be the reality and effect of the word within them. This is altogether the work of the Holy Spirit.<p>This is true not only in the matter of salvation but in all spiritual experiences and truths as well. Doctrines require memory to remember and human strength to carry out; spiritual reality, being of life, does not require memory to remember nor human endeavor to carry out. When the socket of our hip is touched by God and we become crippled, thereafter, without remembering that we are crippled and without endeavoring to act crippled, we are crippled. This is a matter of life. Whenever we walk, we will limp. This is different from understanding the doctrine of being touched on the socket of the hip and receiving the knowledge of being crippled. If we only understand the doctrine and receive the knowledge but have not experienced its reality, we have no alternative but to depend on memory and performance. Doctrines cannot afford us the spiritual reality; only through the work of the Holy Spirit can we have the spiritual reality.<h2 class=head1>SATAN HINDERING OUR PROGRESS BY DECEIVING US</h2><p>Therefore, we are very often easily deceived in the matter of spiritual experience. After we hear a certain truth and before we have the spiritual reality, we may think that we already have it. On the other hand, sometimes we already have the spiritual reality, but being deceived by the enemy, we think that we do not have the reality. For example, many of us have doubted whether we are saved. If a person has clearly been saved yet is doubtful about his salvation, that is a deception that comes from the enemy. This kind of deception causes us to doubt that we have the spiritual reality after we already have it. This is precisely the reason that God&#8217;s work is not able to advance in us. The problem is that either we do not have the reality yet think we have it, or we already have it yet doubt that we have it. Both are due to the deception of Satan, the evil one, whose aim is to keep us in our original situation. He does not want us to progress in our spiritual pursuit, so he uses all kinds of ways to hinder us.<h2 class=head1>THE CONTRADICTION RELATED TO SPIRITUAL REALITY</h2><p>In our spiritual pursuit we must first know that spiritual reality is neither doctrine nor knowledge but the work of the Holy Spirit in us. Next, we should not consider that we have already obtained the spiritual reality, neither should we consider that we are lacking it. We are deceived if we lightly consider that we already have obtained it; similarly, we are deceived if we casually think that we are lacking it. Generally speaking, those who easily believe that they have already obtained spiritual reality are people who are too careless, while those who easily believe that they have not obtained spiritual reality are people who are overly serious. This seems like a contradiction; either way that we think, we seem to be deceived. But this is God&#8217;s way regarding spiritual reality. For example, the treasure is put in earthen vessels (2 Cor. 4:7), the fire burns in the thornbush (Exo. 3:2), the new creation is contained in the old creation, and God&#8217;s life is mingled with man&#8217;s life. These are all seemingly contradictory situations.<p>Today within some of us the new creation is flourishing and the old creation is languishing, while within others the old creation is flourishing and the new creation is languishing. We ourselves are responsible for this. While it is impossible for us to be completely freed from the old creation before our rapture, we are still responsible for whether the new creation is flourishing in us or the old creation is occupying the first place in us. If Paul were alive today, on the one hand he would surely say, &#8220;To me, to live is Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:21a), but on the other hand he would also say, &#8220;We have this treasure in earthen vessels&#8221; (2 Cor. 4:7a). Although Paul still had the earthen vessel, the flesh, the old creation, he could testify that by the grace of God he did not allow the earthen vessel to prevail against the treasure within nor did he allow the old creation to take the first place. Rather, by the grace of God Paul allowed the new creation to subdue the old creation and allowed Christ as the treasure to take the first place in him.<h2 class=head1>OUR RESPONSIBILITY</h2><p>In our daily living we are always facing this question: Do we allow the new creation to prevail against the old creation, or do we allow the old creation to overcome the new creation? Do we allow God to have the upper hand in us, or do we still allow our self to have the upper hand? No one can answer this question for us. Today whether the new creation prevails over the old creation or the old creation prevails over the new creation is our own responsibility. Although it seems to be a contradiction that we are deceived whether we think that we have the spiritual reality or we think that we do not have it, we still can be responsible for allowing the new creation to prevail against our old creation. Whenever God demands something within us, we have to learn to say to God, &#8220;O God, You win; may You prevail in me.&#8221;<p>We must realize that the new creation is contained in the old creation, the treasure is placed in the earthen vessel, God is mingled with man, and God&#8217;s life is mingled with man&#8217;s life. After we have this clear knowledge, whenever there is a conflict between the new creation and the old creation, we can then choose the new creation. Whenever we feel that there is a struggle between God and us, we will be able to pray, &#8220;O God, have mercy on me! By Your grace may You be victorious and may I be defeated.&#8221; This is the responsibility we must bear. We have to learn this lesson daily and constantly. How spiritual we are is not our responsibility. In our experiences in daily life, instead of depending on excitement or our mood, we should simply allow that which is &#8220;new&#8221; to win while denying that which is &#8220;old.&#8221; This is the work that the Lord desires, and this is what the Lord wants to gain. All those who love God and pursue God must pay attention to this way by preparing themselves to cooperate with the leading of the Holy Spirit. Moreover, by the grace of God they must stand on His side. May the Lord be merciful to us. This is the experience of the spiritual reality.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>ONLY GOD BEING ABLE TO SATISFY MAN'S INNER BEING</h1><h2 class=head1>CHRIST BEING ALL</h2><p>Colossians 2:9-10 says, &#8220;For in Him [Christ] dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and you have been made full in Him, who is the Head of all rule and authority.&#8221; In these verses fullness and full are mentioned. First it says that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily; then it says that we who belong to Christ have been made full in Christ. Verse 11 of chapter three says, &#8220;Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&#8221; Furthermore, Ephesians 1:22b-23 says, &#8220;The church, which is His [Christ&#8217;s] Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&#8221; Verse 17a of chapter three says, &#8220;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&#8221; Verse 19b continues, &#8220;That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&#8221; We, the saved ones, are being filled unto the fullness of God because we have Christ dwelling in us.<h2 class=head1>MATERIAL THINGS BEING UNABLE TO SATISFY MAN'S INNER NEED</h2><p>Generally speaking, religion focuses on three items: material blessings, behavior improvement, and man&#8217;s inner satisfaction. However, according to the revelation of the Word, the salvation that the Lord has given us is altogether different from these three items. Consider the matter of the satisfaction of man&#8217;s inner being. Many people are very prosperous in their enterprises and have no lack of material things, yet they still feel as if there is a lack. Obviously they still have a need in their inner being. It is difficult for human language to describe this lack or need, yet affluent people over the whole earth and throughout history have felt this need. Although sometimes they try to convince themselves intellectually that they ought to be contented, they simply are not satisfied deep within. Therefore, they gradually realize that in their inner being is an emptiness that cannot be filled by material things; material things cannot meet the need in their deepest part.<h2 class=head1>MAN BEING CREATED AS A VESSEL TO CONTAIN GOD</h2><p>Therefore, among the human race, particularly among high-class people, religion has quite a firm foundation. This is because religion seemingly offers a solution to man&#8217;s need, a need that cannot be replaced or solved by material things. On the surface religion seems to solve this problem, but in actuality religion can only promise or attempt to solve the problem of man&#8217;s need because it has no way to satisfy this need practically. The Word of God shows us that this matter is simple, clear, and easy to understand. The book of Romans tells us that man is a vessel created by God for Himself (9:21-23). We may use a cup as an illustration. A cup is a vessel designed by a potter and then produced through burning. A cup exists for a purpose and a function-to contain water. Suppose instead of being filled with water, the cup is just placed somewhere and left there. If the cup could speak, it would tell people that it has a void within, that it is not satisfied. Even if we were to inlay it with gold or gild it with silver and elevate it to a place of honor, it would still say, &#8220;This cannot fill my emptiness. The reason for my existence is that I have a function, and this function is to contain water. Do not inlay me with gold nor gild me with silver. Moreover, there is no need to elevate me. Just fill me with water, and I will be satisfied.&#8221; It is the same way with a lightbulb. A lightbulb is created with a purpose, with an intention; it is specifically made for electricity to pass through it so that it may give light. If we do not let electricity enter into the lightbulb, it will be useless and its existence will be meaningless.<p>The Bible tells us that the way God created man was different from the way He created all the other things in the universe. God created man in His image and according to His likeness (Gen. 1:26) because God wanted man to be a vessel to contain Him. He wants to put Himself into man that man may express Him. God created man in His image and according to His likeness so that man may become a vessel to contain Him, just as a Coca-Cola bottle is specifically made to contain Coca-Cola. When we see an empty bottle with the words Coca-Cola printed on it, we know what that bottle was created for. According to the Scriptures we human beings were created to contain God. God wants to put Himself into us, so He created us in His image and according to His likeness. Furthermore, when the Coca-Cola bottle was being made, an empty space was left inside so that Coca-Cola could be put into it. The bottle was not made as a solid chunk of glass; otherwise, it would not be able to contain any Coca-Cola. In the same way, when God created man, He left an empty space within man for the purpose of filling it with Himself.<p>Today as &#8220;bottles,&#8221; are we empty? Or are we filled with different things? The reason why people throughout the ages have discovered that they feel empty within is because they are in fact empty. In the beginning when God created man, He did not fill him up; instead, He left an empty space within man. Some philosophers and sages have said that man is the most intelligent among all creatures. Believing that man as a complete entity is the most intelligent of all creatures, they think that if we just develop man&#8217;s intelligence and cultivate his conduct, then man will be able to live in abundance and sufficiency. In reality, however, there is no such thing. No matter how much man&#8217;s intelligence is developed and no matter how rich and sufficient is man&#8217;s living, man still will be empty and void within. This void cannot be filled by excitement nor by material things. This empty space is reserved for God. We all have such an empty space in us. We all have an empty room in our heart. Just as the Coca-Cola bottle is empty within so that it can be filled with Coca-Cola, we human beings are all empty bottles to be filled with the heavenly &#8220;Coca-Cola&#8221; to quench the thirst within us and to satisfy us. This heavenly &#8220;Coca-Cola&#8221; is God. As the Spirit and the living water of life, God wants to come into us to fill the vacuum within us.<h2 class=head1>RELIGIOUS CULTIVATION BEING UNABLE TO SATISFY MAN'S INNER EMPTINESS</h2><p>Since man cannot find a solution to the emptiness in his innermost being in the material world, he goes to the religious world to seek for the answer. The religious world&#8217;s best attempt to solve the problem of satisfying man&#8217;s inner emptiness is teaching. Religion teaches people to turn inward instead of outward; it teaches people to turn to their innermost being and to pay attention to the cultivation of their inner being. Previously a person may have been focused on outward cultivation, on the improvement of his outward behavior; now he must pay attention to the cultivation of his inner being. Religion teaches people to sit still in meditation in order to turn their whole being from the outside to the inside. Previously a person might have always turned outward, but now he must turn within by sitting in meditation; he must exercise his will and his peaceful state of mind to focus his entire being within. This kind of teaching tells people that the more they go outward, the emptier they will be and the greater will be the void within. Therefore, now they must turn their direction from the outward to the inward. They should not be busy laboring for money, commerce, family, wife, children, etc. All these things, which may afford some outward enjoyment, cause people to turn outward and therefore experience a greater emptiness within. The richer a person becomes, the emptier he will feel within; the higher his position is, the less satisfied he will be within. The outward things can easily draw man to the outside; hence, according to religion, the only way to bring him back is to practice self-cultivation. When a part of his being goes outward, a part of his being will be empty; when a part of his being is drawn back, a part of his being will be filled. This is the teaching of religion. However, the part &#8220;pulled away&#8221; is human, and the part &#8220;drawn back&#8221; is still human. Regardless of whether a person is drawn outward or inward, he is still human, and as such he is basically still an empty vessel.<h2 class=head1>GOD DESIRING TO BE MINGLED WITH MEN TO PRODUCE GOD-MEN</h2><p>In the beginning when God created man, He reserved an empty space for Himself that He might work Himself into man; hence, man was created empty. A person may try to improve himself either outwardly or inwardly, but ultimately he is still an empty vessel. God&#8217;s intention is not just for man to be satisfied in himself. God&#8217;s main intention in coming into man is not for man to be satisfied but for man to be mingled with God. God comes into us and mingles Himself with us, making us a part of God; the result is that the creating God is mingled with the created man. Thus, we, the created beings, are mingled with the Creator who is within us. The Scriptures reveal that all of us, the saved ones, will arrive at a certain stage; that is, we will be filled unto the fullness of God. In other words, all that God is will become everything to us, the saved ones. This means that He will work Himself into us and will be completely mingled with us. This mingling will go on until one day not only we will be in Him and He in us, but He and we will be inseparable. We may use a glass of orange juice as an illustration. Suppose we mix the juice of an orange and water together to produce a glass of orange juice. When we pour out the drink, there is juice and also water. The juice and the water, the water and the juice, are mingled into one; the two are inseparable. In the same way, God&#8217;s intention in man is to mingle Himself with man and to fill man with Himself, thereby producing a God-man, one who is not only man but also God, not only God but also man. When the juice and water are blended together, eventually we may say it is juice or we may say it is water because the two have been blended as one into orange juice. Likewise, God wants to mingle with all the saved ones so that eventually they will all become the God-men.<h2 class=head1>TO BELIEVE BEING TO RECEIVE</h2><p>Most people understand believing in Jesus as a matter of simply having our sins forgiven and being able to go to heaven. However, according to the Scriptures the meaning of believing in Jesus is much higher than this. John 1:12 says, &#8220;But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name.&#8221; This verse speaks about our receiving the Lord Jesus into us. For example, we believe that this glass of juice is orange juice; therefore, we drink it. Thus, we receive the juice into us; this is to believe. The same is true with our believing in the Lord Jesus. Not only do we confess with our mouth that we believe in Him, but we also receive Him into us from within our heart. To believe is to receive. To believe in this glass of orange juice is to receive the orange juice into us; to believe in Christ is to receive Christ into us.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST BEING ALL</h2><p>Once we believe in Christ, that is, once we receive Christ, Christ comes into us. What then is the element of this Christ who comes into us? Colossians 2:9 says, &#8220;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&#8221; The element of this Christ is nothing less than God Himself, because all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. The element of Christ is the element of God. God Himself as the element of the Godhead is in Christ. This is neither abstract nor theoretical but tangible, concrete, and real. All that God is and all that God has are in Christ. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. This is the element of Christ. Therefore, the Scriptures tell us that it is not a matter of being Greek, Jew, circumcision, uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free man; all these do not matter. Rather, the only thing that matters is that Christ is all and in all (3:11). Christ is all; He is God, and all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him. Now He is in us (Rom. 8:10; Col. 1:27).<p>God created man as a vessel with the intention of putting Himself into man. In order to carry out His intention, He first put Himself in Christ for man to believe in and receive. When someone receives Christ, then Christ with all His elements, which are God Himself, enters into him. Whenever someone receives Christ, Christ enters into him to be his all. Ephesians chapter one tells us that we, the saved ones, are the church, the Body of Christ, and that Christ is the Head of the church (vv. 22-23). This shows us that our relationship with Christ is the relationship of the Body and of life. We are the Body, and He is the Head; all that the Head has is in the Body. In this way Christ fills all, and He fills the church. All of us who belong to the Lord have Christ within us. When Christ is in us, this means that God is in us.<h2 class=head1>MAN'S INNER SATISFACTION BEING DEPENDENT ON THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD'S PURPOSE</h2><p>Since Christ, who is everything of God, is in us, we should be satisfied. However, although we have been saved, we are often unsatisfied. The reason is that the intention of God in coming into us is not only to satisfy us but even more to mingle Himself with us. God puts Himself in us to mingle Himself with us. Therefore, our real satisfaction depends on God&#8217;s being able to carry out His purpose in us so that God and man may be mingled together until one day everyone who has been saved is a God-man. This is God&#8217;s desire.<p>Praise the Lord! Not only is He the God who created the universe, but now He is also the God in us. Because He is in us, all that is required of us is to stop our outward man and come before Him, bowing down in worship to Him and beseeching Him, &#8220;O Lord, open my eyes that I may see how great, how rich, and how full You are in me. Lord, You are unlimited, and all that You are is in me.&#8221; When we see this, spontaneously we will cooperate with Him. Such a revelation, such a vision, will move us and lead us to cooperate with Him. Then He will be able to flow out of us. At that time we will not need to seek satisfaction; we will have satisfaction and rest within because God the Creator will have been mingled with us. This fulfills the original purpose of God&#8217;s creation of man, allowing Him to put Himself into the vessel He created.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST BEING THE OFFERINGS</h1><h2 class=head1>THE OFFERINGS BEING FOR ENJOYMENT AND MINGLING</h2><p>Christ as the tabernacle is for us to experience and to pass through; Christ as the offerings is for us to enjoy that we may gain Him and become one with Him. We have to clearly differentiate between these two aspects-Christ as the tabernacle and Christ as the offerings. Christ as our offerings is more subjective and deeper than Christ as our tabernacle. This is because Christ wants us not only to be joined to Him and to pass through Him but also to receive Him into us. As the offerings Christ is not only God&#8217;s food, but He also becomes our food and our element within. Thus, we are not only joined to Him but also mingled with Him. When a person enters into the tabernacle, at most he is joined to the tabernacle, not mingled with it. However, when a person receives Christ as the offerings, Christ enters into him, not only to be joined to him but also to be mingled with him to be his element. Therefore, the offerings are not only for union but even more for enjoyment and mingling.<h2 class=head1>FIVE KINDS OF OFFERINGS</h2><p>In the Old Testament, Leviticus chapters one through seven show us five kinds of offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. All these five kinds of offerings are for dealing with the situations we are in before God. Since the fall of Adam our situation before God has not been pleasing to Him. First, we are not for God; second, our living and conduct are not acceptable to God; third, there is no peace between God and us; fourth, our very being is sin, and we ourselves are just sin; and fifth, we have wronged and transgressed against both God and man. These are the five situations we are in before God.<h2 class=head2>The Burnt Offering and the Meal Offering</h2><p>Christ as our offerings is mainly to meet our need in dealing with these five situations. The burnt offering deals with our first situation before God, which is that we do not live for God. When Christ was on the earth, He lived for God wholly and absolutely. At the end He even offered His own body as a burnt offering that He might live for God in our stead to satisfy God&#8217;s desire.<p>The meal offering, the second kind of offering, speaks of how Christ lived His human life before God. He was so balanced, fine, and perfect, and as such, He presented Himself before God for God&#8217;s satisfaction and enjoyment.<h2 class=head2>The Peace Offering</h2><p>Besides the two offerings mentioned above, there are the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. The peace offering is for peace between us and God. Formerly we were not one with God and had no peace before Him. Before we were saved, we had no peace within whenever we thought of God; we felt that we did not conduct ourselves properly and were full of transgressions and shortcomings. But then Christ as our peace offering became our peace. When we repented and received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, believing that He shed His blood for us for the redemption of our sins before God, immediately we had peace within us. That kind of peace is indescribable. The more we draw near to Him, the more we feel that He is so dear and lovable; the more we pray to God, the sweeter and happier we feel within. It is not like the past in which we were frightened and fearful within whenever we thought of God. This is because Christ as our peace offering before God has solved the problem between us and God and has therefore reconciled us to God. Romans 5:11 says, &#8220;Boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.&#8221; Previously we had been afraid of God, whereas now we boast and exult in God through Jesus Christ.<h2 class=head3>Being Slaughtered</h2><p>How did Christ become our peace offering? First, He was slain for bearing our sins. Leviticus 3:2 tells us that the sacrifice of the peace offering had to be slaughtered and shed its blood.<h2 class=head3>The Shedding of Blood-the Blood Being Sprinkled on and around the Altar</h2><p>According to typology, after the sacrifice of the peace offering was slaughtered and its blood was shed, the blood was sprinkled on and around the altar instead of being brought into the tent of meeting. This is different from the blood of the sin offering, a portion of which had to be brought into the tent of meeting to make propitiation before God for our sins. The blood of the sacrifice of the peace offering, however, did not have to be brought before God; it needed only to be sprinkled on and around the altar. Why? It is because although there had been a problem between us and God, now at the altar we are at peace because of the blood shed by the sacrifice of the peace offering. Very often we have no peace within because of a problem between us and God. When in faith we see the precious blood shed on the cross and know that the Lord Jesus has solved the problem for us, within we are at peace. Therefore, in order to be our peace offering, Christ was firstly slaughtered for us; secondly, He shed His blood for us.<h2 class=head3>The Best Part Being God&#8217;s Food</h2><p>A part of the peace offering was offered to God as His food. The best part, the fattest part, including all the fat, had to be placed on the altar as God&#8217;s food for His satisfaction (vv. 9-11). We seldom realize that in the universe God also needs food and that God also has His food. We eat our food at the dining table, but God&#8217;s dining table is the altar, and His food is Christ. When Christ placed Himself on the altar, He became a food of fragrance for God&#8217;s enjoyment and satisfaction.<h2 class=head3>The Remaining Parts Being for Us</h2><p>The remaining parts of the peace offering are for us, indicating that Christ has also become our enjoyment. Christ was slain and shed His blood not only to satisfy God&#8217;s need, but also to satisfy our need as well. God and we, we and God, are both satisfied; therefore, God and we, we and God, can be at peace with one another.<p>Christ has made peace between us and God. If Christ had not been killed, had not shed His blood for us, and had not become God&#8217;s food and our food, then God&#8217;s requirement upon us could not have been met, and our problem before God could not have been solved. Thus, there would have been no peace between God and us. Thank the Lord that He became our peace offering by dying and shedding His blood for us. On the one hand, He became God&#8217;s food to satisfy God&#8217;s need, and on the other hand, He became our food to satisfy our need. The result is that both God and we are fully satisfied and at peace with one another. This is the meaning of Christ as our peace offering.<h2 class=head2>The Sin Offering</h2><p>What is the sin offering, and what is the difference between the sin offering and the trespass offering? Actually, sin and trespass differ greatly in meaning according to the Scriptures. What is sin? People commonly understand sin to be actions such as killing people and beating people. Actually, those are merely sinful acts and not sin itself. This may be likened to the fact that a tree and its fruit are not the same. Sin is the tree, whereas sinful acts are the fruit of the tree. Stealing, lying, and doing shameful things are examples of the fruit of sin, sinful acts.<p>Then what is sin? Romans 7:15-17 says, &#8220;For what I work out, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do. But if what I do not will, this I do, I agree with the law that it is good. Now then it is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me.&#8221; This portion tells us first that sin dwells in us. There are certain things we are not willing to do, yet we do them; this is against our thought and intent. Since this is the case, it is not we who do them but the sin that dwells in us. Second, the sin that dwells within our being is active and capable of doing these things. Lastly, sin compels us to do these things against our will.<p>Romans chapter six speaks even more clearly about sin. It says that sin can reign and can have dominion over us (v. 12). In the Bible sin does not refer to the outward actions of sin; rather, it refers to the source of sin that dwells in us. Romans 8:3 says, &#8220;For that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.&#8221; Because the Lord Jesus came in the likeness of the flesh of sin, He could be the sin offering for us, and as such, He judged sin and condemned sin. In other words, first the Lord came in the likeness of the flesh of sin, then He became the sin offering, and finally He condemned sin.<p>What does it mean that the Lord came in the likeness of the flesh of sin? Second Corinthians 5:21a says, &#8220;Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf.&#8221; Not only do we commit sinful acts, but we are sin; we sin because we are sin. A tree bears oranges because it is an orange tree. Likewise, we commit sins because we are sin; even if we do not commit any sinful acts, we are still sin. In the beginning, after Adam was created and before his fall, he did not sin because he was not sin; he was a man. Then in Genesis chapter three after he had eaten the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (v. 6), another element was added into him. That element was Satan. When the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil entered into man, Satan entered into man as sin. Since that time there has been the element of sin within man, and man has become sin. Everyone who is of Adam is a sinner from his birth.<p>In God&#8217;s creation we were humans, but after sin entered into us, we became sinners. Since we are sinners, we commit sins without being taught, just as an orange tree, after a period of time, will naturally bear oranges without having to learn how to. Some would ask, &#8220;What is man?&#8221; Strictly speaking, man is sin. Within man there is nothing but sin. However, one day the Lord Jesus became flesh; that is, He became a man like us. We are sin, so when the Lord Jesus became a man, He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin. He not only bore our sins but also became sin for us. He who did not know sin was made sin on our behalf. However, although He had the likeness of the flesh of sin, within Him He did not have the substance of sin. This is typified by the bronze serpent in the Old Testament (Num. 21:4-9).<p>John 3:14 says, &#8220;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&#8221; That bronze serpent typified Christ. In the Old Testament a bronze serpent was lifted up on a pole; in the New Testament a man-Jesus-was lifted up on the cross on Mount Golgotha. Was the One who was hung on the cross a man or a serpent? He was a man, yet He was typified by a serpent; He had the appearance of a serpent, yet He was truly a man. The serpent is Satan (Gen. 3:1; Rev. 12:9). After the children of Israel sinned in the wilderness, poisonous serpents came into their midst and bit them. When the venom of the serpent entered into them, they became serpents. To say that at that time they were merely humans would not be entirely accurate; they were also like serpents because within them they were full of the element of the serpent. Therefore, God lifted up a substitute-a bronze serpent-on the pole. Instead of lifting up a man, God lifted up a bronze serpent, because in His eyes all the children of Israel had become serpents.<p>However, there is a difference between the serpent that was lifted up on the pole and the serpents that bit the children of Israel. The serpent on the pole was a bronze serpent without the serpent&#8217;s poison. The bronze serpent typified Christ who became sin on our behalf and who was in the likeness of the flesh of sin. He only had the likeness of the flesh of sin; He did not have the reality of the sin of the flesh. Having been made sin in this way, He went to the cross as our sin offering to be judged and condemned there. When He was condemned, sin was condemned. Because man is sin, when the Lord Jesus became man, He became sin. When He went to the cross, He brought us-sin-with Him to the cross. When He was judged, we were also judged; that is, sin was also judged. When He was condemned, we were also condemned; that is, sin was also condemned. By being judged and condemned He became the sin offering; as such, He died for us not in name but in reality. As the sin offering He dealt with us, the sinners.<h2 class=head2>The Trespass Offering</h2><p>The trespass offering, the last of the five kinds of offerings, denotes the Lord Jesus who bore our sins. All our sins-including lying, coveting, and all other actions by which we offend either God or man-were borne for us by the Lord Jesus. The sin offering deals with us, the sinners, whereas the trespass offering deals with our sinful acts. Therefore, both our person and our actions have been dealt with by Christ. Simply speaking, sin is the person while trespasses are the actions of sin. As such, the sin offering deals with our person, while the trespass offering deals with our actions of sin. When these problems are resolved, we are reconciled to God. Therefore, before the Lord could be the peace offering, He first had to be the sin offering and then the trespass offering; the trespass offering is dependent on the sin offering. If the Lord had not been made sin on our behalf, He could not have borne our sins. If He had not become our sin offering, He could not have become our trespass offering. If He had not dealt with us, the sinners, He could not have resolved the problem of our actions of sin. Therefore, these two offerings are closely linked together-the trespass offering follows the sin offering, and the two offerings are actually one.<h2 class=head1>EXPERIENCING THE FIVE KINDS OF OFFERINGS</h2><h2 class=head2>Experiencing Christ as the Trespass Offering</h2><p>These five kinds of offerings all denote Christ. When the Bible mentions these five categories of offerings, it always follows this sequence: first, the burnt offering; second, the meal offering; third, the peace offering; fourth, the sin offering; and fifth, the trespass offering. However, when we experience and enjoy these offerings, the sequence is reversed: first, the trespass offering; second, the sin offering; third, the peace offering; fourth, the meal offering; and fifth, the burnt offering. This is because according to our experience, when we are first saved, we firstly see that we have so many sins, trespasses, transgressions, and other terrible things. At this time we see that the Lord Jesus was hung on the tree to bear all our sins. This moves us to receive Him as the sin-bearing Savior; thus, instantly we are at peace. This is our experience of Christ as the trespass offering.<h2 class=head2>Experiencing Christ as the Sin Offering</h2><p>Actually, our conduct is only the secondary problem; the primary problem is our being. Therefore, after we are saved for a period of time, we see that not only our conduct is poor, but even our being is problematic. Thus, we are enlightened to see that we are basically sin and that when the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He not only bore our sins, but having been made sin on our behalf, He judged and condemned us, the sinners. In this way we take a second step in knowing Christ. We then may pray, &#8220;Lord, I thank You. Since You became sin for me and died on the cross, I also died there. Lord, I experience You as my sin offering.&#8221; Whenever we see how corrupt and evil our conduct is and thus acknowledge that Christ died for us, we receive Christ as our trespass offering. When we see that our being is exceedingly wicked and even incurable, that every part of our being is sin, we would then receive Him as our sin offering. Seeing that through His blood He made redemption for our sins and that through His death He judged our person, we then have peace before God and with God. God is satisfied, and we also are satisfied.<h2 class=head2>Experiencing Christ as the Peace Offering</h2><p>Moreover, Christ became God&#8217;s food to satisfy God&#8217;s need; He also became our food to satisfy our need. God is fully satisfied in Christ, and we too are fully satisfied in Christ. At this moment within us we are joyful, at ease, peaceful, and comfortable; moreover, our heart is full of thanksgiving and praise. We have a sense that Christ is so good and so precious and that He is our peace, our reconciliation, and our acceptance to God. In this way we experience Christ as the peace offering. The peace offering is based on the trespass offering and the sin offering. Our trespasses and our sin were dealt with through Christ&#8217;s redemption, so there is no more problem between God and us. God is satisfied, and we are also satisfied; thus, we have peace with God.<h2 class=head2>Experiencing Christ as the Meal Offering</h2><p>Furthermore, we will eventually say to the Lord, &#8220;Lord, I want to be like You. You are so balanced, so fine, so obedient, and so blameless. Lord, I want to be like You in experiencing the death of the cross with the power of resurrection. You are without sin and You are not natural.&#8221; At this time we will experience Him as unleavened cakes, made with fine flour mingled with oil, having frankincense and salt added into it, but without honey or leaven. We bring the cakes before God, offering them as food to God, and they also become our food. We bring the Lord&#8217;s life, the Lord&#8217;s living, and the Lord&#8217;s conduct and walk and offer them all to God as an offering for our enjoyment as well as God&#8217;s enjoyment. This is the experience of the meal offering. Perhaps what we experience is a very small cake, and what Paul experienced was a very large cake; however, no matter what the size of the offering, we who have been saved all have a certain amount of experience of Christ as the meal offering.<h2 class=head2>Experiencing Christ as the Burnt Offering</h2><p>For a person to experience Christ as the meal offering is still not enough. At this moment he will see that just as Christ was absolutely for God, he also ought to be for God; just as Christ offered Himself to live for God, he also ought to present himself as a living sacrifice. Romans 12:1 says, &#8220;Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service.&#8221; The one who is offering the burnt offering does not let the priest slaughter the sacrificial animal for him; rather, he himself has to slaughter it, skin it, cut it into pieces, and then arrange the pieces on the altar to be burnt for God&#8217;s acceptance. The result is that with God there is a satisfying fragrance, but on the earth there is only a heap of ashes. In the same manner, all that we have must be for God alone; if God accepts us, then all that we have will become ashes. When we become ashes before men, we will be a satisfying fragrance before God. We do not regard ashes as something pleasant, yet God delights in the satisfying fragrance that comes from the burning which turns the sacrifice into ashes.<h2 class=head1>THE RESULTS OF EXPERIENCING THE FIVE KINDS OF OFFERINGS</h2><p>The children of Israel first offered the trespass offering, the sin offering, and then the peace offering, the meal offering, and the burnt offering. The way we Christians enjoy Christ is the same. First we see that He bore our sins, so we enjoy Him as our trespass offering. Next we enjoy Him as our sin offering. Then we enjoy Him as our peace offering because He accomplished redemption for our sin and trespasses. From then on we desire to take Him as our life so that we may live the life He lived and may be like Him in His conduct and walk for God&#8217;s satisfaction. This is to enjoy Him as our meal offering. Then we go on further to see that Christ lived for God and that, like Him, we must also live for God since we have received Christ. He put everything to death, giving up His all on the cross for God, so we also must be like Him, putting our all on the altar to live for God. At this point God accepts us, and we become a burnt offering, turning into a heap of ashes for God&#8217;s satisfaction.<p>These five kinds of experiences will finally bring in two results: one is the satisfying fragrance before God, while the other is a heap of ashes before men. All our beauty, all our good points, all our special qualities, and our everything are all burnt completely. All that is left is just a heap of ashes-shapeless, colorless, and useless. However, at the same moment that we become ashes before men, we also become a satisfying fragrance before God. At this moment we not only experience Christ, but through experiencing Him we become food to God for His satisfaction.<h2 class=head1>THE RESPONSES TO EXPERIENCING THE FIVE KINDS OF OFFERINGS</h2><p>Every person, regardless of which kind of offering he offers, has a reaction or response to his presentation of the offering. When a person offers the trespass offering, his response is to deal with his offenses and trespasses. Therefore, in the trespass offering there are ordinances concerning restitution. For example, when someone is conscious of his offense against another person, he has to go immediately before God and before man to confess it. A person who offers the sin offering also has a response. Knowing that he has offended God, he has deep regret before God and condemns himself. A person who offers the peace offering has a grateful heart because he feels that he is so unworthy to have received such great grace. Therefore, whenever he sees his relatives, friends, and the saints, he tells them about the Lord&#8217;s grace and love. This is the response of a person upon offering the peace offering. A person who experiences the meal offering always has a desire to take Christ as life, to live out the life of Christ, and to express Christ in his walk and conduct. This is the response to experiencing Christ as the meal offering. When a person enjoys Christ as the burnt offering, he will surely give himself completely to God and live for God in all things. He will place everything he has in the hand of God, desiring that he himself and all that he has would become a satisfying fragrance before God and a heap of ashes before men. These are the responses to presenting the offerings.<p>If we experience Christ, we will surely have these responses. If we have these responses, this proves that we have experienced Christ as our offerings. In our initial enjoyment of Christ, we deal with our trespasses and offenses. In our further enjoyment of Christ, we realize that we are sin and that we are wicked. When we go on another step to enjoy Christ, our heart is grateful and we are full of joy. After a further step of enjoying Christ, we desire to live Him out. In our ultimate enjoyment of Christ everything we have is for God; we become a heap of ashes before men and a satisfying fragrance for God&#8217;s enjoyment. In this way Christ is our offering as well as God&#8217;s food. This is the burnt offering.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>WILLING TO BE BROKEN, NOT ACTING INDEPENDENTLY, AND PERFECTING OTHERS FOR THE SERVICE</h1><h2 class=head1>SERVICE BEING THE ISSUE OF THE GROWTH IN LIFE</h2><p>The service that we have before the Lord is the issue of our growth in the spiritual life. In the church life the participation of the saints in the service is a manifestation of the extent of their growth in life. Without growth in life, the service will inevitably become a human organization. If the service in a local church is not the issue of life, it will need to be organized and promoted using human methods. As a result, the reality of the church life and service will be lost, and the church will degrade into a social organization.<p>If a church does not pay much attention to the growth of Christ&#8217;s life in the saints and neglects to submit to the authority of the Holy Spirit, the result will be that it will use human methods and reasoning to elect elders and deacons according to man&#8217;s condition. This is human organization. The service in the church should be the manifestation of the growth of life. When by the Lord&#8217;s grace the saints love the Lord, know the Lord, and thus allow the Lord&#8217;s life to grow in them, some of them will be manifested as elders while others will be manifested as deacons. This is the way the serving ones in the church should be produced.<p>Therefore, we all need to allow the life of Christ to have a way out of us. The faster the life of Christ grows in the saints, the faster those who can serve in the church will be produced; the more life grows, the more serving ones will be produced. If in a local church there are only persons who are merely saved, and if there is no growth in life, then it will be difficult for serving ones to be produced in that church. When the saints truly consecrate themselves to the Lord, pay the price absolutely, abandon their futures, and allow the Lord to gain ground and have a way in them, only then will it be possible for serving ones to be produced in the church.<h2 class=head1>SERVICE BEING THE MANIFESTATION OF THE LORD'S LIFE</h2><p>The spiritual things are related to the Spirit, and the things of life are related to life, having nothing to do with our education, knowledge, or capability. If the service in the church is committed only to those who are capable and highly educated, then it is reduced to a kind of social activity. Thus, not only will the church lose its reality, but it will also become a social organization. The church is the Body of Christ; the content of the church is the presence of Christ-the life of Christ; furthermore, all the functions of the church are the expression of Christ Himself. Therefore, the service in the church must be the issue of the manifestation of the life of Christ.<p>The manifestation of Christ&#8217;s life is based upon the breaking of the cross, and the breaking of the cross is based upon our learning. For example, suppose someone who serves the Lord preaches the gospel in a certain place and as a result some people are saved and begin to meet together as the church in that locality. Then a question will arise: Who ought to bear the responsibility of the church there? It all depends upon the manifestation of Christ&#8217;s life in the saints. How can the life of Christ be manifested? It is through the breaking of the cross. But how can the newly saved ones know the breaking of the cross? They do not know the way of the cross, nor have they experienced anything of the cross, so how can they know the breaking of the cross? Thus, there is the need for the serving ones to not only help people to receive the life of Christ but also to help people to know the breaking of the cross and thereby allow the life of Christ to be manifested through them. This requires much learning.<h2 class=head1>THE SERVING ONES NEEDING TO KNOW THE WAY OF THE CROSS AND TO RECEIVE THE BREAKING OF THE CROSS</h2><p>Today many do not know the way of the cross, they do not know what the breaking of the soul means, and they do not understand what it means for the flesh to be dealt with. This is due to the fact that the serving ones have not shown them the way of the cross; even the serving ones themselves have not gone through this path and have not lived this kind of life. Due to their lack of this kind of reality and experience, and due to the dullness of their sight, they usually appoint responsible ones based on capability and education. As a result, opinions, naturalness, and the flesh are brought into the service of the church, causing the church life and the service to be damaged.<p>The reason the believers do not recognize their natural life and their flesh is that they do not see the way of dealing. Because this way-the breaking of the cross-is not opened wide enough to the children of God, the life of Christ has no way to be expressed through the brothers and sisters in a local church. As a result, very few in the church service are able to bear the responsibility of taking care of practical affairs. Although in the church there are many saved ones who all have the life of Christ, there are very few who manifest the life of Christ. This is due to the lack of the breaking of the cross. If we employ any method or use any scheme to produce responsible ones in the church, then one day they will become problems in the church and in the Lord&#8217;s work. In the church life and in the service of the work there is no place for methods and schemes, which ought to be rejected; there is room only for life and the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head1>WORKING BY LIFE, SOWING THE SEEDS OF LIFE, AND REAPING THE FRUIT OF LIFE</h2><p>Galatians 6:8 says, &#8220;For he who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life.&#8221; If we sow seeds out of our own flesh, we will bear the fruit of the flesh; if we sow seeds out of our own will, we will bear the fruit of our own will. However, if we sow seeds out of the Spirit, we will reap the fruit of the Spirit. If our work is produced by the life of the cross, the fruit we reap will be the work of the life of the cross. Whatever we sow is what we will reap; whatever we do is what we will gain. It is possible to fake many things, but it is impossible to be fake in doing the things related to the Lord&#8217;s work and the church.<p>When a serving one works by the life of Christ and sows the seeds of life, spontaneously he will reap life. If he has been broken by the cross-that is, if he has learned his lessons, been dealt with and broken, and is thereby living in the Lord-then the seeds he sows will surely produce a normal church life and testimony. Not only so, if those who serve manifest life and those who minister have the leading of the Holy Spirit, then among them there will be not only life but also authority. There will be not only the riches of life but also the ruling of authority. Those who know the flesh and the natural life are those who live under the cross, who allow only Christ to live out through them and allow only the Spirit to rule in them. Thus, by life and by the Spirit they prepare the Body for Christ, which is Christ&#8217;s expression. Therefore, we must learn the same lesson, have the same vision, walk the same path, live the same life, and do the same work, so that we may produce the same result.<h2 class=head1>RECEIVING THE BREAKING OF THE CROSS TO CARRY OUT A REAL WORK</h2><p>How are workers raised up? Are they produced by human methods such as encouragement, enthusiasm, training, and arrangement? If we carry out the Lord&#8217;s work by the arrangements of our human will, then we are in a situation of degradation, and we are using the method of the world. We cannot use such a method or take such a way because it is not found in the Bible. All those who serve the Lord must receive the breaking of the cross and allow Christ to be lived out so that they may minister Christ and life. Only in this way can they have real work. If there is no Christ, there is no work; real work is the overflow of life and the expression of Christ.<p>Immediately after a person is saved and has received the Lord&#8217;s life, he must see the way of the cross. He must know that he has to be broken and dealt with so that the life of Christ may be manifested through him. When the life of Christ is manifested in the believers, the functions for the various services will be manifested in them. Some of the believers will be manifested as elders, while others will be manifested as deacons. An illustration of this is a nursery with many green sprouts. When the sprouts are tender, it is difficult to tell what kind of plants they are. However, after fertilizing and watering them, the sprouts gradually grow and manifest themselves as a peach tree, an almond tree, a plum tree, an apple tree, and so forth. It is the same with the newly saved ones. Although they all have the life of Christ, their functions are not discernible. After they have grown in life, passed through the breaking of the cross, experienced consecration, and dealt with their natural life and their flesh, then Christ can be manifested in them. In this way, after a period of time various functions will be manifested in them.<p>The manifestation of function is absolutely not through human inciting nor through human encouragement. Please remember this principle: Any work stirred up by men is useless. Christ can be expressed only by our ministering the life of Christ, experiencing the way of the cross, and dealing with the natural life and the flesh. The various services can be manifested only through the manifestation of the life of Christ.<h2 class=head1>SERVING IN THE BODY</h2><p>The Scriptures show us clearly that no one who participates in the Lord&#8217;s work can act independently (Mark 6:7; Luke 10:1). All the services are in the church, and the church is the Body of Christ. Since it is the Body, there is no possibility for anyone to act independently. If someone insists on acting alone, no one can do anything about it. This one will have a problem before the Lord. However, according to the Lord&#8217;s arrangement and according to the requirement of life, no Christian can serve God independently in a locality. We must serve in the church, in the Body.<h2 class=head1>WORKING IN THE BODY</h2><p>How then shall we work for the Lord? If we read Acts or the Epistles, we cannot find one reference to a person working independently for the Lord. In the Gospels no one among the Lord&#8217;s followers acted independently, and no one started a work independently. All who participated in the work were in step with one another and in one corporate move. On the day of Pentecost it was not Peter in Jerusalem, John in Nazareth, and James in Paphos; rather, about one hundred twenty people were gathered together (Acts 1:15b). In the church the work of the Holy Spirit does not begin with an individual but with a corporate group of people. Every move in the work must be of the Body, not of an individual.<p>In the book of Acts, from the first chapter to the last chapter, we can say that all the moves of the apostles were of the Body; there was no individual move. Take for example the case of Barnabas. He was raised up by the Lord and was placed in the flow of the work. Instead of sending him out as an independent worker, the Lord placed him among many co-workers. Regrettably, a problem arose halfway through the flow of the work; there was a sharp contention between Barnabas and Paul. Barnabas had an independent view and brought in an independent action (15:39). The result was that in the book of Acts the name of Barnabas is not mentioned again. From this we see that the Holy Spirit records only the work that is in the divine stream, the work of the Body. Perhaps people were still able to work independently-Barnabas surely brought more people to salvation-but the Holy Spirit did not record his name from that point on.<p>Therefore, we can see that the Lord&#8217;s work is entrusted to many workers; however, these workers do not work individually but corporately. When they move, it is the move of the Body. The entire book of Acts with twenty-eight chapters clearly reveals one flow of the work-flowing from Jerusalem to Antioch, then from Antioch to the land of the Gentiles, passing through Asia, Macedonia, Greece, and eventually reaching Europe. Through it all there was no independent move by any individual; rather, there was only the functioning of a corporate body.<h2 class=head1>USHERING THE NEW BELIEVERS INTO THE SERVICE</h2><p>Some of the serving ones can serve only by themselves and are not able to bring others along to serve together with them. Every serving one, however, must be able to bring along some new believers to serve together with him, just like a master craftsman who brings someone along to be trained as an apprentice. This &#8220;bringing along&#8221; requires the paying of a price. In the Bible, and in the New Testament in particular, there are many examples of apprentices in serving the Lord. In the matter of learning to serve the Lord, there is no school, but there are workshops. When the new believers come into the church, they are not enrolled in a school to be students; rather, they have come to a workshop to be apprentices. For this reason all the serving ones need to have the character of not being afraid of troubles and not being afraid to pay the price but rather being willing to bring along some new ones to serve together with them.<p>Some of the serving ones are used to being alone and being solitary. They must allow this kind of character to be broken by the cross; otherwise, they can only do their own work alone. Throughout history there have been many serving ones who served to such an extent that they became poor and lonely without anyone coordinating with them, just like a master craftsman who does not produce an apprentice. No good businessman would open a store for ten years and yet not bring in a group of younger apprentices; no good industrialist would operate a factory for five years and yet not be able to produce many apprentices. This is the way of service revealed in the Scriptures. After serving for three years we should be able to help some new believers to become serving ones like us.<p>Like master craftsmen teaching apprentices, we all need to learn to bring others along to serve together with us. Only those who can bring others along in serving can learn the real lessons. In fact, those who cannot bring others along are unwilling to learn the lessons. To allow the Lord&#8217;s work to spread, all the serving ones must learn the lessons, being willing to be broken and restricted, so that they may produce more serving ones. This is the way to work. If we cannot teach others to serve, our work has no reality, and the Lord&#8217;s work has no way out of us.</body></html>
