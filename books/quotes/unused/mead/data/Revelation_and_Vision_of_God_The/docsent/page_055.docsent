   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 The Source of Sin the Devil's Private Possession</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 8:44 the Lord Jesus said to the Jews, "You are of your father the devil .He was a murderer from the beginning .When he speaks the lie, he speaks it out of his own possessions."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the proper translation according to the Greek text.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Chinese Union Version translates it this way: "When he speaks the lie, he speaks out of himself."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>L Chen-chung's Version translates it another way: "When he speaks the lie, he speaks out of his own nature."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both are not the meaning of what the Lord Jesus expressed at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus' speaking was full of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In describing the relationship between Satan and sin, He said that sin is something of Satan's own.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Greek experts affirm that this expression denotes something which Satan has within himself, something as Satan's private possession, something as a secret in him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the Lord Jesus' word means that the devil lies out of his private possession, which is the source of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Up to the present we still cannot explain what Satan's private possession is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, by the word of the Lord Jesus we can be sure that this private possession of the devil is the source of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because of this, Satan has a name which is called "the evil."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Within Satan there is an evil thing that is not found in any other angel or any other creature; it is uniquely his.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you ask me what this evil thing is, then I would tell you that this evil thing which uniquely belongs to Satan is called "sin" in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then if you ask me further where sin came from, I can only tell you that although many have been trying to find out where sin came from, it is still a secret.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even the Chinese philosophers who achieved a great deal in their study concerning the origin of sin were unable to answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, the Bible impresses us deeply with the fact that sin is Satan's private possession, something of Satan's own, something that is uniquely and exclusively his.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, he is the father of liars and the father of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only the liars are of him, but even the lies are essentially of him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is something within him as his private possession, and this is the gene of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he seduced Eve and Adam by instigating them to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the gene of sin entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why Romans 5:12 says, "Therefore just as through one man sin entered into the world."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>World here denotes the people of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is the same as the word for world in John 3:16, which says "For God so loved the world."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the way sin entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, strictly speaking, the understanding of the early Chinese theologians concerning sin was not quite accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They considered yuan tsui, the original sin, as the sin committed by our forefather Adam, and pen tsui, our own sin, as the sins committed by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, the original sin is not the sin committed by Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The sin committed by Adam, to Adam himself, was Adam's own sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The original sin is something of Satan's own, something as Satan's private possession.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the origin, the source, of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>3 The Dealing of Sin the Inward Sin and the Outward Sins</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What the Lord Jesus dealt with on the cross was sin, the sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why, after Romans 7, Paul said in 8:3, "God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that there is something called sin, and when the Lord Jesus was crucified, sin was also crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way God judged sin in the flesh of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, God condemned sin by sending His Son "in the likeness of the flesh of sin" and also "concerning sin."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Concerning sin means including anything that is related to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although this One whom God sent was "in the likeness of the flesh of sin," there was no sin in Him 2 Cor 5:21; Heb 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is typified by the bronze serpent which Moses lifted up in the wilderness Num 21:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In John 3:14 the Lord Jesus said, "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This word indicates that the bronze serpent was a type of Him as our Substitute on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The bronze serpent had the form of the serpent but was without the serpent's poison; it had the serpent's form but not the serpentine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the bronze serpent was hung on the pole, only the serpent's form was hung there; it was not an actual poisonous serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the same principle, when the Lord Jesus was put to death on the cross, He was crucified in the flesh; that flesh was "the likeness of the flesh of sin," the form of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was in such a "likeness of the flesh of sin" that God condemned sin and dealt with everything related to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Not only so, since man has the gene of sin within, he surely has the deeds of sin without.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus dealt with our inward sin, the gene of sin, by becoming sin on our behalf and condemning and judging sin in the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He dealt with our outward sins by bearing our sins and suffering God's righteous punishment on our behalf to satisfy God's righteous requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is Christ's passing through death to deal with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is proven by Isaiah 53:6, Hebrews 9:28, and 1 Peter 2:24.</S>
