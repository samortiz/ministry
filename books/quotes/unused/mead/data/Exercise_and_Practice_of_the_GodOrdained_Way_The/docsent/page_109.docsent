   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LIFE OF MORNING REVIVAL AND DAILY VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A vital matter that is crucial to the practice of the church life in the new way is our living a life of morning revival and daily victory.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should not consider that to have a personal morning revival is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be revived is simply to be touched by the Lord anew.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever the Lord touches us, we are revived.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In only two minutes the Lord can touch us and revive us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You may not have been revived for a long time, and you may feel that you are very far from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the Lord promises that, regardless of what we are, where we are, or how we are, He is always near to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may not have a pure conscience, but the Lord's blood is ready to cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we simply confess our failures, defects, wrongdoings, and shortcomings, the Lord will forgive us and cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then immediately we touch Him, and He touches us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is to be revived, and this kind of revival must be fresh every day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We stress that this should be a morning revival based upon God's natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every twenty-four hours there is a morning to begin the new day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The sun rises anew every morning, and we also must rise up every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, it is good for us to go to bed earlier at night so that we can rise up earlier in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every morning we should get up, make our bed, and then spend some time with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we can give the Lord ten minutes in the morning before doing anything else, surely we will be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we normally get up at six o'clock, we should get up at five fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we could have ten minutes to contact the Lord and be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our time with the Lord, the main thing is to clear up our conscience, to get rid of our inner condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is done by making a thorough confession of all of our failures, defects, defeats, wrongdoings, mistakes, even sinfulness to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we can take one or two verses from the Holy Word to use in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not be concerned about too many things, and do not care that much for your understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Take care of calling on the Lord, contacting the Lord, and touching the Lord with a proper inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This keeps you in a direct, fresh, intimate, loving contact with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes as you are enjoying the Lord in this way, you may have the sensation that the Lord is speaking to you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then you can be silent, listening to His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is to fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In ten minutes you can do a number of things, yet you should not try to do too much.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Use this ten minutes mainly to contact the Lord directly; then you will be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because you have been revived, when you go to work, you will go with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way you will be victorious the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because we have such a daily practice, we should help all of our new ones to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not think that because they were just baptized, they cannot have morning watch or a morning revival.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everyone can have a morning revival.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You only need to give them some simple instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We found out that a good way to help the new ones build up this practice is by using the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You can encourage a new one to have a time of morning revival and explain what this means as I have done in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then you can help him set a time for this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many people do not get up early, so you may have to encourage him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If he usually gets up at seven o'clock, then you can say, "If you get up fifteen minutes earlier, you can make your bed, and then I will call you at six fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then we can pray together over the phone."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you practice in this way, you may be able to take care of two or three new ones every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You should also fellowship with them and select a book from the New Testament to go through in your morning revival times.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When you begin to help them in this way, it may seem somewhat lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, after one or two days, this new one will be revived and become living.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whether he becomes living this morning, tomorrow morning, or the next morning, you should not care for that.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you are faithful to call him every morning, eventually, he will be fully revived.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through your example, he will learn to pray and to pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you will practice with him, he will learn.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you have a morning revival with an overcoming daily life, then you can take the lead to bring the new ones into the same practice.</S>
