   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE EIGHT STAGES OF GROWTH IN LIFE Scripture Reading: S. S. 1:9, 15; 2:2, 14; 3:6, 7, 9, 10, 11 A FAMILY OF DESCRIPTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last chapter we saw the Lord's appraisal of the seeking one in the first three chapters of the Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not so easy to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the last chapter we had a group of words which belong to the same family; I would call it a family of description.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord used at least eight figures to describe His seeking one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord's description of His seeker with different figures illustrated the state the seeker had attained at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, if we consider all eight figures together and compare them with one another, we will see their meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They indicate the growth in life and the transformation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First of all, the Lord Jesus used the figure of a horse.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Next He spoke of the doves' eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She was not a dove yet, but she had the eyes of a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the doves' eyes there was the lily.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The dove as a complete entity followed the lily.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Following the dove were the pillars of smoke, the couch, and the palanquin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Finally, there was the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we pray over these eight figures, I believe the Holy Spirit will show us something so meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My burden is not to expound the Song of Songs, but that we all may know the way to take the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So many Christians talk about Christ as life, but very few know how to experience Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>CHRIST AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The way to enjoy and experience Christ as life is found in the Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The term "life" is not used in this book, but there is the way to enjoy Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The way to enjoy Christ as life is simply to love Him as a wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Gospel of John is not a book of doctrines, gifts, or power; it is a presentation of a wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Song of Songs is exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are not any doctrines in this book or any doctrinal terms.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are no manifestations of gifts or power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These eight chapters reveal to us a lovable Person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is altogether lovely!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And this Person is not only our life, but also our living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Song of Songs, this lovely One is just the life and the living of His seeker.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The seeking one takes this lovely One as her life within and her living without by loving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Oh, we must love such a wonderful Person!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we will take Him as our life and as our living.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He will become our talk, our walk, our attitude, our expression, our everything!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He will become not only our life within, but also our living without.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"For to me to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A CONTINUAL CHANGE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This book not only presents a picture of this wonderful, loving Person, but it also gives a clear picture of the seeking one who loves Him so much.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why there is a continual change in her growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We cannot help growing in life and having the transformation of life if we really love the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you say that you love the Lord Jesus, yet year after year you remain the same, I do not believe you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a person really loves the Lord, there will be a continual growth and change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not by teaching, instruction, correction, or adjustment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I do not have confidence in these things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They can only adjust a little in an outward way, just as the morticians do who work on a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They make some changes, but they are all outward; not one bit comes out of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is no growth, no transformation, no improvement, no change, and no living progress.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Consider the seeking one in the Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the time she is growing, changing, and being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What a transformation from a horse to a dove!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From a dove to pillars of smoke!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From the pillars of smoke to the couch!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>From the couch to a palanquin!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>And from the palanquin to a crown!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In all of these figures we can see the growth in life of such a seeking one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not by teaching, and it is not by gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must realize that no transformation of life can come out of any gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In John 2 many people saw the miracles done by the Lord and believed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yet, the Lord would not commit Himself to the miracle appraisers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not be miracle appraisers, but Person appraisers those who love and seek after the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then there will be the growth in life and the transformation of life.</S>
