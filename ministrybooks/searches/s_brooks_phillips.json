Some believed in pretribulation rapture, others believed in posttribulation rapture, and still others believed in a partial rapture, which takes place before and after the great tribulation. Forty years ago, I spent much time to study which school was the most scriptural. At that time Brother Nee gave us a number of messages on the truth concerning the rapture. He gave us a list of well-known believers who were found in all three schools [26] of truth concerning the rapture. J. N. Darby, William Kelly, R. A. Torrey, Phillips Brooks, James Gray, Arno C. Gaebelein, J. A. Seiss, D. L. Moody, and C. I. Scofield are some of those who believed in pretribulation rapture. George M\u00fcller, A. J. Gordon, A. B. Simpson, W. J. Erdman, W. G. Moorehead, Henry Frost, James Wright, and Benjamin Newton believed in posttribulation rapture. Hudson Taylor, Robert Chapman, Robert Govett, D. M. Panton, G. H. Pember, and Paul Rader believed in the rapture of the overcomers, which is called the partial rapture, or the midtribulation rapture. Paul Rader was the successor of R. A. Torrey in the Moody Memorial Church of Chicago. The doctrinal differences among the saints concerning the truth of the rapture caused much division. "}]}
