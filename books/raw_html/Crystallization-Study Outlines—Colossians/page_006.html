<h1 class="title">The Cross of Christ&mdash;<br />
the Unique Way in God&rsquo;s Economy and<br />
the Center of God&rsquo;s Government</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:20-22; 2:11-15; 3:5a</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In His economy God gives us one person and one way; the one person is the all-inclusive, extensive, preeminent Christ, and the one way is the cross&mdash;1 Cor. 2:2; Phil. 2:5-11; Gal. 6:14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We not only have Christ, the unique person, who is versus all things; we also have the cross, the unique way, which is versus all ways&mdash;Col. 1:20.</li>
	<li>The way God has ordained, uplifted, and honored is the cross of Christ&mdash;Gal. 6:14.</li>
	<li>The one person&mdash;Christ&mdash;is the center of the universe, and the one way&mdash;the cross&mdash;is the center of God&rsquo;s government&mdash;1 Cor. 2:2; 1:17-18, 23; Gal. 6:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God governs everything by the cross and deals with everything by the cross&mdash;Col. 1:20; 2:14-15.</li>
		<li>By the cross God has dealt with all the negative things in the universe, and He is still governing everything through the cross&mdash;Eph. 2:14-16.</li>
		<li>In order to progress spiritually, we need to pass through the cross; until we come to the New Jerusalem, we need to pass through the cross day by day in our walk with the Lord&mdash;Matt. 10:38; 16:24; Luke 14:27.</li>
		<li>In order to have the proper church life, we need to experience the cross; if we have a daily life of passing through the cross, there will be oneness and harmony both in the church life and in the family life&mdash;Col. 3:12-15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>If we have a clear understanding of the fact that the enemy of God, in a subtle way, utilizes culture to replace Christ, we will realize that the only way for us to take is the way of the cross&mdash;Gal. 6:14; 1 Cor. 2:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The book of Colossians teaches us that in the church life Christ must be all and in all; everything that is not Christ must go to the cross&mdash;1:18; 3:10-11.</li>
	<li>Through the cross we need to become nothing, to have nothing, and to be able to do nothing; otherwise, what we are, what we have, and what we can do will become a substitute for Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 1:17-18, 23.</li>
	<li>For those who are willing to take the cross, the cross is not a narrow way but a highway&mdash;Luke 9:23.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the book of Colossians we see a clear vision of the cross as God&rsquo;s way in His administration&mdash;1:20-22; 2:11-15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;Through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross&mdash;through Him, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens&rdquo;&mdash;1:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Through Him</em> means through Christ as the active instrument through which the reconciliation was accomplished&mdash;v. 20a.</li>
		<li><em>All things</em> refers not only to human beings but also to all creatures, which were created in Christ and now subsist, cohere, in Him (vv. 16-17) and are reconciled to God through Him.</li>
		<li>To reconcile all things to Himself is to make peace with Himself for all things; this was accomplished through the blood of the cross of Christ.</li>
		<li>Because of the rebellion of Satan, the archangel, and the angels who followed him, the heavens were contaminated; therefore, not only things on the earth but also things in the heavens needed to be reconciled to God&mdash;v. 20b.</li>
		<li>Because we were sinners, we needed redemption, and because we were also enemies of God, we needed reconciliation&mdash;vv. 14, 21-22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Wiping out the handwriting in ordinances, which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross&rdquo;&mdash;2:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Ordinances</em> refers to the ordinances of the ceremonial law with its rituals, which are the forms or ways of living and worship&mdash;Eph. 2:15.</li>
		<li><em>Nailing it to the cross</em> means to abolish the law of the commandments in ordinances.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it&rdquo;&mdash;Col. 2:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This verse portrays the fighting that took place at the time of Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion.</li>
		<li>Activities involving Christ, God, and the evil angelic rulers and authorities were brought to a focus on the cross; thus, the cross became God&rsquo;s eternal, central, and unique way&mdash;vv. 14-15.</li>
		<li>By His crucifixion Christ labored to accomplish redemption, and God the Father was working to judge sin and nail the law to the cross&mdash;v. 14.</li>
		<li>At the same time, the evil rulers and authorities were busy in their attempt to frustrate the work of God and Christ, pressing in close to God and Christ; thus, a warfare was raging at the cross.</li>
		<li>God openly made a display of the evil angelic rulers and authorities on the cross and triumphed over them in it, putting them to shame&mdash;v. 15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ&rdquo;&mdash;v. 11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This is spiritual circumcision, the circumcision of Christ, referring to the proper baptism, which puts off the body of the flesh by the effectual virtue of the death of Christ&mdash;Phil. 3:3.</li>
		<li>The circumcision that is the putting off of the body of the flesh was not made with hands; it was accomplished by the death of Christ, and it is applied, executed, and carried out by the powerful Spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth&rdquo;&mdash;Col. 3:5a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This is based on the fact that we have been crucified with Christ and baptized into His death&mdash;Gal. 2:20; Rom. 6:3, 6.</li>
		<li>Christ accomplished the all-inclusive crucifixion; now we apply it to our lustful flesh.</li>
		<li>We execute Christ&rsquo;s death upon our sinful members by crucifying them, by faith, through the power of the Spirit (Rom. 8:13); this corresponds with Galatians 5:24.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
