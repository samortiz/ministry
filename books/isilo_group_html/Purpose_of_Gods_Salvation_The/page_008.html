<h1 class="title">THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that the church is the fullness of Christ. In this chapter we will consider the riches of Christ. Ephesians 3:8 says, &ldquo;To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.&rdquo; This verse speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ. Ephesians 1:23 says that the church, &ldquo;His Body,&rdquo; is the fullness of the One who fills all in all. This verse speaks of the fullness of Christ. These two verses contain two very significant terms: the <em>riches</em> of Christ and the <em>fullness</em> of Christ. These two terms refer to two different things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE RICHES OF CHRIST<br />
TO BECOME THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>There is a difference between the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ. The riches of Christ are the gospel that the apostle preached (3:8). The apostle Paul received grace to preach the gospel. The gospel that he preached was just the riches of Christ. When we received the gospel, we received the riches of Christ. By enjoying the riches of Christ, we become the fullness of Christ. Many people mistakenly understand <em>riches</em> and <em>fullness</em> to mean the same thing. However, these are two different Greek words: <em>riches</em> is <em>ploutos,</em> denoting &ldquo;wealth,&rdquo; and <em>fullness</em> is <em>pleroma,</em> denoting &ldquo;completeness.&rdquo; Thus, <em>riches</em> and <em>fullness</em> refer to two different things.</p>
<p>Christ is rich; He is the unsearchable riches. The apostle preached these unsearchable riches as the gospel. When a person receives the gospel, he gains, enjoys, and experiences these riches. Those who gain and enjoy the riches of Christ become the fullness of Christ. Hence, if we enjoy the riches of Christ, we will become the fullness of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RICHES OF CHRIST BEING UNSEARCHABLE</h2>
<p>Ephesians uses the general term <em>riches of Christ</em> but does not define what the riches of Christ are. The entire Bible is needed to define the riches of Christ. For example, in the Epistles of Paul we are told that Christ is wisdom to us as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1 Cor. 1:30). Wisdom as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption refers to different items of the riches of Christ. Christ as wisdom to us from God has at least three functions. First, Christ is the righteousness of God. By Christ as our righteousness we were justified, accepted by God, and saved (Rom. 5:18). Second, after we are saved, Christ is our sanctification so that we can live a sanctified life (6:19, 22). Third, when we meet the Lord in the future, Christ will redeem our body; He is redemption to us for the transfiguration and glorification of our body (8:23; Phil. 3:21). Christ justified and saved us in the past, He is sanctifying our whole being in the present, and He will redeem our body in the future. These different items of the riches of Christ are God making Christ wisdom to us.</p>
<p>Wisdom is displayed in the way that we solve problems. A wise person has the best way to solve a problem. Hence, God has the best way to solve problems. As sinners, we did not have righteousness, but God gave Christ to us as righteousness. We cannot sanctify ourselves, but God gives Christ to sanctify us gradually. We cannot redeem our body, but God has given us Christ to transfigure and redeem our body by His resurrection power. Therefore, Christ is our God-given way. Christ is wisdom to us from God as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. These are a few items of the unsearchable riches of Christ.</p>
<p>The New Testament is full of the items of the riches of Christ. First Corinthians 1:30 gives three items of the unsearchable riches of Christ, but these three items involve many details. For example, sanctification involves our living, conduct, thoughts, emotions, and intents. For this reason, Paul says that we can have the mind of Christ (2:16), that we should let the mind that was in Christ Jesus also be in us (Phil. 2:5), that we can enjoy the love of Christ (Rom. 8:35-39), and that we can experience the power of Christ (Phil. 3:10). These items are included in Christ being our sanctification.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE &ldquo;I AM&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John speaks of the Lord Jesus as the way, the reality, and the life (14:6), the true vine (15:1, 5), the good Shepherd (10:11, 14), the door (v. 7), and the resurrection life (11:25). How rich Christ is! Hence, the Gospel of John says that the Lord&rsquo;s name is &ldquo;I Am&rdquo; (8:58). The name I Am means that Christ is whatever we need. If we need life, Christ is life. If we need comfort, Christ is comfort. If we have no way to resolve a problem, Christ is our solution. If we do not have a way through, Christ is our door. If we have no joy, Christ is joy. If we are dying, Christ is life, and if we are dead, Christ is resurrection. Christ is everything. These are the riches of Christ. Whatever He is, is ours. He is like a blank check given to us so that we can write in what we need. The riches of Christ are unsearchable.</p>
<p>In 1933 I was in Shanghai. While I was there, I often fellowshipped with a brother who had much experience in the Lord. One afternoon he asked me, &ldquo;Brother, what is patience?&rdquo; I thought that this was a very basic question. Who does not know the meaning of patience? However, I felt that his question could not be that simple. Therefore, instead of answering him quickly, I thought for a long time. He asked me a second time, &ldquo;What is patience?&rdquo; Although I was not sure how to answer his question, I knew that I had to answer. So I said to him, &ldquo;Patience is trying one&rsquo;s best to endure the mistreatment of others.&rdquo; He said that my answer was not correct, so I asked him, &ldquo;What is patience?&rdquo; He continued rocking in his chair and asking, &ldquo;What is patience?&rdquo; without telling me the answer.</p>
<p>I was unable to answer such a basic question. Eventually, he said, &ldquo;Patience is Christ.&rdquo; As I walked home, I asked myself, &ldquo;What does it mean to say that patience is Christ?&rdquo; Because I did not understand and was troubled, I prayed and asked the Lord how patience could be Christ. One morning I received light while I was praying, and I began to offer praises. I understood that patience is Christ, and Christ is patience. Christ is my life, and He is living in me. When He is lived out from me, He is patience for me to handle any situation. Likewise, Christ is love. When I am in a situation that needs love, and Christ is lived out from me, He becomes my love. From that day onward, I began to see that patience is not gritting one&rsquo;s teeth while enduring beatings or ill speaking. Patience is Christ lived out from me. Patience is not my enduring; it is Christ living out from me. Love is not my love; love is Christ living out from me. These are the riches of Christ, and these riches are unsearchable. Christ is whatever we need.</p>
<p>We have no need other than Christ. If the elders want to know how to be good elders, they need Christ. Christ is the way to be an elder. If the elders will allow Christ to gain ground in their being, they will be very good elders. What should the young co-workers who minister do when they cannot find a topic? Christ is their topic. Christ is their speaking. If they will allow Christ to gain ground in them and to pass through their being, they will experience Christ as their inexhaustible topic. A wife with a difficult husband should allow Christ to gain ground in her being and to be lived out from her. Then she will have a way with her husband, because Christ is her way and her solution.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Purpose of God's Salvation &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
