   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. God's Expectation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God expects to see one thing from us: Whoever wants to receive grace must first learn to dispense grace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whoever receives grace must first learn to share grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a man receives grace, God expects him to share this grace with others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Matthew 18:28-29 says, "But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, and he took hold of him and began to choke him, saying, Repay me what you owe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then his fellow slave fell down and begged him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here the Lord shows us that we owe Him ten thousand talents, while others only owe us only a hundred denarii.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we say to the Lord, "Be patient with me and I will repay you all," He not only releases us but also forgives our debt.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our fellow slave, our brother, owes us a hundred denarii at the most.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When he says, "Be patient with me and I will repay you," he has our same hope and request.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How can we not be patient with him?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the slave "would not; instead, he went away and threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed" v. 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord spoke such a parable to expose the unreasonableness of those who do not forgive others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you do not forgive your brother, you are the very slave spoken of in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we read this parable, we are indignant at this slave.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The master had forgiven his debt of ten thousand talents, but he would not forgive his fellow slave's debt of a hundred denarii.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He put his fellow slave into prison and kept him there until the latter would pay what he owed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He acted according to his standard of "righteousness"!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A believer should treat himself according to righteousness but should treat others according to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Your brother may owe you something, and the Lord knows clearly that your brother owes you something.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But He also clearly shows us that if a believer does not forgive his brother, he is not dealing with others according to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such a one is short of grace in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verses 31-33 say, "His fellow slaves, seeing what had taken place, were greatly grieved and came and explained fully to their master all that had taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then his master called him to him and said to him, Evil slave, all that debt I forgave you, because you begged me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave even as I had mercy on you?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord expects us to do to others as He has done to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He has not made demands on us according to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the same way He expects us to not make demands on others according to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord has forgiven our debts according to mercy, and He expects us to forgive others' debts according to mercy as well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With what measure the Lord measures to us, He expects us to measure the same measure to others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord dispenses grace to us according to a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He expects us to do the same thing to others according to a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord expects us to do to our brother as He has done to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The ugliest thing in the eyes of God is for a forgiven person to refuse to forgive others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nothing is uglier than refusing to forgive when one has been forgiven or refusing to be merciful when one has obtained mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A person should not receive grace for himself on the one hand and refuse to share grace with others on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A person must realize before the Lord that he should treat others the same way that the Lord has treated him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is very ugly for a man to receive grace while refusing to share grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Being forgiven yet refusing to forgive others is a most uncomely sight.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God condemns a debt-ridden person's attempt to demand payment from another debt-ridden person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has no pleasure in those who remember others' shortcomings when they themselves have come short.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The master asked the slave, "Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave even as I had mercy on you?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God wants us to have mercy on others as He has had mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to learn to have mercy on others and to forgive them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A man who has experienced grace and who is forgiven by God should learn to forgive others' debts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He should learn to forgive others, to have mercy on them, and to be gracious to them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to lift up our eyes and say to the Lord, "Lord, You have forgiven my debt of ten thousand talents.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am willing to forgive those who have offended me today.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am also willing to forgive those who will offend me in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You have forgiven me of my great sins.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I also will learn to be like You in a small way by forgiving others."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>D. God's Discipline</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 34 continues, "His master became angry and delivered him to the torturers until he would repay all that was owed."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a man who has come under God's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God delivers him to the torturers until he should repay all that he owes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verse 35 says, "So also shall My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We hope that no one would fall into God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must forgive our brother from the heart, as God has forgiven us from His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We hope all the brothers and sisters will learn to forgive all offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do not try to remember the sins of your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not ask our brother to repay us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God's children should be like God in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Since God treats us generously, He expects us to treat our brothers generously as well.</S>
