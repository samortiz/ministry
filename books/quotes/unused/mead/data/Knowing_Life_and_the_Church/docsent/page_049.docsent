   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REALIZING THAT GOD S WORK OF REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REQUIRES MAN S COOPERATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those who serve the Lord should have a basic understanding that God requires man to cooperate with Him in His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everyone who has a heart to serve the Lord should know this in a fundamental way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In creation, God created everything by Himself, and in the final act of creation, God created man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After He created man, everything was complete; man did not need to do anything or ask for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The work of creation was done by God alone, and man did not have any part in it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, in addition to His work of creation, God has the work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In creation man did not need to do anything, and he had no part in God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In redemption, however, God wants man to work together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Redemption is accomplished by a joint effort of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Just as tea-water is produced by the mingling of tea and water, redemption is accomplished by the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God did the work of creation through His own position, qualification, power, and authority; however, redemption is accomplished through the mingling and joining of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Without God, redemption could not be accomplished, but without man, redemption could not be accomplished either.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE WORK OF GOD S REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>BEING THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When our Savior accomplished redemption on the cross, did He redeem us in His status as God or in His status as man?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Is the Lord Jesus God or man?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a very important question.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must remember that every item in redemption is accomplished through the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Where did redemption begin?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It began from Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The story of Bethlehem is the story of God entering into man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Incarnation shows that God s redemption requires the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Redemption cannot be accomplished only by God Himself, and redemption cannot be accomplished only by man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Redemption can be accomplished only by God entering into man and by the mingling and joining of man with God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is certainly true to say that Jesus is God, and it is equally true to say that Jesus is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Jesus the Nazarene is the result of the mingling and joining of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When He was on the earth, His thoughts, His work, and even the direction of His footsteps were all for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His every footstep was the footstep of God with man, and His every action was the action of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to be clear that the One who was born in the manger in Bethlehem and was worshipped by man is God yet man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The One who dined in the house of the Pharisee is God yet man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The One who was crucified on the cross at Golgotha is God yet man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The story of the Gospels is the story of God s redemption through the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the brothers lead the churches or give messages, are they only in themselves?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If they are, this should be disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a brother is giving a message in himself, this is no different than the practice in Islam, Taoism, or any other religion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we give a message in the church, God should be speaking through us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In whatever we do, God should be doing it through us and God should be mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If I speak without being mingled with God, I should be cursed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was the son of Mary and the brother of James, but within He was the Word of God; He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God Himself was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the great mystery of godliness 1 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The redemption of Christ began from Bethlehem, and the significance of Bethlehem is incarnation, which is the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From the day that the Lord Jesus became flesh until now, this principle remains: God desires to enter into man and mingle Himself with man as one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we want to serve the Lord and work for Him, we must see this great and basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we serve the Lord, it is not enough to be zealous, to give some material offerings, and to pray some prayers; the basic principle of serving the Lord is to see that God does everything in redemption through the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He wants man s cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once we see this principle, we will be able to solve the following three matters.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All Work Being of God, Not of Man</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since God needs man s cooperation in His work of redemption, all work is of God, not of man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In our exercise we must seek to act according to the principle established by God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God s desire that man work together with Him has been initiated by God, not by man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God initiates His work, but it is carried out by man s cooperation with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We could never even dream that redemption requires man s cooperation and needs to pass through man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This thought is not of man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we do not see this principle, we will definitely have many deficiencies in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All works require man s cooperation with God, but no work is initiated by man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All works originate from God as the source and are carried out with the cooperation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to see this principle: All work begins with God, not with man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the source of the confusion in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The main reason Christians are divided into many denominations and sects is that many things among them have been initiated by man, not by God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The point of initiation is not God but man.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Every person who serves God should submit to Him and say, O God, although You cannot do anything without me and although You need me to work together with You, everything must originate from You, not from me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I will not move unless You move; I want to move only in Your move.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What is the difference between the church and religion?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No religion has been initiated or advanced by God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In contrast, the church is initiated and advanced by God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Religion is something conceived by man, who worships and serves God according to his thoughts about God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, the church does not come from man s thinking; rather, the church comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The church is the issue of God s moving and calling in man and of man s answering God s call.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>From the Old Testament to the New Testament, those who served God were called by God; no one served out of his own desire.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Saul, who took the way of religion, persecuted Jesus the Nazarene and was zealous in all kinds of religious activities.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then one day he saw a great light on his way to Damascus, and he heard a voice from heaven, saying, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He immediately said, Who are You, Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Acts 9:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>At this point Saul began to know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The church originates from Christ and comes out of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Religion comes from man s imagination, but the church comes from God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In religion man volunteers to serve God, but in the church man s service comes from a calling that originates from God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Lord said to Saul, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you persecute.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Saul immediately asked, What shall I do, Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Acts 22:8, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Saul did not say, I will do something for You.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If he had said this, it would have been religion.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The evil one in Isaiah 14:13-14 says, I will, but when man submits and stops his efforts, he asks, What shall I do, God?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then, like Paul, he will receive a revelation: It will be told to you what you must do Acts 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Nothing in the church comes from man s imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Rather, everything in the church should be the result of God s revelation to man, God s shining on man, God s calling of man, and God s gaining of man.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God wants to gain man because He needs man to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In the church God gains man to move with Him and to cooperate with His move.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In religion man initiates, man decides, and man works.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Although there is service, it is of man.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Today many preachers are doing man s work.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In principle, only that which is of God, is called by God, and answers God s demand is the service of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Anyone who does not serve God according to this way serves God according to his own imagination, decision, and desire.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Although these people say that they are serving God in the church, they are involved only in religious activities.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Hence, as we learn to serve God, we need to see that God s work requires our cooperation with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>No work should originate from ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The Father, Son, and the Spirit are in us.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>All work is started and must be started by the Triune God.</S>
