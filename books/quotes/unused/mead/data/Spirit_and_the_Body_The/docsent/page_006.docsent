   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOING DIRECTLY TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The tragic history of Christianity must not be repeated among us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must not insult the Lord and offend Him by not caring for His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We do not agree with any manmade decision.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everyone in the Lord's recovery must go directly to the Lord and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If anyone asked me where he should go, I would give him just one word pray.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Pray until you are clear, and then go.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not ask me or anyone else what you should do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>None of us is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only Jesus Christ is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I cannot speak on His behalf and tell you where you should go.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You must inquire of Him, "Lord, where should I go?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you do not get the Lord's leading, do not go to others and ask them to tell you what you should do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>BEING ASSURED OF THE LORD'S SENDING</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not say, as if it were a mere slogan, "I am following the flow."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The real flow is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How wrong it is to stir up a movement!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That is an insult to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is an offense to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There must never be a movement among us in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not use the word "flow" as a cloak to disguise a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When some of you speak of the flow, you actually mean a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To create a movement and then to encourage others to follow it is to make a tremendous mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Again I say, concerning any move you make in the Lord's recovery, you must go directly to the Lord Himself and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I long to see that after some months of prayer, spontaneously, without a discussion or a conference, a number will be burdened to go to Phoenix and others to certain other places.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the angels ask why you have come there, you will then be able to say, "Angels, don't you know that the Lord has sent me here?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You will have authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if you say that a certain brother has sent you there, that will mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It will have no weight whatever.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What any man says about where you should go means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You must have the assurance that the Lord is sending you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And do not say, "I have come here because I followed the flow."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps after a year you will regret that you followed the so-called flow, for you never had any assurance from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You must be able to say, "I am here because the Lord sent me here.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He asked me to come to this place and He wanted me here."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all must be clear concerning the Lord's leading to this extent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>None of us should give any instructions to others or make decisions for others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now is the time for us to have a genuine turn before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You must say, "Lord, we don't want to offend You or insult You.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We want to honor You by waiting on You for Your leading."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the Lord's recovery, not a repetition of the pitiful history of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not take orders from anyone and do not give orders to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Go to the Lord and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the proper way.</S>
