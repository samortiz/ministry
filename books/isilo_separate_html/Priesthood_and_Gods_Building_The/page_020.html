<h1 class="title">THE FLOWING OF THE RIVER<br />
OF WATER OF LIFE</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the flow of the water of life and the results of this flow.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONDITIONS FOR THE FLOWING<br />
OF THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The flow of the river of water of life depends on our being open in two directions: toward God and toward man. In order for a river to flow, it must have a source and an outlet. Every river has one of its ends open to a source and the other end open to an outlet. A river that lacks either a source or an outlet is not a river, and it will not flow. This also applies to the river of water of life in the New Jerusalem. It flows from the throne of God, meaning that God is its source; it is open to God. The river of water of life flows throughout the entire city so that no place is without water. In order for the water of life to flow in a person, there must be a thoroughfare between him and God as well as a thoroughfare between him and the other saints. This may seem obvious, but almost every Christian has a problem in this matter.</p>
<p>Some Christians are completely cut off, severed, from the source. There is a barrier between them and God. Perhaps they do not pray in order to contact God. Even if they do pray, they pray routinely and with little interest, because they are not willing to remove the barrier between them and God. Since there is not a thoroughfare between such believers and God, they do not have any fellowship in the spirit. There are other Christians who fellowship with God and are open to Him. It seems as though they are connected to the source, but they are closed toward other believers. As a result, the river of water of life cannot flow out of them. Some believers are closed because they are introverted by disposition; it is not easy for them to open to others. Some believers are closed when they are in an unfamiliar environment; it is not easy for them to open in certain situations. There are still other believers who are closed because they want to &ldquo;learn a spiritual lesson.&rdquo; These believers are not willing to show the riches that are within them. Whatever the reason may be, a believer should not be closed.</p>
<p>We must overcome all three situations. As a Christian, we should live a life that is against our natural man, that is, our natural disposition. If a person is naturally slow, God will ask him to be quick. If a person is quick by nature, God will ask him to be slow. If a person&rsquo;s natural disposition is closed and introverted, God will ask him to be open and extroverted. We often say that we should receive the breaking of our natural man. To go against being introverted is to receive the breaking of the natural man. This does not mean that a Christian should always speak; rather, it means that he should go against his natural disposition and be open to fellowship with other believers. He should preach the gospel, and in the meetings he should testify for the Lord, speak the truth, pray, and praise. In spiritual matters he must go against his disposition and be released. The natural tendency of being closed must be overcome.</p>
<p>We must overcome the situations in which we cannot open. Our spirit should be strong and uplifted; it should not be conquered or dictated by the environment. We should overcome and rule over our environment. With regard to learning spiritual lessons, we should accept the environment that has been sovereignly arranged for us, but with regard to serving the Lord by praising Him, testifying, and praying, we should rule over our environment. We should not allow the environment to rule over us. If we desire to let the river of water of life flow, we must learn to go against our natural disposition and overcome our environment.</p>
<p>Some saints have &ldquo;spiritual reasons&rdquo; for being closed. They desire to learn lessons and not display themselves. Although their motive and intention for being closed seem &ldquo;spiritual,&rdquo; the issue is that their spirit actually is restricted within them. Whether a person displays himself does not depend on his being open or closed; rather, it depends on his intention. If his intention is not to display himself but to release the spirit, others will not feel that he is showing off. Therefore, we do not need to be closed.</p>
<p>The human spirit is the purest and keenest part of man. Our motives are easily recognized by those who know how to discern the spirit. If a believer&rsquo;s motive is to show off, those who know how to discern the spirit will recognize it when he speaks. Whether or not he is showing off is not related to his speaking but to his intention and inner motive. If his intention is to put on a show and display himself, others will discern it. If his intention is to release the spirit so that the Lord may come forth, others will discern that he is not showing off. One does not become humble merely by closing his mouth but by dealing with his inner motive and intention. As a Christian, our mouth should always be open. This is not a matter of self-display. A believer who hides, regardless of the occasion, often wants others to have the impression that he is a spiritual person. He knows that he can receive more praise when his mouth is shut than when his mouth is open. We need to reject this concept. A truly humble brother can open his mouth in every situation and let the spirit come forth. Such a brother can have much utterance without any hint of displaying himself. We must overcome being closed in the name of spirituality. We must not allow our mingled spirit to be restricted; we must not restrict the Lord in us. Our prayer must be open toward God and man and connected with both God and man.</p>
<p>In order to exercise our spirit, we must be able to pray in the Lord&rsquo;s presence and with other believers. Some saints are able to pray in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, but they cannot pray with others. When they are praying by themselves, they are open, but when they pray with others, their spirit is closed. Other saints can pray with a small number of believers but not with a large number of believers. Still others can pray when they are with younger believers but not with older believers. Some sisters cannot pray if brothers are present, some saints cannot pray in the presence of the elders, and still other saints cannot pray in the presence of the co-workers. None of these situations is proper. There should not be any distinctions among us when we pray. We should be able to pray in the presence of anyone. It is not normal to be able to pray only in the presence of the Lord but not with other saints. There is also a small number of saints who can pray only when they are with others but not by themselves. They are open toward man but not toward God. We should overcome all these situations.</p>
<p>A Christian must be open both to God and to man. He cannot be open only to one and not to the other. If he is open to only one, there will be no thoroughfare within him. He must be open to both God and man. A Christian should be open even to unbelievers. He should have the feeling to preach the gospel to an unbeliever. If we are open to God and also to sinners, God will flow through us and make us a channel for the river of water of life as we preach the gospel. As a result, sinners will be saved. We should be open to sinners and especially to the brothers and sisters. We should be persons who have a thoroughfare that is completely unobstructed; we should allow God to continually pass through us in order to reach others. This is the way that the river of water of life will flow within us.</p>
<p>The basic hindrance to the flow of the river of water of life is a lack of prayer. We must spend much time in prayer. On the one hand we should pray in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and on the other hand we should pray with others. When we preach the gospel to an unbeliever, we should lead him to pray. Sometimes the saints are embarrassed to lead a gospel friend, who is well educated, to pray. Some saints dare not pray with their boss. Such problems are the issue of not having an open, strong, and released spirit. If our spirit is strong, we will lead our gospel friend to pray, no matter what his status is.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
