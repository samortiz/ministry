	 <h2 class="head3">The Revival after the War</h2>
<p>After the war was over, Shanghai and Nanking became the center of the entire country. The daily lives of the brothers and sisters returned to normal, and communications were opened between the north and the south. For five or six years we had not been able to see each other, and everything had been a difficult trial. Everyone had learned many lessons through their personal hardships. Thus, when the meetings and fellowship resumed, the brothers and sisters combined the lessons they had learned during the war with what they had known before it. There was a great turn in Shanghai and Nanking in 1947 and 1948. Not only were the meetings restored in Shanghai, but there was a revival. In 1948 there were meetings in seventeen districts in Shanghai with approximately sixteen hundred saints.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1948 several co-workers from Shanghai went to fellowship with the saints in Fukien and Canton, resulting in a turn in those places as well. When they returned to Shanghai, Brother Nee held a conference. Because the arrangements for the conference were made well in advance, saints came from the western, central, northern, and northwestern regions of China; thus, that time of fellowship can be considered a conference. For six years, from 1942 to 1948, Brother Nee had not been able to formally minister, so that conference was the resumption of his ministry. The Lord blessed the conference. Brother Nee continued his burden from the Shanghai conference at Kuling in Foochow, where he held the first co-workers&rsquo; training. The training lasted for four months. Because of the turn in Shanghai, Canton, and Fukien, in addition to the situation in the northeast, the northwest, and the north after the war, the condition of the churches was glorious. Therefore, all areas of the country experienced an atmosphere of revival; the brothers everywhere had a seeking heart and were willing to be for the Lord.</p>
<p>At the end of 1948 and the beginning of 1949 there was a revival throughout the country, which brought in an unprecedented golden age; it was not difficult for ten thousand people to be saved every month. The fire of revival, the spirit of the gospel, the zeal for the service, and even the material offerings reached unprecedented levels. There were meetings in all places with ports, train stations, and provincial councils. Soon, however, we met with a great problem&mdash;the rise of the Chinese Communist Party. We knew that the Communists would not allow religious freedom or even allow the church to exist. We had much prayer before the Lord concerning this, beseeching Him to care for and remember His church and to care for our country; however, we were not able to save the situation. In the beginning of 1949 two or three hundred brothers went to Taiwan with their government units, schools, or hospitals; some were scattered around Taipei, some were in Chiayi, and some were in Kaohsiung.</p>
<p>At that time the co-workers faced a dilemma; because we saw the situation changing before our eyes, we had to decide whether to stay in mainland China or leave. We knew that the churches in mainland China would have difficulties. If the co-workers left, how would the churches go on? This dilemma bothered us. The leading co-workers had two meetings for thorough fellowship related to this matter. Some brothers advocated leaving because of the practical situation and because we were sure that we would be dealt with by the Communists if we stayed. Others felt that if the co-workers left China, it would be a great loss to the churches. Therefore, we did not make a formal decision to stay or leave but decided that each person should follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading to stay or leave; no one would decide for another person. Many brothers and sisters left mainland China, some going to foreign countries or Hong Kong and some following the Nationalist government to Taiwan. In 1949 we foresaw the difficulties that the brothers and sisters in mainland China are facing today. However, in those two co-workers&rsquo; meetings, the leading brothers all agreed that I should go to Taiwan.</p>
<p>In April 1949 Brother Nee went to Kuling to begin the second training. Then the Communists crossed the Yangtze River. When they crossed the Yangtze River, all the co-workers were attending the training at Kuling; only Sister Ruth Lee and I were left in Shanghai. Please forgive me for saying some things about myself again. April 25, 1949, seven years ago, was my worst day in Shanghai. Nanking had already fallen to the Communists, and the Communist army had reached as far as Kun Mountain near Soochow; it seemed that Shanghai would fall very soon. I was responsible for the construction of the meeting hall in Shanghai, and although I knew how cruel the Communists were, I felt that I could not forsake my responsibility. Because Sister Ruth Lee was responsible for putting out the publications, she had a responsibility to bear. Because I had overseen the construction of the meeting hall from the beginning to the end, I had a strong burden. The building lacked only windows, plaster, and paint; the framing work was already completed. My wife asked me, &ldquo;If we women and children do not leave, we will be all right, but what will you do?&rdquo; I could only put myself into the Lord&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>On April 28 Brother Nee sent me a telegram from Foochow, telling me in a very commanding tone to turn over the construction of the meeting hall to the brothers in Shanghai and quickly come to Kuling. I was more sorrowful than I am able to express. I could only confess that it was the Lord&rsquo;s will, that He was stripping me so that I would take Him as my goal. I am human; I loved China, I loved the work in mainland China, I loved the church in Shanghai, and I loved the meeting hall in Shanghai. The location of the meeting hall in Shanghai was very good. It was more than four times larger than the meeting hall in Taipei, and it was a perfect square. It was a good place to preach the gospel because on all four sides the roads had connections to both the bus routes and the electric car routes, and it was in the center of Shanghai&rsquo;s residential district. There was a small park next to it, which looked from the window like it was our own garden. On April 29, the day after I received Brother Nee&rsquo;s telegram, I bought my ticket, and I arrived in Taiwan on April 30. From Taiwan I went to Foochow to fellowship with the brothers in Kuling and then quickly returned to Taiwan. The work also ordained at that time that some young brothers and sisters who were learning how to serve would also go to Taiwan. They came in two groups; one group arrived safely, but the other group did not. The boat on which they were sailing got as far as Wu Sung Kou, but because the boat was old and leaky, the captain was afraid that he would not make it to Taiwan; thus, he turned around and went back to Shanghai. No one in that group of brothers and sisters was able to come out of mainland China.</p>
<p>In September 1949, after the training at Kuling ended, Brother Nee returned to Shanghai to help the church there. At the beginning of the Communist takeover, most of the believers were still relatively free. After the Communists arrested Brother Nee in 1952 and accused him publicly, they went on to arrest more than one thousand leading brothers in all the localities. Thus, the churches in mainland China have been completely entrapped in difficulties and persecution; we cannot describe their sufferings in detail.</p>
