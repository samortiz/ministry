   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 19 ends in this way: "It being ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The "it" here refers to the law mentioned above.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The law was not only added because of transgressions, but was also ordained by a mediator.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are these two features to the law: it was added because of transgressions, and it was ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why was the law ordained through the hand of a mediator?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 20 explains: "But a mediator is not a mediator for one."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Have you ever been an intermediary or a go-between?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>An intermediary acts on behalf of two parties.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why does the law have a mediator?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is because with the law there is the side of God and the side of man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man has to do certain things for God before God will do certain things for man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When parties A and B draft a contract, the contract states what A must do and what B will do in return and vice versa.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A mediator will then serve as a witness between the two parties.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The law states what God's responsibility to man is and what man's responsibility to God is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If either side fails, the whole matter falls through.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What follows in verse 20 is wonderful: "But God is one."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But God is one!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The law implies two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If either side has problems, the whole matter falls through.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In giving the law, God said that we should do this and that we should do that.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we fail to do them, the whole matter will fall through.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in making the promise, "God is one," regardless of how we are.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In promise and in grace, there is no mention of our side, only of God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As long as there is no problem on God's side, there will be no problem at all.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The question today is whether God can save Abraham and whether He can preserve him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The question is not how we are.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the promise, there is nothing that involves us, nothing that depends on how we are.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The principle of the law can be compared to buying books from our gospel bookroom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If I spend 1.60, I can purchase one copy of The Spiritual Man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If I give the brothers there the money, they will give me the book.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If they have the book but I do not have the money, the transaction will not be made.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nor will the transaction be made if I have the money but they do not have the book.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If one side has a problem, the deal falls through.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the law is of two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If one side fails, the whole matter falls through.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But what about the promise?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The promise is like our magazine The Christian; one does not have to pay for it because it is free.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The law is: if you do something for me, I will do something for you in return.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you do certain things, you will get something back; if you cannot do them, you will not get anything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, the law is of two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By making a promise, God gives us the grace regardless of whether we do well or not.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It has nothing to do with us; how we are is not a problem at all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thank God that promise is of one side only.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All that is needed is one side.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 21 says, "Is then the law against the promises of God?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Absolutely not!"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those with little knowledge may say that the law contradicts grace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is right to say that law and promise are two completely different things, but there is no contradiction at all; the law is merely the servant of the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is something used by God and something inserted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Law and promise may appear contradictory in nature, but in God's hand they are not contradictory at all.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The law was used by God to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Without the law, God's promise would not have been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Please remember that God uses the law to fulfill this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, law and promise do not contradict each other at all.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul concludes in this way: "For if a law had been given which was able to give life, righteousness would have indeed been of law" v. 21 . If a man could obtain righteousness by the law, he could have life through the law.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However man cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, "the Scripture has shut up all under sin" v. 22a . What did God use to shut us all up? He used the law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whoever is shut up by the law has to admit that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God shuts up all under sin "in order that the promise out of faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe" v. 22b . Hallelujah! The law of God is something God uses to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is not something God uses to condemn us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The law is absolutely something used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Tonight every one of us here has been shut up.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Every one of us is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God has used the law to show us that we are sinners so that He may save us.</S>
