Receiving Christ is a very wonderful experience, yet it is only a beginning, only a foretaste of the riches of our Christ
Before we can enter into the reality of experiencing all the fullness of Christ, we must know the key and how to use it
We contact the physical world through the five senses of our physical body: hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and feeling
The sound is real, but if you shut your ears and attempt to exercise your eyes to see his voice, you cannot do it
Since God is Spirit, we must contact Him, worship Him, and fellowship with Him in our spirit and by our spirit
Whatever Christ is, whatever He did, and whatever He obtained and attained have all been included in this life-giving Spirit
Now this life-giving Spirit has come into us and is mingled with our spirit, thereby joining us to Him as one spirit
They do not have the eternal life of God in their spirit because they have not received Christ as the eternal life into their spirit
Now, after being saved, we have another life within us which is Christ Himself, and by this life we must learn to live
Now by turning to our spirit and exercising or using our spirit, we have the way to experience the reality of all that Christ is to us
It is apparent that we have had enough of this kind of exercise in elementary school, junior high school, senior high school, and college
We must realize that as Christians, it is not a matter of what we are going to do, but how we are going to do it
Of course, we should not think that the Lord demands that we give up the faculties of the mind, emotion, and will
We must learn never to do anything out from this fallen life again, but live entirely by the divine life which is in our spirit
From henceforth we must never take our fallen life in the soul as our source of living, but the divine life in our spirit
We need to realize that this natural, soulish life has already been put to the cross and that we must now take Christ as our life
We must also be very clear that the exercise of the spirit is not only in prayer and touching the Word of God, but in everything
To know the difference between the body and the soul is easy, but to discern the spirit from the soul is rather difficult
In all four GospelsMatthew Mark Luke and Johnthe Lord Jesus repeatedly tells us to deny the self and lose the soul with its soulish life
We must know the difference between the spirit and the soul by denying the soulish self and going along with the Lord in our spirit
