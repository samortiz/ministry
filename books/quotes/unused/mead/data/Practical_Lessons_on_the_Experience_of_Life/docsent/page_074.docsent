   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A GREAT STRUGGLE RELATED TO LIFE AND GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since Christ has been sown into us as life, there has been a great struggle between the Lord and the enemy, both around us and within us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should not think that the negative items in Matthew 13 are only there and not within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Within us are the same matters mentioned in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The enemy may have snatched away the words and messages we received concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the past two and a half years many messages about Christ as life have been ministered to you, but nearly every bit may have been snatched away by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You may listen to message after message, but after listening nothing may be left remaining in you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Or perhaps the seed sown remains, but you may be a shallow, superficial person full of rocks and stones beneath.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If this is the case, can Christ grow within you?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You may say, "Praise the Lord, I am not too shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am a deeper person."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, is there something choking you within?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Are there the cares of this life, lusts, the love of money; is there the desire to be rich, to better your life, and to uplift your standard of living?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I do not like to say these things, and I am not happy to say them, but I feel the burden to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All these things choke, so after two and a half years, where is the growth?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition, you may have friendships with imitation, artificial Christians, which may frustrate you from growing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The inner life is working within you, yet there may be an influence without that causes a struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By your experiences, you know what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, there may be leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In addition, the principle of the great tree is always within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In these days the church in Los Angeles is looking for a meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever we touch this matter, there is the temptation to have a bigger, more beautiful building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may say, "Our current building cannot attract people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This kind of building is for the poorer, lower class.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The bank managers and people with doctorate degrees will not come here."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To speak in this way is the principle of the great tree.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we say that the "poor Jesus" is not good enough to attract people, we must be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The principle of the great tree is still in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We still like to be big, to have magnificent, attractive material things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not have enough money for those things, but even if we did, we should not care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to keep the principle of the mustard seed to be little, temporary, and transient.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you feel that to sit in a nicer chair when we meet is very good, you are still in the great tree.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, what kind of meeting place did He have?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He met on the mountainside and on the seashore.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Of course, I am not legalistic, but I do not like anything with the principle of the great tree.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Shanghai, mostly under my hand, we built a meeting hall that could accommodate three thousand people inside and two thousand outside.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The brothers brought the architect to me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He asked, "Mr. Lee, what kind of design do you want for your church?" I explained it to him again and again, but he simply could not understand me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We were both speaking Chinese, but he could not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He said, "I have learned architecture.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I know how to build a law court, a restaurant, and a church, but I do not understand what kind of church you want to build."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His thought contained the principle of the great tree.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I told him to let me draw the rough design, and he could just fit it to the city codes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By cooperating in this way, we were able to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, we did not build a "church."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We simply built a big "warehouse."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we came to Taiwan, we built the first meeting hall in Taipei, hall one, in 1952.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The same thing happened again.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The architects could not understand what we wanted to build.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Again, I drew the rough design and told them to do their best to meet the requirements of the city codes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the inspector from the housing department came, he said, "Is this your church?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is just a warehouse."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I do not feel shameful about this; I feel glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the principle of the mustard seed.</S>
