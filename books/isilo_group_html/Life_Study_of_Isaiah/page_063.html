Now that we have covered twenty-three chapters of Isaiah, I would like to ask a question: What is the main thing covered in these chapters? Putting the question another way, I would ask: Have you seen the vision of God's economy concealed in these chapters? My burden in this message is that we would all see this vision.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THREE IMPORTANT MATTERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Forgiveness of Sins</H2><P>A number of important matters are covered in Isaiah 1&#151;23. For instance, 1:18 speaks concerning our being cleansed from our sins: "Come now and let us reason together,/Says Jehovah./Though your sins are like scarlet,/They will be as white as snow;/Though they are as red as crimson,/They will be like wool." This word is related to the word in 38:17: "You have cast behind Your back/All my sins." God has forgiven our sins and has cast them behind His back. Although the forgiveness of sins is wonderful, it is not the economy of God hidden in the prophecy of Isaiah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Sign of the Virgin<br>Conceiving and Bearing a Son</H2><P>Another matter of great importance is the sign in 7:14 of the virgin conceiving and bearing a son. This verse says, "Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel." This sign covers not only the past and the present but also eternity. The Bible of sixty-six books consummates in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21&#151;22), and the New Jerusalem is the aggregate of Immanuel. The sign of Immanuel consummates in the New Jerusalem&#151;the totality of God being with us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Receiving and Enjoying God as Our Salvation</H2><P>A third important matter is found in chapter twelve of Isaiah. This chapter shows us how to receive God Himself as our salvation and enjoy Him as salvation. We enjoy God as our salvation, drawing water with rejoicing from the springs of salvation, by praising the Lord, calling upon His name, crying out, and giving a ringing shout (vv. 3-4, 6). However, we may enjoy God as our salvation but still not see the vision of the economy of God hidden in the first twenty-three chapters of the book of Isaiah.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_062.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_064.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 63</div><br></body></html>
