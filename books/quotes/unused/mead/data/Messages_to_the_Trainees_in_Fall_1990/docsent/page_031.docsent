   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO BECOME SPIRITUAL PERSONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must not live in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should live in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit, and be spiritual in our whole being, including our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this reason the New Testament charges us to pray unceasingly 1 Thes 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To pray is to be "spiritualized."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more we pray, the more we become spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The New Testament also charges us to have fellowship with the Lord and with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fellowship with the Lord and with the church always makes us spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are also charged to set our mind on the spirit Rom 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is mostly accomplished by reading and pray-reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Prayer, fellowship, and getting into the Word are crucial and vital for our becoming spiritual persons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without these practices, we can never be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our mind has to be renewed Eph 4:23 , and our whole soul has to be transformed Rom 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By our constant prayer, fellowship, and reading and pray-reading of the Word, our mind will spontaneously and unconsciously be renewed from being natural to being spiritual, from being earthly to being heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Romans 12:2 Paul says, "And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When our mind is renewed, our soul will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To be transformed by the renewing of the mind is to be made spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How proper our living is depends upon how much we have been made spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Question: In Romans 8, are minding the things of the Spirit v. 5 , setting the mind on the spirit v. 6 , and being in the spirit v. 9 the same experience?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Answer: Romans 8 is not a chapter of doctrine but of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verses 9, 5, and 6 refer to our experience in three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 9 refers to our experience after regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the Spirit of God is in us, we are not in the flesh but in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 5 is the experience of practicing to be spiritual, but the experience of verse 6 comes after we have had further practice.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that point, we not only have life through regeneration, but we also have peace subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After we are regenerated, we have Christ in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we have to learn to mind the things of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, our mind will be on the spirit, and we will have life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Question: At what point do we know that we have become spiritual persons?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Answer: It is better not to know or to seek to know when we have become spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should simply be what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we feel that we are sufficiently spiritual, we are really not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Question: Romans 8:13 says, "For if you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If our putting to death the practices of the body relates to our self-control, how is it "by the Spirit"?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Answer: Verses 13 and 14 are joined by the word "for" and should be read together.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 14 says, "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Both verses refer to the same practice of putting to death the practices of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are led by the Spirit, we can put to death the practices of our body.</S>
