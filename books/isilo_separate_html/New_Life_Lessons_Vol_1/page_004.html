<p>Prayer is not based upon our condition, behavior, or anything of ourselves, but upon:</p>
<p>1. THE BLOOD OF THE LORD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus.&rdquo;</strong>  Hebrews 10:19</p>
<p>Only the <strong>blood of the Lord</strong> can satisfy God&rsquo;s righteous demands and can <strong>cleanse us</strong> that we may draw near to God with boldness.</p>
<p>2. THE NAME OF THE LORD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;If you ask Me anything in My [the Lord&rsquo;s] name, I will do it.&rdquo;</strong>   John 14:14</p>
<p>Our prayer must be in <strong>the Lord&rsquo;s name;</strong> this means that we must pray by depending on the Lord and by being <strong>joined to the Lord.</strong> Only then will we gain God Himself.</p>
<p>When we rely on the Lord&rsquo;s blood and are joined to the Lord&rsquo;s holy name, we will have a conscience void of offense. In this way our prayers will be unhindered.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Let us come forward to the Holy of Holies with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.&rdquo;</strong>  Hebrews 10:22</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE SIMPLEST WAY TO PRAY&mdash;<br />
CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>To call on the name of the Lord is:</p>
<p>1. TO CALL &ldquo;O LORD JESUS!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him. For, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 10:12-13</p>
<p>2. SPIRITUAL BREATHING</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I called upon thy name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon. Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.&rdquo;</strong> Lamentations 3:55-56</p>
<p>We breathe out our burdens, sorrows, and sins, and we breathe in the Lord&rsquo;s strength, comfort, salvation, and rest.</p>
<h2 class="head2">* HOW TO CALL</h2>
<p><strong>(1) Call out of a pure heart</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.&rdquo;</strong>  Psalm 66:18</p>
<p><strong>(2) Call with the saints</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&rdquo;</strong>  2 Timothy 2:22</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE BLESSINGS OF PRAYER</h2>
<p>There are many blessings from God to the person who prays:</p>
<p>1. PRAYERS BEING ANSWERED</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.&rdquo;</strong> Matthew 7:7</p>
<p>2. RECEIVING THE GRACE OF GOD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help.&rdquo;</strong> Hebrews 4:16</p>
<p>3. RECEIVING THE REVELATION OF GOD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him.&rdquo;</strong> Ephesians 1:17</p>
<p>4. ENJOYING THE PEACE OF GOD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But in everything, by prayer...and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</strong> Philippians 4:6-7</p>
