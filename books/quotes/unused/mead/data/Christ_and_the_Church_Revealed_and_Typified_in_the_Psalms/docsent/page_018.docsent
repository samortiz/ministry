   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE CHRIST RESURRECTED, THE SHEPHERD, AND THE COMING KING Psalms 22:22 to Psalm 24 Scripture Reading: Psa 22:22-31; 23 24 PSALM 22:22-31 CHRIST IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have seen, the first part of Psalm 22 depicts the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now the last part of this Psalm speaks of the resurrection of Christ in a marvelous way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word "resurrection" is not used in the passage, but the fact of resurrection is indicated clearly and definitely.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 22 says, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates a sudden change in the trend of this Psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The situation in the previous verses is full of intense suffering and sadness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then suddenly He says, "I will declare thy name."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that He was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After His resurrection, He said, "I will declare thy name the name of the Father unto my brethren."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This verse is quoted in Hebrews 2:12, by which we see that it is a prophecy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus, after His resurrection, told Mary, "Go to my brethren" John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then, again, in Matthew 28:10, He said, "Go tell my brethren."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before His death, the Lord Jesus never called the disciples His brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because by His resurrection all His disciples were regenerated 1 Pet 1:3 and made the sons of God; thus, they all became His brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The New Testament tells us that on one hand the Lord Jesus is the only begotten Son of God John 3:16 , but on the other hand that He is the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before His resurrection, the Lord Jesus was the only begotten Son; but after His resurrection, the only begotten Son became the firstborn Son, for at that time all His believers were regenerated and became His brethren, the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The only begotten Son became the firstborn Son, the firstborn of many brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"That he might be the firstborn among many brethren."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we have a hint of the church: "I will declare thy name unto my brethren."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All His brethren are the members of His Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then Psalm 22:22 continues, "In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the Old Testament rendering.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the quotation of this verse in Hebrews, the word "congregation" is rendered differently to read "church."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"In the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee" 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here we have the church, and we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all must believe that Christ today as the resurrected Lord is among us, and that He is singing among us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we sing, He sings within our singing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is in resurrection, and He has many brethren to be His church, His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now He is in the church, singing praise to the Father, and He asks us to praise the Father: "Ye that fear the Lord, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him" v. 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From verse 26 to the end of this Psalm there are some things which are difficult for many to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if you pray-read this section again and again, looking unto the Spirit, you will see that it describes the result of His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The result is fivefold: firstly, the meek and the prosperous shall "eat and be satisfied" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>26, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is so good.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are the eating people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Day by day we are eating in His resurrection; so we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then, because we are satisfied, we worship.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The worldly people and even some Christians do not understand what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are the meek ones, and they are the proud ones; we are the truly prosperous ones, but they are the miserable ones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The meek and the prosperous ones of this earth shall eat, be satisfied, and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The second aspect is in verse 27: "All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is really so.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the ends of the earth, especially today, do remember the Lord, turn to Him, and worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The third aspect is seen in verse 29: "All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and he that cannot keep alive his own soul."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This corresponds with Philippians 2, where we read that all things in heaven, in earth, and under the earth shall bow before Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Praise the Lord, we are the living ones, but the Bible tells us that even the dead shall bow before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow, because Christ was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The fourth aspect of the result of Christ's resurrection is in verse 28: "For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he rules over the nations."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ is the King ruling over the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have not seen this with our eyes; but one day we will see it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It seems that Satan is ruling today, but with heavenly revelation we can see through to the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ is the King.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Kingdom is the Lord's, and He rules over the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do you believe the present situation, or do you believe the Word of God?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Praise the Lord, we do believe the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The fifth point concerns the Gospel preaching: "A seed shall serve him; it shall be told concerning the Lord to the coming generation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No doubt this refers to the believers; the believers are the seed of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We shall tell the coming generation; we shall declare His righteousness, justification, salvation, to a people yet to be born; and we will tell them that the Lord has done this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the Gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The five aspects of the result of the death and resurrection of Christ are these.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We cannot at this time go into these matters thoroughly; I have simply indicated the lines with all the points to you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I trust in you and I trust in the Holy Spirit that you will take time to pray-read these verses to gain something more.</S>
