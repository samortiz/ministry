   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RIVER FLOWING TOWARD THE EAST SEA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ezekiel 47:8 says that the river flows toward the East Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the map, the East Sea is the Salt Sea or the Dead Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By the flowing of the river out of the house, the salt water of the Dead Sea will be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that death will be swallowed up by life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When there is a rich and deep flow of life in a local church, much death will be swallowed up by life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, if there is no flow in a particular church, that church will become a dead sea full of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But if there is the flow of the river, deadness is swallowed up by life, and then the dead sea will be made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE RIVER BEING UNABLE TO HEAL THE MARSHES</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although the Dead Sea and the dry places can be made alive and deadness can be swallowed up by life, the marshes cannot be healed v. 11 . A marsh is a place that is neither dry nor flowing with water.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Consisting partly of mud and partly of water, a marsh is neither wet nor dry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A marsh signifies a situation that is full of compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that wherever there is a compromising situation, there is a marsh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should never become involved with any situation that is a marsh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus rebuked the church in Laodicea for being lukewarm and neither hot nor cold.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He told those in Laodicea that they should be either hot or cold but not lukewarm.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He also said that if they remained lukewarm, He would spew them out of His mouth Rev 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be lukewarm is to be in a compromising situation, to be in a marsh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our stand concerning the church must be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you stand in a denomination, you should stand absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you stand with an independent group, you should stand with that group absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you stand on the ground of the church, you must stand absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You should be either cold or hot, but you should not be lukewarm.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be lukewarm is to be in a marsh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you give up the denominations and the independent groups yet are not absolute for the proper ground of the church, you are in a marsh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is possible for one to be in the church life without being absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such a person is a marsh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not even the Lord can heal a marsh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A marsh is a neutral place, a halfway place, a place of compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Certain saints are neither in Babylon nor in Jerusalem but in a halfway place between Babylon and Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that they are in a marsh and even that they are a marsh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need either to be absolutely in the flow or stay on dry ground.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we remain in a marshy or muddy situation, the Lord cannot do anything with us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is very easy to get into a marsh, but it is very difficult to get out of one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church must be in a place of absoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, for the church life we need to be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church should also be a place after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Genesis 1:11-12 says that the grass, the trees, and the herbs brought forth each after its own kind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>An apple tree cannot bring forth an apple-peach.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To bring forth an apple-peach, that is, for something not to be after its kind, is to be a marsh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A man must be a man and a woman must be a woman; no one can be a man-woman.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you are in a denomination, be there after your kind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you are in an independent group, be there after your kind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Likewise, if a group of saints in a certain locality are the church in that locality, they must be the church after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you are in the Lord s recovery, be in the recovery absolutely, not halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Come back all the way from Babylon to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you stop halfway, you will become a marsh, and you will not have any flow, not even a trickle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, you will have just enough water to make you muddy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You will be a marsh, and a marsh cannot be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Throughout all my years in the Lord s recovery, I have never seen a marsh that was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Revelation 22:11 the Lord Jesus says, Let him who does unrighteousness do unrighteousness still; and let him who is filthy be filthy still; and let him who is righteous do righteousness still; and let him who is holy be holy still.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Here we see that the Lord Jesus desires and requires absoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must learn to be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By being absolute we will be in the flow, and the flow will not be a trickle but a river to swim in. Then everything shall live where the river comes.</S>
