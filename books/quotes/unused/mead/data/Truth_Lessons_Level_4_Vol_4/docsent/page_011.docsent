   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Who Have Died through All the Generations,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Signified by the Ten Virgins,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rising Up from the Dead</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Lord Jesus returns, the believers will be of two classes, signified by the numbers two in Matthew 24 and ten in Matthew 25.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The totality of the believers is signified by the number twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because the two men and two women are working 24:40-41 , they represent the believers who will be alive when the Lord returns.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The ten virgins, on the contrary, were asleep 25:1, 5 , indicating that the majority of the believers will have died by the time the Lord returns.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the Lord returns, the majority of the believers, who have died through all the generations, as signified by the ten virgins, will rise up from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Matthew 25:1 says, At that time the kingdom of the heavens will be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The believers are like pure virgins, bearing the Lord s testimony the lamp in the dark age and going out of the world to meet the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The lamps in Matthew 25:1 signify the spirit of the believers Prov 20:27 , which contains the Spirit of God Rom 8:16 as the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The believers shine with the light of the Spirit of God from within their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, they become the light of the world, like a lamp shining in the darkness of this age Matt 5:14-16; Phil 2:15-16 to bear the testimony of the Lord for the glorification of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The virgins went forth to meet the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This signifies that the believers are going out of the world to meet the coming Christ as the Bridegroom, as the most pleasant and attractive person John 3:29; Matt 9:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord promised to come quickly, but nearly two thousand years have passed, and still He delays His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because of this delay the virgins became drowsy and slept 25:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Becoming drowsy signifies becoming sick Acts 9:37; 1 Cor 11:30 , and going to sleep signifies dying 1 Thes 4:13-16; John 11:11-13 .</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Go forth to meet him!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Midnight signifies the darkest time of this dark age night .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That will be the end of this age, the time of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The cry signifies the voice of the archangel 1 Thes 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their own lamps Matt 25:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Arose signifies resurrection from the dead 1 Thes 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the resurrection predicted in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 and 1 Corinthians 15:52.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After the virgins arose, they trimmed their lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This signifies the virgins dealing with the testimony in their living and indicates that after their resurrection, the believers still need to deal with the Lord s testimony in their living.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Matthew 25:2 says that five of the virgins were foolish and five were prudent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Five is composed of four plus one, signifying that man signified by four is added with God signified by one to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Five virgins being foolish and five being prudent does not indicate that half the believers are foolish and the other half are prudent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It indicates that all believers bear the responsibility to be filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
