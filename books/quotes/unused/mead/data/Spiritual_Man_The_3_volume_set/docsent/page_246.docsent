   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN'S DUTY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When a believer is regulated by a life of feeling, he neglects his duty towards others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A life of feeling has self as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, it cannot be concerned with the needs of others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A believer must have the faith and the will to carry out his duty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Responsibility has no regard for feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our duty towards others is fixed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our duty towards our work is also fixed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These cannot change according to how we feel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A duty must be performed according to principles; it cannot change according to how we feel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a believer merely understands a truth in his feeling, he will not carry out his duty.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is so happy during his time of fellowship with the Lord; therefore, he is desirous of such times.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When a believer has experienced the happiness of a pleasant feeling, his greatest temptation is to be alone with the Lord to enjoy this happiness throughout the day, without taking care of all the other things around him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He dislikes his work because temptations and difficulties in his work are inevitable.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He feels that he is so holy and victorious when he is face to face with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, once he performs his daily duties, he finds himself just as defeated and filthy as before.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, he wants to escape from his duties in the hope of being able to stay in the Lord's presence so that he can be holy and victorious for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He considers his duties as worldly things which he, as a holy and victorious person, should not be concerned with.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is very desirous of a time and place to have fellowship with the Lord, but he detests his duties because they frustrate his happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He does not care for the need and welfare of others because he seeks after a time and place to fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Parents who bear this attitude fail to take good care of their children; likewise, slaves fail to serve their master faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To them these things are worldly, and it is all right not to care about them since they are seeking after something more spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The reason for this is that the believer is not yet living by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, he is still after "self-nourishment."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since he is not yet fully in union with God, he can only commune with God at a particular time and in a particular place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He has not learned to look to the Lord by faith in all things and work together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He still does not know how to be in union with the Lord in the trivial matters of daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His experiences of God have been confined solely to the feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, he loves to pitch a tent on the mountain and dwell with the Lord for a long time, but he does not want to come down from the mountain to cast the demons out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Believers should know that the highest life of a Christian can never contradict the duties of his human living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we read the Epistles to the Romans, Colossians, and Ephesians, we can see how a believer must fulfill his human duties.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The highest life of a Christian is not expressed only at a particular time or a particular place.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If so, this life would be rather ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, it can be fully expressed at any time and in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It makes no difference whether one is doing housework, preaching, or praying.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The life of Christ can be manifested in every kind of activity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All our dissatisfaction over our present position and all our reluctance to perform the duties associated with this position are the result of living by our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We resist because the happiness we desire is not found in these things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, our life is not for happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>So why do we seek happiness?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The life of feeling requires us to disregard our duties.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The life of faith is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our love for God does not require us to forsake our duties towards our friends and our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are in union with God in all things, we know what our proper duties towards every person are and how to fulfill them.</S>
