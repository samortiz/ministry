   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. TO KNOW CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To be a co-worker or an elder, first, we must know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Philippians 3:10 Paul spoke about knowing Christ and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To know Christ is not a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I want to fellowship with you concerning how to know Christ mainly in four items.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The co-workers and elders must know these items.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not only must you know them, but also you must know them thoroughly and be able to speak them to others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To know Christ is not to know Him in a common way but to know Him in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The riches of what Christ is, are unsearchable Eph 3:8 , but among them, there are the four following items which we need to know in particular.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. He Is Both God and Man</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, we must know particularly that Christ is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not think that we already know this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to be reminded again and again that Christ is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was God and He became man, so He is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, He is a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>B. He Possesses Both Divinity and Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, we need to know that since Christ is a God-man, He possesses both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some may say, "We also know this already."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Maybe we know, but we do not know how to speak it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Concerning the divinity and humanity of Christ, we must have a thorough knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>C. In His Humanity He Accomplished His Judicial Redemption through His Death</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Third, we have to know that in His humanity Christ accomplished His judicial redemption through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To know Christ, we have to discern clearly that His being in His humanity is one thing and His being in His divinity is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Concerning the redemption of Christ, the general saying is that Christ was a man with blood and flesh, so He could die for us in His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The deeper way, however, is to say that Christ accomplished redemption in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not remain only in the general saying; this is an indication that our knowledge concerning Christ is not deep enough.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must penetrate the deepest part of the divine truth to see the intrinsic significance of Christ in His humanity.</S>
