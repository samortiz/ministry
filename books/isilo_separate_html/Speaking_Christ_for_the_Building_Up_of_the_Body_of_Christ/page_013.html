<p>In order to be the speaking ones in our meetings, we must also accumulate the experiences of Christ. From Philippians 3:8-10 and 12-14, we can see that Paul was accumulating the experiences of Christ day after day. Paul was pursuing Christ. The Greek word for <em>pursue</em> in Philippians 3 is <em>dioko,</em> which is also the word for <em>persecute.</em> Before he was saved, Paul persecuted Christ. After being saved, Paul continued to persecute Christ in a positive sense. He would not let the Lord go; he pursued Christ to the uttermost. Because he sought after Christ in such a way, he accumulated the experiences of Christ continually. All day long Paul was enjoying the addition of these experiences. This is why Paul had so much to say about Christ. Many times when we come to the meetings, we do not have much experience of Christ as a base, or a foundation, for our speaking. We are short of experiences. We can speak the word, but our speaking of the word needs a backing, and this backing is our real experience of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KEEPING A RICH STORAGE OF THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD</h2>
<p>We also must keep a rich storage of the Lord&rsquo;s word (Col. 3:16; John 15:7; 1 John 2:14). If we would just practice to pray-read two to four verses from the Word every morning, and we do this week after week and month after month, we will gain a rich storage of the living word. The word will not just be in our memory but it will be something stored within us. Many riches of the word of God and of Christ will be stored richly within us. The riches of Christ are embodied in the holy Word. This is what makes the Bible different from all the other books. I have been reading the Bible for many years, but the more I read it, the more riches I receive. We have the same experience whenever we read the publications of the ministry that expound the Bible in the way of life. The more that we abide in the word, the more light we receive.</p>
<p>We need to dwell upon the word every day. The best time is in the morning, and the best way is to pick up two to four verses from a specific book of the New Testament. Do not pick up two verses in the morning in a random way. Do not choose the verses that fit your taste. Instead pick a book of the New Testament and pray-read your way through it, verse by verse. If you want to start with Philippians, you can begin with verses 1 and 2 of the first chapter: &ldquo;Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The first word of verse 1, &ldquo;Paul,&rdquo; is very rich. We can pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus&mdash;Paul! I want to be a Paul today.&rdquo; Then we can go on to speak, &ldquo;Paul and Timothy.&rdquo; &ldquo;O Lord, not only Paul but also Timothy. Hallelujah! Paul and Timothy! Thank You for the Pauls in the church life today and the younger Timothys.&rdquo; Every single word of the Bible is good. We can read it, pray it, and speak it to the Lord and to ourselves. How rich the phrases &ldquo;slaves of Christ Jesus&rdquo; and &ldquo;to all the saints&rdquo; are! Every word in the Bible is so meaningful. When we come back to these verses in Philippians again with an open and empty spirit, we will receive more light. We may say, &ldquo;Lord, thank You that this is Paul and not Saul. It is not the natural Saul but the regenerated Paul.&rdquo; Every time we come to the Word in a proper way, we will receive some fresh points from the Lord.</p>
<p>When we exercise our spirit to read the Bible, the Spirit within our spirit reacts and echos with something. The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation (1 Cor. 2:10). In this way, verse after verse and phrase after phrase from the Bible can be stored within us, and we can keep a rich storage of the Lord&rsquo;s word. When we come to any meeting or meet with anyone, it will be easy for us to speak, and we will have the material to release because we have the experiences of Christ and the riches of the holy word accumulated and stored within us. This will strengthen and enrich our speaking and even encourage us to speak.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
