<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Two</H2><P>Greetings in love to the beloved brother in the Lord,</P><P>Mr. Chang Kuang Jung:</P><P>It has been three months since we parted! Thank the Lord! In the days that have passed, the Lord's hand has upheld me and enabled me to stand firm. At times He has even used me to give a small testimony. Although I am very foolish, the Lord is happy to entrust me with a little of His messages here and there. Therefore, I dare not turn my back on the responsibility that the Lord has given me. I can only trust Him, on the one hand, while moving diligently forward, on the other. Brother, please pray earnestly for me because the work of the enemy is especially fierce both in my body and environment. There is no help for me other than from the Lord now. But the Lord's hand is eternally firm. Since He began the work, He will also finish it. Therefore, my heart is still at peace through faith.</P><P>Mr. Chang, I will now tell you some news about Wenchow. The meeting in Wenchow has had a lot of problems from the very beginning. It is a sad story. I am sure that you heard of it long ago, so I will not repeat it here. Thank the Lord! The dark clouds of the past have all passed away. Although man failed, God will never fail. Man can steal his way into the flock, but the Lord's sheep can discern the shepherd's voice from the stranger's. Therefore, beginning last spring, the brothers left the old Bible study place in Chu Kuan Lane and have rented another meeting place at Sha Mao Ho. The Lord really has given us a new beginning. About seventy percent of the ones who were in the old Bible study group did not come over. Although there are not many people, the condition is very pure. Now there are twenty people who break bread together, and they all love the Lord in one accord. On the fourteenth of last month, Brother Ts'ai Ch'i and I were led by the Lord to Wenchow to meet with them for eight days. In this meeting, we saw their zeal, piety, and love. It really moved our hearts. The worries the brothers had regarding the work in Wenchow can now be turned into praises.</P><P>We also thank the Lord that He has given us a co-worker in Wenchow. There is a brother named P'an Huo Ling who used to be a useful pastor in the China Inland Mission. In recent years he has read many of the publications put out by the Gospel Book Room, and he has been enlightened by the truth. He did not feel peace in his heart about being a hired pastor in the denominations, so he was willing to leave the denominations and follow the Lord to suffer outside the camp. His wife is very much in one accord. Now they have already moved out of the mission and are renting a house at 36 Hsing Kung Ti at T'ieh Ching Lan. Brother P'an completely relies on the Lord for his living. Please pray for this brother. Ask the Lord to bless his life and work so that he can glorify the Lord much. I will tell you the rest next time! Peace in the Lord.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Chen Chin Fa<br>May 4, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTER TO ANNOUNCE A CONFERENCE OF "PURSUIT"</H2><P>Why are we, the church in Ning Hai, in such desolation? Why are the common believers so lacking in the growth in life? Why are the co-workers so weak and without the power of the Spirit in this work? Why are the meetings in every place so cold and scattered? It is because we understand only a little about our salvation. We only ask for peace and blessings for ourselves (both for now and in the future), but we have never taken up the cross to pursue that for which God has called us.</P><P>We now ask the Lord to give us a conference of "pursuit" from the sixth until the sixteenth of the sixth month of the Chinese calendar. We have invited a brother who is after the Lord's will and who has given up all for the Lord, David Hsu, to be at the meeting. He will lead us deeper into Christ. All the co-workers in the Lord and whoever has been regenerated and desires to pursue the truth may come to the conference.</P><P>The fifteenth day of the sixth month will be a time of baptism. Other matters, concerning bringing mosquito netting, bedding, and eating utensils, are the same as in years past, so I will not go into detail here. We hope that saints everywhere can pray much for this conference of pursuit. May the Lord give you peace in your way.</P><P>Your brother in the Lord,<br>Hua Shih Pin</P>
