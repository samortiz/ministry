   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE CHRIST OPENS THE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO THE TREE OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Gen 3:22-24; Heb 4:12, 14-16; 10:19-20 THE REQUIREMENTS OF GOD S GLORY,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GOD S RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND GOD S HOLINESS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FULFILLED BY THE DEATH OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 3:22-24 says, And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever: therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So he drove out the man: and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Cherubim signify the glory of God Heb 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The requirement of the glory of God closes the way to the tree of life from fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sword signifies judgment by God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to fulfill God s righteousness; otherwise, we are under the judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Fire signifies God s holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The requirements of God s glory, God s righteousness, and God s holiness kept fallen man from the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Until these requirements could be fully met, the way to the tree of life could never be open to fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hebrews 4:14-16 says, Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For we do not have a high priest who is not able to sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tried in all respects like us, yet without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In these three verses, there is Christ as the High Priest ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second, this ascended Christ can sympathize with our weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although He is in the heavens and we are on this earth, He can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Third, in verse 16 we are charged to come to the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 14 tells us that Christ, who is on the throne of grace, is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How then can we come to the throne of grace in the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before we solve this problem, let us read verses 12 and 13 of chapter four: For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And there is no creature that is not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we are accountable.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hebrews 10:19-20 says, Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In these verses we are told that we have the boldness to enter the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The throne of grace is equivalent to the mercy seat in the Holy of Holies Exo 25:17, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, to come to the throne of grace means to come into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We enter into the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have seen that the tree of life is nothing less than God Himself in His Trinity presented to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But due to the fall of the human race, man became sinful and the way to the tree of life was closed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man had fallen short of the glory of God Rom 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man was also under the condemnation of God s righteousness, and man was against God s holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s desire was still that man would enjoy Him as the tree of life, but His glory, His righteousness, and His holiness kept fallen man away from the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No fallen man can get through these three items the cherubim, the slaying sword, and the flaming fire.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If man is going to eat the tree of life, he has to fulfill the requirements of God s glory, God s righteousness, and God s holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, man s fallen condition, man s sin, has to be solved, has to be taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, all the requirements of God s glory, God s righteousness, and God s holiness have to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Otherwise, there is no way for human beings to eat the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Where is the tree of life?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The tree of life is in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How could a sinful person get through the outer court, enter into the Holy Place, and pass through the inner veil into the Holy of Holies to eat the tree of life?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the altar in the outer court, the sacrifices dealt with the fallen condition and the sins of man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The altar typifies the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the cross, not only was sin dealt with, but also the veil was rent Heb 10:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the second veil 9:3 within the tabernacle, which typifies the flesh of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When Christ s flesh was crucified, this veil was rent Matt 27:51 , thus opening the way for us who were excluded from God, signified by the tree of life Gen 3:22-24 , to enter into the Holy of Holies to contact Him and take Him as the tree of life for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ, the eternal all-inclusive sacrifice, died on the cross, on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He fulfilled all the requirements of God s righteousness, God s holiness, and God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By His death, Christ opened the way for us to eat God as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is why Christ told us in John 14 that He had to go to prepare a place for us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Gospel of John tells us that the Word who was God became flesh 1:14 , and this is the Christ, the Messiah v. 41 , the One who is the life 14:6 , the light 8:12 , the food 6:35 , the drink 7:37-38 , the air 20:22 , the shepherd 10:11 , the door 10:1 , and so many other items.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How could Christ be so many things to us?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have sin within, and we commit sins without.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If Christ is going to impart Himself to us as so many things, He has to solve the problem of sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God s glory, righteousness, and holiness would not allow Him to impart Himself to such sinful persons.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, Christ had to fulfill the requirements of God s glory, righteousness, and holiness through His death on the cross.</S>
