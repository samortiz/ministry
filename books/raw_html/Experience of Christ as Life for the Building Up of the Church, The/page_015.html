<P>In the following portion of John 14, the Lord went on to say that another Comforter would come to abide within the disciples. This chapter reveals that the second One, the Son, is one with the first One, the Father, and the third One, the Spirit, is one with the second One, the Son. In verse 17 the Lord said to the disciples that "He [the Spirit of reality] abides with you and shall be in you." Then in the next verse He said, "I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you." "He" and "I" are interchangeably used here. This means "He" is "I" and "I" is "He." In other words, the third One, the Spirit, is the second One, Christ. Christ who was in the flesh went through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit.</P><P>The Lord said, "I am coming to you." This coming was fulfilled on the day of His resurrection. After His resurrection the Lord came back to His disciples to be with them forever, thus not leaving them as orphans. John 20 tells us how He came back to His disciples. The disciples were in a room with all the doors shut because they were afraid of the Jews. Suddenly Jesus appeared and stood in their midst (v. 19). He breathed into His disciples and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (v. 22). Then He disappeared from their physical sight, but He had entered into their spirit. The resurrected Jesus as the Spirit who gives life was in the spirit of all the disciples.</P><P>Thus, regardless of where the disciples went, He was with them. When Peter told the disciples that he was going fishing, going back to his old occupation, they followed him (John 21:3). The Lord also was with them because He had entered into their spirit. Today, of course, it is the same with us. If we go to the meeting, the Lord comes with us with joy. But if we go to the movies, He goes with us in sorrow. You can never get away from Jesus within you. Once He gets in you, you may want to divorce Him, but He will never divorce you. The Triune God has dispensed Himself as life into our spirit, and our spirit is now His dwelling place (Eph. 2:22).</P><P>In 2 Corinthians 13:14 Paul expressed his desire for the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit to be with us all. These are three aspects of one thing. Love is the source, grace is the course, and fellowship is the flow. God the Father is in Christ the Son, Christ the Son is realized as God the Spirit, and God the Spirit is within us. Today this wonderful Triune God, who is ultimately and consummately the life-giving Spirit, is in our spirit. The Lord is within your spirit (2 Tim. 4:22).</P><P>At the conclusion of the Bible, we see that out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, flows a river of water of life (Rev. 22:1). God the Father is within God the Son as the Lamb, and out of the throne of this Lamb-God flows God the Spirit as the river of water of life. This is a full picture of the Triune God flowing out and flowing into us as our life. By this flowing we are being transformed and built up. At the conclusion of the entire Bible, the river of water of life flows out of the Lamb-God throughout the entire city composed of all the Old Testament redeemed saints and all the New Testament believers. The twelve names of the twelve tribes on the twelve gates represent the Old Testament saints (Rev. 21:12), and the twelve names of the twelve apostles on the twelve foundations represent the New Testament believers (v. 14). Thus, the city is a composition of all the redeemed ones throughout all the generations. They are composed together as gold, pearls, and precious stones by the flowing of the living water.</P>
