   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 13:"Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The lesson here is still to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord told them to watch, showing that all the virgins had life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord did not say to the virgins that they needed to be born again to obtain salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 10 those who were ready went in with Him to the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be ready is to be watchful; hence, the two are together.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be ready is to have no unfinished business.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Every day a ready person is prepared to hand over his business.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A watchful person is one who sees His coming and is therefore always ready.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We believers should be those who can hand over everything every day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For us, the Lord can come any day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The five foolish virgins were ready and watchful in the beginning, but they did not persevere.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Readiness is related to the unfinished business in our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Watchfulness is related to the imminent coming of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be ready, to be watchful, and to wait requires the strength that comes from the infilling of the Holy Spirit, the second kind of oil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One cannot trust in his self.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The self quickly becomes weak and confused.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order for our watchfulness to last, we must depend on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The filling of the Holy Spirit will automatically issue forth in good works, the fruits that glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who are truly watchful always feel that they are not fully ready; they do not trust in themselves and are willing to follow humbly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brothers and sisters, it is of no benefit to equip ourselves with prophecy if we are not watchful and ready.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Would it not be a great loss if we have the knowledge of prophecy today yet suffer loss in the future?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Get ready!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord wants to see our lamps and our light.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Watch!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No one knows the day or the hour.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the day and the hour were known, there would be no need to watch.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In chapters twenty-four and twenty-five there are five instances where it is said that no one knows the day of the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This repetition is to stress its importance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not rely on being caught up after the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord does not reveal the day of His coming because He wants us to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verses 14-30:The parable of the talents, from verse 14 through verse 30, can be divided into four sections: a the distribution of the Lord's talents vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>14-15 ; b the ways the slaves used their talents vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>16-18 ; c the judgment of the first and second slaves vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>19-23 ; and d the judgment of the third slave vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>24-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to understand this parable, we must first understand the difference between our relationship 1 with God and 2 with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Otherwise, it will be difficult to understand the Bible clearly, and we will encounter many difficulties and contradictions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before God we are children, and before the Lord we are servants, or slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are children by faith, and we are servants by works.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In grace we are children and in responsibility we are slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are children because of the Son and we are slaves because of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This passage concerns the relationship between the slaves and the Lord, not the relationship between the children and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From 25:14 on, the Gospel of Matthew no longer deals with the relationship between the children and the Father, which is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, it deals with the relationship between the Lord and His slaves, which lasts until the end of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The relationship with the Father has to do with salvation and eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The relationship with the Son has to do with victory and reward.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The parable of the talents concerns the reward, not eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The question of eternity has already been resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are basic differences between the New Testament and the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Old Testament we must labor before we can gain life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That is, we must first be slaves; then we can be children.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, in the New Testament we must first possess life, and then we work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that we must be regenerated first; then we become slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God does not desire the fleshly service of His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verse 14:"For the kingdom of the heavens is just like a man about to go abroad, who called his own slaves and delivered to them his possessions."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The phrase "the kingdom of the heavens" is not in the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The original text reads, "It is like a man."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This "man" is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The term "abroad" refers to a foreign country, one that is not in this world and is different from any country on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our citizenship is of that country Phil 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"About to go abroad" refers to the Lord's ascension Heb 9:24; 1 Pet 3:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>"Called his own slaves."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>From this we know that this cannot refer to the Jews, because the Jews are not slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Neither can it refer to the unsaved, for they are not the Lord's own purchased slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Formerly, Abraham circumcised his son and his purchased slaves according to God's covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today our position is both as children reborn and as slaves purchased by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord wants us to serve Him as His slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There are two extreme views today in the church: one emphasizes works instead of faith; the other emphasizes faith instead of works.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>"Delivered to them his possessions."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Because the man was going to travel abroad, he delivered his possessions to his slaves that he might test them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A servant may be faithful while in the presence of his lord, but his faithfulness is genuine only when it is maintained in the absence of his lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The man's delivering of his possessions to them indicated that he expected them to manage his possessions for him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The situation is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We serve an invisible Lord who has delivered His possessions to us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This parable is different from that in Luke 19:13, where it says, "Do business until I come."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Here the Lord did not tell us specifically what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Rather, He wants us to seek His will and to accomplish it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Only those who are able to discern and accomplish His will are qualified for the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The real test lies in the fact that the slaves are not told what to do.</S>
