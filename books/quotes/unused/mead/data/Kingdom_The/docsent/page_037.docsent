   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO TREES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is of tremendous importance to realize that at the very beginning there were two trees the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The tree of life signifies God, and the tree of knowledge signifies Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man took the tree of knowledge into him, meaning that Satan entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Satan, as sin personified, is now inside of man Rom 7:8, 11, 17, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After coming into man, Satan began to saturate him, poison him, and take full possession of him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, man became corrupted and darkened.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be darkened and corrupted by Satan means to be placed under the authority of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man became a citizen in Satan's kingdom, subject to the rule of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everyone born of man is likewise a citizen in Satan's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every human being is subject to Satan by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, men steal, fight, and kill.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the kingdom of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the totality of the satanic life with all its activities.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day Jehovah-plus came.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God was incarnated as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's desire is to come into man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, He comes into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From that point on, God grows within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's growth in us means that He is spreading within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more God grows, the more He spreads, and the more ground He occupies within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more ground He occupies, the more He reigns.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The kingdom is God's divine reign in us through the inward growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The kingdom of God is God being life to us, spreading in us, occupying the ground in us, and reigning over our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>TWO SPIRITS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are two kingdoms, and there are two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John 4:24 shows that God is a Spirit, and Ephesians 2:2 reveals that Satan, the ruler of the authority of the air, is also a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This evil spirit is working in every human being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word "working" is a strong word in Greek, and some versions render it as "operating."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Satan is operating, working, with a definite purpose in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In every human being there is a satanic operator, the spirit who works in the sons of disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>People may talk about freedom, liberty, and independence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everyone likes to be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, not one fallen person is independent, because he is under the operation of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE RULER OF THIS WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Matthew 12:26 indicates that Satan has a kingdom, and John 12:31 describes Satan as the ruler of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Satan is not only the operator; he is the ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He rules the whole earth, and he has many subordinates, many ranks, under him, which Ephesians 6:12 describes as rulers and authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These are some of the various ranks in Satan's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is the ruler of this world, and he is also the ruler of the authority of the air.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the earth there is the human race, and in the air there are the rebellious angelic powers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Satan's kingdom is composed of the fallen human race and the rebellious angels.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the earth, the fallen human race are the citizens of the kingdom of Satan; in the air, the rebellious angelic powers and principalities rule this earth for Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is the ruler of the authority of the air.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Satan, as the evil spirit, has come into every human being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He operates in every human being without exception.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By being such an operator, he has produced a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Satan now dwells in man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you have ever had the experience of casting out demons, you know that the demons like to take the human body as their dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From his base of operation in the body, Satan will attempt to control the person's whole being his mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A demon-possessed person is always very much in his mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you can turn him from the prison of his mind to the spirit, the demon, for the most part, will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, it is difficult to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, you must cast out the demon by the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After the demon has been driven out, you must help this person turn to his spirit and not to exercise his mentality too much.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Otherwise, the demons may return to possess him once more.</S>
