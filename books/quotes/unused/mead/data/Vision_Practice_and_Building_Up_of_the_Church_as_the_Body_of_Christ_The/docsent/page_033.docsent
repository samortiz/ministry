   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 4:24 says, And put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many things are implied by this item alone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the entire book of Ephesians, the new man is not merely an individual who has been regenerated and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, the new man is the entire Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 15 and 16 of chapter 2 show us that the new man is the Body, which includes Christ as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the new man is the mystery of godliness, and it is the new creation 1 Tim 3:16; 2 Cor 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To put on the new man is to put on Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to put off the old man and put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not live in the old way according to the old concept.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to live in the church according to Christ and by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>BEING RENEWED IN THE SPIRIT OF OUR MIND</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>AS THE SECRET TO ALL THE ABOVE EXPERIENCES</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ephesians 4:23 says, And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This one matter alone requires many messages to adequately cover it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To be renewed in the spirit of the mind is the secret to all the other points.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are not renewed in the spirit of our mind, we cannot put off the old man and put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why the apostle put this word between verses 22 and 24.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Between the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man there is the renewing in the spirit of the mind as the secret to the putting off and the putting on.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How can we deal with all the vanity of our mind?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is by being renewed in the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How can our understanding be enlightened, our heart not be blinded, and our conscience be dealt with?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All these depend on one thing our being renewed in the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a great matter in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are two spirits within us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have a human spirit, and in our spirit is the Holy Spirit Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is difficult to know how to translate spirit in verses like Ephesians 4:23.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Spirit may refer either to the Holy Spirit or the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is better to invent a new letter for our alphabet, a small s within a big S, for use in a passage such as this one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then people will realize that it refers both to the Holy Spirit and the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No doubt, spirit in verse 23 is the mingled spirit, the Holy Spirit mingled with our human spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be renewed in the spirit of the mind is for the spirit to take over, possess, and saturate the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that the entire mind is now under the control of the spirit, so the spirit becomes the spirit of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since the human mind is the leading part of the soul, it represents the whole human being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, our whole being is now under the dominion and control of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whatever we think, do, love, decide, and choose is under the control, the influence, of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is in such a spirit that we are renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then spontaneously we put off the old man and put on the new man, and we live by Christ and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our mind is cleared up from all vanity, our understanding is enlightened, our heart is open to the Lord, and our conscience cared for.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All these depend on one thing the spirit that controls our whole being, bringing it under its influence.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This must not be a mere teaching to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to check with ourselves and put this into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Otherwise, we may talk about the building, but there will be no possibility to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From the first day I came to Los Angeles I declared that we cannot have the church life merely by teachings, gifts, and forms.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The only way to have the church life is by being renewed in the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>OUR NEED TO EXERCISE TO GROW AND</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>BE RENEWED FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am thankful to the Lord for giving us the deep understanding that in Ephesians, the book on the church, the miraculous gifts are not mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the gifts were necessary for the church, why does the apostle not speak of them in this book?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not my argument; it is what we observe in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, in this book we have the growth and our function to receive something from the Head and impart it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These are a matter not of the gifts but of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Following this, we have the clearing up of the mind from all vanity, the understanding being enlightened, the heart being opened, and the conscience being cared for.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These also are not matters of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this light we can see the present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even in dealing with the miraculous gifts, there is much vanity of the mind and darkness and blindness in the understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to humble ourselves before the Lord to see where we are and what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What we need is to grow inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church life depends upon the growth of life, and the way to grow is by all the foregoing matters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is why following the first section of this chapter, we have the second section to tell us the way to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The way to grow is by being renewed in the spirit that controls our mind and brings our whole being under its leadership and subduing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, we need to learn how to exercise our spirit and go along with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is why in the New Testament, especially in the Epistles, we often find the phrase in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must walk, live, work, serve, pray, and do everything in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Without this, there is no possibility for us to realize the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Rather, we will merely be speaking about something in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need a vision, but we also must be very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is the need for us to offer ourselves to the Lord once again and say, Lord, since I have seen this, I am willing to give myself to You again for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Renew me in the spirit of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Spontaneously we will put off the old man and put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our understanding will be transparent, our mind will be cleared up from all vanity, our heart will be open to the Lord, and our conscience will be at peace because we will take care of the feeling within it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then we will be renewed and transformed persons.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the genuine growth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Growth is transformation, and it is renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The more we are renewed, the more we grow.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As a result, we will become very rich in our ministry, our function.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In our meetings everyone will have something from the Head to minister to the Body.</S>
