   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SEAL OF THE HOLY SPIRIT A Message Given in Shanghai on February 21, 1931</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Issue No. 14 Scripture Reading: Eph 1:13-14; 4:30</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The two passages we just read are the only places in the whole Bible that mention the Holy Spirit as a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today I am going to talk about the relationship between the Holy Spirit and the Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is one item concerning the Holy Spirit which I would ask you to pay special attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people think that after a man is saved, he still needs to seek the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I will now prove whether or not this statement is true.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Please do not believe something just because I have said it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One must see what the Bible says, for only the word of the Bible is reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us consider Ephesians 1:13: "In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is the word of the truth?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is the gospel of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After we hear the gospel, we believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What we believe is a person, Christ, and not a doctrine or a theory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word of the truth tells us about the Christ who can save us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Its aim is to bring us to have faith in Christ through the hearing of the gospel; its purpose is not to bring us to have faith in some gospel sermons or some doctrines written on pieces of paper.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The latter are not the genuine thing and will not save us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What we hear is the word of the truth, the gospel of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What we believe is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, the first step is that we hear the word of the truth, the gospel of our salvation, and the second step is that we believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After a person has heard the word of the truth and believed in Christ, he is "sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The words "you were sealed" are very important.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It means at that moment when one believes, he receives the Holy Spirit of promise.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It does not mean that one has to wait for a while; it does not mean that one has to wait for three days, five days, or for some time before he can receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Bible tells us that "you were sealed," it means "you were sealed."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brothers and sisters, while you are sitting here, I would like to ask if you have heard the word of the truth and believed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If your answer is yes, do you not think that you have the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible tells us that "you were sealed"; the Holy Spirit dwells in the believers like the sealing of a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do we have the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let me say this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if you are a backsliding or very bad Christian, the Holy Spirit is still dwelling in you in the same way that he is dwelling in other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In a minute I will show you the difference between a sanctified believer's feeling and an unsanctified believer's feeling towards the Holy Spirit; I will show you the difference between an obedient believer's feeling and a disobedient believer's feeling toward the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, whether it is the sanctified believer or unsanctified believer, the obedient one or disobedient one, the Holy Spirit dwells in them all; there is no difference, and there is no distinction whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even though there may be differences in other matters, there is no difference as far as the Holy Spirit dwelling in them as a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you have heard the gospel and have believed in Christ, the Holy Spirit will dwell in you in the same way He dwells in other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if you have not believed in Christ, there will surely be a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It does not matter what kind of a person one is, whether he lives a good life or a bad one, whether he is advancing or backsliding, obedient or disobedient to God; there is no difference between them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you think that you have the Holy Spirit because you obey God, love Him, have a joyful feeling, see some visions or some tongues of fire, etc., and that, unless you have these things, you do not have the Holy Spirit, you are in a heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whoever believes in the Lord has the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At the time we believe, the Holy Spirit dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here it says that one receives "the Holy Spirit of the promise" v. 13 . What is a "promise"? The whole book of Galatians tells us that a "promise" is something received freely.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A "promise" is of grace; it is not a wage.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is given to us freely by God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Most people do not understand why every Christian, that is, every saved person, has the Holy Spirit dwelling in him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They think that their spiritual condition must reach a certain level before the Holy Spirit will dwell in them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet the Bible reveals that the Holy Spirit dwells in us because of the work of the Lord Jesus' redemption and not because of our own work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can understand this by looking at one of the types in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Leviticus 14:25 says, "Then he shall slaughter the lamb of the trespass offering; and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering and put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What happened after this?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Following this, verse 28 says, "Then the priest shall put some of the oil which is in his palm on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those who received the application of the blood received the anointing of the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Where there is no blood, there is no oil.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The oil is put upon a person after the blood is first put upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Holy Spirit comes down because the blood is there already.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God pours down the Holy Spirit of promise not because of our good behavior, but because of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, all those who have heard the word of the truth and believed in Christ have received the Holy Spirit.</S>
