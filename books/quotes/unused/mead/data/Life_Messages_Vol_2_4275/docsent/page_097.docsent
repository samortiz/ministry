   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX HOW THE LORD BECAME THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 1:14; 7:39; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17a; Rom 8:16; Phil 1:19b; Exo 30:22-26 MISTRANSLATION DUE TO MISUNDERSTANDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament there is a term which has been largely overlooked by biblical scholars and ordinary readers as well.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That term is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A number of times in the original Greek the definite article is used with the word Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sometimes the is translated literally, but other times it is blurred over.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Chinese version 2 Corinthians 3:17, for example, is correctly rendered, "Now the Lord is the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, quite often instead of translating the Spirit literally, the word Holy is added, along with three dots to indicate that the word was not in the original.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was done with Romans 8:16, for example; "The Spirit Himself" is rendered "Holy Spirit" in the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>... This same verse has another inaccurately rendered word in the Chinese version.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather than saying "with our spirit," as it is in Greek, the rendering is "with our heart."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The scholars who did the Chinese translations were well versed in Greek and Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There were seven translators, most of them British and American, assisted by well qualified Chinese scholars.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Generally speaking, the translation is an excellent one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The literary style and the sentence structure leave little to be desired.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What the translators lacked, however, was an accurate knowledge of spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It would be a serious error, physiologically speaking, if we used heart when we were referring to the lungs.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In referring to our psychological makeup, it is no less important to differentiate between our spirit and our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This distinction between spirit and heart is clear in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ezekiel 36:26 says, "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Heart and spirit are clearly two different entities.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not use the two terms interchangeably.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In John 4:24 the Chinese translation again shows the lack of spiritual understanding on the part of the translators.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead of going along with the Greek and saying that God is to be worshipped in spirit, the Chinese version has heart-spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Greek word for spirit is pneuma; for heart, it is cardia.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to maintain the scriptural distinction in their usage.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Over thirty years ago, one day in Shanghai I sat down with Brother Nee and asked, "Brother Nee, what is heart-spirit?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He replied, "Heart-spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is no such thing, anymore than there can be a heart-lung.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Heart is heart, spirit is spirit, and lung is lung.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These are all separate organs.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They cannot be mixed up."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Please be assured that the New Testament books we have translated are not an effort to alter the meaning of the original.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our object is to make the translation as accurate as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It takes a great deal of research and consideration to select the right words.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have in hand over forty different English translations of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before we decide how to translate a certain word, we check the different ways it has been translated already.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many differing opinions are revealed by the various translations!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We also have numerous reference books, such as lexicons, concordances, and word studies, that help us arrive at our translation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We further study the usage of the word in question.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How was the word used in ancient times?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is its modern usage?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How is it used elsewhere in the New Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To all these considerations we add our understanding of spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then we make our decision as to how the word will be translated.</S>
