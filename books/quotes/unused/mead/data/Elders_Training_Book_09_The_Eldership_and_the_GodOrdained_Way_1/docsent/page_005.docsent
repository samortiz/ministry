   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I realized that initially it might be a suffering to have such a change.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Seemingly we may not make that much profit at the beginning, but we will lay a good foundation so that we can make an unlimited profit in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have the full assurance that the God-ordained way, the biblical way according to Acts 2:46, Acts 5:42, and 1 Corinthians 14 works.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This new way is insured by God's Word and will not suffer loss eventually.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The number one thing in my heart since 1984 has been to overthrow the system of one man speaking and the rest listening.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to drop that old way and pick up the God-ordained, scriptural, new way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to have an absolute change to meetings of mutuality and to the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The basic factor for our meetings is that we need to meet in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is in the Bible, and this is God's ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many of us can testify that at the beginning of our church life experience, when we were meeting in the homes, we increased rather quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But once we began to concentrate our meeting life in the meeting hall, our rate of increase gradually declined.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To have the home meetings is not an easy task.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The way of having big congregations is somewhat easy, but to have home meetings in every believer's home is a difficult job.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we have the home meetings, we will receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all have to drop our old way and pick up the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the new way, we have to learn how to go to every believer's home to have a meeting in each home.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not an easy work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, to work for the Lord we have to go to the people who can be considered as producing soil.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the other hand, we have to learn to recover those who have backslidden.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Where there is a will, there is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we would set our will to visit people with much prayer, the Lord will honor our will because this is His will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We will experience the Lord's blessing if we cooperate with Him to visit others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The elders and co-workers also need to learn how to use the positive ones among us who are desirous to serve and burdened to function.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to visit people with these ones as helpers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, we can assign the whole burden of the home meetings to these helpers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Concerning these things, we are still in the laboratory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are still in the experimental stage.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need many experiences in the lab.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to find out the most prevailing way to build up a Christian meeting in each member's home if possible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to endeavor to do this.</S>
