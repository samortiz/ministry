<p>Our responsibility is to serve God with a pure conscience. When the church became desolate, the apostle Paul spoke concerning the conscience in his Epistles to Timothy (1 Tim. 1:5, 19; 3:9; 4:2; 2 Tim. 1:3). The defense of the truth cannot be our only responsibility when the church is desolate. In fact, our first responsibility must be to bear a good conscience before God. Suppose a brother says, &ldquo;Brother Lee, your way of serving God is wrong.&rdquo; I would humbly say to him, &ldquo;Brother, perhaps I am wrong, but my conscience is pure. Therefore, please give me some freedom. If you think that what you are doing is acceptable to God, you should bear that responsibility in your conscience before Him. That is not my responsibility. I would be very happy if you could see the light that God has shown me and walk according to it, but you are taking a different way. I dare not condemn you, because it is your responsibility before God.&rdquo; This should be our attitude.</p>
<p>The church fell into desolation and chaos while the apostles were still alive, but the apostles did not do a work of conformity. I do not believe that the apostles did such a work. Paul did not do a work of conformity. Paul instead told Timothy to maintain a good conscience and to serve God with a good conscience.</p>
<p>I once had fellowship with several brothers who asked, &ldquo;Is only your way the right way?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Brothers, I did not say that, nor is that my attitude. We are each responsible to maintain a pure conscience before God. We should not interfere in others&rsquo; affairs. If you think that my way is wrong and that yours is right, my conscience is still pure. Please give me the freedom to serve God according to the light that I have received. If after two years I see that my way is wrong but your way is right, I will follow your way. My conscience is clear. In the same principle, even though you think that your way is right, in two years the Lord may show you that my way is right. Therefore, I should give you the freedom to serve God. I will never criticize you or interfere in what you are doing.&rdquo; After that day there was nothing left to dispute.</p>
<p>All of us here have this feeling before the Lord. Perhaps one day the Lord will lead me to do things in a different way, and then we will learn this lesson: there is no need to criticize or judge anyone. Rather, our responsibility is to maintain a pure conscience before God. The way that others are taking is their responsibility.</p>
<p>Just as the apostles did not dispute with others, we should not dispute over who is right or who is wrong. A brother should not be foolish and say that only his way is right. His responsibility is to maintain a pure conscience before God. Whether or not God will touch his conscience does not depend on a third party. Hence, on the one hand, we should give one another the freedom to serve. On the other hand, we must be blameless in our conscience.</p>
<p>The only thing that matters is whether we are intentionally trying to be different from others and whether we are disputing with them based on differing opinions because we have not maintained a pure conscience before God. We cannot judge one another in these matters. Every brother is responsible to God. This is our way and our position. We cannot follow or partake of Roman Catholicism, and we cannot follow or partake of Christianity, even if others say that we are closed. We need to be humble and maintain a pure conscience in order to please God in this time of degradation. We should fellowship and serve together with all God&rsquo;s children in every matter as long as our conscience is not offended. We will not criticize others, and we hope that others will not criticize us. The time for judgment is when the Lord comes (1 Cor. 4:5).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRST DANGER&mdash;<br />
BECOMING A SYSTEM AND AN ORGANIZATION</h2>
<p>We must guard against falling into a system or becoming an organization. Concerning this, we must be clear that we have a group of workers and that we have a work. The work exists wherever there are workers. this is inevitable. We also have the churches with meetings in different localities for mutual fellowship. The workers, the work, the churches, and the mutual fellowship among churches are good and necessary, but we may make this into a system.</p>
<p>The workers and the work should help and supply the church, the church should support and supply the work, and the local churches should have mutual fellowship. Among the workers there should be spiritual order, spiritual authority. The workers who are more mature have a little authority, and the younger workers, who are less experienced, should learn to submit. This kind of learning should not be only among the workers; the churches in the different localities should also learn lessons on submission. Some churches are more experienced, and others are weaker. The weaker local churches need the help of the more experienced churches. All these experiences are necessary, but there is a danger that they can become a system, making us an organization.</p>
<p>The workers, the work, and the churches may be spiritual in the beginning, but they can gradually become a system. The workers, the work, and the churches may initially be of life but gradually become an organization. The relationship between the workers, the work, and the churches may be spiritual, but it can gradually fall into a system. The fellowship between the different localities may be spiritual and of life, but it can gradually fall into an organized system. This danger applies even to a local church. The submitting of the younger saints to the more experienced ones may be of life, and the arrangements in the church service may be spiritual and of life, but they can deviate from life and deteriorate.</p>
<p>If we fall into a system and become an organization, we will lose the spirit and the element of life, and we will be left with arrangements and positions; that is, we will have only an empty shell without life. We face this danger in every locality. The fellowship from some of the brothers concerning the lack of spiritual supply in certain localities indicates the danger of becoming an organization.</p>
<p>Preaching the gospel is an example. If a church does not make arrangements, the brothers and sisters will not preach the gospel. The saints wait until the elders decide when to preach the gospel, to distribute gospel tracts, and to visit the weaker saints. Then the elders may assign some saints to lead the singing, some to serve as ushers, and some to speak with the new ones. Thus, the saints function only when they are assigned; hence, there is a gospel-preaching show. It is true that some will get saved, but we must know that this situation portrays an organization.</p>
<p>There is a difference between a corpse and a body. A corpse is a body without life. We recognize that it is not possible to be without arrangements in the spiritual service, but the arrangements must have the Spirit and life. If we have arrangements but not the Spirit and life, we have fallen into a system and become an organization.</p>
<p>When someone is baptized, the elders assign him to the group meeting that is closest to his residence. The elders also arrange for some saints to be responsible for the group meetings. The elders arrange for a group to have a love feast and fellowship. The responsible saints might not shepherd the brothers and sisters in the group, but because the responsible ones have been assigned, they must prepare the group for a love feast. This situation is the activity of a corpse that does not have life or the spirit. This shows that we have become an organization with a system.</p>
<p>Arrangements are necessary, but the arrangements must be in life. Arrangements must meet the needs of the divine life in the saints. Arrangements that lack the spiritual element of the divine life are a system.</p>
<p>Likewise, it is good for the churches to copy, imitate, and follow each other. The Bible speaks of this in 1 Thessalonians 1:6-7. The positive situation in a local church should be imitated by other local churches. This is right and pleasing to the Lord. However, we must guard against imitating, copying, and following that become a system. Suppose the saints in a locality want to preach the gospel. They should first seek the Lord in prayer before they decide to copy another locality.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei is blessed and has some situations that are pleasing to the Lord. It would be good for the various churches to imitate the church in Taipei. But we must ask ourselves whether we touch God when we imitate and whether our imitating is in the Spirit. If we imitate without touching the Lord in prayer, we may criticize churches that are different from Taipei and say that they are independent. There are some saints with this attitude. They justify the churches that copy the methods used in Taipei and condemn the other churches. This is an attitude that leads to organization.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the serving ones in a locality should determine to not copy Taipei. If the sisters in Taipei cover their heads with black head coverings, to use a blue head covering does not mean that a sister is spiritual and is not in a system. This is the flesh. The desire to be different from others is the flesh. Outward behavior does not determine whether something is a system or an organization. We must touch the inward feeling.</p>
<p>The full-time serving ones in the localities have practical needs for their living. Under the Lord&rsquo;s leading, they are supplied by the churches and by the ministry. This arrangement is spiritual and of life. We must guard against this arrangement becoming a system, in which the care of the full-time serving ones becomes solely the responsibility of either the ministry or the church. Under normal conditions this should be a living matter. The serving ones should live before the Lord and look to Him for their needs. The saints, the churches, and the ministry should follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading to supply the serving ones. Everyone should live according to the Spirit and be in life. Then this matter will not become a system.</p>
<p>The first danger we must guard against is having a system and becoming an organization. There should be elders and deacons in the local churches, and services should be orderly and free of chaos. However, we must guard against the danger of losing the presence of the Spirit and the vitality of life, that is, of falling into a system and becoming an organization. The saints can preach the gospel and visit the weaker ones without the arrangement of the elders. When every service depends upon an arrangement made by the elders, we have become an organization.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there is divine order among us. We have elders and deacons, there is coordination in the services, and we submit to authority. These are good and necessary. On the other hand, an elder must not claim the position of an elder, a deacon must not claim the position of a deacon, and the saints should not have the concept that elders and deacons are treated in a certain way but that ordinary brothers and sisters are treated in another way. Such a concept shows that we have fallen into a system and are an organization.</p>
<p>When God&rsquo;s children serve together, they must learn spiritual lessons, submit to spiritual authority, and coordinate. The coordination should supply, nurture, and strengthen. Otherwise, the practices that are of life and the spirit will become a system.</p>
<p>Whether or not they are a co-worker, an elder, a deacon, or a responsible one in a group meeting and regardless of their age, every brother and sister is responsible to guard against becoming an organization. We all should learn to accept the breaking of the cross and the discipline of the Spirit and to know our position, the order in God&rsquo;s house, and the authority established by God. We must also learn to live in spirit and in fellowship and to be fresh, vital, and strengthened in our services. Our submission to authority should be of the Spirit and full of the anointing. If this is our situation, we are on the right track. We will be delivered from the danger of a system. We must not condemn others in these matters. We should apply them to ourselves so that we focus on the Spirit and life and guard against systems and organization.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
