Every meeting is very fresh, and we meet the Lord Himself in every fellowship meeting. The brothers' and sisters' hearts are all one in fellowship. We preached the gospel for five days in January, and the Holy Spirit did a great work each day. Although the weather was very cold, the brothers all came to the meeting hall around 6:00 or 7:00 in the morning. We prayed every morning. It was pouring rain on two days, but the brothers and sisters were burning in their hearts and did not fear the rain. As a result, the meeting hall was still filled. We not only saved quite a few sinners but also revived the brothers and sisters. The Lord is worthy of all the glory. Amen.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Fan Zhi-guang<br />February 27, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord's Preparation (Yichun)</h2><p>Thank the Lord! The Lord prepared a house for us in Yichun. It is a small house with three rooms and three entrances just outside the northern gate of Yichun. It has a second story. (There is no one living upstairs yet.) We made the front three rooms into a double-entrance store. It is located near a small market on a nearby street, and is just across the river from the city. The river is not as big as Lansi, and the water is good. It meets the requirements for a factory, and the Labor and Business Office has allowed us to make the arrangements. We thank the Lord for going before us and preparing a good place for us. We are now buying machinery and materials. We are going on positively.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Jin He-sheng<br />March 7, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">A Great Cry (Chuanchow)</h2><p>During the Chinese New Year, I was invited to Chendaixiang, which is fifteen miles from Chuanchow, to hold meetings for a few days. A preacher came out of the denominations two months ago and is meeting on the ground of the church. There are now more than ten people waiting to be baptized.</p><p>The opportunities for work here are very good. Many villages and cities are in the vicinity. If the church here is strong, it will influence the region greatly. Therefore, I am making a great cry to the Lord to raise up vessels. I plan to visit the churches in the Anhai and Tongan regions next week. If the Lord allows, I will return to Foochow in two weeks.</p><p>Ye Feng-sheng<br />February 26, 1951</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 56: The Open Door & The Present Testimony &nbsp; pg 48</div><br></body></html>
