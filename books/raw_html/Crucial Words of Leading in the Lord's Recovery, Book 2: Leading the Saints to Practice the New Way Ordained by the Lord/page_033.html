 <h2 class="head1">NOT SEEKING QUICK SUCCESS IN THE NEW WAY,<br />
BUT LABORING TO BEAR FRUIT</h2>
<p>Both Acts and the Epistles show the apostles&rsquo; work of building up the church. In the past we appraised their work too highly, thinking that their work was marvelous and that every church they built up seemed to be a New Jerusalem. However, while we were studying the new way and came back to the Bible to consider this matter, we discovered that the work which the apostles did was not extraordinary. According to the Epistles, the church in Philippi was an excellent church, yet Paul still spoke of two co-working sisters who were not in one accord (Phil. 4:2). Even among the co-workers today, we may not have such a condition. I believe that our co-working sisters are better than those two sisters. We do not need to write a letter to certain sisters, charging them to be in one accord and to think the same thing in the Lord, as Paul exhorted Euodias and Syntyche.</p>
<p>In one of his last Epistles Paul wrote that all in Asia turned away from him (2 Tim. 1:15). That turning away was not physical or geographical, because Paul was in a prison in Rome when he wrote 2 Timothy. Rome was a sea apart from Asia. Their turning away from him was in regard to the truth in the ministry; all who were in Asia rejected Paul&rsquo;s ministry. This is difficult to believe.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus gained five thousand and later four thousand; in Acts, on the day of Pentecost, Peter and the brothers quickly gained three thousand (2:41). However, we see from Acts that the church in Jerusalem was not that encouraging. When Paul entered Jerusalem for the last time, the leading brothers, including James, who was a pillar in the church and a leading one, said to Paul, &ldquo;You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed; and all are zealous for the law&rdquo; (21:20). This means that thousands of believing Jews still kept the law. This statement indicates that the church in Jerusalem was nearly worthless. We know that the Jewish believers in Jerusalem, as believers in the New Testament, were in Christ, had received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and were the church, yet they still kept the law. This word was not spoken by a little brother in the church but by the leading elder. The elders of the church in Jerusalem, according to that church&rsquo;s custom of keeping of the law, persuaded Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles, to also keep the law. In this matter Paul was weak.</p>
<p>In Romans and Galatians, Paul says that the law has been abolished; in 1 Corinthians, he also says that knowledge will be rendered useless (13:8). His speaking is very clear in these three books. However, when he went to Jerusalem, due to the persuasion of James, he was softened in his heart and paid the expenses for four Nazarites to undergo the rite of purification. We know from the Old Testament that purification was a ritual that required many offerings to be presented for seven consecutive days, and the purification was not completed until the last day. Paul followed the rite accordingly, entering into the temple with the four Nazarites and giving notice of the completion of the days of the purification until the offering was offered for each one of them (Acts 21:24, 26). By the sixth of seven days Paul must have felt inwardly pained and must have been praying for the Lord to rescue him from this temptation. He probably never imagined that he would be in such a predicament. The Lord heard his prayer, and on the seventh day, when the purification was about to be completed, the Lord did not allow the rite to continue further. A great uproar ensued, the rite of purification was interrupted, and Paul was arrested (vv. 27-33). This was a rescue to Paul. God used that arrest to deliver Paul from the great temptation of the Jewish religion.</p>
<p>God is the sovereign One; He brought about an uproar to preserve His servant Paul, and in His preservation, He transferred Paul from the hands of the Jews to the hands of the Romans. The Jews conspired to take Paul&rsquo;s life when he was on his way to the Sanhedrin and put themselves under a curse to neither eat nor drink until they had accomplished the matter. When the son of Paul&rsquo;s sister heard this, he told Paul and the commander, and Paul was rescued from that tribulation (23:12-24). Paul knew that he was born a Roman citizen (22:28), and he was acquainted with Roman law. Therefore, he told Festus, &ldquo;I am standing before Caesar&rsquo;s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews...I appeal to Caesar&rdquo; (25:10-11). He declared that Caesar should judge him; this stopped Festus from doing anything. He replied, &ldquo;To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go&rdquo; (v. 12). This means that Paul could not be sent to Jerusalem, which was Jewish territory; rather, he had to be sent to Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire. It was in prison in Rome that Paul wrote the Epistles of Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and 2 Timothy. These books in the New Testament are very precious.</p>
<p>In terms of Paul&rsquo;s work, there is much to be praised; nevertheless, in reality the result of his work is nothing like what we would have expected. Even the result of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost is not as we may have imagined. At the end of Acts, we see that the fruit of Pentecost entered into Judaism. In Acts 8, apart from the apostles, all the believers were persecuted and departed from Jerusalem. These ones were not the one hundred twenty but another group of people. After this group of people were scattered, Acts does not clearly indicate how strong and prevailing the testimony became. Therefore, we should be clear and comforted that the new way is a way of labor, step by step.</p>
<p>Even if all the churches in Taiwan take the new way and the Lord enables us to gain twenty thousand in the first year, sixty thousand in the second year, and one hundred eighty thousand in the third year, we need to be careful, because if we have this condition, it could be called a &ldquo;mushroom work.&rdquo; Someone who grows mushrooms can gain a large quantity of mushrooms overnight. However, this is not the pattern for the growth in life. There is a common Chinese saying: &ldquo;He who advances with haste will retreat with haste.&rdquo; This means that if a certain matter advances too rapidly, it will also decline quickly. Hence, the slower we proceed with the new way, the steadier we will be. In order to obtain a long-term, permanent result, we must exert effort and spend time to proceed step by step.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was God, yet He spent three and a half years carrying out His work on the earth step by step. There were no automobiles at that time. For sure there were donkeys, but we do not know whether there were any other types of vehicles. Hence, it is likely that the Lord walked from Galilee to Jerusalem on foot. Since He traveled mostly on foot, the Lord Jesus&rsquo; work must have been very slow. Although it is recorded in the Bible that He gained four thousand at one time and five thousand at another time, in the miniature of the church life in the house of Martha and Mary, there were only three or four people in this &ldquo;home meeting,&rdquo; and even these three or four were not in one accord. After Pentecost, there were three thousand who were in one accord (2:41, 46), but that one accord did not last long. In Acts 5:1-11 Ananias and Sapphira, his wife, tried to deceive the Holy Spirit. Then in Acts 6:1, there was a dispute over the daily dispensing, causing a conflict between the Jews who spoke Greek and the Jews who spoke Hebrew. Therefore, in the early stage of the apostles&rsquo; ministry, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit that the believers received did not guarantee a good church life.</p>
<p>We should be comforted and see that if our work is real, it will surely produce results. Although Paul was not satisfied with his work at the time he wrote 2 Timothy, he said clearly that he knew that he was already being poured out and that the time of his departure was at hand (4:6); nevertheless, he was joyful within because he knew what he had preached and the kind of work he had done. From his Epistles, we see that Paul preached the truth, dispensed and ministered Christ to people, and established churches. He knew that this was real, so no matter how much Satan tried to destroy his work, it would last forever. We have tasted the lasting value of his work. When we read Ephesians, it is as if Paul were right in front of us. We can say that in the New Testament, Paul is the one who renders us the most help. Therefore, we should be assured that if what we do is real, it will come under Satan&rsquo;s devastation; nevertheless, the more he devastates, the more the reality will be manifested, and the more we will be able to see that our work is not a work of wood, grass, and stubble but of gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12), which will last forever.</p>
<p>We should not be discouraged. The new way is truly the right way; we must go out to preach the gospel through door-knocking. After the preaching of the gospel, we need to maintain continual contact with people; the more contact there is, the better it will be. Whether we are an elder, co-worker, or a full-time serving one, we must take the way of going out to preach the gospel, establishing the home meetings and group meetings, and establishing churches. When the number of people in a church becomes too large, the church should be divided into districts. Even if there are only one hundred people in the church, it should be divided into districts. At most, there should be fifty or sixty people in a district because it is difficult to take care of anything above this number. After dividing into districts, taking care of the saints will become more widespread. Furthermore, the opportunity for service will increase, and the members of the Body will all be able to function. This will create opportunities for the saints to serve and fulfill their function in the church life.</p>
