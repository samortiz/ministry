Paul prayed for us, asking the Father to strengthen our being through His Spirit to such an extent that we would be strengthened into the inner man. In the meetings you may feel that you are very much in spirit and exercising your spirit. However, your being in the spirit may be compared to reeds that cannot withstand the blowing of the wind. Therefore, when you go back to your daily living, a word from the elders or an attitude of your spouse can cause you to become enraged and corrupted. In the meetings your heart is burning, but right after you get home, you are &#8220;doused by cold water.&#8221; If you are this kind of a person, you need Paul&#8217;s prayer, bowing your knees to the Father and asking Him to strengthen your entire being into the spirit. When you are thus strengthened into your spirit, Christ is able to make His home in your heart (v. 17).<h2 class=head2>Being Renewed in the Spirit of Our Mind</h2><p>Ephesians 4:23 says, &#8220;And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind.&#8221; When we were the old man, all of our thoughts were old and corrupted, but now through the renewing of the spirit of our mind we have become the new man. This indicates that there has been a great improvement with our spirit because even our mind is now filled with the spirit, which is the spirit of the mind. When our mind becomes a mind in the spirit, our spirit becomes a transforming spirit that is able to transform our entire being.<h2 class=head2>Being Filled in Our Spirit</h2><p>Ephesians 5:18 says, &#8220;And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit.&#8221; To be drunk is to be filled in the body with physical wine, whereas to be filled in our regenerated spirit is to be filled with Christ unto God&#8217;s fullness (3:19). The spiritual wine, which is God Himself, fills and infuses our spirit. Instead of being drunk in our body with physical wine, we are &#8220;drunk&#8221; in our spirit with God Himself as the divine wine. The result is that we are filled unto the fullness of God to become His expression and flowing out.<h2 class=head2>Praying at Every Time in Our Spirit</h2><p>Ephesians 6:18 says, &#8220;Praying at every time in spirit.&#8221; This indicates that the main organ which we should use in prayer is our regenerated spirit, which is indwelt by the Spirit of God. To pray every time in spirit indicates that we ought to exercise our spirit moment by moment, always living in spirit.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> </body></html>
