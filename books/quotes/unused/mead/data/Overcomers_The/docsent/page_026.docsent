   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PROTESTANTISM A. Practicing the Works of the Nicolaitans, the Works of the Clergy in the Religious Hierarchy</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Protestantism practices the works of the Nicolaitans, the works of the clergy in the religious hierarchy Rev 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a strong sign of today's Protestant churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Protestant churches there is a hierarchy with the clergy and the so-called laymen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A small number are clergy, and the majority are laymen.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we practice this, we are not in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to consider whether or not we have the clergy and the laity in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may not have the term clergy, but in actuality we may be building up the clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as we insist on keeping the system of one man speaking without the proper practice of every member of the church prophesying, we are building up the clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Nee saw the truth concerning the church meeting in mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14 in 1937.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His ministry on this is in the book entitled The Normal Christian Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1948 he spoke concerning this again in the book entitled Church Affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But throughout the years, we did not find a way to replace the system of one man speaking with all of the saints prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1984 I purposely went to Taiwan to restudy our situation in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In that study I was encouraged and strengthened by the Lord to pick up the practice of the church meetings revealed in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, starting from the church in Taipei, we gave up the practice of one man speaking on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we practice prophesying in the meetings by all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We realize that we cannot do this in very large meetings, so the church in Taipei divided their three thousand attendants into a number of district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Each district meeting has about fifty saints.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today many of the local churches are practicing the prophesying of all of the saints instead of the Lord's Day message meeting by one speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Revelation 2:6 the Lord Jesus says clearly that He hates the works of the Nicolaitans, the clergy-laity system see note 61 Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to reject anything of this system.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All of us should be the functioning members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Wherever clergy and laity are, hierarchy is being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a system changes the nature of the churches in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>B. Holding the Teaching of Balaam</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Protestantism holds the teaching of Balaam, who put a stumbling block before the people of God, teaching people to accept idolatry and commit fornication Rev 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Balaam was a Gentile prophet who spoke and taught the word of God for base gain, enticing God's people into fornication and idolatry Num 25:1-3; 31:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>C. Holding the Teaching of the Nicolaitans</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Protestantism also holds the teaching of the Nicolaitans to build up hierarchy and practice the system of clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the seven epistles to the churches, the works of the Nicolaitans are mentioned first Rev 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At first there was only the practice of the hierarchy with the clergy and laity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Later this practice became a teaching v. 15 . Today in Protestantism there is such a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>People are encouraged to dedicate themselves to the Lord, offering themselves to be preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then they are sent to seminary, and after their graduation they become the clerical class.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the practice and teaching in Protestantism.</S>
