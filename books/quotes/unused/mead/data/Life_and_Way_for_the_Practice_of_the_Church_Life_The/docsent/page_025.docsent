   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE THE LIVING LAW WITHIN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hebrews 8:10-11 says, "For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me. And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them." Notice in verse 10 that laws in the plural number is used.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But in the original passage in Jeremiah law is used.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jeremiah 31:33 says, "I will put My law within them."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Later, we will see why "law" eventually becomes "laws."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 8:2 speaks of "the law of the Spirit of life."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Three things are composed together here: the law, the Spirit, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The law is of the Spirit, the Spirit is of life, and this life is Christ Himself, who is God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This verse goes on to tell us that the law of the Spirit of life is in Christ Jesus and has freed us "from the law of sin and of death."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 9 says, "But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have previously pointed out that the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ in this one verse are not two Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are just one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is simply Christ Himself, because verse 10 says, "But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the previous chapter, we saw what a wonderful, all-inclusive Spirit we have within us today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this chapter we will see that this Spirit within us is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I say "the law of the Spirit of life," please do not think of it as three things, the law, the Spirit, and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually, the life is the Spirit and the Spirit is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose you had a hamburger for lunch today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The hamburger was made up of different ingredients such as bread, beef, lettuce, onion, pickles, and mustard.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the lunch, the hamburger, and all the ingredients were not many different things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They were just one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Similarly, when we speak of the law of the Spirit of life, we should realize that the law, the Spirit, and the life are not three things but just one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, "It is the Spirit who gives life..the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, the Lord indicated that for giving life He would become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then He said that the words He speaks are spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We know the word is the Lord Himself, and the Lord Himself is life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So the Lord, the Spirit, the word, and the life are just one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now how can we say that the law is the Spirit and that the law is the life?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let me illustrate in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Old Testament, God gave His people the Ten Commandments as the law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This law is a description, a definition, and an explanation of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Ten Commandments can be summarized into four main points.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They reveal to us that God is holiness, righteousness, love, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The complete law reveals to us the nature and character of God, showing us what kind of God He is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>People in the Old Testament had to deal with all the items of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If they were wrong with any item of the law, that meant they were wrong with God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They had to get right with God according to the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They had to do everything according to the holiness, righteousness, love, and light of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then they would be right with God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today, however, it is different.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God Himself comes into us in the Son as the Spirit to be the living law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose your father wrote you a lot of regulations when he was away from you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But now he comes to stay with you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He himself becomes the living regulation to you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even more so, in the New Testament under the new covenant, God puts Himself into us as the living law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When God comes into us, He is the living law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have seen that Christ in us is our life and the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have something shining within us, enlightening us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This life is also the law, so we have something regulating within us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we have Christ, we have something living, shining, and regulating within us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the acting, working, and moving of the Lord Jesus as life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am burdened for the children of God to have a clear vision about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord has to take away all the veils and open this mystery to us that we may see this wonderful One.</S>
