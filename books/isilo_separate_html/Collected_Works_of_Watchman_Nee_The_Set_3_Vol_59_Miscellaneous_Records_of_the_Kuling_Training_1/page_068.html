How much does the name of Jesus include! How little do we know about it! Luke 24:47 says that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name. This means that forgiveness comes from the name of Jesus. It is also through this name that the disciples received life, cast out demons, caused men to walk, and baptized men. It is also through this name that believers are justified, that they pray to God, and that God pours out the Holy Spirit. The emphasis here is that the Bible equates the name of Jesus with authority. Luke 10 speaks of the seventy disciples going out to preach. In verse 17 they returned and reported to the Lord, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name." In verse 19 the Lord answered them, saying, "Behold, I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you." The name in verse 17 equals the authority in verse 19. The Lord's name is His authority. The serpents are related to Satan, and the scorpions are related to his power.</p><p>There is a big difference between authority and power. Twenty years ago we saw the difference between authority and power. In Shanghai I once said that the power spoken of in the New Testament is like dynamite; it is not an ordinary kind of power but a tremendous power. Yet authority transcends such a power. Authority can subdue the greatest and strongest power. Authority prevails over power; it subdues even the power of dynamite. The Lord said that He has given us authority to overcome the power of Satan.</p><p>Everywhere in this world, we find authority prevailing over power. An elderly man of seventy years old may not be able to walk. He may cough all the time, his back may be hunched, and he may carry a stick with him everywhere. His thirty-year-old son may be very strong physically, but the son has to obey the words of the father. As far as power is concerned, the son is stronger than the father, yet he has to obey the father. The son obeys the father not because of his power but because of his authority. Consider the example of a school. A teacher may have a few dozen or even a hundred students in a class. All the students obey the teacher. As far as their power is concerned, the students' combined power is surely much greater than that of the teacher. Yet they obey the teacher. When the teacher assigns the students work, they obey. When the teacher prepares an examination, the students take the exam. The students obey the teacher not on account of his power but on account of his authority. As far as power is concerned, ten strong teachers would still be unable to subdue a class of over a hundred students. The issue, however, is not power but authority. The teacher has the authority to rule over the students. This is an example of authority over power.</p><p>God's priority in the whole universe is authority. Satan controls man with his power. He instills fear in man with his power. Yet he does not have any authority. Let me give another illustration which I used twenty years ago when I was speaking in Shanghai. There is a busy intersection in the city of Shanghai. Many cars go through it every minute. During its busiest hours over a hundred cars can pass through it at any one moment. However, only one policeman directs traffic. One person controls over a hundred cars at any one moment. As far as power is concerned, a hundred-horsepower car is strong enough to pulverize the policeman, but all the cars at the intersection only move according to the waving of the policeman's arm. His club is neither short nor long; it is no good as a weapon for beating either men or dogs. It is useless even for kneading flour dough, but that little club is very useful for directing hundreds of cars. This is another example of authority over power.</p><p>As soon as the Lord's disciples exercised authority, Satan fell like lightning out of heaven. It is true that he possesses power in this world, but he does not have any authority. He merely exercises his power through messengers who follow him. God, however, has appointed us to be His authority to subdue Satan. No matter how powerful Satan is, authority is in our hand. As long as we have authority, everything is under us. This universe is ruled by authority. God has established authority as the fundamental principle of administration. As soon as a man touches authority, his own power disintegrates. A robber may be armed with a gun, but as soon as he meets a policeman, his boldness leaves him. The policeman does not have to run away; the robber is the one who has to run. Authority is behind the whole issue. When a sergeant gives a command, the soldiers march, and when he halts, the soldiers stop. What gives the sergeant the ground to direct his soldiers? The soldiers have weapons. Why do they have to listen to one man? Here we find authority prevailing over power. If a man knows authority, he will spontaneously obey. No one can go up against authority with his power. Authority will eventually prevail over power. In the spiritual realm we are the ones with representative authority. Although Satan has power, the victory will always be ours, because authority always prevails over power.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_067.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_069.html">Next</a> </body></html>
