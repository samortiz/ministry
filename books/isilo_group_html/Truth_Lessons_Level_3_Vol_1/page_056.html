That the Children of Israel Might Be Able<br />to Enter the Good Land to Enjoy Its Riches,<br />Typifying That the Believers<br />May Be Put in Christ to Enjoy All His Riches</h2><p>In Exodus 3:8 God said to Moses, &ldquo;I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey.&rdquo; When God led the children of Israel out of Egypt, He severed their relationship with the world and enabled them to go on the journey to sacrifice to God. Furthermore, He enabled them to enter the good land to enjoy the riches there that He might establish His kingdom on the earth and build His dwelling place. The enjoyment of the children of Israel was of three stages. The first stage was the enjoyment of the Passover lamb in Egypt; the second, the enjoyment of the manna and the living water in the wilderness; and the third, the enjoyment of the rich produce of the good land. After their exodus from Egypt, the children of Israel were able, eventually, to enter the good land to enjoy its riches. This typifies that after our breaking away from the world, eventually we are put in Christ to enjoy all His riches.</p><p>Colossians 2:6-7 says, &ldquo;As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him.&rdquo; Here Paul shows us that God has planted us in Christ as the good land. Furthermore, we have been rooted in Christ that we may absorb all His riches as nourishment. These riches become the element and substance by which we grow and build up the Body of Christ as God&rsquo;s house and God&rsquo;s kingdom (1 Tim. 3:15; Rom. 14:17).</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The Passover is a type of Christ as the believers&rsquo; redemption and supply. In the aspect of redemption, the lamb without blemish was killed and its blood was shed, typifying that the sinless Christ died and shed His blood for the believers. The blood of the lamb was put on the door, typifying that the blood of Christ was put before God for the believers&rsquo; redemption. In the aspect of supply, the flesh of the lamb was eaten by the children of Israel for their supply, typifying that Christ enters into the believers to be their life supply. The flesh of the lamb was to be eaten with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, typifying that the believers need to receive Christ as the life that delivers them from sin and purges away their sin and as the sinless life that gives them a bitter feeling toward sin. Those who enjoyed the Passover continued with the observance of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, typifying that those who enjoy the redemption and supply of Christ go on to live and enjoy a life that purges away sin.</p><p>Israel&rsquo;s crossing of the Red Sea is a type of the New Testament believers&rsquo; baptism. The children of Israel were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea, typifying that the believers are baptized into Christ in the Spirit and in the water. The water of the Red Sea drowned the Egyptian army and delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Egyptians, typifying that the death of Christ has destroyed the power of the world for the believers and thus delivers them from it.</p><p>Israel&rsquo;s exodus from Egypt typifies the believers&rsquo; breaking away from the world. God led the children of Israel out of Egypt that they might be severed from Egypt, go on the journey to sacrifice to God, and eventually be able to enter the good land to enjoy its riches. This typifies that God leads the believers to break away from the world that they may be severed from the world, that they may be able to follow the Lord to worship God, and that they may be put in Christ to enjoy all His riches.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly explain how the Passover is a type of Christ as the believers&rsquo; redemption.</li><li>Briefly explain how the Passover is a type of Christ as the believers&rsquo; supply.</li><li>Briefly explain how Israel&rsquo;s crossing of the Red Sea is a type of the New Testament believers&rsquo; baptism.</li><li>Briefly explain how Israel&rsquo;s exodus from Egypt is a type of the believers&rsquo; breaking away from the world.</li></ol><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth Lessons, Level 3, Vol. 1 &nbsp; pg 56</div><br></body></html>
