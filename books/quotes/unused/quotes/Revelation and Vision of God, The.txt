The recently saved ones who have come into the church life for only a short time may not fully understand what revelation and vision mean
Generally, in their concept, people consider these two words synonyms, thinking that a revelation is a vision and a vision is a revelation
In the Bible throughout the ages the seekers of God, from Adam to John the Baptist, were only groping at the veil
The things they touched were mostly fragmentary and incomplete; some were not quite accurate, while others were not quite thorough
Some of the things they said were correct and accurate, while other things they said were incorrect and inaccurate
At the beginning of the New Testament when John the Baptist came it seemed that the veil was going to be opened yet it was still not opened
It was not until the writing of the book of Revelation by the elderly John that the revelation of the mystery was completely laid open
After the opening of the seventh seal, there are the seven trumpets , which are the contents of the seventh seal
It is not enough only to open the veil and break the seals; there is still the need for a loud trumpeting, a shouting
They will probably answer, 'It is better not to touch it or pay attention to it; otherwise, you will get into trouble'
Not only so, the Catholic Church and some of the Protestant denominations have even gone back to the Old Testament
The Scripture cited is Proverbs 30:28, which says, 'The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces'
They believe that all they need is to worship and believe in God and their business will prosper and be successful
One brother said that he testified for twenty minutes about how he escaped by swimming from the mainland China to Hong Kong
By this you can see that when you go into people's homes, you should not give lengthy testimonies or speak your own words
Before we speak about the revelation of the Triune God, we need to know the history of the development of Christianity in China
Later, the flourishing of Buddhism influenced some of the emperors who prohibited the activities of Nestorianism and destroyed its temples
It was then that the term Trinity was translated into Chinese as san-wei-i-t'i, which literally means 'three persons, one body '
The New Testament is divided mainly into three sections: the Gospels and the Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation
The apostles wrote the Epistles as a continuation of the revelation of the Lord Jesus; the most important writer among them was Paul
They studied extensively the writings of the apostles as well as the contents of the Old Testament and had high theological attainments
In the 1700s, during the time of Zinzendorf and John Wesley, theological studies gradually turned from Latin to English
We felt that even adding the word in is misleading, so we dropped it; now we simply say 'the three-one God,' that is, 'the Triune God'
To answer this question we have to study from the theology in the Greek language to the theology in the Latin language
Hupo means 'underneath' and stasis means 'a supporting substance'; hupostasis, therefore, means 'a supporting substance erected underneath'
In Paul's Epistles this word is rendered as confidence or assurance , referring to something on which one can stand firmly
The Triune God has three hupostases, three substantial, dependable supports-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
With regard to the aspect of the Divine Trinity's being one, the word essentia in Latin is used; it denotes 'essence,' 'intrinsic nature'
When the Western missionaries came to China, they used a simple expression, san-wei-i-t'i, to express the concept of the Divine Trinity
Wei denotes person substance ti refers neither to a physical body nor to a corporate body but to an entity to the essence of a substance
San-wei-i-t'i means that although the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three in person or in substance, They are one in essence
In America because of our proclaiming the truth, we were libeled and slandered and were therefore forced to file two lawsuits
In the future wherever you go, whether in the East or in the West, you will meet people who are in Christianity
In studying this matter, we have stood on the shoulders of our predecessors, but we also have seen something further
To know the Triune God, first we must understand the word hupostases, which refers to the three substances of the Divine Trinity
In the entire Bible, Matthew 28:19 is the only verse that clearly puts the Father, the Son, and the Spirit together
God is Jehovah; this name also means the One 'who is and who was and who is coming' , implying three periods of time
Not only so the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob also implies that God is triune that God has the aspect of being three
If we want to worship God, who is Spirit, we must worship Him with our spirit, which has the same nature as His
The situation in today's Christianity is confusing and full of all kinds of mixtures, such as Mormonism and Jehovah's Witnesses
Only then will you be able to present the truth clearly and answer questions properly when you preach to people
Ephesians 6:14 says that we should gird our loins with truth and not be loose that we may protect ourselves and preserve others as well
Finally, in the inspiring of the apostles He manifested Himself as the Holy Spirit; that was the period of the Spirit, and the Son was over
Immediately after this, the latter half of verse 2 says that 'the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters'
Rather the threethe Father the Son and the Spirit existed there at the same time this is why They used Us and Our to refer to Themselves
At the end Manoah asked what His name was, and He replied, 'Why do you ask about My name, since it is wonderful'?
When He came out of the water, the Father spoke to Him from the heavens while the Spirit descended upon Him like a dove
In the Epistles, from Acts to Revelation, many times the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are mentioned at the same time
The three-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-are mentioned at the same time; this proves that They are coexistent
To be eternal means to be without beginning or ending, to be complete and perfect, and to be infinite and boundless
The Arians maintained that although Christ is the Son of God, He was not God in eternity but became God at a certain time
The Bible says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation not according to His divinity but according to His humanity
In church history, still there were some who properly taught that Christ is both the Creator and the Firstborn of all creation
Panton in the beginning of the twentieth century based upon Colossians 115b they clearly said that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation
The Docetists advocated that Jesus was not a real man but simply appeared to be; to them He was merely a phantasm
The Messiah, referring to the Lord Jesus, was cut off at the fullness of the sixty-ninth week of the seventy weeks
History tells us that the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem occurred in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king
After seven weeks and sixtytwo weeks that is four hundred eightythree years that was exactly the year of the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus
From that time on, in God's eternal view, God the Son had become a creature, even the Firstborn of all creation
The term coinhere applied to the Triune God means that the three-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-exist within one another
1 Corinthians 15:45b says, 'The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit'; moreover, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that 'the Lord is the Spirit'
Today among Christians there exists an erroneous traditional saying that Christ is in the Holy Spirit that is that the Son is in the Spirit
When we speak about the enjoyment of Christ, we must tell people who Christ is; we must also tell them clearly the way to enjoy Christ
In brief, we can say that the Father and the Son are one because the Lord Jesus said, 'I and the Father are one'
The Scriptures show us however that the threethe Father the Son and the Spiritnot only exist at the same time but also exist in one another
No one has been able to determine when the Father the Son and the Spirit are three when They are one and when They are both three and one
According to what the Bible tells us we can say only that God is one yet He has the aspect of being threethe Father the Son and the Spirit
Today, there is a group of Christians who do not see that the Divine Trinity has the essential aspect and the economical aspect
From that time on, you can say that Jesus was born of the Spirit; you can also say that He was born of the virgin Mary
According to His divinity, He was born of the Holy Spirit; according to His humanity, He was born of a human virgin
Are there two Holy Spirits, one being inside the Lord Jesus as His essence and another being outside, in the air, to descend upon Him?
On the one hand, the Holy Spirit was in the Lord Jesus as His essence for His existence; this is the essential aspect
We would go on and ask: After His baptism, when He came out of the water and stood there, why did the Father speak from the heavens?
According to the essential aspect from the time the Lord Jesus entered Marys womb He came not only from the Father but also with the Father
As early as the first century there rose up a heretical teacher, Cerinthus, who was a Syrian of Jewish descent
Cerinthus advocated that the One who was baptized and who died was Jesus, and the One who descended upon Him to be with Him was Christ
It was not the Son alone who was born in the manger; rather, it was the Father accompanying the Son and being with the Son
The term economy means 'arrangement,' 'plan,' 'administration,' 'management'; hence, it denotes moves, works, and doings
The Bible does not say that the Lord Jesus became flesh or that the Son of God became flesh; it says that God became flesh
John 1 says that in the beginning was the Word, that the Word was God, and that the Word who was God became flesh
The Lord Jesus was God who became flesh; all the experiences of the Lord on the earth were God's experiences in Him
In the economical aspect when the Lord Jesus was baptized the Father spoke to Him from the heavens when He was crucified the Father left Him
John 14 through 16 are the most mysterious as well as the most explicit chapters concerning the Divine Trinity
The Son, who was on the earth, lifted up His eyes to heaven and prayed to the Father; this is the economical aspect
Brothers and sisters, concerning the Divine Trinity, we should not debate blindly like the blind men feeling the elephant
Now we come to the fourth point-the creeds which have been highly regarded by the church through the ages for nearly two thousand years
When the contents of man's belief are enumerated and set forth in writing, article by article, these articles of faith are called a creed
Sixty years ago when we were raised up in China, we also declared, 'We do not care for the creeds; we care only for the Bible'
Concerning the doctrine of the Divine Trinity, there have been mainly three major schools through the centuries
The true balanced teaching is the doctrine of Trinity with the correct teaching concerning God's being uniquely one and yet distinctly three
Eventually the opposing parties were subdued because the truth is the truth, and the more it is debated, the clearer it becomes
They were serious and accurate in their study, and the items they set forth may be considered quite deep, thorough, and detailed
Next, in the age of the church fathers, seven books of the New Testament had yet to be publicly recognized as authoritative
397 at the Council of Carthage in North Africa that these seven books were affirmed and recognized as a part of the New Testament
Today those who fear God, know God, and know the Bible all acknowledge that this recognition was undoubtedly of God's sovereignty
In the second century it was not easy for the first group of church fathers to give a complete definition of the Divine Trinity
The main contents of the Apostles' Creed are as follows: 'I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth
Following the Apostles' Creed is the Nicene Creed, which was instituted in the Council of Nicaea assembled by Constantine the Great in A
The church leaders were in discord due to disputes concerning the truth; hence, there were divisions among them
In the assembly the bishops were urged by Constantine to present their opinions, and decisions were made based upon the Apostles' Creed
After the making of the Nicene Creed, it was recognized by the 'catholic church,' the predecessor of the Roman Catholic Church
Later, based upon this, people began to call the Roman Catholic Church T'ien Chu Chiao, the 'Church of the Lord of Heaven'
After the Council of Nicaea, the Roman Empire was gradually divided politically into the Eastern Empire and the Western Empire
Besides the political factor, the division was also caused by a strong controversy involving the Divine Trinity
397, in the third general Council, held at Carthage in North Africa, the final seven books of the New Testament were officially recognized
In this Council, the contents of the Nicene Creed were greatly increased to make the original Creed more exhaustive
Athanasius was an attendant of the Nicene Council who served as an assistant to one of the bishops who participated in the Council
Arius erroneously taught that Christ was not the eternal God but an extraordinary, noble man who was later deified by God
Because Athanasius was the most powerful antagonist of the Arians, some considered the creed adopted by the Nicene Council as his writing
Just as man has a spirit, He also has a spirit ; just as man has a soul, He also has a soul ; just as man has a body, He also has a body
The Bible tells us that the Lord Jesus is the Word who was in the beginning and that the Word became flesh; in the flesh He is the last Adam
The proponents of tritheism say that 'the Lord' here is actually 'God,' who is generally referred to as 'the Lord'
The sentence 'the Lord is the Spirit' was written as a continuation of 'the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit'
We cannot blame the Nicene Creed for not referring to the seven Spirits, since the book of Revelation had yet to be recognized at that time
397, the point concerning the seven Spirits was not added to either the Chalcedonian Confession of Faith or the Athanasian Creed
Isaiah 9:6 says, 'For a child is born to us, / A son is given to us; / And His name will be called / Mighty God, / Eternal Father'
In the text of five verses in John, the Lord Jesus repeatedly said, 'I am in the Father and the Father is in Me'
Since the Son is the image of God, how can we say that the image of God is one person and the Father is another person?
The proponents of tritheism assert that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three persons, each One standing alone
The Son as the image of the Father expresses the Father; whereas the Spirit as the eyes of this 'image' transmits the Son
The three-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-are distinct, just as a person himself, his image, and his eyes are distinctly three
In Zechariah 2:8-11 we see that the Lord Jesus is the One who was sent by Jehovah, and He is also Jehovah who sent Him
Essentially, the Father was always with the Lord, not only while He was moving on the earth but even while He was being crucified
The Bible says that the blood shed by the Lord Jesus on the cross is the blood of God's Son , and it is also God's own blood
Since the Son is the only begotten Son, He should not have any brothers; how then can He be also the firstborn Son?
When He was crucified, not only He died, but all those who were chosen by God and who believe in Him died with Him in His death
Our critics have made a big mistake because they think that we speak about this matter according to the teaching of the Arians
What he meant is that the Lord lost His human nature immediately after His resurrection and is therefore no longer a man
Acts 7 says that Stephen, before he was stoned to death, saw the Lord Jesus still standing as the Son of Man at the right hand of God
In Revelation 1, the apostle John saw that the Lord Jesus, who is walking in the midst of the golden lampstands, is like the Son of Man
John 1:51 proves that, in eternity, this Jesus will still be the Son of Man, on whom the angels of God will be ascending and descending
The title His Son denotes the Lord's divinity, which is needed for the eternal efficacy of the redeeming blood
The fullness of the entire Godhead-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-dwells in Christ as one who has a human body
When we put together all these items that are omitted in the creeds, we can see that the Divine Trinity is indeed a mystery
The more we study the matter of the Trinity, the more we have to admit that the Trinity is truly mysterious and incomprehensible
If we are only for doctrinal study, we cannot adequately explain even an ordinary fish, let alone the Triune God
They believe that all issues must be decided according to the resolutions of the Councils and not according to the Bible
The resolutions of the Councils are simply the creeds; therefore, their intention is to go back to the creeds that are seriously short
If you desire to serve the Lord full time for a long time, you must have the fundamental knowledge concerning this matter
Beginning with the second century, there were many disputes among Christians concerning the Divine Trinity and the Person of Christ
For this reason, a number of councils were convened to settle the controversies, and as a result, the so-called creeds were brought forth
The Greek word for consubstantial is homoousios: homo means 'same,' 'identical,' and ousios means 'essence of the substance' or 'element'
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three persons, but instead of having three identical essences, They have the same one essence
These teachers inserted the letter i in the middle of the Greek word for consubstantial to make it homoiousios, meaning 'identical essences'
The practice of the Roman Catholic Church is to add a little leaven to the truth so that eventually the whole lump is leavened
Many monasteries were established after the formation of the Catholic Church to teach people how to learn the truth by self-mortification
Otherwise, without the Triune God wrought into you, even if you have learned all the tasks and can do them well, you will still gain nothing
They are short of a total of eighteen items concerning the divinity and humanity of Christ; these items are not mentioned in their creeds
We have published in books the results of our sixty years of studying the Bible and respectfully present them before you
Most preachers follow the teaching of the Eastern Orthodox Church; their teaching of the Trinity is actually tritheism
In the previous chapter we pointed out that the Son is the image of the Father and that the Spirit is the eyes of the Son
The image of a person and the person himself are distinct but not separate; the eyes and the face are distinct but not separate
Revelation 5:6 says that the Lamb has seven horns and seven eyes and that the seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God
The stone and the Lamb are just one because both have seven eyes; furthermore, these seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God
What does it mean that the Son comes in the name of the Father and that the Son works in the name of the Father?
That the Son is the image of God means that the Son is the expression of God's being in all His attributes and virtues
The Son lives and does the works in the Father's name; then the Father sends the Holy Spirit in the Son's name
Because the Father sends the Holy Spirit in the Son's name, the Father's sending is the Son's sending; the Father and the Son are one
Since the Holy Spirit is sent in the Son's name, the Holy Spirit's coming is the Son's coming; the Holy Spirit and the Son are one
John 14:26 says that the Father sends the Holy Spirit in the Son's name and that the Holy Spirit comes in the Son's name
In 15:26 it says that the Son sends the Holy Spirit from the Father and that this Spirit proceeds from the Father
The Son sends the Holy Spirit from and with the Father; moreover, the Holy Spirit also comes from and with the Father
The Eastern Orthodox Church believes that the Spirit proceeds only from the Father and that only the Father is the source of the Spirit
When the Holy Spirit comes from the Father and the Son as the source, He does not leave the source but He comes with the source
When the Holy Spirit is sent, He comes with the Son in the Son's name and He comes also from and with the Father
Today's Christian teachers mostly teach tritheism, saying that when the Son comes, He comes alone, leaving the Father in heaven
Today, our critics are most afraid of three Scripture verses: 1 Corinthians 15:45; 2 Corinthians 3:17; and Isaiah 9:6
Some say that 'the Lord' in 2 Corinthians 3:17 is a general title of God and that it does not denote the Lord Jesus
No one can twist this word and say that the Father here does not refer to the Father in the Godhead but to another Father
In the entire book of Isaiah Jehovah is referred to twice as our Father indicating that the Eternal Father refers to God who is our Father
Hebrews 2:14 says, 'Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same'
The reason is that the flesh is involved with Satan-Satan is in the flesh of the fallen man and is the poison in the flesh of man
He humbled Himself even to the extent that, instead of being a high-class person, He became a slave to serve people
Since He includes God, in the Divine Trinity He is not only the Son, but He is also called the Father, and He is also the Spirit
Since He includes man, He became flesh as a man, taking the form of a slave, having the likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man
Blood, flesh, and bones evidently belong to a created being; therefore, it is illogical to say that the Lord Jesus is not a creature
Since Christ partook of blood and flesh , having a body with human blood, flesh, and bones, how could He not be a created One?
In God's eternal plan, in God's eternal economy, the Triune God agreed that the Son would become a man, would become flesh
Since the first Adam is the beginning of mankind, all human beings are descendants of Adam and all of them are 'Adams'
Manoah asked the Angel of Jehovah for His name, and He said, 'Why do you ask about My name, since it is wonderful'?
Instead of trying to comprehend these truths with our minds, we should simply receive them by faith according to God's revelation
Colossians 1:18 says that Christ is 'the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead'
Acts 167 mentions the Spirit of Jesus Romans 89 mentions the Spirit of Christ and Philippians 119 mentions the Spirit of Jesus Christ
The Lord Jesus poured out the Holy Spirit whom He had received from the Father, and He gives the Spirit not by measure
The exalted Christ's receiving of the promise of the Holy Spirit was actually His receiving of the Holy Spirit Himself
As the Head of the church, Christ not only pours out the Holy Spirit but also dispenses the Spirit to the believers without measure
Most likely they will tell you not to be too particular about this matter and that nevertheless He is the Son of God
Before His resurrection Christ was the Son of God only in His divinity; in His humanity He was not yet the Son of God but was the Son of Man
Through His resurrection His humanity was brought into divinity; thus, He was begotten to be the Son of God in His humanity
When He entered into resurrection, this man became the Son of God, and in His ascension this man was made the Lord
He was made Lord, the Lord of all , to possess all; He was also made Christ, God's Anointed , to carry out God's commission
In His work He created the universe and upholds and bears all things; He also made purification of our sins and accomplished redemption
We must very clearly see the divinity and humanity of Christ to be able to understand the mystery of the Divine Trinity
In conclusion, God is three, having three persons-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-yet He is surely one, being the one God
When we have the Son, we also have the Father and the Spirit; when we have the Spirit, we also have the Father and the Son
When the Spirit comes, the consummation of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit comes; the all-inclusive Spirit comes
Though angels praise the heavenly King, And worship Him as God alone, We can with exultation sing, 'He wears our nature on the throne'
In heaven Jesus sitting, Christ the Lord is there enthroned; As the man by God exalted, With God's glory He is crowned
He as God with man is mingled, God in man is testified; He as man with God is blended, Man in God is glorified
From the Glorified in heaven The inclusive Spirit came; All of Jesus' work and Person Doth this Spirit here proclaim
A man is now in heaven As the Lord of all enthroned; This is Jesus Christ our Savior, With God's glory ever crowned!
When we lead you to go out to knock on doors, we do not preach the low gospel but preach the meaning of human life instead
The melody and poetry of Hymns, 113 are very good but most of the content is too low; therefore, we rarely sing it
Most of the hymns they sang are concerning God's dispensing Himself into us, Christ as our life, and the church as His expression
It well becomes the saints of God; / Should we refuse our songs to raise, / The stones might tell our shame abroad'
With my growth in life and my increase in the knowledge of the spiritual truths, hymns that are crystals came out
In order to understand the matter of the Trinity, on the negative side, we must see the fifteen shortages of the creeds
Food, drink, feast, new moon, and Sabbath are not persons but things, which are just shadows; but the real body is Christ
If they had truly been enlightened, they would be able to see that the Lord Jesus is One who is so inclusive, extensive, and unlimited
Some theologians, failing to see the inclusiveness of Christ, are just like the blind feeling the elephant, touching only a particular part
On the other hand, they lack the view of Christ's inclusiveness and therefore become very shallow and shortsighted
They have not seen that Christ is not only a creature but also the Firstborn of all creatures-He is the man among all men
Rather, it says that Christ was a man in form, in likeness, and in fashion and that He also was in the likeness of the flesh of sin
For John 114 he wrote a note on the Word was made flesh saying that the Lord Jesus joined Himself to sinless humanity in His incarnation
If theologians hastily decide on doctrinal matters without a full view of Christ's all-inclusiveness, they will make big mistakes
He said that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so He, the Son of Man in the flesh, would be lifted up
He Himself acknowledged and implicitly told us that the bronze serpent in the Old Testament was a type, a figure, of Himself
In Revelation 5, the apostle John wept much when he saw that no one in the universe was able to open the mystery of God's economy
As a Shoot, Christ has two origins: one origin is David, the human origin; the other origin is God, the divine origin
Whether or not it will be a thoroughfare leading to great success depends on how you press forward on your own
In the recent ten or so years we have released many messages and published a number of books concerning this matter
There are over three hundred passages in the Bible referring to the economy of God either directly or indirectly
The Greek word oikonomia is made up of two words: oikos, denoting a 'house' or 'household,' and nomos, denoting a 'law' or 'principle'
With the household administration, there is a dispensation; with the dispensation, there is the need for a plan
When God makes His dispensation, He designs a number of administrative procedures for the carrying out of His economy
For this reason oikonomia may also be rendered dispensation which means arrangement or plan referring to Gods plan for His administration
The entire Bible reveals that God wants to work Himself into His chosen ones by passing through various processes in His Divine Trinity
They did not see that the same chapter clearly speaks of the purpose of God's predestination, saying that it is 'unto sonship'
What they meant is that we are not genuine sons of God but adopted sons of God; hence, we have obtained sonship through God's adoption
Ephesians chapter one begins by telling us how God works Himself into us through His Divine Trinity that we may obtain sonship
If we carefully study Romans 8 and Galatians 4 again, we will see that God's enabling us to receive sonship is not a simple matter
God the Father had to send His beloved Son to accomplish redemption for us that we may be qualified to receive sonship
When our parents begot us, they wrought themselves into us; that is, they passed on their life and nature to us
The Bible says that God is Spirit ; moreover, the ultimate manifestation of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is the Spirit
The second place is John 4:24: 'God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness'
When our human spirit is regenerated by the Holy Spirit, we can worship God as Spirit with our regenerated spirit
When He comes, He does not come into our body of blood and flesh, into our internal organs, such as the stomach
He comes into our spirit, which is the innermost part, the center, the most sincere part of our being, to be joined with us
According to the Greek, in the New Testament there is only one place-2 Corinthians 6:18-that says we are God's sons and daughters
As such, we must exercise to be led by His Spirit continually that we may grow in life and arrive at the stage of being His sons
On the one hand, it denotes the family, the household ; on the other hand, it denotes a habitation, a dwelling place
We must realize that if there were not a group of people who allowed God to work Himself into them, God would become homeless
In the Old Testament time, God sighed through the prophet, saying, 'Heaven is My throne, / And the earth the footstool for My feet
Through His death and resurrection He would bring man into God that man may be prepared to become God's dwelling place
In our organic union with the Divine Trinity we become the members of Christ; that is, we become His bone and His flesh
Collectively, as members of Christ we are constituted into one Body as a corporate expression of the Triune God in Christ
We, the regenerated believers, can become God's house and God's dwelling place because firstly we have been chosen by God in Christ
That we are in Christ refers not only to a change in our position in our being transferred by God out of Adam into Christ
The believers are joined to God the Father by repenting unto Him by being baptized into Him and by being born of Him to become His children
The believers need to be joined to God the Spirit essentially as the Spirit of life and also economically as the Spirit of power
The union we have with the Divine Trinity in different aspects is as organic as the grafting of a branch to the tree
As a result, we become the members of Christ , the branches of the true vine to constitute His Body, which is the church
As sinners we need Gods salvation second we have been ensnared and troubled by the devil so we need God to destroy the works of the devil
Because the financial situation of our family was not so good, sometimes our relatives or friends would give us some gifts
We all have a heart to go upward, and we resolve in our hearts to excel by strenuous efforts, yet our feet are always going downward
Most people in Christianity not only do not see the economy of God but they do not even see clearly the truth about the sinner and the devil
In Romans 7, Paul personified sin, saying that it is revived and very active and that it can deceive and kill people
Now He is doing a transforming and conforming work within us; in the future He will come again to glorify our body
Of course, we do not participate in His Godhead to become the object of worship; this is the difference between us and Him
In other words, we should not just see the facts recorded in the Bible, but we should also realize and experience them
If we really see the vision, we will certainly respond with an inner desire to realize, know, and experience God's economy
We can see from the very beginning of the New Testament, in Matthew chapter one, that the Triune God desires to dispense Himself into man
In Matthew 1, we can see at least four facts: the genealogy of Jesus, the conception of Jesus, the birth of Jesus, and the name of Jesus
He created man in His image and according to His likeness, and then He breathed into man the breath of life, giving man life and breath
Today those who graft trees know that trees of different species cannot be grafted together; only trees of the same species can be grafted
Despite the fact that there is evil today, the day will come in which nothing is evil and everything becomes a utopia
At the end of the last century, this school of theology was very prevailing and strongly influential in Europe
Today, however, forty years after the last great war, this school seems to be showing signs of gradually raising its head again
God put man in front of the tree of life that man might receive the life of the tree of life, which is a higher life
We must realize that our need for the life of God is recorded in Genesis 2 before sin had come in; sin did not come in until Genesis 3
Romans 9 says that we are vessels of mercy, then we will become vessels unto honor, and eventually we will be vessels unto glory
Today, however, we have God, so we have become vessels unto honor; in the future when we are in glory, we will become vessels unto glory
It is true that because we had fallen into the garbage can of sin and had become dirty, we needed God to wash us clean
It was at the beginning of the New Testament that we are clearly told that the Triune God entered into man and was mingled with man
Union is where two are merely joined together; mingling is where one enters into another, and the two are mingled together
God entered into man and produced this model, which was first seen in Matthew 1 as an individual, the Lord Jesus
The Bible with its sixty-six books is very rich in content, but its emphasis is very simple: the Triune God wants to work Himself into man
We all know that when a vessel is created to contain something, the vessel must be made the same as the thing it will contain
The Bible records this very clearly: 'And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature and in the grace manifested in Him before God and men'
After thirty-three and a half years, again, according to God's ordination, the Lord Jesus entered into death and then rose from the dead
When He entered into death, Satan thought it was he who had captured the Lord Jesus, put Him on the cross, and crucified Him there
Through death and resurrection, the Triune God is able to dispense Himself into the myriads of people that He has chosen
Today by the Lords mercy although our practice of doorknocking according to the Godordained way is very effective it is also very tiring
The divine revelation concerning the Triune God desiring to work Himself into man extends throughout the entire New Testament
Romans 1 speaks of the gospel of God, which is a gospel of the forgiveness of sins, a gospel of justification by faith
In the Old Testament the Triune God was outside of man; by Romans 8, the three of the Triune God are all in man
When Matthew 1 speaks of God's entering into man, it is individual; by Romans 8, God's entering into man is corporate
The Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, who has worked Himself into us and constituted us into a corporate bride
In other words, the Triune God is the Husband, and we who have been filled and transformed by Him become His bride to be one with Him
The Father is the Son and the Son is the embodiment of the Father the Son is realized in the Spirit and the Spirit is the reality of the Son
You just need to use your spirit, open your heart, and open your mouth to pray to the Lord; then you will be able to enjoy Him
When you call softly from the depths of your being, immediately you will return to your spirit, and your entire being will be revived
You must know that Satan always stirs up some trouble in our environment to disturb us and force us into anger
When you are angry, all the truths that you have ever heard become nothing; they are all made void and vanish into thin air
If another sister tracks dirt all over the floor which you had scrubbed clean the previous night, will you get angry?
You are disgusted with the sister who troubles you, and she also despises you; so how can there be the church?
When we have an inward union with the Lord and live in Him by this life union, the reality of the church is produced
If you have not seen or heard these truths you could not understand them even if you had realized them because you do not have the knowledge
In the Lords recovery you are nourished taught and have all the riches laid out before you in a delicious rich and easily digestible way
We have many books among us which speak about this point, that is, that you must always contact the Lord and continuously touch Him
The more you use your spirit to contact Him and call, 'O Lord Jesus,' the more you will sense His supply inwardly
The more you remember Him, appreciate Him, and consider His glory, beauty, and honor, the more you will be inwardly filled with His Spirit
The Pentecostal movement in Christianity today pays attention only to whether or not people have spoken in tongues
In the same principle, we cannot be filled just by praying; unless we touch the Lord, we cannot be filled with Him
Every time you touch Him you will sense the Fathers care and presence and receive the supply and transmission from the Father as the source
The bride is full of the Spirit, full of the enjoyment of the Spirit, and that the Spirit has all the ground in her
Back then, most architects did not approve of constructing a building with two ends over one hundred feet apart
If pillars were erected only on the two sides and not in the middle of the hall, the beams would not be secure
When you go to the meeting hall in Anaheim, you cannot see any steel; you can only see the stones, which are for beauty, for adornment
Whether it is beautiful or not and whether it is perfect or not does not have any harmful effect; at least it does not endanger your life
The central message of the Gospel of John is found in chapters fourteen through sixteen and in the concluding prayer in chapter seventeen
Although they saw these things, what they saw was superficial; they did not see the Triune God as the framework
As a result, Bible readers pay attention to where, thinking that it denotes a place, and neglect the Father Himself
The Son asked the Father to send the Spirit, and when the Spirit comes, He is not only the Comforter but also the Spirit of reality
When the Spirit enters into the believers, the Triune God is realized in them and mingled with them to become their life and essence
These things simply cannot be described by human language; they are hard to translate and even harder to explain
In John 6 the Lord's word was so difficult to understand that many of the disciples said, 'This word is hard; who can hear it'?
When Peter heard the Lord's speaking, he realized that since the Lord's words were spirit and life, they had to be words of eternal life
Although many of the disciples did not understand what the Lord was saying, at least there was one, Peter, who understood
Whether in the study of the Bible, in the spiritual service, or in the growth in life, you will have a foundation
Next, you must also see that our God, the Triune God in the universe, has a purpose, a plan, an intention, and a work
Since He is not a confused or mixed up God, He certainly has an economy; this is another great matter that we must see
The Lord Jesus was not appointed after He was born as a man; rather, He had already been appointed in eternity past
When Christ created the universe and when the created things began their existence, that was the beginning of time
John 1:3 says, 'All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being'
The universe refers not only to the heavens and the earth but also to all the ages in the heavens and the earth
These ages did not take place by development or evolution; rather, they were founded, instituted, by the Lord Jesus
In every scene the characters do not just stand still; rather, they are acting out the story according to the script
The Lord Jesus not only created the roles for us but also established the content of each scene; thus, the universe came into existence
Many things have happened age after age, but people in the world do not understand the mysteries hidden in all these occurrences
Some of you might not be saved if you had not been born in Taiwan; others might not be saved if they had not gone to America
In China forty years ago, to travel from my hometown, Chefoo, to Shanghai, one could take only the boat, and it would take forty-eight hours
It mainly tells us that an angel announced the good news saying Today a Savior has been born to you in Davids city who is Christ the Lord
The angel's announcement of the good news is recorded in the Gospel of Luke, telling us that the Lord Jesus was born to be a Savior
The Gospel of John does not announce the glad tidings of the Savior's birth; rather, it says, 'The Word became flesh'
The Word became flesh, and this Word was God , not just a partial God, but the entire God, including the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
When oil and fine flour are mingled each still retains its own characteristics yet they are mingled to become one entity the unleavened cake
We must see that after we are saved, God has come into us not only to be joined but also to be mingled with us
The four Gospels show us that the Lord lived out God in His humanity when He was in the process of experiencing the human life
When He loved people, you may say that was man's love, or you may also say that was God's love shown in man's love
They have not seen that these four biographies are a portrayal of a man who passed through human life to live out another life
As a result, God and He, He and God, had one life and one living; They both lived by the same life and lived out the same living
After saying that He lived because of the Father, the Lord went on to say, 'So he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me'
It seems that the New Testament contains some words for improvement, words that teach us to reform ourselves and to do good
If we study the context carefully we will see that those are the fruits of our having the same life and the same living with Christ our Lord
In His experience of the human life the Lord Jesus lived out God among men that God might be expressed in humanity
You will know the meaning and the goal of your pursuit for the growth in life and your endeavor in the spiritual service
The truths concerning the accomplishments of Christ have been made shallow by the majority of today's Christian teachers
It is true that the fundamentalists speak about all these matters, but what they speak is very shallow and too common
As a result, these shallow, common things occupy people's inner being and hinder them from receiving the deeper truths
Many truths taught in Christianity are just candies; they are not only shallow but also damaging to people's taste
The main revelation of the New Testament is the three accomplishments of Christ: His death, His resurrection, and His ascension
The death of Christ is not only profound but also hard to preach because it involves many complicated items and includes many details
We go on to chapter four, where the Bible says that Cain presented an offering to God from the fruit of the ground
Abel, however, presented an offering from the firstlings of his flock, that is, from their fat portions; in this we can see death
Isaiah 537 says Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers So He did not open His mouth
The One 'whom they have pierced' is Christ, and the 'wounds between arms' denote the spear wound He suffered on the cross
Yuan tsui, the original sin, refers to the sin committed by Adam; whereas pen tsui, one's own sin, refers to sins committed by ourselves
In another sense, the original sin is the nature of sin, whereas the sins we committed ourselves are the deeds of sin
Sin has many offsprings, such as transgressions, iniquities , sins of guilt , errors , turning aside , wickedness, and trespasses
The Chinese philosophers discovered this law a little later, but instead of calling it a law, they called it a 'principle'
Within Satan there is an evil thing that is not found in any other angel or any other creature; it is uniquely his
Even the Chinese philosophers who achieved a great deal in their study concerning the origin of sin were unable to answer this question
In John 3:14 the Lord Jesus said, 'And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up'
The bronze serpent had the form of the serpent but was without the serpent's poison; it had the serpent's form but not the serpentine nature
When the bronze serpent was hung on the pole, only the serpent's form was hung there; it was not an actual poisonous serpent
It was in such a 'likeness of the flesh of sin' that God condemned sin and dealt with everything related to sin
The Lord Jesus dealt with our inward sin, the gene of sin, by becoming sin on our behalf and condemning and judging sin in the flesh of sin
When Satan rebelled against God, some of the angels followed Satan in his rebellion and became the fallen angels, the unclean spirits
The entire world from the past to the future is a kosmos, a whole entity, composed of many ages, each of which is an aion
After the Republic was established, that was the age of the Republic, and the people at that time had their fashion
Mans body was transmuted into flesh because the element of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil the element of Satan was added into it
In the Bible the flesh includes man's corrupted body , the entire fallen man , and even the good aspects of man
In Romans 8:8, concerning the flesh Paul made this conclusion: 'And those who are in the flesh cannot please God'
God hates the flesh just as much as He hates Satan; God wants to destroy the flesh just as much as He wants to destroy Satan
Through this, all the created things, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens, were reconciled to God
Hebrews 2:9 clearly says that Christ tasted death not only on behalf of everyone but also on behalf of everything
By passing through death Christ dealt with sin, Satan, the world, the flesh, the old man, and the old creation
Not only are there barriers between the Jews and the Gentiles, but there are also barriers among the nationalities and races
On the one hand, Hebrews 2:14 says that the Lord Jesus partook of blood and flesh and destroyed Satan through His death on the cross
Paul, who wrote Hebrews, also told us to beware of the devil lest we be taken advantage of by him, for we are not ignorant of his schemes
In Ephesians 6:11 Paul also exhorted us to put on the whole armor of God that we may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil
After one thousand years, he will then be released again to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth
That will be his final activity, in which he would deceive the nations on the earth to rebel against God for the last time
We must realize that the revelations in the Bible always have two sides: one side is the fact and the other side is the fulfillment
According to the seeing by faith, that is, according to God's view, all these items which we see as alive are already actually dead
Faith is not something which we have naturally; faith is produced by seeing certain persons, things, and matters which we appreciate
On the one hand, faith is not by sight; on the other hand, faith greatly requires seeing, that is, it requires revelation
The Bible is full of revelations, and even the last book is called Revelation, a book that reveals the treasures
Today when we read the Bible, we need to learn not only to read the dead letter but even more to see the revelations contained therein
Once we have faith, we are living in the vision, and as a result, our old man, sin, and the devil will all be dead in our experience
If we do not live in the vision which Revelation has shown us, our old man, sin, and the devil will all be alive
While we are living on the earth, we must believe only in God and in His words and not in the environment that we see
The entire Bible, especially the New Testament, is a revelation that shows us the facts according to God's view
In this and the following chapter, we review the practice of the new way so that we may make some changes and adjustments
The so-called new practices are those which are already in the holy Scriptures but are not being practiced by us
Today in the research stage of our practice of the new way, we must at least get rid of this kind of religious formality
In our training, on the one hand, we are researching and experimenting, and on the other hand, we are also correcting
Now we have no problem bringing people to salvation; we can get a person baptized with only fifteen minutes of gospel preaching
After we have begotten them, we should not neglect them; if we do not nourish or cherish them, they will surely die prematurely
What we are doing today might be changed tomorrow; if it is being spread outside from one to the other, this will cause many difficulties
Although they are not in the training, they want to know what we are doing here and how we are leading here that they may closely follow
Human beings are human beings; hence, they are still very anxious and they insistently question what we are doing here
More than ten saints serving full-time in their locality were not accepted into the training because they did not have sufficient education
After watching they must not go and carry it out right away, because they will surely not be able to practice it properly
In the original language, the preposition used here denotes 'for,' 'on behalf of,' 'instead of,' 'in the interest of'
If you want to write nicely, you need to copy or imitate by using a copybook, tracing each stroke accurately; you must not be a bit careless
Visiting people by door-knocking is a course of great learning for changing the system to practice the new way
Maybe some of you can no longer wait; you think that you have already been trained for two years and must now graduate
Although the time of our research has not been very long, visiting by door-knocking has definitely been proven to be an effective way
Once this kind of spirit comes out, it can produce all kinds of effects; when it touches people, it can cause them to be open and released
Someone said that he knocked on thirty to forty doors and none of them opened, so immediately he was disheartened
When you go door-knocking, you must have a proper attitude: An unopened door is not discouraging but rather a normal thing
If everyone would open the door and were all predestinated by God, then would it be necessary for us to labor in this matter?
The most important point is that you must avoid aimless speaking and learn to cope with all kinds of situations by remaining calm
Someone may say that he does not have time or that he believes in another religion, but do not pay attention to his excuse
As you are serving in the various meeting halls, you should first knock on all the doors in the neighborhood of the meeting hall
You all can testify that the most effective way for door-knocking is to follow the way established by the training
The other ways, the natural ways, may appear to be helpful superficially, but in fact they are damaging to you
When you go door-knocking, if there are local saints coordinating with you, of course it is a very big help, but you must not rely on them
At present when you go out, you are still practicing; in a year or two you should be able to be coaches when you go back
When your practice results in proficiency, you will be a tremendous help to the meeting halls or churches when you go back
Although the United States is rich, the people there are negligent in the matter of diet; it is as if they are committing a slow suicide
Even the United States government requires tobacco companies to place a label on cigarette cartons warning that 'smoking may cause cancer'
The second thing that people should not consume is cured pork; this is according to the research of the United States government
When you go to the Christian bookstores, you cannot buy any 'food'; even if there is some 'food,' it is just 'small candies'
The really tasty steamed bread does not need anything added to it; it is made in such a way that the fragrance of the wheat comes out
If The Mystery of Human Life contains these two ingredients, then your door-knocking surely will be even more effective
In the same principle previously we often used the love feast as a way of preaching the gospel but now the method has advanced and improved
He preached the gospel to an old man, but after he talked for a long time, the old gentleman still was not saved
To speak more or to speak less is not the important point; what is important is whether or not we touch the person
We are studying how to improve the product, how to strengthen the word used for injection, and also how to improve our techniques
The seeds have to be right, the techniques have to be right, and even the more we the laboring ones have to be right
There were one thousand and thirty-four persons who were baptized and 2,397 homes that want to be visited again
In other words, we need to study how much time you should spend from now on when you go to visit and take care of the baptized saints
After a person is baptized, we still need to continue to revisit, to take care of him, and to establish a meeting in his home
To lead someone to grow in life, we cannot stay away from the truth; without the truth it is very difficult for him to grow
When you lead others to grow in life and to get into the truth, eventually you will be able to lead them into the church life
When people are saved and baptized, immediately they are in the church, but they are not living in the church life yet
It is not until this training has researched enough and has practiced thoroughly that we can present all these things to all the saints
These ones are not only familiar to us, but they have also become our kinsfolk, our brothers and sisters, in the Lord
Especially in helping them to know the truth, if you are speaking to just one or two persons, the taste will not be so rich
At present we already have good seeds and good techniques for the preaching of the gospel by door-knocking to lead people to salvation
Concerning how to lead them to grow in life learn the truth properly and enter into the church life we still need to find the good seeds
On the other hand, due to the different situations of the different districts, you cannot be too rigid and inflexible
Since one of the goals of this training is to evangelize the whole island of Taiwan, in the future you will all be going to the villages
For this reason if you meet some native Taiwanese during your doorknocking and visitations it is best if you practice speaking in Taiwanese
In some of the homes which you knock on today, only the children are home and the parents are not there, or nobody may be home
You need to keep a record, with remarks concerning all these situations, and find time to knock on these doors again
We may not be able to thoroughly research all of these points during this term, but they must be the goals toward which we strive
About a hundred years ago, China was technologically underdeveloped and remained in a very conservative condition, so Japan went ahead of us
Neither the Mongols nor the Manchus were successful in conquering China in the end they were all assimilated and blended with the Han people
The ethical and moral culture of China was passed down from generation to generation and was established in the homes
If you attend a poor school, then the English you learn there will have the wrong pronunciation and the wrong grammar
