<h2 class="head2">Forsaking the Past Ministries</h2><p>Jonathan stood between Saul and David. He was one man standing between two ministries. He should have followed the second ministry. However, because Jonathan's relationship with the first ministry was too deep, he could not disentangle himself. In order to catch up with the ministry of the age, there is the need for us to see the vision. Michal was married to David, yet she did not see anything. She only saw David's condition before God, and she could not tolerate it. As a result, she was left behind (2 Sam. 6:16, 20-23).</p><h2 class="head2">All Being a Matter of God's Mercy</h2><p>It is God's mercy that a person can see and come into contact with the ministry of that age. Yet it is altogether a different thing for a man to take up the courage to forsake the past ministry. It is a precious thing to see, and it is a blessed thing to come into contact with something. Yet whether or not one can set aside his past ministry is entirely up to God's mercy.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE CONTENT OF THE MINISTRY</h2><h2 class="head2">The Outward Man Being Broken,<br />and the Inward Life Being Released</h2><p>Witness Lee: What is the relationship between the knowledge of life and the service?</p><p>Watchman Nee: The word knowledge cannot adequately describe the way we are taking. Whether or not a man's ministry can be released depends not only on whether he knows life, but on whether his outward man is broken. The content of the ministry is fully a matter of the life within.</p><p>We have an outward man, and we have an inward man. Some people's outward man is broken, and their ministries are released. Many years ago I gave a message on the Lord's Day morning entitled "Deep Calls unto Deep.'' A man who is not broken outwardly can only have "shallow calls unto shallow.''</p><p>Every one of the brothers from Kiangsu is an eloquent speaker. Yet, when a person touches them, he feels that there is something wrong. These brothers are like drops of oil on the water. They are shallow, and they do not have any depth. If you ask them to speak, they can speak with their clever minds for two hours. But after their speech, you cannot touch their spirit at all.</p><h2 class="head2">The Outward Man Being Broken<br />for the Inward Man to Be Released</h2><p>What we need today is for the outward man to be broken. If the outward man is not broken, the inward man will not be released. Everything outward has to be broken. Only when that which is outward is broken can that which is inward be released. The earthen vessel has to be broken before the treasure can be released (2 Cor. 4:7). As long as the ointment is in the alabaster box, the fragrance will not be released. Only when the box is broken will the fragrance be released (John 12:3).</p><p>God deals with us daily through our environment. On the one hand, the Lord works in us. On the other hand, He makes arrangements in our environment. Strictly speaking, for a Christian there is no such thing as the environment; with him, there is only the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Every environment is a discipline of the Holy Spirit. The purpose of these disciplines is to break our outward man. Once a man's thoughts are broken, his inward man flows out. Once a man's emotions are broken, his inward man also flows out.</p><h2 class="head2">The Release of Our Inward Man<br />to Touch Others' Inward Man</h2><p>We should never think that as long as we say the right thing and the proper words, we will be all right. There is another question: Do the words we say come from our outward man or our inward man? We can only blame the co-workers for the condition of the brothers in Kiangsu. A person whose outward man has not been broken may use the same terms and speak the same thing; his words may even mean the same thing. Yet we cannot touch anything in the words he speaks. If we want to serve others, our outward man must be broken. Only when the outward man is broken can the inward man be released. Only when our inward man comes out can we touch others' inward man.</p>
