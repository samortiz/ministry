   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Mixture</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible tells us that God chose Jerusalem as the place to put His name and build up His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God told His people that when they got into the good land, they had no right to choose the place in which they would worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They had to go to the place of His choice.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He would choose a place out of all their tribes to put His name and to build up His habitation Deut 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They all had to come to that unique place to worship the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was for the keeping of the unity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was by this unique place of worship to God that the unity of His people was kept for generations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This unique place was Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Jerusalem the house of God was built, and the glory of God filled that house 1 Kings 8:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That was the golden age of the history of the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to destroy Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He burned the house of God in Jerusalem, carried away all the vessels in God's house for God's worship, and put them in the temple of his idols in Babylon 2 Chron 36:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What a contradiction this was.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows that even in Babylon, there are some of the things related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the temple of idols in Babylon, there are some vessels belonging to God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This brings us to the fourth point concerning Babylon: it is a mixture of the things of God with the things of the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The vessels used in God's house were in the temple of the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the New Testament this mixture is enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John in the spirit saw a vision of the great Babylon Rev 17:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Babylon is decorated, gilded, with all the things of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The New Jerusalem is built with three precious materials: gold, precious stones, and pearls Rev 21:18-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The great Babylon is gilded with gold, precious stones, and pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She gives people the appearance that she is the same as the New Jerusalem, but she is not built in a solid way with these precious things; she is only gilded with these treasures as ornaments for outward display.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a deception intending to entice people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the harlot's false appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The difference between apostate Christendom and the genuine church is that one is a mixture, but the other is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the New Jerusalem there is no mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everything is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Revelation 21:18 says the city is pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Also, the river of water of life is bright as crystal Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is absolutely pure, without mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The description in Revelation 17 says that this evil woman, the evil Babylon, holds a golden cup in her hand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But this golden cup is "full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication" v. 4 . Outwardly it is golden, but inwardly there are evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It has spiritual persons, some precious stones, like Madame Guyon, Father Fenelon, and Brother Lawrence, who give some outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But inwardly it is full of all kinds of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The local churches have to be crystally transparent, with no mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those of us who were in Christianity can testify concerning its hypocrisy and falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many good things are there to give a good appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when you get into it, you see the evil mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not be deceived by the outward appearance of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What it has is an outward gilding, an outward decoration, but inwardly the situation is different.</S>
