We should not merely obtain some enjoyment from them; rather, we should gain some practical knowledge and experience
Although it does not focus on any particular topic, it has a central theme that is comprehensive, encompassing many matters
They may have understood a point here and a point there, but they have not been able to gain a complete understanding
Because they are comprehensive and are not focused on one specific topic, it is difficult for people to see the center
In the same way, we must be able to point out how Exodus speaks about the death of Christ and His resurrection
There is the unleavened bread that typifies Christ Jesus who is our nourishment of life and who takes away all our sinful and evil things
Finally there are the bitter herbs that indicate that we need to regret and repent, to experience bitterness in the matter of sinful things
Christ is also the tabernacle of God, that is, the dwelling place of God and the dwelling place of us, the priests
We can abide in Him enjoying the inward supply of the golden lampstand the table of the bread of the Presence and the golden incense altar
The meat of the lamb was distributed to all the people, and if anyone did not eat, he did not partake of the rich supply of Christ the Lamb
If we compare our experiences to these types, they are very easy to understand because they are descriptions of our normal Christian living
Some people might have been lazy and reluctant to rise early in the morning, so they did not gather the manna and were hungry all day
It indicates that the supply of life is for our enjoyment for one day only and cannot be kept over to the next day
The meat was eaten to get into the people, signifying the resurrected Christ entering into us as our spiritual supply
Manna came down from heaven to the Israelites, signifying Christ coming down from heaven as food for God's people
Manna came from God and descended from heaven, implying that when Christ ascended, He ascended to God, that is, to the Father
It also shows the Israelites eating the meat of the lamb and taking it into them as a type of the resurrected Christ as our life supply
In the past when people read the Bible, they could not find the way to enter in, so they had no way to understand it
Mere exposition of the Bible is just the impartation of knowledge which causes people to know doctrines mentally
Some pastors do not have anything to talk about, so they speak about things such as sanitary practices and personal hygiene
Some are a little better and speak about matters such as redemption, the washing away of sins, and justification
We have seen from our experience and our research that the richest meetings are those with the life-study messages as their content
If every Lord's Day we would take two life-study messages as the content of our fellowship, the meeting would be very rich
Fish is very nutritious, but if we only ate fish for three meals a day without eating anything else, we definitely would not be healthy
The life-study messages are like a salad that is made not with just one kind of vegetable but with all different kinds
At present, we have dug out life from each book of the New Testament and even the Old Testament books of Genesis and Exodus
Although the Bible was written comprehensively, speaking much on many topics, it always has life as its center to clearly point out the way
Even the short book of Ephesians with only six chapters is composed in a comprehensive way, speaking on many topics
It also speaks of very low matters-matters which could not be any lower-as in the word that those who steal should steal no more
If today we were to choose a topic and speak of God's calling and predestination, we would not also speak of such things as stealing
After the book of Ephesians speaks of such high matters, it suddenly inserts just such a sentence, telling those who steal to steal no more
Some people have said that in the life-study messages there are many new, deep terms that are hard for ordinary saints to understand
In recent years American educators have discovered that as our era progresses, the knowledge of our children progresses along with it
The things which children are able to understand according to their intelligence far surpass the contents of their textbooks
The first step was taken when the Western missionaries spoke messages about joy and peace in order to get people to accept their preaching
Our knowledge of the truth has not only been constantly progressing, but the younger we are, the more room there is for progress
We must be willing to change our concepts and must encourage the young ones to learn the highest and deepest truths
If we do not have the technique or secret, people will not understand us even when we speak the shallowest truths
It is just like in the elementary schools today, where what they are teaching is much higher than what was taught ten or twenty years ago
May we all be able to really perfect the young people in the truth and encourage them to enter into the depths of the Lord's word
The seedlings may not be very evident in the first couple of years, but they will be manifested by the third year
After a while the formerly unsightly, small tree seedlings will grow quite big and tall and will begin to produce fruit
Even though initially they might have looked like they were about to die, eventually they will be so living and exuberant
The other way is to assume full leadership in the church in that locality after the church has handed itself over to us
The elders will still be elders, the co-workers will still be co-workers, and the deacons will remain as deacons
The senior co-worker who had represented all the co-workers in handing themselves over actually had not really handed himself over
The church in Manila had been given to the service of the six of them, so they should pray earnestly to see how things should be handled
They also said that though the church needed to preach the gospel, the church more urgently needed the building up
For the building up of the church it would not be absolutely necessary to invite this brother to preach the gospel
Since the original elders felt that they did not have a more convincing or stronger argument, they finally agreed not to invite this brother
The purpose of going over this history is so that we would realize that the turmoil in the church in Manila in 1961 did not begin in 1961
The opposing ones wrote on a long bench in the old meeting hall: 'Down with the four elders; cast out Witness Lee'
The Spaniards brought Catholicism to the Philippines, and later the missionaries from the United States came to work here
Most Filipinos know only a little about God and have heard only a fraction of the gospel, which in most cases was not the pure gospel
Thank the Lord that He gave us a period of eleven years to open up the entire New Testament, chapter by chapter and verse by verse
During those eleven years we studied exhaustively and what the Lord unveiled to us has now been put into print for you to have in your hands
There may be almost fifty million Christians in the Philippines, but they are all in an unclear state-they are in a cloud
No one is able to destroy or overthrow the Lord's recovery on this earth because it has a very solid foundation
We know this is just the beginning; thousands more will come into the Lord's recovery to enter into the divine truths
One day they will all be able to stand up before millions to preach the pure gospel and to speak the divine truths
Through the church as the organic Body and God's garden, the Lord will be able to fulfill His purpose and accomplish His economy
When we see the older people, we also cannot help but smile, because they are the fathers, the base of the church
Those who serve practically in the churches in every place, especially the young ones, must learn some skills and secrets
We must study the Bible thoroughly until we can see that the gospel is God Himself and that the truth is also God Himself
The gospel is not merely a kind of message but God Himself; the truth is not merely a doctrine but God Himself
Unfortunately, due to the degradation of the church, the light of the gospel dissipated and the light of the truth also became dim
Came the time of the Reformation when the primary work of the reformers was to release the truths in the Bible
Today it can be said that the light of the gospel and of the truth is shining as bright and full as the sun at noonday
We may say that the light in Christian publications has been extremely sparse for the past one and a half centuries
As a result, the theology taught today in every country covers the light of the truth only up to one hundred fifty years ago
There was a sculpture of this so-called 'Jesus the Black Nazarene,' the toes of which had been worn down from being touched by the Catholics
In the past sixty years the Lord has been opening up the Bible to us day by day, chapter by chapter, and verse by verse
He will continue to do so until all of the truths from Genesis to Revelation are completely transparent, opened, and unveiled to us
After listening, this one was captured by the Lord and confessed that he had never heard this kind of message before
As the next day was the Lord's Day, he had to preach a sermon so he went back to West Texas to fulfill his duty
Now the situation is no longer the same; we see English being taught even in the elementary schools in Mindanao
When they read it, they use their mind to comprehend it, so there is no way for them to see the spiritual mysteries
The wives already have these concepts in them; there is no need to read the Bible in order to have such an understanding
Similarly all husbands desire to love their wives, but their greatest problem is that their wives are not submissive
Ephesians 5 not only speaks about these two things, it also reveals a much deeper truth, which is that we must be filled with God in spirit
Most Christians when reading the Bible only see that it teaches people to be forbearing, patient, kind, righteous, and temperate
They consider this kind of teaching to be good and proper and more or less the same as the teachings of the Chinese Confucianists
Almost no one understands why Matthew chapter one records Christ's genealogy or why it is presented in the way that it is
If we would read the Bible along with the life-study messages, we would be able to see the significance of every name
The more we read, the more we will be clear and the more we will have the sense that the entire book has been opened to us
As a result, we will be able to enter into the depths of Matthew and come to the knowledge of the true significance of the divine revelation
If he continues with another four years of college, by age twenty-two he will be more enlightened inwardly and able to teach others
Even if you are no longer a young person, it would be best for you to go back to school to get a college education if possible
We are certainly happy to see the elderly saints, but it is very difficult for us to demand that they spend more effort to pursue the truth
In God's creation there are two important points-one is the creation of life, and the other is the creation of man
People today promote the building up of their countries, but no matter how much building work they do, they can never produce life
When He created the living things, God started from the lowest form of life and then progressed to the higher forms of life
Since the human life has God's image, it also has love, light, holiness and righteousness, making it the highest created life
When man fell, not only was there a charge of sin against him before God, but also the sinful nature was in his flesh
In His human nature were all kinds of human virtues, the principal ones being love, light, holiness, and righteousness
The result was that after contacting over five hundred people during a period of several years, over three hundred were saved
Today many Christians, even many pastors and preachers, do not necessarily understand the truth conveyed in the diagram of the three circles
We should not preach this; instead, we should use the diagram of the three circles to preach on the three parts of man
The second main point of God's incarnation is that this God-man went to the cross to suffer death to accomplish eternal redemption
Whenever this word is mentioned, theologians understand it as the different methods by which God deals with people
In reality, this term in Latin and English theology denotes God's arrangement, which is the divine administration
When we use this term today, we are referring not to God's arrangement or administration but to God's dispensing
In the same way, when God dispenses Himself into us, we are regenerated with God's life and nature to become God's children
Regeneration, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification are the five steps of God's work in dispensing Himself into us
At the end of the age, when the Lord Jesus comes again, He will glorify us, that is, He will come out of us as glory
We believe that this is the only way we can bring the Lord back as well as meet the need of human society in its present vain condition
We should bear this burden to diligently study the truth to the extent that we can expound the truth and announce the truth
We need the spiritual enlightening of the Spirit of God to understand them, and we also need to spend time to dig them out
We must know not just a small part or one aspect of the truth but rather the truth in its entirety and in all of its aspects
We must diligently learn all of these things, obtain the knowledge of them, and be able to speak them clearly to others
The above points merely show the different aspects of the truth, not the mysteries of the truth in their entirety
Our God is the Triune God, and He wants to dispense Himself into His chosen ones to be their life and everything
They do not see that the purpose of God's creation of man was to make it possible for Him to dispense Himself into man
The hand has five fingers; thus, for a glove to be worn by the hand, it must resemble the five fingers of the hand
Genesis chapter two continues to show us that when God created man, He breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life
Little by little it has been uncovered to us through the books of the Bible that the human spirit is for contacting and containing God
Man's body requires food for nourishment; however, for the food to be put into man, there needs to be a container
Like the Jews in those days, many Christians are puzzled when they come to this portion of the Word, having no idea what the Lord meant
Nicodemus thought that to be born anew was to return to the mother's womb, so he said, 'How can a man be born when he is old?
The Lord answered that to be born anew is to be born of water and of the Spirit because that which is born of the Spirit is spirit
John tells us that while the Lord was on the earth for over thirty years, He was never lonely because the Father was always with Him
When a sinner repents on earth and prays to the Lord, calling on His name, immediately the Spirit comes, bringing the Father with the Son
Formerly there was darkness within us, but once we called on the name of the Lord Jesus, immediately there was light
When we are filled to the extent that we overflow with joy, we will say, 'It is no longer I, but it is Christ'!
It is amazing that we are filled inwardly with the Spirit, yet we would say that the One who lives in us is Christ
When we are beside ourselves, we do not care about east or west or heaven or earth, and we are neither shy nor fearful
In other words, this Spirit is the Triune God-the Father, Son, and Spirit-completely filling us and enveloping us
Before speaking, these people usually exercise their spirits by calling on the Lord, in order for them to be fed within
We must speak Christ to people, and we must be 'crazy' toward them, telling them that everything else is poor and that Jesus is the best
We will be with Him in the millennial kingdom, enjoying His joy, His presence, His glory, and His authority for a thousand years
The New Jerusalem is the ultimate expression of the mingling of God and man-God living in man and man living out God's glory
Although the millennial kingdom and the New Jerusalem have not come, today in the church life we can have a foretaste of this in miniature
When we preach and speak in this way, the essential Spirit will fill us inwardly, and the economical Spirit will fill us outwardly
At this juncture the life we live will be a life of love light holiness and righteousness and we will spontaneously live out Gods image
The Christ we are referring to here is not the objective Christ who is sitting in the heavens but the subjective Christ who is our life
Most preachers can cover many topics in their sermons, but it is difficult for them to definitely present a particular truth to people
In addition, even when a clear and precise definition of incarnation is presented, most people still forget what they have heard right away
Note 3 of 1 John 1:5 says that love is the nature of God's essence, and light is the nature of God's expression
We must learn to differentiate between love and light and between holiness and righteousness, and we must also speak these things accurately
If you take something that costs twenty dollars, but you pay only ten dollars, this is the same as stealing ten dollars
God would never approve of drinking and smoking, because He is holy, and He would never take advantage of people, because He is righteous
The five fingers of the hand are hidden in the glove; they are not for a nice appearance but for the rich content
The five fingers of the hand, as the attributes, are hidden in the five fingers of the glove to enrich and strengthen the glove
The virtues referred to in the Bible have the divine attributes as their content and are thus enriched, strengthened, and excelling
God is a God of love, light, holiness, and righteousness, so you also have the virtues of love, light, holiness, and righteousness
Once you call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, this Spirit will enter into you, that is, God will enter into you
His real love, light, holiness, and righteousness will fully enrich your love, light, holiness, and righteousness'
To make it easier for people to experience and apply these truths subjectively, we may use the following illustration
God's love will be in his love, and as a result, he will be able to love his wife, regardless of how she treats him
Just like the person in this illustration, we have patience, which was created by God, that is like the fingers of an empty glove
We should no longer be like the elderly church members in Christianity who have been saved for decades but are still ignorant of the truth
Although we have spoken many high truths in the past, we have never precisely defined the meaning of the name Jesus Christ
If a person does not quite understand the definitions of various things, his speaking concerning them will not be so definite and accurate
There is a hymn which says that the church is not a school or a factory but an organic garden of God for growing Christ
Their education was conducted in their homes with the parents bearing the responsibility of teaching their children
Now the life-study messages present the truth in a clear and precise way, so that people can readily understand the truth after reading them
We must not be influenced by confused Christianity any longer; instead, we should completely renounce all the old practices
In this way, when we speak to people, we will not give them knowledge or doctrines, but we will minister Christ to them
Acts 542 tells us that the early disciples announced the gospel of Jesus as the Christ this means they announced Jesus Christ as the gospel
What they announced was not an empty doctrine nor an elusive gospel but a living Jesus Christ, who is the reality and content of the gospel
Paul did not announce some doctrines; rather, he supplied them practically with the riches of the Lord Jesus Christ
He also passed through human living, experienced all the trials and ordeals of human life, and endured all the pains of humanity
We must tell people that this Christ, who possesses all these unsearchable riches, is now the life-giving Spirit
We will realize that our love is boundless, our patience is enduring and transcendent, and our power is strong
Once they pray, the Spirit will come into them and enable them to touch the reality and comprehend and receive Christ
The slow increase in the churches is due to the fact that we do not know how to speak the truth or how to minister Christ
We do not know how to present Christ clearly as the truth to people, nor do we know how to supply them with Christ as the living Spirit
Aside from time for your schoolwork, you should not waste any time but always seize every opportunity to speak the truth to your classmates
Redemption resolves the problem of our sins, redeems us back to God, and deals with the problem of our position
Salvation is related to God's purpose and includes God's regenerating, sanctifying, renewing, transforming, and conforming us into His image
Gradually they will notice that your Bible knowledge is advanced and that your knowledge of the truth is very clear
In time, all our neighbors will realize that we are those who know the Bible, who are clear about the truth, and who experience Christ
Now there are five thousand saints in the church in Taipei, and the population of the city of Taipei is two million
If we believe in Him and receive Him, we will be able to live out the human virtues of love, light, holiness, and righteousness
In short, the reason we cannot lead people to the Lord is that we do not know how to speak the truth or minister Christ
We have to learn, starting with the basics and going on to understand the fundamental truths and to study the deeper truths
Some people say that they are really busy, but once they get on the telephone, they spend half an hour to an hour gossiping
If we have the desire to enter into the truth, there is no lack of reference books, and they are not difficult to get into
The difference is that the truth is an outward definition and explanation, and life is the inward and intrinsic content
If we are not clear about the truth and do not understand or know the truth, we will have no way to enjoy the Lord as our life
All experienced Christians confess that no one can enjoy Christ as life if he does not know the Bible or understand the truth in the Bible
When we read the Bible, if we study only the letter but not the intrinsic truth within, we will not receive life
Rather, we want to minister to God's people for their growth by planting and watering as the apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3:6 and 9
We must realize that the church is different from human society and distinct from all the different Christian organizations
If today someone were to tell us, 'I am the life,' we would surely think that this person was either a fool or insane
He would not have been able to speak such a word unless He possessed exceptional wisdom and extraordinary reality
If He were not God and the everliving Spirit and if He did not possess supreme and extraordinary wisdom how could He have said such a word
Just by this word we ought to believe that the Lord Jesus is extraordinary and far superior to Confucius and Socrates
He was a fisherman from Galilee an uneducated man and a layman but after he received this transcendent life he became a transcendent person
He was a Galilean fisherman, yet he was able to say that he was one who received God's life and partook of God's nature
The reason we have God's life and nature is because Jesus Christ came into us and dispensed God's life into us
From that time on, we have had the sense that we are very close to God and may spontaneously call Him, 'Abba, Father'!
The truth they teach is completely distorted because they think that the Holy Spirit in us is merely the representative of Christ
The New Testament does not say that the Christ who is sitting in the heavens has sent merely a representative to be in us
The New Testament emphasizes that the Christ who is sitting in the heavens is also within us, that is, in our spirit
Some tires have the word pneumatic printed on them, indicating that the tires must have pneuma, air, for the car to move
If you drive carelessly and one of the tires is punctured by a nail, you will have a flat tire, and your car will stop moving
Perhaps on the third day, the wife thinks to herself that her husband is unreasonable and wonders how she can be subject to him?
The husband may feel that his wife is inconsiderate, but on the first day he restrains his anger and says nothing
He continues to grit his teeth on the second day, but on the third day he can no longer stand it and loses his temper
When our husband or wife gives us a difficult time, we should not look at them, because at that time they will seem very ugly
After He has completely dissipated our anger and infused us with His fragrance, we will surely be filled with joy
We all know this truth, but unfortunately, most of the time in our practical daily life it is not Christ who lives but we who are living
In the United States the department stores advertise their sales every Saturday, and many sisters love to read these advertisements
After she enters the store, she may pick up a piece of fabric thinking that its color is beautiful and its quality is very good
Sometimes when the telephone rings, the sisters' ears become attached to the telephone just like a piece of metal attracted to a magnet
If you ask them to read a life-study message, they will excuse themselves by saying that they do not have time
If you ask them to pray over and read the Bible, they will say that they cannot do it because they are busy with their housework
By this kind of practice we can avoid gossiping and wasting our time, and we can also keep ourselves in spirit
Even if you have been wronged and want to cry and shed tears, you still have to fellowship with the Lord first, saying, 'Lord, will You cry?
Today He has become the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life, and even the sevenfold intensified Spirit who is in us
Sometimes we may be having enjoyable fellowship with Him, but at a certain point He turns His face away from us
Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul-our mind, emotion, and will-plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit
Although each of the four Gospels refers to the matter of gospel preaching, the record in the Gospel of John is the most particular
In the Gospel of John the preaching of the gospel is mainly not in the way of proclaiming or preaching but in the way of releasing life
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me
The branches' abiding in the vine is not merely the preaching of the gospel but the overflowing of the inner life
If you went to visit him at his home, you would see only an old man with his body bent over and his old wife who can hardly walk
The Father's divine life is expressed through our fruit-bearing as the branches of the vine, and in this He is glorified
When we see all the young people, especially the new ones, rising up, and when we hear them singing in the meeting, it is really glorious
If we cannot bring one person to the Lord; that is, bear one fruit for the Lord in one year , this will be a shame to us
Five years ago it was so, and now, five years later, it is still the same-we have not brought one person with us
Suppose next spring each of us brings a lamb, and in the second half of the year each one of us brings another lamb
Those who are weak will be made strong, while those who are spiritually unhealthy will become normal and healthy
When a person is sick, he may ask for a leave from his company, but he cannot ask for a leave from his children
The more people were baptized, the more people were neglected because no one took up the responsibility to take care of them
After you give birth to a baby, you should not just hand it over to others; rather, you have to take good care of him and feed him
The Lord's words to Peter clearly reveal that we must shepherd the few lambs that the Lord has committed to us
Excluding the southern part of the Philippines, we have less than one thousand saints in the whole metropolitan area of Manila
There are only a few elders, and even if they exhausted themselves, they still could not bear such a responsibility
If we all take care of our lambs, they will also be influenced by us to go forth to bear fruit and feed the lambs
The Gospel of John is a book on life, but John was also particularly fond of using the word truth in his writings
If we know the truth in the Bible and the word of the Lord, we will be able to give our lambs much nourishment
Chapter eight says that the truth shall set us free, and chapter seventeen says that we are sanctified in the truth
If someone does not understand the Gospel of John, he should read the Life-study of John where all the truths are opened
After we have learned the truth and we see our lambs again, we should not say, 'The meeting is really good; please come'
Later, we may further speak to them, 'The truth not only shall set us free, but it is also an explanation of the Lord
Their fruit will then become their lambs, and they will feed their lambs according to the way they were supplied by us
In the Lord's recovery, serving full-time does not mean that you enter the profession of preaching and earn your livelihood by preaching
A definite way to do this would be for them to open their homes and invite their relatives and friends to hear the gospel
Please bear in mind that if you invite the elders or the gifted ones to preach the gospel, the result may not be good
In Taipei we also mentioned the burden of serving full-time, and surprisingly, many people immediately responded
Now there are about six hundred who have the desire to serve full-time and another six hundred who want to serve part-time
If a young person graduates from college and desires to learn to serve full-time, the first thing he should learn is the truth
If they spend four hours every morning to do this, they will be able to study the New Testament once in two years
We have to think of a way to help the saints to open their homes, whether they are strong, weak, or have stopped meeting for a long time
We have to help them to invite their relatives, neighbors, colleagues, and classmates, and we also have to lead them in preaching the gospel
They should not ask the elders and co-workers to preach the gospel; rather, they should do the preaching themselves
The best way to recover the saints especially those who have stopped meeting for a while is to ask them to preach the gospel to other people
The secret of leading a small group is that you should not be the one doing everything but you should only help the saints to form the group
Although it is the full-timer who helps the small group, he is neither the one who calls the meeting nor the one who takes the lead
All the members of the group must take care of and bear the responsibility of all the matters and decisions related to the group
The full-timers mainly have to do these three things: learn the truth, preach the gospel, and lead the small groups
In verse 15 He said Feed My lambs in verse 16 He said Shepherd My sheep and in verse 17 He summed everything up by saying Feed My sheep
Lambs denotes little lambs, referring specifically to individual lambs whereas sheep denotes a flock, referring to the church
The full-timers must continue to shepherd them that they may be built up into a dwelling place of God in spirit
The majority of the saints have learned only half of the truth, so ultimately no one has learned the truth in a complete way
Even when we truly wanted to do something, we could not find the way to do it, so we lost interest in doing anything
Now the way has been clearly presented to us, and everything depends on whether or not we are willing to pay the price
In order to serve, we all must be equipped with the truth, and in particular, we all must be familiar with the New Testament
All of you who have the heart to serve full-time must get yourselves fully equipped by studying the life-study messages thoroughly
Otherwise, when you go to establish the work, shepherd people, and speak to people, you will have nothing to say
We do not force the saints to read the life-studies, but every co-worker should read the life-study messages in a thorough way
We have never held any examinations for the co-workers, so no one really knows whether they are qualified in the matter of the truth
Some co-workers even think that as full-time serving ones they are special people and that everyone has to listen to them
You may also go further and ask him, 'Do you know that there are three important names in the genealogy in Matthew 1?
Even when we are facing matters related to national affairs, such as an election, we still should not talk about them
They were Chinese who lived outside of China and had never studied in a Chinese school, but they spoke very good Chinese
Others may ask whether it is proper for the full-timers to study gospel materials such as Gospel Outlines in order to preach the gospel
The saints who have a heart to pursue can spend at least an hour a day; then they will be able to finish the New Testament in eight years
You have to spend all your effort on the study of the Recovery Version of the New Testament and the life-studies
We have to encourage the churches in every place to study the life-studies carefully, because the life-studies are full of diamonds
If you could ask Martin Luther about the subject of Romans, he would tell you that Romans speaks about justification
As long as we open the lifestudy messages and study them every day regardless of what chapters or verses they cover we will profit from them
Not only should we propagate the life-studies as literature to other countries, we should also spread them into the saints' homes
All the saints among us should have the life-studies on display everywhere in their homes, such as on the coffee table and the nightstand
Now we have to turn this situation around so that all the saints among us will know how to speak the truth and preach the gospel
They should know only the Bible, the life-studies, and the explanations in the footnotes in the Recovery Version of the New Testament
If the saints have life-study messages everywhere in their homes, their spiritual condition will be greatly revived
On the one hand, we have to study the meaning of the words thoroughly; on the other hand, we have to touch the spirit of the writer
If we all rise up to study the truth and to know and pursue the Lord this will bring in a big longlasting and genuine revival of the church
Although they often mention the church and discuss it, in their realization the church is nothing but a building or a human organization
Once a member is separated from the body, not only will it lose its life and function, it will also become a dreadful member
In addition, because they are separated from the Body, they lack the life supply of the Body and lose their usefulness in the Lord's hand
Since we are members of the Body of Christ, we must remain in the Body; since we are children in the house of God, we must stay in the house
Christians often say that they need to edify and build themselves up, but the Bible says that the Lord wants to build the church
The peculiar disposition and natural life of a Christian cannot be removed in any other place; they can only be dealt with in the church
Suppose there is a person with a quick temper who is concerned about doing everything with speed and efficiency
Even after such a one has been married for twenty-five years, his wife may still be unable to deal with his quick temper
The Lord arranges the quick ones to hasten the slow ones, and He arranges a few slow ones to deal with the quick ones
All the married ones know that husbands do not know how to deal with wives, nor do wives know how to deal with husbands
Eventually, having left the church, these ones are without a church and become wandering Christians, individualistic members
In Matthew 16 the Lord Jesus said to him that he was a piece of stone and that He had to build him, this piece of stone, into the church
On the one hand, the Lord has to build the believers into the church, and on the other hand, the believers cannot leave the church
In chapter eight, instead of being called the believers in Jerusalem, they were called the church in Jerusalem
Chapter fourteen records that Paul went out to preach the gospel, passed through many places, and led many people to the Lord
Although we are all spiritual children when we are saved, once we start meeting and living in the church life, we spontaneously grow
He has never considered that if he stays at home, he will become a thirty-eight-year-old child, 'an elderly infant'
Even though the condition of the church may not be good, when people come to meet, they spontaneously grow in life
Attending the worst church meeting is better than staying at home, because whoever becomes individualistic loses the Lord's blessing
Even if this is the case, as long as we do not leave the church we will still grow in life, because God's blessing is in the church
You may be able to rise up at six on the first day, but on the second day you will change your rising time to 6:15
On the third day you will change it to 645 on the fourth day you will postpone it until 715 and on the fifth day you may not get up at eight
When they were in Rome, they 'operated' the church there, and when they went to Ephesus, they also 'operated' the church there
Because of their love toward the church, Paul said that he and all the churches of the Gentiles gave them thanks
The majority of Christians see only the one Spirit, but at the end of the Bible it speaks of the seven Spirits
If we are not in a local church and do not remain in a church in a definite way, we will lose the supply of the seven Spirits
In the local church there are the seven Spirits, the sevenfold intensified Spirit, supplying the church in a sevenfold intensified way
Since the church is the house of the believers, everyone in the church has to bear the responsibility of taking care of others
If we preach the gospel to others, lead them to be saved, and bring them to the church to be baptized, we should not leave them alone
When some people hear this word, they may feel that this is too troublesome and would dare not preach the gospel
There is a hymn that says, 'We are for the Lord's, / We are for the Lord's, / We are for the Lord's recovery'!
We all love the Lord the church and the Lords recovery yet we may not love the lambs because feeding the lambs is a very troublesome matter
If this is the case, then we will need some full-timers to rise up and serve in coordination to take care of the saints in those groups
Concerning the full-timers, we need to have a kind of understanding that they are not preachers but full-time serving ones
If we read two messages each day, we will be able to read fifty messages a month and six hundred messages in twelve months
Also, the full-timers have to help people to establish and lead the groups, and they should also speak the truth to those in the groups
Also, when we meet each other, instead of exchanging pleasantries, we should fellowship about the truth through mutual asking and answering
Even some elders of the local churches cannot speak clearly concerning the difference between the titles Jesus Christ and Christ Jesus
There are over three hundred churches in the Far East; the Philippines alone has about one hundred and thirty churches
In total, apart from the churches in the Far East, there are at least two hundred and fifty local churches in those other continents
When you open the Recovery Version of the New Testament, there are footnotes that open the truth to you in the places you cannot understand
When we go to establish and lead the small groups, we should not go to the husbands first, because they are harder to deal with
The wives are willing, and in the end the wives influence their husbands to open their homes for the small group
Corinthians 12:28 says, 'And God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers'
As long as we are sent by the Lord to speak for Him and preach the gospel to our parents, relatives, friends, and neighbors, we are apostles
If all the saints are like this, the churches will be strong and flourishing, full of apostles, prophets, and teachers
The truth brings us life, life produces the church, and the church is responsible for the preaching of the gospel
The book of Romans, written by the apostle Paul, consists of sixteen chapters, and each chapter contains the gospel
In the gospel Paul preached, which is the whole book of Romans, there is no mention of perdition, heaven, or prosperity and peace
Paul first speaks of justification, then sanctification, then the Body of Christ, and last of the local churches in every place
We must see that if what we preach is merely about escaping perdition and going to 'heaven,' then we are preaching the poorest gospel
In the New Testament there are not only the four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John but also the gospels of Acts and Romans
Romans 8 is the center of Paul's gospel, which is concerning the Triune God dispensing Himself into the tripartite man
To preach the gospel is not to tell people about escaping perdition and going to heaven nor to tell them about prosperity and peace
Sometimes we make a distinction between the meetings for gospel preaching and the meetings for preaching the truth
When we are in a gospel meeting, we spontaneously preach the gospel, and when we are in an edification meeting, we preach the truth
Not only are those who listen to the gospel unable to understand this, even those who preach the gospel do not know what this means
The Gospel of John begins with, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God
It may seem that people will not be able to understand the truth, but we cannot say that they will not understand any of it
When parents teach their child to speak, they do not care whether he understands or not; they simply speak to him every day
We should simply tell people, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
People may not understand it the first or second time, or even after seven or eight more times, but eventually they will understand
The younger ones speak these things to them all the time and eventually after hearing these things many times the older ones also learn them
The problem of our gospel preaching is not in people's inability to understand our preaching but in our inability to preach
For the preaching of the high gospel, we have a strong burden to encourage everyone to pursue the knowledge of the truth
If we are filled with the truth inwardly, we will spontaneously express it outwardly by speaking the mystery of the gospel to people
If from now on we would be willing to seriously learn the truth, we all would know how to preach the gospel in two months
To preach the gospel is actually to speak the truth, because the real gospel preaching is the speaking of the truth
After hearing this, he will be surprised and will respect the excellence and mysteriousness of the content of the gospel
In addition, the unique commission of the church today is to preach the gospel, the content of which is the truth
We must continually pray for those who are in our hearts-our relatives, friends, and neighbors who are surrounding us
With the truth and the infilling of the Holy Spirit, we will be equipped to go out to preach the gospel to others
We even have to motivate the saints who are weak and the saints who have not been meeting for a long time to open their homes
The best way to invite people to your home is to invite them for meals or to prepare the best refreshments for them
As long as the best refreshments can get into their stomachs, the Lord Jesus will gain an excellent opportunity to come into their spirits
All the fish have been gathered in the fishponds so we must go to every college high school and elementary school to preach the gospel
Use the weekends to gather the children from your neighborhood and to invite the children of your relatives and friends to your home
