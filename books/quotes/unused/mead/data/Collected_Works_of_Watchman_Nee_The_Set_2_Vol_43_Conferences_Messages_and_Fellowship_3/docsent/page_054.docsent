   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT ACCEPTING SATAN'S TEMPTATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thank God, the things that are impossible with men are possible with God!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Victory does not depend on us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Victory is Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perhaps we are not as extreme a case as this man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nevertheless, we should not look at ourselves but at Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once we turn back to look at ourselves, we will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Satan tempts us not to sin but to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is no virtue in our old man, and it can do nothing except sin and die.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God has crucified us with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is His valuation of the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The old man deserves only to die.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's assessment of the old man is death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Other than death, the old man deserves nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our mistake lies in the fact that we think we are weak and that we will overcome our weakness if we ask the Lord to empower us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When temptation comes, we do our best to resist.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Satan provokes us to lose our temper, we try our best to endure.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But as soon as we make a move and expose ourselves, we are lost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The interesting thing is that when Satan tempts us, his goal is not just for us to resist him but for us to expose ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once we expose ourselves, we sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The only thing the devil does not want us to do is hide ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he comes to us, and we treat him as an object of attack, we have been defeated already.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When temptation comes, we should never move, because we can never withstand Satan by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not resist him, he will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we will wonder where the temptation has gone and why it has left us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The key to the whole matter lies not in ourselves, but in Christ's work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A Western missionary once came to me in Chefoo concerning her temper.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I think temper must be the most common sin among Christians today!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She told me that as soon as her children argued, she would lose her temper.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>She could not be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I said to her, "Since you cannot be patient, there is no need to try to be patient."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She said, "If I fail when I try my best to be patient, what will happen if I do not try?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I said, "It is because you try to be patient that you lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you do not try to be patient, everything will be well.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You fail because you try to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since you cannot be patient, do not try to be patient any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As long as God is patient, everything will be well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is impossible with men is possible with God."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A man must know that he cannot make it, and he must know that God can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Most of us know that we cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But even though we realize that we cannot make it, we still try to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God can do nothing except let us do whatever we want to do.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Victory has nothing to do with our ability.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It has nothing to do with whether or not we can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a man concedes that he cannot make it and stops trying, hoping, and insisting, and instead gives up, lets go, and stops trying to turn his inability into ability, God will do something.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Victory is a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is a miracle God performs in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The secret to victory is conceding that we cannot make it and that God alone can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We cannot make it, we do not intend to make it, and there is no need to try to change our inability into ability.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is no need to take control.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no need to plan.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everything has been done by God already.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is all a matter of substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Just as we were saved by faith, we should exercise faith and nothing else as we go on.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After I was saved, I did not know the meaning of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But God opened my eyes to see that I could not make it and that He alone could make it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When I trusted in God with a living faith, He brought me through.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May the Lord open our eyes to see His saving way so that we will abandon ourselves and accept all of God's word by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>May His word be fulfilled in us, and may He bless His own word.</S>
