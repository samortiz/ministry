<h2 class="head1">THE WATER THAT CHRIST GIVES</h2>
<p>The water that Christ gives is His life, which is God&rsquo;s life. God has given His own life as living water to man. Man needs the living water. God wants man to receive the living water, and Jesus Christ came in order for man to receive this living water. Christ gave Himself on the cross in order to release this living water, and the Spirit enters into man so that man may receive this living water. The living water is the center of God&rsquo;s salvation and the goal of man&rsquo;s salvation. Man&rsquo;s being saved is his receiving this living water. When this living water enters into man, it quenches his thirst and becomes in man a fountain springing up into eternal life. Only the living water that Christ gives can satisfy the human life and quench man&rsquo;s thirst forever.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ASKING HIM</h2>
<p>After the Lord spoke of the water that causes man not to thirst forever, the Samaritan woman said, &ldquo;Sir, give me this water&rdquo; (v. 15). Initially, she said that the Lord Jesus was but a Jew, but she now called Him &ldquo;Sir.&rdquo; The way she addressed the Lord Jesus improved, but her knowledge of the Lord Jesus was still inadequate. In spite of her inadequate knowledge of the Lord Jesus, the Samaritan woman asked Him for this water.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus had said, &ldquo;If you...would have asked Him...He would have given you living water&rdquo; (v. 10). This was a promise. Although the Samaritan woman did not have sufficient knowledge, she asked, and the Lord Jesus had to grant her request and give her the living water according to His word, His promise. For someone to ask the Lord for living water and be saved does not require much knowledge of the Lord. Someone who does not know the Lord adequately will be saved if he is willing to ask. Many people who did not have much knowledge of the Lord have been saved because they were willing to ask. In England there was a well-known, beautiful, and intelligent woman who was born into a family of high standing. She attended most of the parties in her town and liked to dance. One day a large banquet was being held to welcome the Prince of Wales. Everyone told the host that the party would not be a success unless this woman was invited. The party was for the Prince of Wales, but she was the center of the party. That day she danced very well, and everyone praised her; she was also very content and happy. However, that night as she sat alone in her room, everything was tasteless. She asked herself, &ldquo;What is the meaning of all this? Is this not vanity?&rdquo; She said to herself, &ldquo;If a missionary saw me now in this state, he would talk to me about God and say, &lsquo;You need God.&rsquo;&rdquo; But she was determined not to believe in God, so she said, &ldquo;I cannot believe in God. I do not want God.&rdquo; She continued to consider and again spoke to herself, saying, &ldquo;If a Christian saw me in this state, he would talk to me about Christ and say, &lsquo;You need Christ.&rsquo;&rdquo; But she was determined not to believe in Christ, so she said, &ldquo;I will not believe in Christ. I do not want Christ.&rdquo; After a little while she decided to pray. She began by saying, &ldquo;God! I hate You! I do not love You!&rdquo; Then she said, &ldquo;I hate You! You said that the world You created is not loveable. But I feel it is very loveable. I hate You! I do not love You!&rdquo; Her prayer was the most peculiar prayer ever recorded in a Christian book.</p>
<p>However, her prayer was effective. The next day she was a different person. The night before she had told God, &ldquo;I hate You! I do not love You!&rdquo; But the next day she was changed. She loved God very much. She had joy and satisfaction. From that day onward, she would tell God, &ldquo;Even if the whole world were given to me, I would throw everything away to love You.&rdquo; This woman did not know God, and her prayer was very odd, but she prayed and contacted God. Therefore, she gained God and received salvation.</p>
<p>There are others who also did not know the Lord. Some even doubted the existence of God. But they prayed, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, if You are God, make me believe in You.&rdquo; Others prayed, &ldquo;God, if You exist, make me believe.&rdquo; Because they prayed and asked in this way, they gained God and were saved.</p>
<p>Ask Him, and He will give you living water. This is the Lord&rsquo;s word. Heaven and earth will pass away, but the Lord&rsquo;s words can never pass away; they will be fulfilled. If you ask Him according to His word, He will give you your request. To ask is not to comprehend or to understand. To ask is to request. It is not to study or comprehend with the mind but to request with the heart. It is not to contact dead doctrines with the mind but to contact the living Lord with your heart. Many people study doctrines concerning Christ by exercising their mind and contact Christianity with their mind, but they do not contact Christ with their heart. As a result, they are not saved. Many people understand doctrines, but they have never asked the Lord to give them living water; therefore, they are not saved. If you want to be saved, to have the life of God, you must ask the Lord and contact the Lord with your heart.</p>
