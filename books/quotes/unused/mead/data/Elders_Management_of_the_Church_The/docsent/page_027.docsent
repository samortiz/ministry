   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THOROUGH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The most important point of the elder's character is to be thorough and not careless.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brothers and sisters, if you have ever tried to be thorough, you will discover how much man is not at all thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sometimes the elders have caused much confusion in the church among the brothers and sisters because of a lack of thoroughness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, some of the brothers and sisters may present a matter to you, but you merely listen casually to them and assume that you have understood clearly what they said.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, you have not listened clearly and accurately enough to the words of the brothers; you have not understood the meaning of their words.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Consequently, by the time you deal with the matter, you can only deal with it in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may consider that the matter is generally taken care of, but actually, the matter is far from completed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you investigate a little, you will find out that most people are not thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, it is hard to find anyone among the brothers and sisters who can repeat another's words accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I may tell you something, and you may pass it on to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The same word may pass through seven people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By the time it reaches the eighth person, the words will then differ very much from the words spoken by the first one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The second person may speak almost the same as the first.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The third one may also speak more or less the same as the second.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But by the time the words are relayed to the eighth person, the difference will be very great.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes, when a brother passes on the words of another, a problem arises in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you bring together the brother who initiated the words with the one who relayed those words, the two will quarrel with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One will say, "At such and such a time you spoke this word to me."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The other will say, "No, the way I said it was thus and thus."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually you discover that neither is lying, and neither of them has any problem with their motives.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fact is that the one who speaks, speaks carelessly, and the one who listens, also listens carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The two careless persons now form a pair.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The one speaking does not speak correctly, and the other listening does not listen accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a result, a problem arises.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not know how many times I have confronted this kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From experience I know that I cannot hastily accept people's words, because their words are too inaccurate.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The basic cause for their inaccuracy is the lack of thoroughness in their character.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe that we brothers do not need to look at others; we only need to look at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let me mention one thing, the reading of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you will check yourself concerning this matter, you will discover how lacking you are in thoroughness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Try to write down what you have comprehended in the first chapter of Genesis, and you will discover how your comprehension of Genesis 1 lacks thoroughness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I can never forget an incident that took place when I was in Shanghai in 1947.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One day I was sitting in the living room.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suddenly, a sister came rushing in and said, "Brother Lee!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A terrible thing has happened!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Upstairs in the ceiling a big hole like this is broken through."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As she was speaking, she made a gesture with her hands.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that time, I was taken by surprise.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I asked her, "How big?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She said, "This big!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The gesture with her hands was slightly smaller than before.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We asked her again, "Really how big?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She said, "Like this."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I asked again, "How big?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She said, "Nearly this big."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Each time I asked, the hole she described became smaller and smaller.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There were others sitting in the room with me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After I had asked five or six times, they began to laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Actually, if I remember correctly, the hole at that time was only the size of a penny.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This seems like a joke, but if you test yourselves with this principle, you will then realize how inaccurate a person you are.</S>
