You probably have many things within you that you would like to say and many matters that you would like to fellowship about
It has been at least seventy-three years now since Brother Nee was raised up by the Lord to speak for Him among us
The heavenly vision which the Lord showed Paul was this economy, the New Testament economy, the eternal economy of God
The Bible, in particular the New Testament, is just like this: it has its roots and trunk and it also has its branches
The less knowledgeable and experienced a person is, the less he can see the roots and the trunk; all he can see are the branches
It is very easy to see the blossoming of a flower and smell its fragrance, but we rarely consider its source, its origin
In our study of the Word, instead of paying attention to the branches, we should go deeply into the roots and the trunk
They argue much concerning these trivial things, and the more they argue, the further they are from the fundamental matters
Unless you speak of baptism in relation to the economy of God, what you speak concerning baptism is something trivial
The types are portraits of God's economy; the prophecies refer to the economy of God to come, that is, the New Testament economy
None of the types of the Old Testament can be separated from God's economy; it is even more so with the prophecies
The teaching of the apostles that we speak of today is not our own teaching; it is the entire New Testament written by the apostles
Due to the lack of a clear view concerning Gods New Testament economy James put undue emphasis on individual practical Christian perfection
After this, we have the Epistle of Jude with only one chapter, and its content is very close to what Peter wrote
At the end of Revelation, John says that nothing can be added to the book, nor can anything be taken away from the book
According to 1 Timothy 1:3-4, we may say that God's economy is the general term for God's New Testament revelation
Paul said that he left Timothy in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach different things
Today in the church we should teach only according to the New Testament revelation, which is the apostles' teaching
Anything less than this is inadequate, and anything more than this is man's teaching, not the words of God's economy
Beginning with Brother Nee to this day, we have thoroughly covered the economy of God in its entirety and in completeness
All these precious revelations in the Word were given to us by God, but regretfully, they were not printed in books at Brother Nee's time
We began simultaneously to cover the New Testament in the two big annual trainings and the Old Testament during the week
In the summer training this year, we will discover that these two books are absolutely different from our natural understanding
Thank the Lord, we now have a complete set of life-studies, from Genesis to Revelation, with a penetrating explanation of God's economy
Last year the Lord led us to begin the crystallization-study of the Bible, a study which goes even deeper than the life-study of the Bible
The life-study opens the entire Bible to us in a general way, but we still need to touch the depths, the crystals, of the holy Scriptures
By such a crystallization-study, the Lord can reveal to us the intrinsic essence of the divine revelation, item by item
The first chapter of the New Testament shows God's incarnation, God becoming a man, and the last chapter shows the New Jerusalem
It took thirtythree and a half years to accomplish the section of God becoming flesh which includes Christs work and ministry on the earth
After His resurrection, before He left the tomb, He arranged the linen cloths there in good order and folded up the handkerchief neatly
What Nicodemus and Joseph from Arimathea did to Him was a great thing in proving that He had resurrected with a body
Because on the morning of the Lord's resurrection the disciples saw that His tomb was empty and His body was gone
After His resurrection He still definitely possessed a human body but in resurrection that human body was transfigured into a spiritual body
Since it is spiritual, it is no longer fleshly; it is not a body of the fallen flesh but a body that is spiritual and glorious
The first section is God's incarnation, which includes four steps: incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection
It was in resurrection that He ended the stage of incarnation by His being transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit
Consequently, beginning from Acts, this Christ is no longer the Christ in the flesh but the pneumatic Christ; He is the very Spirit
Romans 8:9-11 shows us that the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, Christ, and the indwelling Spirit-all four-are one
The Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Christ is the very Christ, and this Christ is the indwelling Spirit
The twenty-seven books of the New Testament mention many matters, but in summary they concern the economy of God
Christ's birth, His living on earth, His death in crucifixion, and His resurrection from death are all familiar terms in Christianity
We have spent over seventy years on this matter, but it was not until recently that we obtained its crystallized significance
Some people may realize that the Lord Jesus expressed God when He was on the earth, but they do not know how He did it
In general, most Christians would say that because Jesus loved us, He bore our sins and died on our behalf to redeem us
Apparently, Christ as a grain of wheat fell into the ground and died; actually, that death was His being made alive
In this resurrection as a great delivery, the incarnated Christ passed through resurrection and became the life-giving Spirit
All these things are carried out by Christ as the firstborn Son who has become the life-giving Spirit and has entered into us
His going was His going to pass through death and resurrection; His coming was His coming to His disciples and entering into them
The Body of Christ is the church, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the bride, the counterpart, of Christ
Without the life of Christ, there also cannot be the bride of Christ who, as His counterpart, must match Him to be a couple with Him
The church as the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the bride of Christ takes the Body of Christ as its organic factor
We have been enlightened by the Lord to have the new expressions; we must learn all these new expressions and new utterances
We should not speak the same old things which people have already heard; we need to speak the crystallized significances of God's economy
The writers of the other Epistles, including the apostles Peter and John, never used this expression; it was used only by Paul
One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling'-these three items form one group
The Body of Christ takes God's chosen and redeemed people as its framework and the Spirit as its constituting essence
Just as our body has a framework and also has blood and flesh, so the Body of Christ has its framework and constituting essence
Perhaps even the Brethren did not see anything concerning the Spirit as the constituting essence to be mingled with the believers
The process from regeneration to glorification is a process of transformation; this transformation is our hope
In Ephesians the Son is referred to as the Lord as also in the book of Acts the Lord is for His exercising of authority for His headship
In the Body of Christ we have not only the transforming Spirit and Christ as the transforming element but also one God and Father
He is over allthis refers to the Father the source He is through allthis refers to the Son Christ and He is in allthis refers to the Spirit
We see that the Triune God and His chosen and redeemed people are constituted into one unit, one entity, which is the Body of Christ
We feel that neither Chinese, nor English, nor any other language can adequately express what the Lord has opened up to us in His Word
In 1963, there were three groups in Los Angeles who responded favorably to us and proposed that we all come together
If we have not been weighing and considering the truth to invent some new terms, how can we explain our particular culture?
Noah's family of eight entered into the ark and was saved in the ark, not outwardly by the ark; they could have peace only in the ark
Because of this problem some Western missionaries created the new expression in Christ in Chinese to speak the new culture with new language
Every message that we have released in the recent two years is almost all new language, yet our understanding is still not adequate
We need to endeavor to enter into the new spiritual language that we may be able to express the spiritual truths in a crystallized way
In the New Testament it is not a matter of the oneness of the church; oneness is not something of the church but of the Body
He prayed, 'Holy Father, keep them in Your name, which You have given to Me, that they may be one even as We are
The believers can have this oneness only by being in the Holy Father, in the Holy Son, and in the Holy Trinity
The oneness that the Lord aspired for and prayed for in John 17 corresponds with the oneness of the Spirit in Ephesians 4:3-6
The one hundred twenty had become one in the Body, and in that oneness they continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer
If you are in one accord only in the church in Taipei and do not care at all for the other churches, that kind of one accord is a small sect
He said that at the time he wrote the letter he was returning from England on a ship sailing on the Mediterranean Sea
After the war in the Persian Gulf, immediately there was a reminding within me, saying, 'Why not go to start the work in Russia?
That land with a population of 350,000,000 has been under the hands of the Communists for seventy years and is now opened
In March of this year eight brothers were needed for the release of the word in the international blending conference in Indonesia
All that we have done is left here for the Lord to show grace to His children; the work that we have done is the Lord's recovery
Do you work in your locality merely to guard your hall, merely to work on your district meeting, or merely for the locality where you are?
Christianity is full of fortresses the Catholic Church is a big fortress the Presbyterian Church and the Baptist Church are also fortresses
We need to see that the Body of Christ is not the oneness in a locality but the oneness of the Body, the oneness of the Spirit
In the Body we need to keep the oneness of the Spirit; in the church and among the churches we need to be in one accord
Prayer: O Lord, we thank You that because of Your grace we are here; we are gathered around You and by Your word
It seems that what we have fellowshipped in these few days is not anything new; rather, it has all been covered in the past
After more than seventy years, we may say that our speaking reached the peak at the Chinese New Year's conference last year
Even after you have entered in, when you try to speak these things, your speaking may be improper or distorted
When we learn the new and profound things, to understand them is one thing and to speak them clearly and properly is another thing
The Greek word oikonomia may definitely be rendered economy, but people commonly use the term plan; Brother Nee did as well
The totality of the church, the Body, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the counterpart consummates in the New Jerusalem
After the begetting of forty-two generations, Mary and Joseph, two descendants of David, were brought forth, and out of them Christ was born
Although he was Mary's husband, Matthew 1 says that Jesus Christ was born of Mary ; it does not say that Christ was born of Joseph
Jesus as God who became flesh had a genealogy of forty-two generations; this genealogy is an abstract of the entire Old Testament
You must have a thorough study of the Old Testament before you can explain the genealogy of these forty-two generations
God became flesh and was born to be a man, and this man was the initiation of God's economy; with this initiation grace was brought in
All the brothers and sisters among us, particularly the elders and co-workers, need to learn to speak the crystallization of God's economy
Luther saw only the truth concerning justification by faith; he did not have the revelation concerning God's economy
Based upon his principle of biblical interpretation, he asserted that Revelation could only be interpreted literally, not spiritually
As a sign, however, seven signifies completion and perfection, and the significance of the lampstands is even richer and more inclusive
Both the tabernacle and the temple are dwelling places, and the consummation of these dwelling places is the New Jerusalem
It also says that the wall of the city is built with jasper , having twelve foundations, and that the first foundation is also jasper
If the book of Revelation must be interpreted entirely according to letters does that mean that in chapter four God is simply a jasper stone
Although the title Christ is not used in Revelation in referring to the New Jerusalem, when God is mentioned, He is mentioned with the Lamb
In the same principle, although the Spirit is not mentioned in Revelation concerning the New Jerusalem, a river is there
John 7 says clearly that out of the innermost being of those who receive the Spirit shall flow rivers of living water
Man has the sinful nature due to the fall, and during the course he still has sin, so he needs the silver that signifies redemption
My concern is whether or not the elders and coworkers among us have carefully studied all the published messages that were mentioned earlier
Some of the things which Paul teaches in his Epistles are shallow and others are deep, but they all concern God's economy
According to 1 Timothy 3, the first skill of an elder is to teach, and according to 1 Peter 5, it is to shepherd
Many elders would help them according to human feelings and speak to them some words of exhortation and encouragement
After God has regenerated us, He goes on to sanctify, renew, and transform us, and eventually conform us to His image
Paul left Timothy in Ephesus to charge the dissenting ones not to teach different things but to teach God's economy
In this way God can produce the result which He intends to have, the consummation of which is the New Jerusalem
May the Lord have mercy on us to make us aggressive in the matters of teaching and shepherding for the building up of the church
In brief the Spirit has been processed to be the consummated compound allinclusive lifegiving indwelling and sevenfold intensified Spirit
When God became a man, He did not simply become a man in an instant, although as the almighty God He could have
After He was born, this man Jesus lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years; this was another process
They knew 'I Am' is the name of Jehovah; hence, when Jesus said 'I am,' they drew back in fear and fell to the ground
The people came and wanted to make Him King, yet the Lord said that He was not a king but 'the bread that came down out of heaven'
Christ is not only smaller than we are; He also made Himself smaller than those who arrested Him and those who crucified Him
The book of Hebrews tells us that He was made a little inferior to the angels ; actually, He made Himself smaller than all men
The Nicene Creed is an excellent creed, and to this day it is still kept by the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches
In his days Martin Luther fought against the Catholic doctrines and brought in the recovery of justification by faith
Today we bear the testimony of the Lord's recovery against Judaism, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Christianity
Prayer O Lord our hearts are full of thanks and praise that You chose us before the foundation of the world and You set us apart in this age
You were with them not only outwardly but also inwardly; You were with them not only in one place but also everywhere
You not only were with them all the time and everywhere, but You were in them as the Spirit and life whereby they could live
The first five matters are the five steps of God's economy, which are incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension
Most of the people whom He contacted were fishermen from Galilee and, other than Nicodemus, very few were high-class people
The New Testament strongly says that on the cross Christ offered Himself in His human body to God to accomplish an eternal redemption for us
On the eighth day, the first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene came early to the tomb and discovered that the Lord had resurrected
The first step He took in His move as the Spirit was to contact Mary the Magdalene in the morning of His resurrection
She was not only the first one who discovered the Lord's resurrection but also the first one whom the Lord contacted after His resurrection
The freshness of the Lord's resurrection as the firstfruits of the harvest must be manifested first for the Father's enjoyment
In the morning of His resurrection, the Lord regenerated all His disciples, including you and me, in His resurrection
From then on the Lord began to call His disciples brothers because they all were regenerated with the divine life through His resurrection
That was a secret ascension; it occurred forty days prior to His public ascension, which took place before the eyes of the disciples
The primary thing which He did in His coming was that He breathed into His disciples and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
Peter was such a person who spoke foolishly, but in Acts 2 when he stood up, he spoke rightly from the moment he opened his mouth
He could expound the holy Scriptures and explain the Old Testament because the Lord had entered into him as the Spirit
The process of the only begotten Son becoming the firstborn Son is not so simple; this process began with incarnation
John 1 says that the Word, who was God, became flesh, and this Word was the only Begotten who came from the Father
Before His incarnation the Son was the only begotten Son once He became flesh entering into the flesh He was the last Adam who was Jesus
Hebrews 2 says, 'Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same'
In His incarnation He put on the flesh, and that flesh was His human nature, which had nothing to do with divinity
In His living on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, the Lord Jesus was always with the flesh, where the human nature lies
By resurrection He was begotten to be the Son of God with His humanity and thereby was designated the Son of God
His humanity was born the first time in His mother's womb; that was human and could not be considered the Son of God but only the Son of Man
The designation of the Lord Jesus in His humanity to be the Son of God was carried out by the Spirit of holiness
Matthew 120 says Joseph son of David do not be afraid to take Mary your wife for that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit
In His humanity He still needed to be designated the Son of God; this was accomplished on the day of resurrection
The crucifixion put Christ to death only in His flesh-the flesh He received through His incarnation -not in His Spirit as His divinity
When a stone is buried in the ground, there is neither death nor life, but when a seed is sown into the soil, life begins to operate
Little did they know that His being killed afforded Him a great opportunity for the divinity in Him to become operative
It was then that He was designated in His humanity to be the Son of God by the Spirit of holiness in resurrection
Through resurrection the humanity of Christ was marked out, uplifted, by the Spirit of holiness, the divinity of Christ
In this way the humanity of Christ was uplifted into divinity; that is, Christ was begotten again in His humanity
We were human beings with the human nature, but we were without the divine life and had no share in the divine nature
In this delivery, He was the first One, so He was the firstborn Son; we were those who came after Him, so we were the many sons
We are not only the brothers of Christ, but even more we are genuine brothers born with Him in the same delivery
Just as His flesh was begotten of the divine nature and the divine life, so also our human nature is begotten of the divine nature
As a result, we all have become the many sons of God, the many brothers of Christ, born with Him in the same delivery
Peter 1:3 explicitly says that God has regenerated us through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead
Ephesians 2:5 says that even when we were dead in our offenses and sins, God made us alive together with Christ
Verse 6 goes on to say that God 'raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus'
Christ was resurrected two thousand years ago, when we were not yet born, yet in God's eyes we were resurrected together with Christ
It is not that His death is merely reckoned as our death; rather, His death is our death because we are in Him
Levi, who was the fourth generation of Abraham's descendants, was not yet born, but in God's eyes he was already in Abraham
The Spirit was consummated by passing through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection
If the cross remains only on Golgotha, without entering into you, it can only redeem you but it cannot save you
The cross that enters into our heart is the cross that has become our subjective experience for us to live by the Lord practically
Stanza 2 is the climax of this hymn, but regretfully most people who sing it do not pay attention to its deep meaning
The cross that we experience today is not only the objective, vicarious death but even more the subjective co-death with the Lord
Thy sweet anointing with Thy might In weakness doth sustain; By Thy supply of energy My strength Thou dost maintain
It cannot be the counterpart of Christ, because Christ is a God-man, so His counterpart must also be a God-man
O Lord, we pray that You would give us the accurate feeling and best judgment concerning these spiritual matters
Christ's death terminated the old creation, which includes us; we are the major constituents of the old creation
Today the life that we live in the Body of Christ is a life of being delivered out of Adam and the termination of the old creation
Of these five major steps of God's economy, only His crucifixion and resurrection are real and practical in us
When a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, there is death outwardly, but there is actually life inwardly
In the preceding chapter we saw the church as the Body of Christ, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the bride of Christ
Genesis tells us that God created only one man; then He took a rib out of Adam's side and made it into a woman
When he finished his seeking, God caused him to have a deep sleep and operated on him by taking a rib out of him
When Adam saw her he said This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called Woman because she was taken out of Man
Verse 24 continues, 'Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh'
If a certain thing exists in a certain culture, there is a definite term in that culture to express that thing
They may appreciate the poetry of this hymn but they do not understand its content or know what it means when it says If no death no life
Today if we want to have the church life and experience the Body of Christ, we must experience the cross and death
Since one is slow and the other one is quick, the slow one complains about the quick one, and the quick one cannot stand the slow one
Not only has sickness caused the husband to become thirsty, but the waiting has also caused him to experience death
Some people clean the table after a meal by hastily removing all the bowls and chopsticks yet the table is not clean and is still very messy
We should not just speak about the objective doctrine of the cross and the Spirit; we must have the practical experience
Sometimes the elders in the church argue over a certain matter that is brought up because they all have their own views
As a result, we may go home with no appetite for eating, and after a period of time begin to have ulcers and even tuberculosis
Quite often, instead of asking the other brothers, Brother Nee would ask me, 'Brother Witness, what is your view concerning this matter'?
In the co-workers' meetings someone may disagree with something but not speak up during the meeting; then after the meeting they criticize
The elders are somewhat reserved when they argue in the meetings, but when they go home, they break loose and pour out everything
If we check with ourselves seriously in this light, we will see that very few churches are genuine churches in experience
Neither exhortation nor rebuke works; the only thing that works is to help everyone to know the cross and the Spirit
Ephesians 3:17 says that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith that we may be rooted and grounded in love
Make an abode denotes building; this is to build God into man as man's dwelling place and to build man into God as God's dwelling place
On the one hand, the Lord's recovery has spread to the whole earth with churches raised up in a great number of places
The co-workers visited different places through the invitations of the churches and have thereby blended the churches as one
At least three have taken place in the days of my ministry, and six or seven took place during the time of Brother Nee's ministry
In addition, the telephone, telegram, fax, and other machines are very convenient for the fellowship among the churches
