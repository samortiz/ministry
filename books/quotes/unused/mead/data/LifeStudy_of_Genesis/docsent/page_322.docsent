   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>l His Wife Being Saved from Destruction</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>but Becoming a Pillar of Salt</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lot's wife was saved from destruction, but she became a pillar of salt 19:15-17, 26; Luke 17:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the form of powder, salt is useful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But when salt becomes a block, it is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That Lot's wife became a pillar of salt meant that she had lost her usefulness in the hand of God and had become a sign of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today Christianity helps people only to take care of the matter of salvation or perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the Bible reveals that besides the matter of salvation or perdition, there is the matter of glory or shame.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lot's wife was not lost; she was saved from destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, however, she became a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, the Lord said in Luke 17:32, "Remember Lot's wife," warning us that, though we are saved, at the Lord's coming back we might possibly suffer shame like Lot's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although we are saved, we may become ashamed at the Lord's coming back 1 John 2:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Luke 17:28-33 the Lord warns us not to look back.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why did Lot's wife look back?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because some of her children, especially her daughters, were still in Sodom and because her house and her clothing also were there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you read Genesis 19 carefully, you will see that she was behind Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As a couple, they should have gone together; she should not have been behind her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But, being behind him, she looked back and became a pillar of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She looked back to the place where she loved to live and became a sign of shame for our warning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not merely a story or doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We see from it that in addition to the matter of salvation, there is the matter of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the day of judgment arrives, will you share in the glory or in the shame?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We shall not suffer perdition, for our salvation is assured.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, as this warning example indicates, we may be put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>m His Life Issuing in Bringing Forth</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moabites and Ammonites</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lot's life issued in bringing forth Moabites and Ammonites children of Ben-ammi , who were rejected by God even to their tenth generation 19:36-38; Deut 23:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What a pitiful ending to Lot's life!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He did not bring forth an Isaac but Moabites and Ammonites who were rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here in the story of Lot we see the record of a defeated righteous man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Alongside of the white record of the victorious Abraham, we have the black record of the defeated Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The record of Lot's life should be a strong warning to us all.</S>
