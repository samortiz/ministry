   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Need to Be in Bethel</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we need to consider how to become a pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe that all of us, young and old alike, are eager to know this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you would know how to be a pillar, you must consider five different places: the place of Lot's wife, who became a pillar of salt; the place where Jacob set up the pillar at Bethel; the place of Solomon, where he built the two pillars; the place of Peter, James, and John, who were pillars of the New Testament church; and the place of the church in Philadelphia, where we see that whosoever will may be a pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is your position that of Lot's wife?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To this question, you should certainly answer, "No!"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But is your position that of Jacob, the two pillars in the temple, the three pillars in the New Testament, and that of the ones in Philadelphia in Revelation 3:12?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To this, you must answer, "Yes," for your position must be in each of these four places.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Firstly, you need to take the position of Jacob, then the position of Solomon's pillars, then the position of the three pillars, and finally the position of Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you would be a pillar in the coming New Jerusalem, you must escape the place of Lot's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As long as you stay with her, you cannot be a pillar of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Recall the Lord's warning in Luke 17:32: "Remember Lot's wife."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today, many Christians are in the position of Lot's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is even true of some of us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It seems that many do not care whether they become a pillar of salt or a pillar of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But you must care.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you do not care now, you will care someday.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Someday, you will not only repent of your indifference, but also regret it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After we have escaped the position of Lot's wife, we must come to Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During the past fifty years, we have been burdened by God with Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We simply cannot keep away from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have been condemned for this and people have said that we are too extreme regarding the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They accuse us of being too much for the church and of not caring for gospel preaching, Bible teaching, or other types of Christian work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>My answer to this accusation is this: "I am not yet enough for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am not crazy' enough for the church."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not think that this is my concept.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you read your New Testament, you will see that the pillars Peter, James, John, as well as Paul were "crazy" for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through the years, many have argued with me, saying, "As long as we preach the gospel, win souls, teach people the Bible, and help them to love the Lord, isn't this good enough?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My answer is, "Where is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus said, I will build My church.'</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Where is this builded church?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Can the Lord's word fail to be fulfilled?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Where, with whom, and by what way will He build His church?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now is the time for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here and now, with us, the Lord is building His church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many Christians devote their attention to the study of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The greatest prophecy is the Lord's word in Matthew 16:18 "I will build My church."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not be occupied with Israel, Antichrist, the restored Roman Empire, or the ten horns.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, you must devote your full attention to the Lord's declaration in Matthew 16:18.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Throughout the centuries, and even today, this church has not yet been built up.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because of this, we are burdened about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you would be a pillar of stone, you must be in Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Bethel is the unique place.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The place of Lot's wife is the right position to become a pillar of shame, and Bethel is the proper place to become a pillar for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When some Christians hear this, they will say, "Brother Lee, do you mean that only those in the church can become pillars of stone?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What about those of us who are not in the church?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>My answer is, "The surest way to become a pillar is to get into the church."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are all familiar with the need for insurance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You may be fortunate enough never to have an accident, but it is still wise to have insurance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When those outside the church argue with me about this matter, I have often said, "Friend, I have peace within me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether my way is right or wrong I really do not care.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But I know that as long as I remain on this way, I am at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How about you?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>While you are arguing with me, do you have peace?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many have said, "No, I don't have peace."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then I have replied, "Why do I have peace, yet you don't have it?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is because you are not on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Please don't argue with me."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To all our Christian friends, I would say this word: "Come to Bethel and get into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the best insurance company.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Here we are all insured."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is significant that, in chapters twenty-eight and thirty-five, Jacob set up a pillar in Bethel, in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today, the house of God is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul said, "But if I delay, that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you would be a pillar of stone, you must be here in Bethel.</S>
