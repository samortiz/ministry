OR THINKING LOWLY OF ONESELF<br />
BUT BEING FAITHFUL TO THE LORD<br />
AND CARING FOR HIS INTEREST</h2>
<p>May the Lord give us the grace to learn to go against our disposition, to work with others, to be under others, and to not play politics. The co-workers should not be discouraged or consider themselves as hopeless; neither should they think that they are too old to be useful. Even if the co-workers are fifty years old, they still have decades before them of being in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. No one is useless; everyone is useful. The younger saints have their strengths and surpass us in many ways, but this is their portion. We also have our portion. We have been in the Lord&rsquo;s work for more than twenty years; thus, we have more experience, insight, and weight. The younger saints cannot replace the co-workers, nor can the co-workers replace the younger saints. We should not be proud, nor should we despise ourselves. The older co-workers should never think that they are not needed because the younger ones have risen up. The Lord still needs every one of us. Every one of us has received the grace of the Lord. We have a portion of the Lord&rsquo;s grace, and we will give an account of this grace to the Lord. One day we will meet Him, and we will need to give Him an account of how we used our portion of grace. We need to be faithful to the church, and we also need to be faithful to the Lord. If we love the Lord, we should care for His interest on earth today. I hope that every one of us will take this way of being used by the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING THE FLOW OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In addition to these four points, the flow of the Holy Spirit is also closely related to the fruit of our work. In principle, the Lord is still working on the earth. Therefore, He must speak because He works by speaking. His speaking is His work. He created all things by speaking, and He also preached the gospel by speaking. God works by speaking (Psa. 33:9; Heb. 1:1-3). Therefore, He has been speaking in every age. In the age of Abraham He spoke through Abraham. In the age of Noah He spoke through Noah. In the age of Moses He spoke through Moses. In the New Testament age the Lord Jesus spoke. Later, the Lord spoke through the apostles. In principle, the Lord is still working on the earth today because He works by speaking. Where is the Lord speaking? Some people say that He is speaking in the Bible. This is correct because the Bible is the complete revelation of God, but what is the Lord speaking today? Furthermore, the Lord must speak in a particular place, but where is He speaking today?</p>
<p>It was the Lord&rsquo;s leading that brought me into His work. In October of 1933 I went to Shanghai to visit Brother Nee and stayed with him for a few months. One day Brother Nee said to me, &ldquo;Brother Witness, the co-workers feel that you should move your family to Shanghai so that you can work together with us. Please bring this matter before the Lord in prayer.&rdquo; When I brought this matter to the Lord, He showed me that in the book of Acts there was only one line, one flow in His move and work on the earth. This flow went from Jerusalem to Antioch and from there to Asia Minor. The co-workers who were later raised up by the Lord also entered into this flow. The Lord showed me that although I had a burden to work in north China, the work in north China should not start from north China; rather, I should first enter into the flow in Shanghai. Therefore, I felt that I could not begin anything in north China. I had to enter into the flow with Brother Nee in Shanghai. If there would be a work in north China, it had to flow out from Shanghai.</p>
<p>I respected Brother Nee not only because he was taking the lead; he was also the oracle of the Lord. At that time I understood many doctrines. I was taught and perfected in a Brethren assembly for seven and a half years, and I had learned many things concerning the prophecies and types. But what I learned was not the Lord&rsquo;s speaking at that time. The Lord&rsquo;s speaking was with Brother Nee. If I spoke what Brother Nee spoke, there was the fruit of life, but if I spoke about prophecies and types, there was no fruit of life, because the doctrines and knowledge related to the prophecies and types were not the Lord&rsquo;s speaking at that time. The messages that Brother Nee gave were the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. Whenever I spoke what he spoke, the Lord confirmed it, blessed it, and enlivened others.</p>
<p>In every age the Lord works by speaking. He does not speak through only one person. However, if He speaks through many people, they will speak the same thing. Moses was not the only person who spoke in his age, but everyone spoke the same thing that Moses spoke. In the New Testament age there have been many apostles, but they spoke the same thing in oneness concerning the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the regeneration and transformation of the believers, and the producing of the church, the one Body, the one new man. This was the Lord&rsquo;s speaking at the time. In Martin Luther&rsquo;s time, the Lord spoke of justification by faith through Luther. In the time of the Brethren, the Lord spoke through the brothers. In Brother Nee&rsquo;s time, the Lord spoke the words of this age through Brother Nee.</p>
<p>Because the Lord&rsquo;s work has not stopped, the Lord&rsquo;s speaking also has not stopped. This does not mean that I am promoting myself or that I am asking everyone to speak my words. The co-workers are free to travel to other Christian groups if the Lord is speaking there. We worship the Lord that in recent years every local church that is using the Life-study messages has been enlivened. Many messages can be given concerning the different topics in the Bible. A message can be given concerning Noah or Abraham. However, what is important is whether our messages are the Lord&rsquo;s speaking today. The Lord&rsquo;s speaking is absolutely related to His move on the earth. When we see the flow of the Holy Spirit and where the Lord is speaking today, our work will be fruitful.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Age of the One New Man &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
