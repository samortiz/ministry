   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Learning to Sing Hymns</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sixth, we must learn to sing hymns properly.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because in the past we have not paid much attention to music, the brothers and sisters have been affected and are not able to sing very well.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I hope, however, that you would give more effort to learn to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When you go to visit new ones, it is best to bring the 100 Selected Hymns, which contains hymns chosen out of all our hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do not want to just learn the hymns ourselves; we must also teach the new ones to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every time we go to see them we should teach them a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must teach the children especially, because they learn quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The content of the 100 Selected Hymns is rich, so while we sing, we spontaneously teach them certain truths.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, we must diligently learn and teach the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Teaching the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Seventh, we must teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we lead the home meetings, the hardest point, which is also the most important matter, is teaching the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not teach the truth, the home meetings will not have a center or a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the points mentioned above are peripheral matters as a preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The central point is to work the truth into people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The materials concerning the truth among us are plentiful, especially the Truth Lessons, the content of which is particularly suited for use in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We still feel, however, that the content of this book is somewhat difficult and a bit too weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why I encourage the teachers as soon as possible to select some lessons from the Truth Lessons, beginning with the experience of salvation, and compile them into suitable teaching materials to meet the needs of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same principle, when we go to teach the truth, we should not consider ourselves teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We go to teach, but we are not teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The way we teach is to read things with them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We want to give them the impression that we are also students and that at most we are students just a grade or two ahead of them who are learning the truth together with them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before the home meetings, however, we must first study the message thoroughly and understand its content.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then when we read it together with them, we should not be inflexible but rather use all kinds of ways to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, we must point out the important items and not fear repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this way, we will always give them a deep impression.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the same time, when we read a portion that is full of inspiration, we can also ask them to give testimonies at any time, or to express their feelings and share something of the light and revelation which they themselves have touched.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Content of the Meetings Needing to Be Living</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eighth, the content of the meetings must be living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The greatest lack among us is that when we read messages, we are very rigid and not at all living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we read, at any time we should add prayer and the singing of hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can also give testimonies, share our feelings, or fellowship some light at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not read on and on until people begin to nod off.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we use the way of fellowship, then we will be free and living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, when we read about being released, we can sing the hymn "Glorious freedom, wonderful freedom!"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hymns, #310 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this way, the home meetings will be living and enlivening.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everyone will have such a good taste that they will look forward to the next meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some people may say, "We are not like the full-time serving ones, who specialize in these matters and have time to prepare thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have our occupations, so how can we have as much energy as they have?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yet the Bible shows us that all God's children have only one occupation, that is, being a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not only the full-time serving ones but all of us are in this unique occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As long as we all have a heart to learn and practice, then we will spontaneously be able to lead the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This does not require eloquence or a special gift.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is especially the case because we are always learning, so it does not matter if we do make a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, as long as we are willing to learn and practice, we will ultimately learn the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I would like to encourage the older saints to not consider themselves too old to learn and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am as old as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we consider ourselves old and tired, then we will not want to walk or move, so we will certainly fall ill in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even though we old people struggle and fight just to live, the more we move, the stronger we are.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, we should all practice going out because this is beneficial to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the entire church would pick up the burden for the home meetings and go out to care for others, we will not only be able to meet a huge need but will also make the church full of vitality.</S>
