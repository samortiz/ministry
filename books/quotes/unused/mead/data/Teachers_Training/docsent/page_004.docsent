   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Spirit and Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus says, "It is the Spirit who gives life the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus is spirit, pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His words are the embodiment of the Spirit, who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that the word which comes out of the Lord's mouth is His breath, the breathing out of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a further indication that the words of the Scriptures are God-breathed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Sword of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Ephesians 6:17 Paul charges us to receive "the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The antecedent of which is Spirit, not sword, indicating that the Spirit is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we read the Bible, we must touch the word of God as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Along with 2 Timothy 3:16 and John 6:63, this verse reveals that the Bible is God's breathing out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since God is Spirit, what He breathes out must also be Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The words of the Bible, therefore, are the breathing out of God Himself as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>PROFITABLE FOR TEACHING, CONVICTION, CORRECTION, AND INSTRUCTION IN RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second Timothy 3:16 says not only that the Scriptures are God-breathed but also that the Scriptures are "profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On God's side the Bible is God's breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On our side the Bible is for us to receive profit in four matters teaching, conviction or reproof, correction, and instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The order here is significant.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why does teaching and not instruction come first?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why does correction come before instruction and reproof before correction?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And why does teaching come first?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The order is first teaching and then reproof, correction, and instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Teaching the Rolling Away of the Veil</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is teaching?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How do you understand the word teaching?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to know the denotation of this word as it is used by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we have the proper and adequate spiritual experience, we will realize that in verse 16 teaching equals revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Teaching is actually nothing less than a divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since teaching equals revelation, as you are teaching the young people in your class in the Summer School of Truth, you must present a revelation to them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A revelation is the opening of a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As you are teaching the young people, you should be taking away a veil so that they may see something of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A certain matter may be hidden from view, but by your teaching you should gradually open the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you are serving in the Summer School of Truth, you should not allow the veil to remain over the eyes of the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, as they are listening to you, the veil should be rolled away little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To teach is to roll away the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Go to the summer school for the purpose of rolling away the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we can see that for the Bible to be profitable for teaching means that it is profitable for unveiling, for rolling away the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A veil cannot be taken away suddenly; it cannot be rolled away all at once.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the contrary, the veil is rolled away a little at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Time after time and in session after session, you need gradually to roll away the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you do this, your way of teaching will be an unveiling.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This kind of teaching always presents a revelation to others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who are under such teaching will be able to see something concerning the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This understanding of teaching applies not only to those who teach in the Summer School of Truth but to all those who speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When you speak something in the church meeting, your speaking should be the rolling away of the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that your speaking should present a revelation.</S>
