<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Oneness of All the Believers in Christ<br>in the Divine Glory for the Expression<br>of the Processed and Mingled Triune God</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>In the Divine Glory</H2><P>The third aspect of the genuine oneness is the oneness of the believers in Christ in the divine glory (John 17:22-24). After many years of studying the New Testament, we have found out that God's glory is His divine life with His divine nature to express Him. If we did not have the Father's life with the Father's nature, it would be impossible for us to express the Father. The expression of the Father comes from the Father's life with the Father's nature. This expression of the Father is the glory.</P><P>First, the Father gave this glory to the Son that the Son may have the Father's life with the Father's nature to express the Father. Then the Son gave the same glory to His believers. This means that the Son has given the divine life with the divine nature to His believers that they may express God. It is in this expression that we are one. The oneness of all the believers in the divine glory is the oneness in the expressed sonship with the Father's life and nature. If we live by our life with our nature to express ourselves, there will be no glory of God. In the expression of ourselves there is no oneness; rather, there is division.</P><P>In the second aspect of oneness, we must be sanctified from the world and kept from Satan. In the third aspect, we must be saved from ourself, we must lose ourself. We must not act or do anything to express ourself; rather, we must do things in the Father's life with the Father's nature to express the Father. This is glory, and it is in this glory that we all are one.</P><P>Even in a small town where only fifteen saints are meeting as the church, if these fifteen do not behave, act, and do things in the divine life with the divine nature to express God, they will have opinions and will surely be divided. However, if they would be willing to be saved from themselves, willing not to live in their natural life with their own nature to express themselves, but to live the divine life with the divine nature to carry out the divine expression, spontaneously, among those fifteen there would be a genuine oneness, and this oneness would swallow up all their opinions.</P>
