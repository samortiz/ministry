<h2 class="head2">The Past Nine Months (Hsugou)</h2><p>The Lord has especially led us to leave the denominations. Over the past nine months we have seen something of the Lord's goal and plan as well as His requirements for us. We really cannot keep up; we can only prostrate ourselves in worship to Him and rely on Him to walk in the way set before us. We ask the brothers to pray much for us. The brothers and sisters here desperately need the edification for new believers. Because we have not had sufficient learning and spiritual pursuit, we really have no way. We hope you will lead us.</p><p>Du Chung-sheng, Kuo Ling-run, Dong Chun-mao,<br />Chang Peng-ze<br />December 12, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">Beginning to Learn to Take the Lord's Way (Chingyuan)</h2><p>After hearing the truth concerning the church and the sin of denominations in 1948, we went to Taiyuan to fellowship with the brothers. After a period of study, we began to meet in the Lord's name at Brother Kuo's house in 1949. Although we are immature, the Lord has had mercy on us. In His good time He led our dear brothers, Kuo Jun-bao and Chiu Ai-lu, to come into our midst this spring. After a three-day conference, our standing was strengthened and some brothers turned from the denominations. Since then, our meetings have been stronger, and we have begun to preach the gospel. In September the Lord led these two brothers here for another three-day conference. Even more brothers and sisters turned from the denominations. On the morning of October 1 (the Lord's Day), we baptized thirteen brothers and sisters. That afternoon we began to meet to break bread in the Lord's name. There were seven brothers and twenty-nine sisters for a total of thirty-six. There were also six other brothers from other localities who had come to visit. Oh, we can only prostrate ourselves in worship! We are beginning to learn to take the Lord's way, and we need your supply and prayers very much so that the Lord would have more of a way among us.</p><p>Kuo Ying-nan, Cao Ling<br />October 2, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">Produced by the Skylight in the Ark (Penglai)</h2><p>We recently received The Open Door, and after reading it our hearts began to leap, and our spirits were greatly stirred up. We really thank the Lord. The situation in Penglai has been smothered by two denominations for many years. In 1931 three brothers and I saw that the denominations were not according to God's desire, and we boldly withdrew from them. At that time we met and worshipped every day. Although we were taunted very much, the Lord was victorious. Thank Him. Over the past ten years or more, we have preached the gospel and edified others. We have increased from three or four to eighty-nine people. Some have turned this way from the denominations, but most are young brothers and sisters who were raised up by the Lord through sufferings in the last few years. (There are more sisters than brothers.) Thank the Lord, this was all produced by the skylight in the ark.</p><p>We earnestly desire to have the table meeting to remember the Lord in Penglai. We also hope that the churches in other localities would fellowship with us, but we do not know how to carry this out. Please remember us much in your prayers.</p><p>Your weak brother,<br />Liu Yen-zhou<br />October 26, 1950</p>
