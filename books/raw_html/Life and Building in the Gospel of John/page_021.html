        <h2 class="head1">THE WORD BECOMING FLESH BEING<br />
GOD EXPRESSING HIMSELF THROUGH THE FLESH</h2>
<p>John 1:14 does not say, &ldquo;God became man;&rdquo; rather, it says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh.&rdquo; John&rsquo;s speaking of God as the Word shows that the term <em>Word</em> is a further unveiling of God; thus, this utterance is more advanced. Some theologians may condemn this utterance as heretical, but we should not deviate in our understanding because of them. We must recognize that there is a distinction between God as the Word and God as God. Although there is no difference in element, God as the Word is more distinctive than God as God. While God is the substance of the Word, the Word is the uttered God. If God was not the Word, we would not even know Him as God, but we know Him as God because He is the Word, the uttered God.</p>
<p>The Word becoming flesh indicates that the uttered and declared God, who is eternally being spoken forth as the Word, has become flesh as well. As the eternal Word, God is sufficiently expressed and declared, but this expression became much more substantial when He, as the Word, became flesh. When the Word became flesh, God began to speak in the flesh, to be manifested in the flesh, and to be declared through the flesh. This is too glorious.</p>
<p>The Word became flesh in order to substantiate the declaration and the expression of God. Although He is eternally the Word, that is, the explanation and expression of God, He now expresses God even more substantially through the flesh and in the flesh. This is the key to the Gospel of John, which shows a human of flesh, who was also the Word of God, in action. God Himself is now expressed and uttered forth in the flesh. Although His visage was marred more than that of any man and His form more than that of the sons of men, having had no attracting form nor majesty and coming out of a little town, Nazareth, God as the Word was manifested in the flesh. As the Word, God was substantially expressed in the flesh.</p>
<p>We know that the heavens declare the glory of God, the expanse proclaims the work of His hands (Psa. 19:1), and the words of the Bible reveal God so that man may know God. The expression of God through the heavens, the earth, all things, and even in the words of the Bible is not as expansive as the expression of God that was declared through Jesus, who is the incarnate Word (John 21:25). When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was a little man from a carpenter&rsquo;s home in a little town, and His visage was marred more than that of any man. Like a root out of dry ground, He had no attracting form nor majesty. Nevertheless, even as a lowly man, He expressed God much more than what can be declared through the heavens and the earth and what is contained in the words in the Bible. The twenty-one chapters of the Gospel of John depict the expression of God in a lowly man, the Lord Jesus. This lowly man in the flesh substantiated the Word of God. He explained God not only through His speaking but also through His entire living, work, and person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE ASPECTS OF INCARNATION</h2>
<p>God delights in entering into man, in being mingled with man, and in being expressed through man&rsquo;s manner of living. This is the greatest mystery associated with Christians. God delights in entering into man. God also delights in being mingled with man such that God and man and man and God are one. Furthermore, God delights in being declared through man&rsquo;s manner of life. Although a Christian is a man, he should declare God. God does not want a Christian to be a man declaring man, nor God declaring God, but a man declaring God. These three points are very significant and mysterious.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John speaks of the most wonderful person in the universe. This person is wonderful because God entered into the man Jesus and was mingled with Him as one. Now we can say that He is a man, because He is a genuine man. We also can say that He is God, because He is the true God. In Him God and man are mingled together and are inseparable. This wonderful person is the Jesus who is shown in the Gospel of John. Jesus is both God and man. In Him God and man are mingled as one. He did not come to man just as God, He came to man as man to express God. Thus, He did not express man but God through man. Although He lived in the flesh, He expressed the Word of God, because He lived in the flesh by the life of God, not by the life of man. He was a man, but His human living was out of the divine life. Hence, even though He was a man, He expressed God. He was both God and man; He was a man in His actions and living, yet in His actions and living God was expressed. He expressed God in the flesh. This is the meaning of incarnation.</p>
<p>The One who asked the Samaritan woman for water at Jacob&rsquo;s well was both God and man (4:7). When He asked for water, He asked as a man. If He had come only as God, the Samaritan woman would have fallen to the ground, rather than asking, &ldquo;How is it that You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman?&rdquo; (v. 9). Although He was God, He spoke to her as a man, not just as God.</p>
<p>Although He spoke to her as a man, His expression was more than that of just a man. If His expression had been merely that of a man, He would have said, &ldquo;Bring the waterpot to Me; I will talk to you after I get a drink.&rdquo; Such a word would have expressed only man. This would have been an expression of man as man. In contrast, the Lord expressed God even though He was also a man. In His asking for water and in His speaking to the Samaritan woman about water, God fully came forth from Him as a man.</p>
<p>In contrast to the Lord, some saints, who desire to express Christ, cannot properly conduct themselves even as human beings. Twenty years ago in Beijing I met a sister who was very zealous for the Lord. She would go throughout the city visiting people all day long, but she also began to neglect her home responsibilities and even her husband and children. Later, she began to tell people that she regretted getting married and having a family. When I was able to talk to her, she said that she believed the Lord did not want her to be a wife, because a wife has too much &ldquo;bondage,&rdquo; including the &ldquo;big bondage&rdquo; of a husband and the &ldquo;little bondage&rdquo; of children. She also said that she would never have married if she had believed in the Lord at an earlier age. After listening to her, I had a deep feeling that she had no experience of incarnation, even though she was zealous and loved the Lord. This sister needed to see a vision of incarnation and be a proper wife.</p>
<p>In 1936 I was serving the Lord in Tientsin. One day someone knocked on the door with such haste that I quickly ran to open it. When I opened the door, I saw a stranger with a handbag and who appeared to have come to town from the countryside. As soon as he saw me, he asked, &ldquo;Are you Mr. Lee?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and he immediately said, &ldquo;The Lord has sent me to you. I left everything behind for the Lord. I want to follow Him and glorify Him on earth.&rdquo; I then asked, &ldquo;Brother, do you have a family?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I have left my parents, wife, and children. The Lord Jesus charged me to do this in the Gospels, so I left them behind.&rdquo; When I asked him what he planned to do, he said, &ldquo;I do not know what to do. I am just following the leading of the Holy Spirit. God led me to you today, so I am here. If God leads me somewhere else tomorrow, I will go somewhere else.&rdquo; When I asked him if he no longer cared for his parents, wife, and children, he frowned and said, &ldquo;You are a fleshly person. The Lord wants us to leave everything behind to follow Him. You should know this.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;If you want to follow the Lord, how will you follow Him and where will you follow Him?&rdquo; He became quite angered by my questions and said, &ldquo;You are a fleshly person. Never mind. I will not stay with you.&rdquo; Then he left in a hurry.</p>
<p>This incident gave me a heavy feeling, so I considered it and also read the Bible. In the Gospel of Luke and other Gospels, the Lord indeed tells us to forsake and leave everything behind to follow Him (Luke 14:33; Matt. 19:29; Mark 10:29). Consequently, I asked the Lord, &ldquo;Do You really want us to leave everything behind as this man has done? There should be a purpose for leaving everything behind, but I feel that this brother left everything behind in an aimless way and without any purpose.&rdquo; Then the Spirit showed me something concerning our human responsibilities. On the one hand, the Gospels tell us to leave our wife, our children, our house, and our fields behind, but on the other hand, God charges us in the Epistles to love our wife, to be subject to our husband, to honor our mother and father, and to care for our children (Eph. 5:25, 22; 6:2-4; 1 Tim. 3:4). Such charges are related to the principle of incarnation. God does not enter into us to make us someone other than a man in the flesh; God enters into us so that we would express more than just the life of a man. He wants us to be proper as children, as husbands and wives, and as parents according to the principle of incarnation. God has no intention that we would no longer be men but that we would be men who express God.</p>
<p>A saint who works as a household servant may believe that menial work such as sweeping the floor is beneath him because he has the Lord Jesus in him, but he has an altogether mistaken concept. Our Lord was glorious and dignified, but when He became flesh and put on the human nature, He was lowlier than any of us. He was born into a poor family, and He grew up in an obscure little town. As a carpenter, He toiled daily in work, but he expressed God in this lowly life. This is incarnation. Therefore, if we have a job of sweeping and mopping the floor, our sweeping and mopping should express God now that we have believed in the Lord Jesus. May we express the Lord Jesus in our sweeping and mopping of the floor.</p>
<p>The tabernacle of God, which was among the children of Israel, illustrates this principle. The outer layer of the tabernacle was coarse porpoise skins (Exo. 26:14); it had no attracting form nor majesty. However, the inner layer of the tabernacle was embroidered with glorious and exquisite cherubim (v. 31). Inwardly we have the exceedingly glorious Word, but outwardly we are but base, earthen vessels (2 Cor. 4:7). The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;Each one, in the calling in which he was called, in this let him remain&rdquo; (1 Cor. 7:20). We do not need to change our living; rather, we should express Christ in our living as a man. This is what is mysterious and powerful about Christians.</p>
<p>It is also possible for some saints who want to express Christ, to conduct themselves as human beings but without any true expression of Christ. Twenty years ago a Christian couple in Shanghai invited several co-workers to dinner. Upon seeing the happy and harmonious situation in their home, everyone admired the brother for having such a wife and the sister for having such a husband. On the surface, the brother was a good husband and the sister was a good wife, but the only expression that we could sense was the expression of a good brother being a good husband and a good sister being a good wife.</p>
<p>Christians can be good husbands but not express Christ, and Christians can be good wives but not express Christ. Even among worldly people, there are expressions of husbands being a good husband and expressions of wives being a good wife. With Christians, however, the expression of a husband or a wife should cause people to meet, feel, taste, and smell Christ. Being a good husband or a good wife apart from the expression of God is merely to express the flesh, not the Word. A normal Christian expresses the operation of divinity and humanity, humanity and divinity. Just being a good husband or a good wife is not enough. We must express Christ in our being a husband or a wife.</p>
<p>May the Holy Spirit speak to us so that we truly know how the meaning of <em>the Word became flesh</em> can be applied to our practical living. It is a glorious matter that the Word became flesh. The Word is our glorious Lord, and human beings are the flesh. He became one of us and is in us so that God may be expressed in man on the earth. This is a glorious matter.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
