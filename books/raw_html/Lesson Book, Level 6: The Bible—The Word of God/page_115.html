<h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<p>After nineteen lessons of seeing how the Bible was written and learning some of the crucial truths in the Bible, we should be very attracted to the Word of God. There should be an appreciation welling up from our spirit causing us to desire to devour the Word of God until our being is fully constituted with His word. In the remaining lessons, we want to fellowship with you about our attitude toward the Bible and how we may be constituted with the Word of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE NEED TO BELIEVE THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>First, we need to believe the Bible. At times we may read the Bible and not fully agree with it, or we may think that what it says is impossible. Other times we may not like what we read. We need to accept, agree, and believe the Word of God by faith.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Accepting the Word of God</h2>
<p>The Word of God is trustworthy. Not one word can be changed or annulled until it is fulfilled. Human words are not trustworthy because they are not eternal. Human feelings likewise fluctuate. We cannot depend on our words or our feelings. But what the Lord has spoken will be accomplished (Num. 23:19). For example, He said in Mark 16:16, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; Anyone who believes the Lord Jesus and is baptized shall be saved. There is no reason to question if the person looks saved or feels that he is saved. He is saved because the Bible says so. We must accept the Word of God the way it is written.</p>
