Sometimes I would say, "In your mind you are arguing with me, but in your spirit you say Amen to me." Let us come into the spirit. When we come into the spirit, right away we are one. Christianity is divided because most Christians abide in their mind. The mind is really divisive, but in the spirit is unity. Christians have argued over the method of baptism. There is baptism by immersion, by sprinkling, in fresh water, in salt water, in the river, in the baptistery, and in the bathtub. There is baptism in the name of Jesus and in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Some have even said that we need to follow Jesus to be baptized in the Jordan River, where He was baptized. We need to forget about all these kinds of doctrinal differences and come back to the spirit. Doctrines can be a snare, a trap. We have to jump out of this trap. We are those who have been saved by the blood and regenerated in our spirit. Let us come back to our spirit where we are one.</P><P>In Deuteronomy 12&#151;16, the Lord charged the people of Israel again and again that when they entered into the good land, they had to worship God in the place which He would choose. They had no right to worship God with the enjoyment of all the offerings in the place of their choice. They had to go to the unique place chosen by God, where He would put His name and have His habitation. This place would be the center of their corporate worship to God. They could pray to God and fellowship with the Lord in their homes, but they had no right to have corporate worship in any place which they liked. They had to go to the unique place chosen by the Lord, which became Jerusalem.</P><P>In Jerusalem was God's temple, God's habitation, bearing God's glorious name. All the Israelites went there three times a year (Deut. 16:16), and that unique center kept the unity of all the twelve tribes. If they had the liberty to set up their own worship centers, they would have been divided. The tribe of Dan in the north would have said, "It is too far for us to go to the south to worship God in Jerusalem. Our God is omnipresent. If He is there in Jerusalem with you, surely He is here with us in Dan." Immediately there would have been a division. But in God's wisdom He charged them beforehand that they had no right to do this. They all had to go to the one place.</P><P>Even today, after so many centuries, no Jew on this earth dares to build a temple. They have the boldness to build hundreds of synagogues, but no one dares to build the temple, because they all know the charge in Deuteronomy. There is only one unique ground, one unique site, for them to build God's habitation. That is on Mount Zion in Jerusalem. That unique ground kept the unity of God's people.</P><P>What was there in the Old Testament is a type of the reality in the New Testament. John 4 tells the story of the Lord Jesus speaking with a Samaritan woman. Eventually she said, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship" (v. 20). Then the Lord told her that the hour had come for the true worship of God (v. 21). That means the dispensation had changed. Men now would no longer worship God with the types but in reality. The Lord said, "But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him" (v. 23). Jerusalem was the unique center of God's people's worship to God, but this was a type of the human spirit. We can be one only if we worship God in our spirit, which is today's Jerusalem. Today we have to worship God in spirit and in reality (v. 24). We do not need to go to Jerusalem to worship God with the offerings. Christ is now here as the reality of all the sacrifices, the offerings, and we can worship God in our spirit with Him as our reality.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
