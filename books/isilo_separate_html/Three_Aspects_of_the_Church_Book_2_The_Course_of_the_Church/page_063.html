<h2 class="head2">Not Seeking to Draw People<br />
and Not Refusing People</h2>
<p>In this age the Lord has commissioned us to preach the gospel and minister life; He has not asked us to touch the situation in Christianity. Even if we are questioned about the situation in Christianity, we should avoid discussing it. We should not answer queries regarding Christianity. I do not know what motives are behind the practices in each locality, but it is wrong to seek to bring people out of Christian groups into our meetings. We should not reject Christians from other Christian groups, but we do not need to seek them out. I do not believe that the Lord wants us to seek out believers from other Christian groups. I believe that the Lord wants us to take the gospel to every place and to minister life to His many children. The Lord wants a situation among us that can influence His children.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, believers from many Christian groups have come to fellowship with us. I am willing and eager to fellowship about spiritual things, but when the topic switches to the church, I avoid discussing it. I am not afraid to discuss the church, but I feel that there is an inward forbidding.</p>
<p>For example, in Hong Kong a young person came to talk to me several times. During our conversations he brought up the church a few times. Another brother who was present told me, &ldquo;If you would simply touch the matter of the church and give him a little help, he will come to be with us.&rdquo; This young person is a pastor, and I have heard that he is very gifted. He repeatedly insisted that I answer him regarding the church, but I could only say, &ldquo;The question of the church cannot be resolved by any person but only by your spiritual life.&rdquo; Although my word was clear and to the point, he did not understand what I said.</p>
<p>The Lord definitely does not want us to lead others into our meetings. Where people meet and how they serve the Lord are entirely between them and the Lord; we cannot intervene in these things. In this age we must minister life to others. When people contact us, they should touch something in us that is unforgettable. The way they take or where they meet does not matter; we should not consider that our meetings are better than those in Christianity or that our meetings have the greatest number of people. Such thoughts are not in resurrection, and we must condemn them. We must also condemn raising up meetings merely for the sake of having meetings. If we raise up meetings in order to minister life, we are proper.</p>
<p>We do not have any intention of competing with or comparing ourselves to others; the thought of competition is fallen. Some brothers like to compare themselves with others, saying, &ldquo;That city would have been a good place to work, but we came a little too late; if we had come earlier, the opportunity would have been ours.&rdquo; This is not a sweet, spiritual, or proper feeling; we should not have such feelings. Are we living in life, resurrection, and the Holy Spirit? Strictly speaking, the Lord does not want us to open up fields for the work or to establish churches. The Lord wants us to preach the gospel and minister life to people. I really hope that our gospel preaching is the going forth of the pure gospel and not just a work; I hope that we are ministering only life to people and that we are not concerned with the visible church meetings.</p>
<p>One brother wrote a letter to his classmates which said, &ldquo;In today&rsquo;s Christianity we should find the place in which we can touch God&rsquo;s presence the most. Today in Taipei the place in which we can touch God&rsquo;s presence the most is with the church in Taipei; therefore, I hope that you will come to meet here.&rdquo; Is this in resurrection? No, this is not in resurrection; this is not something that we should do. None of the brothers and sisters among us should do this kind of work. The Lord has not commissioned us to do such a thing. If someone comes here and touches God&rsquo;s presence, that is between him and God. If he returns to Christianity, that is also between him and God and does not concern us.</p>
<p>If we meet someone who has never contacted Christianity, we should do our best to bring him into the Lord&rsquo;s churches, but we should not announce to people who are already in the realm of Christianity that God&rsquo;s presence is with us or attempt to draw them to meet with us. This is a foolish practice. If they want to come, we should not refuse to receive them. If Christianity misunderstands us because we do not refuse to receive them, that is God&rsquo;s responsibility.</p>
<p>A highly-educated woman in her fifties was recently saved. After one meeting she said to me, &ldquo;When I come here, I really feel supplied. Please tell me what I should do.&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;You should go home and make a complete consecration of yourself to the Lord. You should give Him the authority over you, and He will tell you what you should do.&rdquo; This is what we should do; we should not do anything more.</p>
<p>It is not we who gain people but the Lord. We should condemn the aspiration to gain people. Only the Lord can gain people. People can meet in any place. The important thing is for people to be gained by God. We must constantly deal with our motives. God does not want us to be happy only because people come to our meetings. God&rsquo;s blessing upon us is for all to share, and there should be no boundaries dividing God&rsquo;s children. However, we should not use human hands, the hands of Uzzah (2 Sam. 6:6-7), to draw people. We welcome anyone who wants to come to serve and pursue the Lord together with us. Many severe misunderstandings and persecutions have arisen in the past because we do not refuse to receive anyone. This will happen again in the future; it is unavoidable. However, we do not care about persecution. If we try to draw people in or exhort them to meet with us, we have fallen; we should not do such a thing.</p>
<p>The best attitude for us to have toward today&rsquo;s Christianity is to not ask about or concern ourselves with it. This does not mean that we despise the believers in Christianity and are proud. When we meet a sinner, we should do our best to preach the gospel to him; when we meet a child of God, we should do our best to minister life. If someone has something to minister to us, we should humbly receive it.</p>
<p>Christianity should not even exist in our thinking. Our thinking should include only sinners and Christians, not Christianity. Such an attitude is pleasing to God. Whenever we meet a Christian, we should not let Christianity be the focus of our conversation. Rather, I hope that the Lord would give us the mercy, opportunity, way, and grace to minister something of the true spiritual life to such a person. This is enough. Allow the believer&rsquo;s spiritual life and the Holy Spirit to resolve all other questions. I believe that those who live by God&rsquo;s life, are enlightened, and have the inward, heavenly wisdom will take such an attitude.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_062.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_064.html">Next</a> </body></html>
