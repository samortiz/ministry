Thank You that You have taken the church in Taipei onto the proper track and that it is now going on steadfastly in this new way
Not only do we bind him here in Taipei; we bind him over the whole earth that there would be churches in Your recovery everywhere on earth
In His becoming flesh, He came down from heaven to earth and was born in a manger in Bethlehem, a small, earthly town
The unlimited, boundless God who transcends time and space became a man limited in time and space, restricted in all respects
He remained on the cross for six hours, accomplishing the work of the cross, and entered into the grave and descended into Hades
He lived in such a hopeless man for thirty-three and a half years and brought this hopeless man to the cross, terminating the hopeless one
The Father gave these captives as gifts to the ascended Head who, in His position of ascension, gave in turn these gifts to the church
When the Holy Spirit descended on the day of Pentecost, the Lord gave these people as gifts to the Body, the church
Formerly, he was one who was against God, against the Lord Jesus, persecuting the churches, and murdering the saints
While he was on the way to Damascus to persecute the saints, the Lord, who captured him out of the hand of Satan, appeared to him
Immediately he fell to the ground, and he heard a voice that spoke to him, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me'?
Later the Lord led him away to a quiet place and showed him the revelation concerning God's New Testament economy
The Triune God became flesh, passed through human living, died on the cross, entered into Hades, and resurrected from the dead
He put His life into us to regenerate us, and He put His nature into us that our humanity would be uplifted and transformed
When we tried to help a friend or a relative to be saved, we had to bring him to the gospel meeting to listen to a gospel message
The book of Ephesians shows us that the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are for the perfecting of the saints
Some advanced brothers and sisters have already become the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers
For us He became a man, died on the cross, accomplished redemption, and resurrected from the dead to dispense life into us
The more we help them, the more they will be focused in the faith, and the more they will be brought to the oneness of the faith
Today there are many denominations and sects within Christianity because they all hold different views concerning the faith
In this way, we will grow gradually and will arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
The above few things are what the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers preach and do every day
When you have learned these lessons and have been taught this way, you will be able to teach others in the same way
Since You could feed five thousand with five loaves and two fishes, You can supply all of us tonight with the few words we speak
Those who practice the will of God, who have a part in the building up of the Body of Christ, will abide forever
By His death and resurrection, Christ has conquered Satan and death and has rescued man from the enslaving of Satan
Gradually, we learn to understand the Bible, we pick up a taste for it, and we find ourselves getting into its riches
We also find ourselves preaching the gospel, feeding and teaching others, prophesying for the Lord, and speaking the Lord into others
When we are continuously perfected little by little in this way, we will produce the result in Ephesians 4:14-16
Satan uses the sleight of men and craftiness to lead men away from the building up of the Body of Christ to his system of error
According to the history of the church, we see that most of its difficulties arose from winds of teaching, which are the different teachings
The different teachings came from different speakings, and the different speakings came from different opinions
From here the recovery spread to Southeast Asia to Japan and Korea to America then to Europe Australasia Africa and then to the whole earth
The first wind of teaching says that after the apostles appoint the elders they can no longer be involved with the matters of a local church
As far as the different parts of our body are concerned, you may say that this is the hand and that is the leg
As far as the blood circulation is concerned, you cannot say that this is the blood of the hand and that is the blood of the leg
The management of a local church is, on the one hand, local in its administration yet, on the other hand, not isolated in its communication
It is wrong for some to say that the building up of the church requires only the Lord Jesus and does not require any man
Ephesians 4:14 tells us that these teachings are 'in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error'
Those who say these things lead people into the wiles of Satan and are used by Satan to bring people into his system of error
To be carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men and to be led into a system of error is to fail to hold to truth in love
In this way, we will grow into Him and will allow Him to occupy all of our inward parts, that is, our mind, emotion, and will
Through the joints of the supply and the operation of each one part, all the members of the Body of Christ are fitted and knit together
The result is that the members of the Body of Christ directly build up the Body of Christ in the element and sphere of the divine love
It speaks of the ascended Head giving the gifts, with some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers
These gifts perfect the saints to do the work of the New Testament ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ
When we grow up into Christ, everything will be in Christ, and something will issue out from Him to supply the whole Body
In this true God there are three things: the economy of God, the Christ of God, and the Body of Christ, the church
The universe is immeasurable, and Paul compared the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe to the measure of Christ
If a man does not have Christ in him, even if he is baptized ten thousand times, he is still not a member of the church
After we believed in the Lord and began to love Him, we began to decrease, and Christ began to increase within us
Whether they are big things, small things, spiritual things, or things in our daily life, we have to allow the Lord to grow in us
We should acknowledge the authority of His headship in our Christian life, in the church life, and in everything
When we grow into the Head, Christ, we are allowing Christ to increase and grow in all the inward parts of the members
Today our common problem is that we reserve a big part within us for ourselves and give the Lord only a little place
The meaning of the perfecting of the saints is to allow Christ to have the proper place in us and to increase in us day by day
It is a matter of denying our self and knowing the crucified and resurrected Lord as the Spirit who abides in us to be our life
Through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body'
These are the gifts described in verse 11: the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers
They are the joints, which are joined together by the sinews, for the rich supply to every member of the Body of Christ
Through the rich supply of every joint and according to the operation in measure of each one part, the Body of Christ grows gradually
To be knit together is for all the other parts to be joined to the frames and to be knit together with one another to form one Body
The life in the new way is the normal Christian life, which is a life of being revived every morning and overcoming every day
Proverbs 4:18 says, 'The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day'
The Christian pathway is not one of sunset but one like the dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day
The element of the Lord's death kills the temper within us, terminating our old creation and enabling us to overcome
In Romans 7 Paul speaks of the experience of the struggle between the law of sin in the flesh and the law of good in man
Without this kind of living, we are not qualified to talk about the new way, and there is no way for us to have the service in the new way
The first item of service in the new way is to contact people, that is, to pay the price to contact people for the Lord
When we preach the gospel by visiting people and bring people to salvation, they become the Lord's lambs, and there is the need for feeding
Perhaps a certain one has only believed in the Lord in an outward way; within he has not touched the Lord and has no experience of salvation
Although a Gentile person may repent, believe, be baptized, and be saved, yet he still knows nothing concerning the spiritual things
In this way, you can go out to preach the gospel again to gain more new ones, and the cycle can repeat itself over and over
For this we need all the brothers and sisters to rise up and to strive together in one accord to grow in life and to be taught in the truth
The psalms are for praising God, the teachings are for teaching men, and the revelations are for revealing and releasing the light of God
Since all of us love the Lord, love the church, and are willing to help others, we should first go to contact people
When we all come together on the Lord's Day, we all pray-read these verses and share and prophesy according to them
Although this is not an easy thing to do, we will succeed if we have a heart for the Lord and if we desire to advance
In addition, you have to learn the truth, experience life, pick up the burden, and pay the price to care for people
