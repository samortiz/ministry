	 <h2 class="head1">A NORMAL OVERCOMING<br />
CHRISTIAN LIFE ALWAYS HAVING<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S PRESENCE&mdash;MANIFESTATION</h2>
<p>What kind of living should we have after we are saved? This is the focus of our fellowship in this chapter. After we are saved, the Lord should continually manifest Himself to us. We should have His face and His presence. Moreover, the Lord should make His abode with us.</p>
<p>We will first consider the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation and then consider the Lord making an abode with us. Suppose two people are sitting together, facing each other. Each one has the other&rsquo;s manifestation. If one goes to another room, he will become hidden, and the other will no longer have his manifestation. As long as one cannot see the other, he does not have the other&rsquo;s manifestation. The other will be manifested only when he returns. Hence, in order to have someone&rsquo;s manifestation, we must be able to see his face. After a person is saved, if his living is normal and overcoming, he should constantly have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation, the Lord&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>I believe that we all have had this kind of experience. Many times we have had the Lord&rsquo;s face. We did not see His face physically, but we had His face within us. In our inner being we were very clear that the Lord was manifesting Himself to us and that His presence was with us. However, there have been many times when we knew that the Lord was not manifesting Himself to us; instead, He was hidden from us. The young brothers and sisters are often concerned about watching movies. Many of them have argued with me, saying, &ldquo;Why can we not go to the movies?&rdquo; I do not have to argue. I only ask, &ldquo;While you are watching the movie, is the Lord Jesus with you? Does He manifest Himself to you? Is His face with you? Do you have the shining of His face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being a Christian is not a matter of sin or of love for the world. These are negative things. Being a Christian is a matter of having the Lord&rsquo;s presence by seeing His face. Fundamentally, being a Christian is not a matter of dealing with the world or sins, nor is it a matter of doing good or evil. Being a Christian is entirely a matter of having the Lord&rsquo;s presence. Hence, our primary concern is not dealing with sin or the world. Our primary concern is our dealing with the Lord, that is, our relationship with the Lord. Whether or not a person is saved does not depend on whether he sins or loves the world. Rather, it depends on his relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. This is the only thing that matters.</p>
<p>Similarly, whether or not a believer can have an overcoming life does not depend on the things he does, nor does it depend on whether he deals with sins and the world. His life depends on how he deals with the Lord. Even if we do not sin, if the Lord hides His face from us, it will be difficult for us to have a good Christian life.</p>
<p>Losing the Lord&rsquo;s presence is something that Christians should fear more than anything else. Sometimes people say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you are always giving messages; you speak daily and even many times a day. We are concerned for you. Even if you have three hundred topics, sooner or later you will exhaust them. Then what will you do? Will you still give messages?&rdquo; I always say, &ldquo;I am not worried about running out of messages. What I fear is losing the Lord&rsquo;s presence, His manifestation, His face. I am not concerned about whether I have something to speak in the meetings. To me, the most fearful thing is that the Lord would hide His face from me. I am fearful that the Lord would not manifest Himself to me and would not be with me. This is what I fear. If the Lord&rsquo;s presence is with me, everything will be all right.&rdquo; If we have the Lord&rsquo;s face, everything is all right. There will be messages to give and words to speak. If we have the Lord&rsquo;s face, all sinful things will be under our feet, and the world will be behind us. Hence, a Christian must not lose the Lord&rsquo;s face, the Lord&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>Do you have the Lord&rsquo;s face, His manifestation, His presence? You should not take this as a matter of doctrine. When you leave your home, does the Lord say, &ldquo;My face will go with you&rdquo;? What do you say? Perhaps you say, &ldquo;Lord, I am going out. If You do not go with me, I will not go. My going out is Your business, not mine. If Your face, Your presence, does not come with me, I will not go.&rdquo; If you contact the Lord in this way, the Lord will say, &ldquo;I will go with you,&rdquo; and you will always have His manifestation, His face. You must always ask whether you have the Lord&rsquo;s presence, His manifestation.</p>
