   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Mark 10:45 says, "The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Luke 19:10 says, "For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 10:10 says, "I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus came to the earth for man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to Mark 10, He came to serve men even to the point of giving His life as a ransom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The purpose for His coming was to serve men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In His service to men, there was the need for Him to give His life as a ransom, and that is what He did.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His becoming a ransom was the highest and consummate act of His service to men.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord did not say that the Son of Man came only to be a ransom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He said that the Son of Man came "to serve."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The goal was service.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was interested in man, and He considered man precious and worthy of love and service.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He served men to such an extent that He met their need by becoming their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is why He gave His life as a ransom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we preach the gospel of the Lord's sacrifice of His life as a ransom without having the Lord's heart of service, we are not qualified to be called His workers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man is lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because he is lovable, the Lord did not say that it was "the Son of God" who came to serve, but "the Son of Man" who came.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Jesus first loved and served men, and then He gave His life for them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Love comes first; the sacrifice of life comes afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we work among men, we cannot preach the Lord's sacrifice without first having the proper love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not think that we can first preach His sacrifice and then love the listener after he has received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we have no interest in man and do not find him precious, and if we have no awareness that we are all fellow creatures of God, we cannot preach about sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we have never been touched by the expression God created man or have very little feeling for it, we are unfit to preach Christ's sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers and sisters, we must first love all men before we can lead them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We cannot hold back our love until they receive the Lord or until they become our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Unfortunately, this is a problem with many people; they come short in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many people hold back their love for a person until he or she has become a brother or a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brothers and sisters, this is not the way our Lord works.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He first loved, and then He gave His life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We who preach His redemption also should love first and then preach redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our Lord first served and showed mercy to others before giving His life as a ransom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same way, we should be interested in men, counting them worthy of our love and grace, before we present the Lord's redemption to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If God opens our heart to see that we are fellow men among all men, our attitude towards them will drastically change.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We will find man lovable and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers and sisters, it needs to dawn on us that man is precious in God's eyes because He created man in His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even today, man is still in the likeness of his Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Unless man becomes the object of our affection we cannot possibly become a servant of men.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must find man lovable and valuable in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many brothers and sisters have an altogether wrong attitude, temperament, and sentiment toward their fellow men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They consider them a burden, trouble, nuisance, or an annoyance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is totally wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must learn to see man as God's creation with God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although man has become fallen, his future remains bright.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we regarded man as lovable, we would not feel that man is a burden, trouble, nuisance, or an annoyance to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord went to the cross for man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Can our love be anything less than this?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a man is touched by the Lord in a genuine way, and if he really sees the Lord's goal in coming to the earth, he will spontaneously conclude that man is lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is impossible for anyone who has a genuine knowledge of the Lord to despise man.</S>
