   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Sanctification the Sanctification of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second step of transformation is sanctification, the sanctification of the Holy Spirit Rom 6:19, 22; 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After our old man was buried through baptism, God set us apart and sanctified our regenerated new man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This new man belongs to God, and God is in this new man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This sanctification is not only an objective sanctification in position; it is even more a subjective sanctification in disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We, as the saved ones, all have this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, after a person is saved, without anyone telling him, he may feel that the shoes he is wearing are too worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When he bought this pair, he liked the pointed style, which is a favorite of the Texan cowboys.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But now that he is saved, when he wears these shoes, he feels that there is too much of a worldly flavor, so he cannot wear them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I went to the United States about thirty years ago, it was the time of the hippies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There were many hippies who came to our meetings, but there was one that I can never forget.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was big in stature, wore a headdress with varied colors, and had a long beard.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He came to the meetings barefoot and sat on the front row.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Praise the Lord, after two or three meetings his headdress was gone, and after another week his long beard was also gone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I was very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, he still came barefoot.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After another week he came wearing sandals.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was better than being barefoot.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After another period of time he came wearing shoes, and after a little more time he came also wearing socks.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Stanza 1 of Hymns, #841 says, "Thou art all my life, Lord, / In me Thou dost live; / With Thee all God's fullness / Thou to me dost give.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>/ By Thy holy nature / I am sanctified, / By Thy resurrection, / Vict'ry is supplied."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord lives in us to be our life, and this life with the divine nature sanctifies us within.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the second step of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>C. Renewing the Renewing of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The third step of transformation is renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we were washed, we were sanctified; when we were sanctified, we were renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Titus 3 speaks of the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I know of some brothers and sisters who have changed their hairstyles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was not due to the teachings of man, but it was surely the renewing of the Holy Spirit within them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1942 during the great revival in Chefoo a young woman came into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She was from a very rich family.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She had gone to Shanghai by herself to study law in the university so that she might come back to fight for her inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all knew her family situation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I saw her sitting in the meeting and noticed that her hair was like a tower three or four stories high.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After she came to the meetings for about one or two weeks, I saw that the high tower on her head was dismantled, though not completely, because there was still a little portion left.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then after another period of time, the tower was completely brought down.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can say that the change in her hairstyle was a renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From the time we are saved, we who love the Lord may feel that we are often weak, and we fail in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet if we carefully consider even a little, we will realize that in many areas we have been renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Beginning from Our Mind</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Renewing begins from our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Romans 12:2 says, "Be transformed by the renewing of the mind."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is in us as our life to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How does He begin the transformation?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First, God comes to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many verses in the Bible refer to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord be with your spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This shows us that the Lord is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then it says, "Grace be with you."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, our spirit is the deepest part of our being, and it is surrounded by our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, the Lord wants us who love Him to have our spirit spread into our soul that we may always set our mind on our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We all know that man has three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The outermost part is the body, the innermost is the spirit, and in the middle is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, starting from the outside, we have the body, the soul, and the spirit; whereas, starting from the inside, we have the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we were saved, we first felt regretful and confessed our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That feeling of regret was the function of our conscience, which is the main part of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then we repented and called on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although we called outwardly, we were motivated from the spirit deep within us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thus, we believed in the Lord and received Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He then began to renew us in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The renewing of the mind is the foundation of the transformation of our soul, and it is the result of our setting our mind on the spirit Rom 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our mind is the main part of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Since our emotion and our will, together with our mind, constitute our soul, when our mind is renewed, our emotion and will spontaneously will be renewed along with the mind.</S>
