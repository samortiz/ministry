<P>To say "Amen" in response to others' prayer is a practice taught by Paul in 1 Corinthians. In 14:16 Paul said that we need to pray in such a way that others can say "Amen." If there are no Amens to indicate our one accord, we should not expect that our prayer will be heard. If only two on earth pray in one accord, their prayer will be answered. The one accord is the practice, the application, of the oneness, and the oneness is the basis on which we practice the one accord. This is very meaningful.</P><P>In a church meeting there may be people of different races and colors. Our one accord could never be based on the different races and colors. We practice one accord based on the fact that we all have a common life. We may be different in race and in the color of our skin, but when we come together to pray, we must forget about the different races and colors. We do have a base for our oneness; thus, we can practice the one accord.</P><P>Not only so, if we do not have the same understanding, the same intention, the same purpose, the same goal, it will be impossible to pray together in one accord. There will be no base for such prayer. If we each have our own opinion, our own intention, and our own goal, there will be no base on which we can pray in one accord. But when we who are saved and who love the Lord and mean business for the Lord's purpose come together, we surely have the base to pray in one accord.</P><P>In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed for the oneness of His believers. That oneness was only in His aspiration. A little more than fifty days later, on the day of Pentecost, the oneness in the Lord's aspiration was accomplished. The oneness in the Lord's aspiration became the oneness in actuality. This oneness is called "the oneness of the Spirit" (Eph. 4:3), the Spirit here being the consummated Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, as the consummation of the entire Triune God. We, the saved ones, possess this oneness as our heritage. We possess this oneness, we enjoy it, and we apply it. To apply this oneness is to keep it, and to keep it is to practice one accord.</P><P>If in our Christian life and our church life we do not practice one accord, we conduct ourselves as if we are unlearned people who do not know that there is such a thing as the oneness of the Spirit. Suppose you have one billion dollars in your checking account. If you never write checks, it will seem as if you do not have a checking account at all, or that your account has a zero balance. Your writing of checks is the practice of your realization that there is one billion dollars in your checking account. The one billion dollars in your checking account is your possession. We may liken the oneness of the Spirit to a one billion dollar deposit in our heavenly bank account. Therefore, every day and in every meeting we need to "write checks"; that is, we need to exercise to apply the oneness of the Spirit to the present situation.</P>
