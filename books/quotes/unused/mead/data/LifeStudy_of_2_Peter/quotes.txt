[1]  The subject of 1 Peter is the Christian life under the government of God.
[2]  The book of 2 Peter is a continuation of 1 Peter, and it also emphasizes God s government.
[3]  Verse 1 ends with the phrase in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[4]  At Peter s time this designated and separated the believers in Christ from the Jews, who did not believe that Jesus Christ was God, and from the Romans, who believed that Caesar, not Jesus Christ, was their God.
[5]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND PETER MESSAGE TWO THE DIVINE PROVISION 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Pet 1:1-4
[6]  In the previous message we began to consider 1:1-4.
[7]  The like precious faith, allotted to us by God through the word of God s New Testament economy and the Spirit, responds to the reality of such contents and ushers us into the reality, making its substance the very element of our Christian life and experience.
[8]  In verse 2 Peter goes on to say, Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[9]  Grace and peace came to us through the God-allotted faith, which substantiates the life-blessing of the New Testament.
[10]  This faith was infused into us through the word of God, which conveys to us the real knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[11]  In the sphere of, by means of, the full knowledge, the increasing and increased knowledge, of God and of Jesus our Lord, the grace and peace which we have received will be multiplied.
[12]  In 1:3 the pronoun Him refers to God who is our Savior and our Lord Jesus Christ vv.
[13]  Second Peter 1:1 indicates that we all have been allotted like precious faith.
[14]  We have seen that faith is the substantiation of the substance of the truth Heb 11:1 , which is the reality of the contents of God s New Testament economy.
[15]  God s economy is a matter of the Triune God dispensing all that He is into us.
[16]  It should become easy for us to say that faith is the substantiation of the substance of God s economy, and God s economy is to dispense Himself into our being as our life and life supply.
[17]  In 1:1 why is it that Peter does not say that God has allotted us a portion of the inheritance, but instead says that God has allotted faith to us?
[18]  This allotment contains all things related to life and godliness, including the divine nature and the precious and exceedingly great promises.
[19]  God has given us these promises so that through them we may become partakers of the divine nature.
[20]  He has called us to His glory and virtue and He has given us the promises for the purpose that we may enjoy the divine nature.
[21]  But it is according to the Scriptures to teach that because we have been born of God, we possess the divine life and the divine nature and that, in these two aspects, we have become the same as God.
[22]  In this message I have the burden to consider further 2 Peter 1:1-4.
[23]  Verse 1 says, Simon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have been allotted like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[24]  Christ s righteous deed of dying on the cross in obedience to God fulfilled God s righteousness and gave Him, the righteous God, the legitimate position to justify all those who believe in this righteous deed of Christ.
[25]  The second crucial point in verse 2 concerns the words in the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[26]  According to verse 1, the allotment of the precious faith was given to us in the sphere of a twofold righteousness and by means of this righteousness, the righteousness of our God and our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[27]  Now in verse 2 we see that grace and peace also come to us in a sphere and by a particular means the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[28]  In verse 3 we have the continuation of the thought in verse 2: As His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness, through the full knowledge of Him who has called us to His own glory and virtue.
[29]  Now we can know the way to experience the multiplication of grace.
[30]  We need to realize that all things which relate to life and godliness have already been given to us, and that inwardly we have the divine life with the divine nature.
[31]  In Ephesians 1 Paul goes on to indicate that this divine power has been applied to us v. 22 . Hallelujah, the very power, the divine power, that raised Christ from among the dead and seated Him at God s right hand in the heavenlies, far above all, has been applied to us!
[32]  In this message we shall continue the review of 1:1-4.
[33]  Second Peter 1:3 says, As His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness, through the full knowledge of Him who has called us to His own glory and virtue.
[34]  We definitely need the full knowledge of the One who has called us for the purpose of bringing us into His glory and virtue.
[35]  If we have such an experiential knowledge of Him, the divine power will operate in us effectively.
[36]  According to 2 Peter 1:4, God has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises for a specific purpose.
[37]  Through the precious and exceedingly great promises, we, the believers in Christ, have become partakers of His divine nature in an organic union with Him.
[38]  Besides, along with, the precious and exceedingly great promises given to us by God, we should bring in all diligence to cooperate with the enabling of the dynamic divine nature for the carrying out of God s promises.
[39]  The knowledge which we should develop in our virtue includes the knowledge of God and of our Savior, the knowledge of God s economy, the knowledge of what faith is, and the knowledge of the divine power, glory, virtue, nature, and life.
[40]  According to Peter s word in verse 6, in our self-control we need to develop endurance.
[41]  In verse 8 Peter speaks of not being idle or unfruitful unto the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[42]  The constitution with the spiritual virtues as its constituents advances in many steps toward the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, with a view to the full realization of the all-inclusive embodiment of the Triune God.
[43]  In this section of the Word, three prepositions are used regarding the relationship of the experience of life to spiritual knowledge: in, in verse 2, referring to the sphere of the knowledge; through, in verse 3, referring to the channel of the knowledge; and unto, in verse 8, referring to the knowledge in view as a goal.
[44]  In verse 6 Peter goes on to say, And in knowledge self-control, and in self-control endurance, and in endurance godliness.
[45]  After a word of introduction 1:1-2 , Peter speaks concerning the divine provision 1:3-21 .
[46]  Concerning the word eyewitnesses Darby comments, Admitted into immediate vision of the glory, a word used for full initiation into the mysteries.
[47]  Peter realizes that he James, and John were admitted to the highest degree of initiation at the Lord s transfiguration, admitted to be the initiated spectators of His majesty.
[48]  Peter considers the Lord s transfiguration as a figure of His second coming, even as the Lord did in Luke 9:26-36.
[49]  In 1:19-21 Peter goes on to use the prophetic word found in the Old Testament to confirm their testimony.
[50]  This shining is part of the divine provision, the provision God has made by His power so that His elect children may be able to stay away from heresy and apostasy.
[51]  If we give heed to the prophecies of the Bible, we shall experience a lamp shining within us, enjoy the morning star rising in our hearts, and have a spiritual day dawning within us.
[52]  The first chapter of the Epistle of 2 Peter is on the divine provision.
[53]  The divine life is contained in the faith that has been allotted to us, and the divine light is contained in God s word, in the word of the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament apostles.
[54]  Peter says that the false teachers will bring upon themselves swift destruction.
[55]  In this Epistle Peter uses three different Greek words concerning the consequence of the apostasy under God s judgment.
[56]  In 2:4-9 Peter speaks concerning God s judgment of old on both angels and men.
[57]  Verse 4 says, For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but delivered them to gloomy pits, having cast them down to Tartarus, being kept for judgment.
[58]  In this message we shall consider the evils of the false teachers and their punishment under God s judgment 2:10-22 .
[59]  In God s governmental dealing, they will be especially kept under punishment for the day of judgment because they go after the flesh, indulging in defiling lust and corrupting luxury for pleasure, and despise the Lord s government, rebelling against His authority vv.
[60]  Verse 13 says, Suffering unrighteousness as the wages of unrighteousness, counting luxury in the day to be pleasure; spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceits, feasting together with you.
[61]  Verse 20 says, For if having escaped the defilements of the world by the full knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and having again been entangled in these, they are overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.
[62]  In order to fit in with the government of Him who is holy and righteous, God s people need to live in a manner of life that is holy, pure, good, and excellent 1 Pet 1:15; 3:16, 2; 2:12; 2 Pet 3:11 , not licentious or vain 2:7; 1 Pet 1:18 , in His straight way of righteousness and truth.
[63]  In this message we come to chapter three of 2 Peter.
[64]  The Greek word for world, kosmos, denotes order, a system, the world with its inhabitants.
[65]  The earth in the preceding verse became the world in this verse, not merely the earth, but the earth with its inhabitants in a system.
[66]  This refers to the world in Noah s age, which was judged by God with the flood due to the sinfulness and ungodliness of that age Gen 6:5-7, 11-13, 17 .
[67]  Here Peter skips over the millennium, the period of time from the Lord s coming to the judgment of the great white throne.
[68]  Peter is dealing here with God s governmental judgment.
[69]  Here Peter speaks concerning the mountain peaks of the Lord s coming and of God s final judgment, but not of the plain of the millennial kingdom that lies between the peak of the Lord s coming and that of the final judgment.
[70]  In the books of 1 and 2 Peter only two chapters are crucial concerning the divine life.
[71]  Peter s word regarding the day of the Lord in verse 10 indicates that again he passes over the one thousand years of the millennium, just as he did earlier in this chapter when he spoke of the Lord s coming in verse 4 and the judgment of the white throne in verse 7.
[72]  In 3:4 the mockers said, Where is the promise of His coming?
[73]  In verse 11 Peter goes on to say, All these things being thus dissolved, what kind of persons ought you to be in holy manner of life and godliness.
[74]  Although all things whether on earth or in the heavens have been reconciled to God through Christ by His blood Col 1:20 , the heavenly things having been purified by the blood of Christ Heb 9:23 , they still need to be cleared up by being burned up in God s governmental dealing so that they may become new in nature and appearance in God s new universe 2 Pet 3:13 .
[75]  Thus, what kind of persons ought we, the children of the holy God, to be in holy manner of life and godliness; that is, what kind of transformation ought we to have to live a life in the manner of God s holy nature and godliness to express Him so that we may be qualified to match His holy government?
[76]  In verse 13 we have the expectation of the new heavens and the new earth filled with God s righteousness; in 14 to 16, the preparation for the coming judgment; and in 17 and 18, the conclusion, where we are told to be on guard and grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord.
[77]  The main thing we see in John s writings is God s love expressed in His life; in Paul s writings, God s grace distributed in His dispensation; and in Peter s writings, God s righteousness maintained in His government.
[78]  This righteousness will dwell in the new heavens and earth and it will saturate God s new universe prevailingly to maintain it absolutely under God s righteous order, so that there will be no need ever of any further judgment.
[79]  In order to prepare for the coming judgment, we should not only be found in peace, but we should also be saved from destruction.
[80]  Concerning this, Peter says in 3:15 and 16: And count the longsuffering of our Lord to be salvation, even as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you, as also in all his letters, speaking in them concerning these things, in which some things are hard to understand, which the unlearned and unstable twist, as also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.
[81]  The mockers count, or consider, the Lord s longsuffering toward the believers as delay, tardiness, or slackness v. 9 . This is their twisting of the Lord s word spoken by the prophets in the Scriptures and the apostles in their teachings.
[82]  Hence, Peter charges the believers to count the Lord s longsuffering as salvation instead of delay, not twisting the prophets prophecies nor the apostles teachings, including Peter s and also Paul s, that they may not be judged unto destruction, as the heretics will at the Lord s coming.
[83]  The believers, as God s possession, have been chosen by God 1 Pet 1:1-2; 2:9 , called by His glory and virtue 1 Pet 2:9; 3:9; 2 Pet 1:10 , redeemed by Christ 1 Pet 1:18-19 , regenerated of God through His living word 1 Pet 1:3, 23 , and saved through the resurrection of Christ 1 Pet 3:21 .
[84]  Paul in his writings also speaks these things except the new heavens and the new earth .
[85]  Such a ministry ministers to people, as its focus, the all-inclusive Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, who, after passing through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, dispenses Himself through the redemption of Christ and by the operation of the Holy Spirit to His redeemed people as their unique portion of life, life supply, and everything, for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ, which will consummate in the full expression, the fullness, of the Triune God, according to the eternal purpose of the Father.
