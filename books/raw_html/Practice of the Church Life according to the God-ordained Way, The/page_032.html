<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Carrying Out the God-ordained Way<br>for the Building Up of the Body of Christ<br>in the Annulling of the Old Way<br>Related to Christianity</H2><P>If we practice to prophesy, we will carry out the God-ordained way for the building up of the Body of Christ and annul the old way related to Christianity (Eph. 4:12). The way to defeat the old way of Christianity is to speak. If we have a meeting full of everyone speaking, such a meeting defeats the old way of Christianity and is the victory of the Lord's Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE LOSSES OF NOT PRACTICING TO PROPHESY</H2><P>We have seen the benefits of practicing to prophesy. Now we must see the losses of not practicing to prophesy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Cooling Down the Believers' Interest<br>in the Lord's Service</H2><P>Not practicing to prophesy cools down the believers' interest in the Lord's service. I am afraid of a meeting in which very few speak. Such a meeting will scatter the audience. Those who come to a meeting of silence will be discouraged from coming to a meeting again. This is because they are cooled down by the silence. Silence cools down, but speaking always stirs up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Annulling the Believers' Capacity<br>in the Divine Life</H2><P>The practice of one man speaking and the rest listening has annulled the capacity of the believers in the divine life. Every life has a capacity. All believers have the divine life, but if they do not speak, their capacity will not be developed. This is the reason for the poverty of today's situation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Burying the Believers' Spiritual Function,<br>Making the Church's Service to the Lord<br>Poor in the Lord's Economy</H2><P>Not practicing to prophesy also buries the believers' spiritual function. This makes the church's service to the Lord poor in the Lord's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Leaving the Believers Unedified<br>in Undergrowth and in Ignorance</H2><P>Another loss of not practicing to prophesy is that the believers are left unedified in undergrowth and in ignorance. When children are being raised, they need to speak all the time. Otherwise, they will be left in undergrowth and ignorance. Without the practice of speaking, there is no growth. But the more the children speak, the more they learn and are instructed by their parents.</P>
