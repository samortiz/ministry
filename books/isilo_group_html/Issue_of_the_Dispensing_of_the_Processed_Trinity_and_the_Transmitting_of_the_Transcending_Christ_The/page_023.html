This is for the Spirit's transforming of the believers metabolically.</P><P>3.The first section of the divine revelation presented to us in the book of Ephesians is the Triune God's triune dispensing. The three aspects of the Triune God's triune dispensing are the three sections of the Holy Spirit's sanctification performed in the believers. The first section is the regenerating sanctification in our spirit to bring forth many sons for God to form an organism for God's corporate expression, which is the organic Body of Christ, the church. The second section is the transforming sanctification in our soul to transform the regenerated believers by renewing them and conforming them to the glorious image of Christ that they may become a heritage of worth, a treasure to God as God's private possession. This will bring the upside-down universe into an upright order by heading up all the collapsed things under Christ. The third section is the consummating sanctification in our body to transfigure the believers' body by redeeming their vile body into God's glory that they may be fully and wholly sanctified in their spirit, soul, and body to be a consummated corporation of God's many sons who are matured in the processed Triune God as their life that they may express God as the New Jerusalem for eternity.</P><P>4.Hence, the carrying out of God's eternal economy is the Spirit's sanctification. The accomplishment of God's eternal economy hinges on the sanctification of the Spirit. Thus, the Spirit's sanctification has very much to do with the Body of Christ, which is the issue of the Spirit's sanctifying work. It is because of this that Ephesians 4:4 says "one Body and one Spirit," and the sanctified life of the saints is the infilling of the sanctifying Spirit in our spirit (Eph. 5:18). Our new man is created according to God in His holiness by the renewing in the spirit of our mind.</P><P>5.Since the book of Ephesians is the revelation of the church as the issue of the Spirit's triune dispensing, it stresses the Spirit's infilling for the saints' holy living and the divine holy element for the saints' holy constitution. We, the pursuers of Christ, must pay our full attention to our inward constitution with the divine element and to our outward living by the Spirit's inner filling.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Issue of the Dispensing of the Processed Trinity and the Transmitting of the Transcending Christ &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
