   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPOSING OUR SITUATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why is it that after the Lord Jesus instituted His supper, He warned the disciples of their stumbling and charged them to watch and pray?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The reason is that whenever the Lord reveals something concerning Himself in God s economy, He exposes our real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Consider the case of Peter in chapter eight.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Peter received the revelation that Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After Peter received this revelation, the Lord exposed him as being Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, the Lord went on to expose Peter s self, his soul life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The institution of the Lord s table reveals the Lord s death, His resurrection, the Lord Himself, and His enlargement, His mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Immediately after this revelation, Peter and the other disciples were exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Their natural man, self, self-will, mind, and thought were all exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although they experienced the Lord s institution of His table, they did not realize how much they were in themselves and how much they were according to the natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus exposed them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This exposure is the practicality of being brought into the Lord s death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>BROUGHT INTO</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE LORD S DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we read chapters fourteen and fifteen of the Gospel of Mark, we see that Peter was brought into the Lord s crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Peter boasted that he would never deny the Lord Jesus, he had not yet been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He claimed that even if all the others were stumbled, he would not be stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He went on to say, If I must die with You, I will by no means deny You 14:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, very shortly after making this boast, he fully denied the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After denying Him, Peter remembered the word Jesus had said to him, Before a cock crows twice, you will deny Me three times.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And thinking upon it, he wept 14:72 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In a very real sense, this was Peter s crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He wept because he had been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although Peter denied the Lord, he did not give up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, he went on to enter into the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps you are wondering what indication there is in the Gospel of Mark that Peter entered into Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Consider the word of the angel to the women who came to the tomb early in the morning on the day of the Lord s resurrection: Do not be amazed; you are seeking Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was raised!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is not here!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Behold, the place where they laid Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But go, tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him, even as He told you 16:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here we see that the angel specifically names Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that Peter was brought into the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not read the Gospel of Mark merely as a book of stories.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to see the revelation in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Gospel of Mark reveals that the Lord Jesus did not intend to go through death and resurrection alone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead, it was the Lord s intention to bring His followers with Him into death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we see this revelation, we shall be assured that, as those who love the Lord Jesus, He will bring us through His death and into His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we come to the end of the Gospel of Mark, we see that all the Lord s followers were brought not only into His death and resurrection but also into His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In His ascension they were sent out to preach the gospel to the uttermost parts of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Praise the Lord that His disciples were brought into His death, resurrection, and ascension!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>EXPOSURE AND CRUCIFIXION</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although Peter was present when the Lord instituted His supper, he did not understand the significance of it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Immediately after the supper, the Lord warned His disciples about being stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This warning was an indication that the disciples were still in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even though the Lord had instituted the supper and they had all partaken of it, they were nevertheless in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Immediately Peter behaved himself in a natural way, boasting that he would not be stumbled or deny the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After warning His disciples concerning their stumbling, the Lord Jesus brought three of them Peter, James, and John with Him to Gethsemane.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord charged them to remain here and watch v. 34 . However, when He came to them, He found them sleeping and said to Peter, Simon, are you sleeping? Are you not strong enough to watch one hour? v. 37 . Peter, the leader of the disciples, took the lead to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He did not have the strength to do anything except sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Peter also behaved in a natural way when the Lord Jesus was arrested.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest, and took off his ear v. 47 . Peter again caused trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the time the Lord Jesus was being arrested, it was necessary for Him to perform a miracle to heal the ear of the high priest s slave Luke 22:50-51 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to Mark 14:66-72 Peter utterly denied the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One of the servant girls of the high priest said to Peter, You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus! v. 67 . But Peter denied this, saying, I neither know nor understand what you are saying v. 68 . Shortly thereafter Peter denied the Lord Jesus twice more.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through this exposure Peter was put on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord Jesus was crucified, and Peter also was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His exposure was his crucifixion.</S>
