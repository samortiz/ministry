The Rapture of the Majority of the Saints,<br>Prophesied by the Apostle,<br>Having Been Made More Firm by the Lord</H2><P>The rapture of the majority of the saints, prophesied by the apostle in 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17, has been made more firm by the Lord's words in Revelation 14:14-16, 15:2, and 20:4, 6. Revelation 14:14-16 speaks of the harvest of God's crop on this earth, that is, the rapture of the majority of the saints living on earth. Then Revelation 15:2 depicts the overcomers who have passed through the tribulation and the persecution of Antichrist. These ones have been raptured and are standing on the glassy sea. The glassy sea mingled with fire is a miniature of the lake of fire and eventually becomes the lake of fire. The late overcomers' standing on the glassy sea indicates that they have overcome the lake of fire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Three More Things Made More Firm<br>by the New Testament Prophecies</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Producing of Antichrist</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) As a Beast Coming out of the Mediterranean Sea</H2><P>Revelation 13:1 says, "And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems, and on his heads names of blasphemy." The beast, which is the fourth beast mentioned in Daniel 7:7, is Antichrist. The sea is the Mediterranean Sea, out of which Antichrist will come. The territory of the Roman Empire in ancient times surrounded the Mediterranean Sea. Antichrist will be a Caesar of the restored Roman Empire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) A Little Horn Coming Up<br>among the Ten Horns of the Beast</H2><P>Antichrist is a little horn coming up among the ten horns of the beast (Dan. 7:7-8). The ten horns signify the ten kings of the restored Roman Empire (Rev. 17:12). These ten kings, ten horns, are also likened to the ten toes of the great image seen by Nebuchadnezzar in his dream (Dan. 2:42). They will submit themselves and their kingdom to Antichrist.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) Coming out of the Abyss underneath the Sea</H2><P>Antichrist comes out of the abyss underneath the sea (Rev. 17:8a). On the one hand, Revelation tells us that Antichrist will come up out of the abyss (Rev. 9:11; 11:7; 17:8). On the other hand, it tells us that he comes up out of the sea (Rev. 13:1). This indicates that Antichrist will come from two sources. His spirit, which has been existing in the abyss before he is born, will come up out of the abyss. His body will come from one of the Gentile nations around the Mediterranean Sea.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> </body></html>
