[1]  CHAPTER ONE THE RECOVERY OF THE SERVICE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Rom 15:16; 12:1-2; Col 1:28-29; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; Luke 10:1-6; John 15:16 THE WAY OF PRACTICE NOT BEING EASILY OR CLEARLY SEEN
[2]  Unless we take this view, when we come to the matter of how to serve God in preaching the gospel, we may never realize that we who preach the gospel are all priests of the gospel of God.
[3]  Despite the church's degraded condition, there have been a few since the second and third centuries who have loved the Lord with a pure heart and who have recovered the Lord's truths.
[4]  Hence, Peter went on to say that we are a royal priesthood, a holy nation, so that we may tell out the virtues of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light v. 9 . This is to announce the salvation of God through the gospel that people may be saved to become spiritual sacrifices offered to God.
[5]  For this reason, in the church, those who are gifted in gospel preaching not only should go forth to preach the gospel but also should spend time to perfect other saints that they also may be able to preach the gospel as the gifted ones do.
[6]  CHAPTER TWO EVERYONE PARTICIPATING IN THE SERVICE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Luke 19:10; Acts 1:8 THE COMPLETE WORK OF THE PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL
[7]  The first step is to go forth and visit people with the gospel that sinners may be saved and offered as sacrifices to God.
[8]  CHAPTER THREE THE ORIGIN, DEVELOPMENT, AND PRACTICE OF THE OFFERING OF SACRIFICES BY THE PRIESTS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 9:22-23; John 21:15; Eph 4:11-12; Acts 20:20, 27, 31; Heb 10:24-25; 1 Cor 14:26, 3-5, 31, 24 THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRIESTS' OFFERING OF SACRIFICES
[9]  In the previous two messages we saw that God's intention is that every believer should be a priest of the gospel carrying out the complete work of the priesthood of the gospel for the accomplishing of God's New Testament economy.
[10]  John possessed the four characteristics given to man by God in the creation of man: having God's image to express Him, having God's authority to represent Him, having a human spirit to receive God, and having God's life to live Him out.
[11]  God bestowed on him an unprecedented, divine, and great commission to go forth to preach the gospel of the kingdom of God to bring people to repent and be baptized that they might enter into the kingdom of God.
[12]  Our gospel preaching today is mainly the preaching of such a Christ, who as the embodiment of God became the reality of God, solved all our problems through His crucifixion and resurrection, and released the divine life so that all who believe in Him may become the sons of God to express Him and the members of His Body to be presented to God.
[13]  THE WORK OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL IN OFFERING SACRIFICES Nourishing the Saved Ones So That They Also Present Themselves as Living Sacrifices to God
[14]  In the past, we may have heard, to some degree, something concerning the practice of the new way among us.
[15]  To practice the new way is to come back to the Bible and take the way ordained by God for the New Testament priests of the gospel to carry out the work of the gospel.
[16]  If we are willing to do these things, we become the genuine New Testament priests of the gospel to carry out the entire gospel work; that is, to deliver a God-chosen and called one from the position of a sinner to become a child of God and a member of Christ, and to help him to grow, be perfected, and eventually prophesy for the Lord for the edification of the saints and the building up of the Body of Christ.
[17]  CHAPTER FOUR THE RECOVERY OF THE ORGANIC PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY
[18]  Prayer: O Lord, we worship You that You have enabled us to see Your light and receive Your revelation.
[19]  BY THE ORGANIC ESSENCE AND BEING FULL OF THE SPIRIT AND LIFE Organic Preaching of the Gospel
[20]  In order to have the organic practice of the new way, we should have a great deal of exercise.
[21]  If we desire to go out week by week to preach the gospel, we first need to decide on a time and ask someone to coordinate with us; then, when the time comes, we go out together.
[22]  As gospel preachers, we need to pick up the burden to pray every day for our gospel contacts whose names we have listed.
[23]  BEING ASSURED THAT THE LORD WILL WORK OUT HIS RECOVERY
[24]  This is the conclusion of what we have received in the last four or five years after reconsidering our ways before the Lord according to the Bible, by studying church history, and by comparing the statistics of numerous denominations.
[25]  This is also the life that we should live, the work that we should do, and the way that we should take as God's New Testament priests of the gospel.
[26]  May every saint enter into the God-ordained way, may everyone be a priest of the gospel, may everyone preach the gospel to save sinners, may everyone nourish others, may everyone perfect others, and may everyone prophesy and help others to prophesy for releasing the riches of Christ that all may be supplied and the church may be built up.
[27]  CHAPTER FIVE LIVING THE CHURCH LIFE IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY TODAY Scripture Reading: Prov 4:18; 2 Cor 4:16; Rom 8:4; Col 1:29; 2 Cor 5:10 THE ORGANIC PRACTICE OF THE PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL ACCOMPLISHING GOD'S PURPOSE
[28]  In the previous messages we have seen clearly that God's desire in the New Testament is that every saved one be a priest of the gospel.
[29]  First, we need to go and preach the gospel to gain sinners that they may be regenerated so that we may offer them to God as sacrifices.
[30]  After this, we need to pick up the burden to go to their homes regularly to nourish and cherish them that they may receive the life supply and grow in the spiritual life until they can present themselves to God as living sacrifices.
[31]  THE STUDY OF THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY ACHIEVING THE ULTIMATE RESULTS
[32]  Strictly speaking, we do not need everyone to serve the Lord with their full time.
