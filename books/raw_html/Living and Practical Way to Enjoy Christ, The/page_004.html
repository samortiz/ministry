<P>According to Zechariah 12:1 it seems that God created only three prominent things: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man. This shows that only these three things are important and vital in this universe. The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man has a spirit for God. Here you have the purpose of the universe, the meaning of the universe. The heavens with all the stars and planets are for the earth. The earth is not for the heavens but for man. Without the earth, man could not exist. The earth is just right for us to live to fulfill our purpose. Man is not for education, for clothing, for food, for housing, or for entertainment. Man is good only for God. Man is a God-bottle, a vessel to contain God.</P><P>We should not think about doing something for God. We have received many wrong impressions from fallen Christianity. We think that we have to worship God, serve God, do something good for God, glorify God, and be nice, loving, and humble. I would ask you to forget about all this. God has no intention to have you be so humble and nice. God's intention is to have you filled up with Him.</P><P>No one would teach a Coca-Cola bottle to worship the Coca-Cola, serve the Coca-Cola, and do good to please the Coca-Cola. If the Coca-Cola bottle could speak, it would say that this is nonsense. It would say, "I was not made for this. I was made just to be filled up with Coca-Cola. I don't know anything else. I know just one thing: to be filled up with Coca-Cola! As long as I am empty, I am nothing! When I am filled up with Coca-Cola, that's wonderful!" In the same way, when we are filled up with God, that is wonderful. We are God-bottles who were made to be filled up with God. I do not care for being either humble or proud. I care just for one thing&#151;I have to be filled with God! I am a container of God! To contain God is my destiny!</P><P>Some may argue with me by saying that there are verses in the Bible which tell us that we have to serve the Lord. I agree with you, but what about Romans 9:21 and 23, which say that we are vessels unto honor and vessels of mercy unto glory? What about 2 Corinthians 4:7, which says that we have this treasure in earthen vessels? In this chapter I am not emphasizing the fact that we are servants of God or children of God. I want to hear you declare, "Hallelujah! I am a vessel of the Lord! I am a vessel of God." As a vessel, do you need to bow down and worship? We need to be filled with Christ because we are His vessels.</P><P>As God-bottles, we need a God-receiver. God is Spirit (John 4:24). Since God is Spirit, we need a spirit to receive Him. Only our spirit can receive the Spirit. Only our spirit can touch the Spirit. Only our spirit can contain the Spirit. Thus, God created the heavens and the earth and then man with a spirit.</P><P>Proverbs 20:27 tells us that man's spirit is the lamp of Jehovah (ASV). A lamp is a container. It contains the oil that gives the light. We have a human spirit, and our human spirit is a vessel. It is the container of God as the oil to give the light. The Christian life is not a matter of outward doing but a matter of an inward containing. It is not a matter of how much we do, work, and act outwardly. It is a matter of how much oil we are containing today. We do have a container within us. That is our human spirit. The human spirit is the lamp of Jehovah.</P><P>Then Ezekiel tells us that in God's salvation the first thing God does is to renew our deadened spirit, to make our spirit a new one. He puts a new spirit within us and then following this He puts His own Spirit, that is, Himself, into our spirit (36:26-27a). Then the Bible says clearly, "The Lord be with your spirit" (2 Tim. 4:22). Who is the Lord Jesus? He is God. He is the treasure. Second Corinthians 4:7 says that we have this treasure in earthen vessels. Now we all can declare, "We have this treasure in our earthen vessel." I am earthen yet I have the treasure because I have a spirit within me as a recipient to receive the Lord Jesus. Now He is here within me, and He is my treasure. You have to exercise your spirit to release your treasure, to share with others the treasure you have in your spirit.</P>
