   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEADING THEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO KEEP MORNING WATCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH THE TELEPHONE AS THE BEST WAY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>WITH THE TWO VERSES WHICH THEY</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>SHOULD READ IN THE MORNING</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to learn to use the telephone to help the new ones keep morning watch.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today the telephone is a "modern weapon" we can use.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Anyone who is not having a morning revival with the Lord is defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the elders should keep morning watch and should also practice having morning watch with others on the phone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I would encourage the elders to try to do this with others six days a week.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not do this with the same person throughout the week.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, we may have morning watch with six different people on the six days of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This will really help people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we help people in this way, we are the ones who receive the top benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is the urgent need everywhere to help and to stir up the saints to participate in this new way of morning watch.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>VISITING THEM ONE OR TWO TIMES EVERY WEEK</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR SPIRITUAL CONDITION AND NOURISHING THEM AS A NURSING MOTHER</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We also need to visit the new believers one or two times every week to take care of their spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to go to see them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If they are sick or troubled, going to see them will warm up their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should nourish them as a nursing mother caring for her own children 1 Thes 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not give them too much teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead we need to nourish them by giving them small portions of spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This nourishment will cause them to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Peter says that the guileless milk of the word will cause the new ones to "grow unto salvation" 1 Pet 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While they are growing, they are being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To grow is to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way to raise up the new believers is to nourish them that they may have the growth in life which issues in the daily salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In conclusion, I want to stress again that what is needed among us is the practice of visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The full-timers among us should spend ninety percent of their time for visiting, going to see people again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to visit people regularly according to a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then the church will be taken care of, and we will gain the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By visiting we will gain people; by visiting we will keep people; and by visiting we will help them to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually, the new believers will attain to the experience of prophesying in the church meetings according to what is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the whole church comes together, all can prophesy for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The basic factor to bring people into the God-ordained way is to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Visiting will spontaneously carry out the first three steps of the God-ordained way gaining sinners, feeding the new believers, and perfecting the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then the ones whom we perfect will be brought into the fourth step of prophesying for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ.</S>
