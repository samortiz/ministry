   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Lord's Promise to the Overcomers of This Stage</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:17 we have the Lord's promise to the overcomers of this stage.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To overcome here means specifically to overcome the church's union with the world, the teaching of idolatry and fornication, and the teaching of the hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 2:17b the Lord says, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna.''</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Manna is a type of Christ as the heavenly food enabling God's people to go His way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A portion of that manna was preserved in a golden pot concealed in the ark Exo 16:32-34; Heb 9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The open manna was for the enjoyment of the Lord's people in a public way; the hidden manna, signifying the hidden Christ, is a special portion reserved for His overcoming seekers who overcome the degradation of the worldly church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While the church goes the way of the world, these overcomers come forward to abide in the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, where they enjoy the hidden Christ as a special portion for their daily supply.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This promise is fulfilled today in the proper church life and will be fulfilled in full in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord also promised the overcomer in Revelation 2:17 that He "will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it.''</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A stone in the Bible signifies material for God's building Matt 16:18; 1 Pet 2:5; 1 Cor 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In our natural being we are not stones but clay.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because we have received the divine life with its divine nature through regeneration, we can be transformed into stones, even precious stones, by enjoying Christ as our life supply 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who do not follow the worldly church but enjoy the Lord in the proper church life will be transformed into stones for the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As indicated by the color white, these stones will be justified and approved by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The overcomers will be justified by God and approved by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, they will be the materials for the building up of God's temple according to God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE CHURCH IN THYATIRA</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church in Thyatira is the church in apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thyatira in Greek means "sacrifice of perfume'' or "unceasing sacrifice.''</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a sign, the church in Thyatira prefigures the Roman Catholic Church, which was fully formed as the apostate church by the establishment of the universal papal system in the latter part of the sixth century.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This apostate church is full of sacrifices, as demonstrated in her unceasing mass.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This apostate church will remain until the Lord's coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A. The Condition of the Church at This Stage</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church in Thyatira is a continuation of the worldly church, pre-symbolized by the church in Pergamos.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church in Pergamos had the teaching of the Gentile prophet Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans, that is, the teaching of a clerical system.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Catholic Church continues these teachings, the teaching of Balaam to bring people into idol worship and fornication and the teaching of the Nicolaitans to build up the hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Catholic Church today there is a strong teaching concerning the building up of a religious organization with its hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One of the crucial points in the epistle to the church in Thyatira concerns the woman Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord refers to her in Revelation 3:20.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices.''</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the very woman prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 13:33, the woman who added leaven signifying evil, heretical, and pagan things into the fine flour signifying Christ as the meal offering for the satisfaction of God and man .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This woman is also the great prostitute of Revelation 17, who mixes abominations with the divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The pagan wife of Ahab, Jezebel, was a type of this apostate church.</S>
