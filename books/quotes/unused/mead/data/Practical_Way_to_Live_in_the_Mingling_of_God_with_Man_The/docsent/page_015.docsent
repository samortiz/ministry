   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: Many Christians speak of living by the Holy Spirit with power.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Is this synonymous with being filled with Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: The current teaching in much of Christianity concerning the Holy Spirit frustrates our ability to see clearly the matter of being filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to realize that in the New Testament age, there are two aspects concerning the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first aspect of the Holy Spirit is that the Spirit is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We find this term in Romans 8:2: For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The second aspect of the Holy Spirit is that the Spirit is the Spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Regarding the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of life, the New Testament uses the prepositions in or within Rom 8:9, 11; 1 Cor 3:16; 2 Tim 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Regarding the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of power, the New Testament uses the prepositions on or upon Acts 1:8; 10:44; 19:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the Spirit of life, the Spirit is within us; as the Spirit of power, the Spirit is upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 14:17 says, Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because we know that the Gospel of John deals much with life, the Spirit mentioned in this book must be the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, this verse tells us that the Spirit the Spirit of life is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Again, John 7:37-39 says, Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From this passage, we can realize that the Spirit mentioned here is the living water which we can drink and which can be within us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>While in these verses in John the Spirit is said to be in us and is likened to water that we can drink, Luke 24:49 speaks of the other aspect of the Spirit: And behold, I send forth the promise of My Father upon you; but as for you, stay in the city until you put on power from on high.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some translations render put on power as are clothed with power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To put on power, or to be clothed with power, refers to the Holy Spirit coming upon the disciples as the Spirit of power in Acts 1:8.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this reason, the Spirit here is likened to clothing clothing being upon the wearer .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In these verses, we can see two symbols of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On one hand, the Spirit is the living water; on the other hand, this Spirit is clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We drink the Spirit as the living water, and we put Him on as clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must take in the Spirit of life and put on the Spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The endowment of power, that is, of the Spirit of power, is the Holy Spirit outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon us is like rain and is something that takes place outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Spirit of life, however, must be taken in by us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can see this in many other portions of the Bible as well.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the evening of His resurrection, Jesus came to the disciples and breathed into them, telling them to receive the Holy Spirit John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came down upon the disciples as a wind and filled the whole house Acts 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here we see two more symbols breath and wind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The breath is for life, and the wind is for power.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the day of the Lord s resurrection, the disciples received the Spirit of life as breath into them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Fifty days later, the Spirit of power came upon them as wind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The symbols of the living water and the breath are both spoken of in the Gospel of John, which deals with the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Gospel of John, in which the Spirit is mainly the Spirit of life, the symbols of the Spirit of life are breath and living water.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the books by Luke, however the Gospel of Luke and Acts the Spirit as the Spirit of power is symbolized by clothing and wind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These two sets of symbols represent the Spirit s inner aspect of life and outer aspect of power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These are the two aspects of the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is important to realize that when we say that we need to be filled with Christ, we are referring to the inner aspect of the Spirit, the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to be filled with Christ, we need to be filled with the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not sufficient to be clothed by the Spirit of power; our desperate need is to be filled with the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can see these two aspects of the Spirit with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit Matt 1:18, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, even before He was baptized with water, He was filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, after He was baptized with water, the Holy Spirit came down upon Him 3:16; John 1:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From the verses related to His birth, we know that this does not mean that before His water baptism He did not have the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit and filled with the Holy Spirit, yet after He was baptized with water, the Holy Spirit came down upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Within, He had already been filled with the Holy Spirit, yet in order to minister, He needed to be equipped with the Spirit of power without.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today we have to realize that we need the two aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit the inner aspect and the outer aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The inner aspect is to be filled with the Spirit of life, and the outer aspect is to be equipped with the Spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Question: Colossians 3:1 tells us to seek the things which are above.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What are some of those things?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Answer: The things which are above are the heavenly things, including the ascended Christ and all things pertaining to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This verse tells us to seek the things which are above; however, if we are not filled with Christ, we will not have the power to seek those things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After creating man, the first thing God did in relation to man was not to take care of man s work but to take care of man s eating.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God knows that if man does not eat, he cannot work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, we must eat breakfast before we can work in the morning, we must eat lunch before we can work in the afternoon, and we must eat dinner before we can come to the meeting in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because we can do nothing without first eating, eating is of primary importance and must consequently be our first priority.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Spiritually speaking, to eat is to be filled with Christ as our spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After God created man, He took care of everything so that man could eat the proper food.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God s intention was that man would eat God in Christ as the tree of life Gen 2:9; John 15:1; 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>His intention remains the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In John 6:57, the Lord Jesus said, As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me. Only when we eat Christ, are filled by Him, and are satisfied with Him are we able to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we are starving to death, we can do nothing, regardless of what we intend or declare.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we are filled and satisfied with Christ, we have the energy to work.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hence, our primary concern and our first need is to be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Let us forget about sins, the world, our deeds, and our works, and simply be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only then will we be able to seek the things which are above.</S>
