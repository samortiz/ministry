   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 22 says, "You see that faith worked together with his works."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul is bold to say that one can have faith alone, without works.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But James does not dare to say that one should have works alone, without faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He indicates that the faith in Genesis 15 and the work in Genesis 22 go hand in hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then he adds another clause.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He does not say that justification comes through faith plus work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, he says, "And by these works faith was perfected."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Genesis 15 we see that because Abraham had faith, he was justified before God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Genesis 22 we see that because Abraham had works, he was justified before men.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Abraham's justification was perfected by his work in Genesis 22.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The offering up of Isaac in Genesis 22 manifested the faith in Genesis 15, and the faith in Genesis 15 was perfected by the work in Genesis 22.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 23 our brother James also quotes from Genesis 15.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Romans 4 Paul quotes from Genesis 15 to prove that one needs faith only, not works.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now our brother James quotes the same word that Paul does: "And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, 'And Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness.'"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In James the word it refers to the act on the mount in Genesis 22.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Abraham's offering of Isaac in Genesis 22 was an offering of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was a work that manifested his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was a fulfillment of the words in Genesis 15 that say that Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Genesis 15 God justified Abraham due to his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Abraham's work in Genesis 22 fulfilled God's promise in Genesis 15.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, we cannot say that faith alone does not save and that there is the need of works as well.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The condition for salvation is faith, not works.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if there is faith, then spontaneously there will be a change in works.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose there is a man whose occupation is to make paper money to be burned to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One day he hears the gospel and believes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But after he believes, he continues to make paper money.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Is this wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He realizes within that the paper money is for idol worship and that a Christian cannot do such work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you ask whether or not he believes in the Lord Jesus, he would say yes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if he gives up his paper money business, how will he support himself?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He confesses that he is a Christian, but we cannot say with certainty that he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not know if he has been saved before God, if he has faith or not.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we see a person who believes that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God and that He was crucified for him, and believes in the gospel of God fully, yet will not give up such a business for fear that he would lose his livelihood, we have no way to tell if he is actually saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Perhaps he has faith before God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Though the seed has been sown, the sprout has not yet come out.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can only know with certainty after the leaves come out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I do not say that he is not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I say only that we are not certain whether he is saved or not.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here lies the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is no question about being saved by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if no work issues from faith, others will not know about that faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is absolutely not a matter of good or bad behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please note this carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>James 2 is absolutely not on good or bad behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The emphasis in James 2 is on the works that prove one's faith.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>James 2 does not tell us to focus our attention on good works or bad works.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What it emphasizes are the works that issue from faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many people are very good in their works.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But these works do not manifest their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These are works without faith; these are not what James was concerned with.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 24 is very good: "A man is justified by works and not by faith only."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>See how careful James is?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He says man is justified by works and not by faith alone.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul is able to say that man is justified by faith and not by works at all.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But James never says that man is justified by works alone and not by faith at all.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If he were to say that, we would have to conclude that the two apostles have divergent views on doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>James says that man is justified by works.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But following that he adds another word, that it is not by faith alone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When one has works, it proves that he has faith.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This does not mean that one should have good works only, but that one should have works of faith.</S>
