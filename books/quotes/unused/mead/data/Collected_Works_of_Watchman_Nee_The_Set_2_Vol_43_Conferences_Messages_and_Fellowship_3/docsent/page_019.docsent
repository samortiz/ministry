   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE A TALK WITH BROTHER NEE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AT HIS FAREWELL DINNER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>PRIOR TO HIS TRIP OVERSEAS Date: June 24, 1937, 9:00 p.m.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Place: Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The dinner was attended by saints at three tables, including the elders and some co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The food was prepared by nine sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE THREE ASPECTS OF THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During the past month or two, there has been a thought continually within me concerning three aspects of our work: first, the gospel among the poor; second, the need of a large meeting hall for the work; and third, the work in Jen-Ru.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Gospel among the Poor</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us first talk about the gospel among the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The poor include thieves, rickshaw drivers, pick-pockets, etc. There are many of these kinds of people in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church should consider preaching to the poor as a part of its regular church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a noble matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These people have never heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For them, coming to the gospel meeting would mean losing a few dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They already do not have enough for their living.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we cannot expect them to come to our gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, we have to go to where they are.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Shanghai there are eight hundred thousand such people, accounting for a quarter of the total population of Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This number is higher than the total population of Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is higher than the combined population of the provinces of Tsinghai and Sinkiang and Mongolia.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If one out of ten were saved in a year, we would have eighty thousand who were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even if one out of a thousand were saved, we would still have eight thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do this, others will not say that we are stealing sheep, because the sheep we have will have been born and not stolen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of course, this is not the only reason for our work, but if we do this, we will avoid some criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A Large Meeting Hall for the Work</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We hope that in the future the Lord will provide us with a central place, a meeting hall which can accommodate seven to eight thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It will be used for the work, not for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The large meeting hall will be used for the annual Overcomer Conferences as well as special conferences for the release of perfecting messages.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Perhaps monthly or bimonthly, the whole church can have the Lord's table together there.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The rest of the time, the Lord's table would still be held in various homes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If our place is not big enough, we will rent a place.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are not like the church in Corinth where the number was small.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are like the church in Jerusalem where the number was big.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the future we may even have to rent a place to set up our own tents for meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Work in Jen-Ru</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The third aspect is the work in Jen-Ru.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I think it is appropriate for me to say something here concerning the nature of the work in Jen-Ru.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jen-Ru is for two groups of people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first group is the responsible ones in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This place is prepared to render them some spiritual help.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>During the summer months or the holidays, they can come to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This would enable them to better serve in their responsibilities later.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The second group is the young co-workers who are clear that they have been called by the Lord to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They can come here to study the Bible for a while before setting out for their work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Jen-Ru will not take those who still need to be dealt with; it is for those who have been dealt with already and who are ready to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not for the lazy ones, but for those who want to serve the Lord diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am not afraid of those who have committed sins, but I am afraid of the lazy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You have to drag a lazy one along before he will move.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you do not drag him along, he will not move.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Or he may move a little if you shout in his ears.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if you do not shout, he will not move.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Jen-Ru is also not for the flippant ones to come to receive some dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is for those who have received the basic dealings already and who need to be perfected more deeply.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Moreover, Jen-Ru is a personal work under the responsibility of Brother Luan and I. Jen-Ru is not a hostel, a rehabilitation hospital, or a seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is established specifically for the young co-workers and the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I dare not say with certainty that these three things are the desire of the Lord, but personally I have this kind of burden within me, which I am presenting before you and asking you to communicate to the saints.</S>
