   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY TALKS 4 Date: Afternoon, November 11, 1940</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Unrecorded ON KNOWING GOD'S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: How can we know God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: Man can know God's will in three ways.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, some people have the Lord's mind, and they may know God's will directly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This knowledge comes directly from God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second, a believer may not know God's will absolutely and completely, but through others God's will becomes more clearly and completely known to him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Third, God may have a will, yet He may not reveal it directly at all, instead relying fully on others to make it known.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Of course, these must first know that God wants to use them to reveal His will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Take the case of Paul on the way to Damascus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was Ananias who came and told him what he should do after he was saved Acts 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>PERSON AND CONDUCT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Question: Was Paul right in going to Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Answer: The disciples at Tyre were clearly prompted by the Holy Spirit to discourage Paul from going to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we say that it was right for Paul to go, this would mean that the Holy Spirit was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we say that it was wrong for him to go, can Paul's leading be wrong Acts 20:22-24 ?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, Ananias received the word from the Lord: "This man is a chosen vessel to Me, to bear My name before both the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel" 9:15; 25:26; 26:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Acts 21 28 is a record of Paul's visit to Jerusalem and the results of his visit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If Paul was wrong, these eight long chapters would have been the result of a wrong leading.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But we cannot say that the disciples at Tyre were wrong either, because the Scripture clearly says that they acted under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit 21:4 , rather than the impulse of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who was right and who was wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The disciples were ahead of the Holy Spirit in speaking to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was their mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even though their prophecy was factual and even though Paul would face danger when he went up to Jerusalem, there was another issue: Being a right person before the Lord and doing the right thing are two entirely different issues.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a man is wrong in the eyes of the Lord, it will be fruitless even if he does the right things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, if a man is right before God, it is not that serious even if he does something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not misunderstand; this is not an encouragement for sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Abraham, Jacob, Noah, David, etc., all failed at one time or another.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Abraham did many wrong things, whereas Lot was wrong only a little.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But God considered Lot's little mistake very serious, and He was very severe toward him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Abraham, however, made many mistakes, but God did not deal with him as severely.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God cares more for the right person than He does for the right things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jacob was the right person, and although he did wrong things at times, God still loved him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Esau was the wrong person, and God was not pleased with him though he might have done many right things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Being a right person before God and doing the right things are two entirely different issues.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You can criticize Abraham or Jacob for making this or that mistake, but God still loved them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We look at what they did, but God looks at what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Lord came to the earth, a voice out of the heavens declared, "This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight" Matt 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was declared before He healed one sick person or delivered one sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is a matter of the person rather than the works.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You may point out many mistakes that some people have made.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What you say may be true, yet God loves them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some people may do all the right things; you may not be able to find any fault in them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet God is not pleased with them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some people can stand up and deliver a sermon and they can write books, but their standing up and their writings are all detestable acts in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am not saying that our conduct is not important.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am merely saying that the person is more important that the conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When I first became saved, I read the Old Testament and found many people for whom I had no respect at all.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Their history was spotted with sins, yet God considered them good.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It may not be hard for me to do better than Abraham or Jacob; in fact, I may quite surpass them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But it is difficult for me to match Abraham and Jacob in the way they understood God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some people may surpass Abraham, David, or even Joseph in their conduct, but they lack one thing they are not the right person in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the past I was quite free to criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I was indeed a "first-class criticizer."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I did not see one person whom I could not criticize.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even though I could criticize many people, I could not match them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I know of forty to fifty people whom the Lord loves.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I doubt very much whether I can match them in the way they have pleased the Lord, even if I tried for my entire Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These ones may make mistakes, but they in their person are right in the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once when I was abroad, I met two sisters and two brothers who spoke to me about Mr. Austin-Sparks' mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I listened to them for almost a whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>During that whole time, I felt that my ears were trash cans.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Later, I said, "I am still looking for a more qualified person to criticize Brother Austin-Sparks."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>His person is right, and God has used him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What he has done is something else.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A brother once said to me, in reference to Brother Austin-Sparks, "Had he not done this and that, we would have invited him to speak at the Keswick Convention."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I responded, "If Brother Austin-Sparks does not speak at the Keswick Convention, whose loss is it?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is the Convention's loss, not his loss.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>According to my knowledge of those who have spoken at Keswick, no one is qualified to criticize him."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Shanghai some of our young people make many mistakes, yet these mistakes are forgivable.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Other people are only half-wrong, yet one feels that they must be disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the first case, the person is right, while in the latter, the person is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You may think that the elders in Shanghai are quite peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Some people make mistakes, but these mistakes are accidental and excusable; the mistakes are not caused by a fundamental weakness in the person.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Others make a mistake, not because they accidentally stumble, but because their persons are wrong; there is a problem with the persons themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A sinless Lot does not come close to a sinful and fallen Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Although Abraham fell, he fell on top of Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Lot might have stood fast, but he stood under Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If a man is not right in the eyes of God, his work and walk will never be pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When some people stand up to speak in the meeting, other brothers and sisters immediately groan within, saying, "Here he goes again."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When still others stand up to speak, the brothers and sisters rejoice and praise, readily inclining their ears to hear them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, the minute some people stand up, you know that they are the wrong persons.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It was not a big thing for Esau to take a bowl of red lintel soup.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He was busy, thirsty, and tired when he returned from the field.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But the New Testament tells us that Esau was a man who loved the world Heb 12:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Some people may sin a hundred or a thousand times, yet their sins are outward, having nothing to do with their constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>With others, sin is something in their constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Some people are sick, but they are like my mother who has thirteen different kinds of illnesses, none of which is fatal.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Some people are infected with only one fatal sickness, and they die.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Esau might have walked properly in his daily life, but he was in darkness; he did not have any revelation, nor did he have the voice of God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Jacob was the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He might have been deceitful in his conduct and he might not have been as nice as Esau, yet he had the revelation, and God spoke to him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Some people are easily approved before God, while others are not.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>May the Lord be merciful to us and show us clearly whether we are right in His eyes.</S>
