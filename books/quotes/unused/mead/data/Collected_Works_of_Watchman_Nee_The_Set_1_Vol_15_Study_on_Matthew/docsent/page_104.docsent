   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ALTHOUGH THERE IS EVIDENCE IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO SHOW THAT THE BELIEVERS WILL BE RAPTURED AFTER THE TRIBULATION,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT ALL BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>WILL BE RAPTURED AFTER THE TRIBULATION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THERE ARE SOME ERRORS IN THE SECOND SCHOOL THE BIBLE SHOWS VERY CLEARLY THAT SOME</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>WILL BE RAPTURED BEFORE THE TRIBULATION</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We will consider some of the reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. Suppose all believers are raptured after the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In that case we would not need to be watchful, waiting, or prepared because we are assured that the Lord will come after the three-and-a-half-year period.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If so, I could do all manner of evil for three years, five months, and twenty-nine days.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This contradicts a most important principle of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. If all are raptured after the tribulation, then our waiting is not a waiting for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, it becomes a waiting for Antichrist, because Antichrist comes first.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>C. The church will lose its hope.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Titus 2:13 says, "Awaiting the blessed hope," that is, the blessing of escaping the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>D. The second school does not admit that there is a secret rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They forget that the Lord said, "I will come as a thief."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The thief comes in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is not preceded by a military marching band.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The thief comes to steal the best things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>E. Concerning the twelve disciples' being Christians, the second school says that they were all Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is exactly opposite to the first school, which says that none of them were Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the fact is that while the twelve disciples were representatives of the Jewish remnant, they were at the same time Christians also.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, in Matthew 10:5-6 and 23:3 all have a Jewish background.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These verses do not refer to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>F. Not differentiating the rapture Christ's coming for the saints from the appearing Christ's coming with the saints . There is a public rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the book of Jude the Lord's coming, as referred to by Enoch's prophecy, is a public rapture because He puts His feet on the Mount of Olives.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Revelation 1:7 speaks of the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But those who believe in only one public appearing are confused.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They are of the historical school, which says that the only portion of Revelation left to be fulfilled is that portion after chapter seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are exactly opposite to the futuristic school, which says that only chapters one through three have already been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the events in the book of Revelation are the things of the past, then it is no longer revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, this book would be understood only by scholars and historians and not by babes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Fulfillment in the Bible is usually literal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, the virgin Mary, Bethlehem, etc. are all literal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Occasionally there are fulfillments that are figurative, but they are explained at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>V. THE FIRST SCHOOL LACKED BIBLICAL EVIDENCE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE SECOND SCHOOL HAS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>SOME BIBLICAL EVIDENCE, BUT MANY ERRORS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>WHAT DOES THE BIBLE REALLY SAY?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let us look at the following:</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A. Revelation 3:10: "Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth." This is the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This verse tells us that some people can escape the great tribulation because they have kept the word of endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This verse refutes both the first school and the second school.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although Philadelphia represents the true church in the age of grace, it is also only one of the seven churches in Asia at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, we know that only a small number one-seventh can be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, the rapture before the tribulation is not based on regeneration, that is, on being merely children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is based on one condition alone, and that is to keep the word of His endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May we ask, "Can all the believers today keep the word of His endurance?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From this, we know that not all can be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The second school says that this verse does not refer to the rapture before the tribulation but to God's preserving of us during the tribulation; it merely means that during the great tribulation God will lead us through the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is just as if a house were on fire yet one room is spared the damage.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Also, this is like the Israelites who did not suffer the plagues while in the land of Goshen.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is wrong!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>1 Here it is not to be kept through but to be kept from.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the original Greek, after the word for "keep" there is the Greek word ek, which means "out of" for example, ekklesia a called-out group .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, it is not a matter of being kept through, but of being kept out of.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Ek means "out of."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>2 "Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>"Kept" and "keep" in the original text are of the same root.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The hour of trial is not the tribulation but the time of the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For example, I was in the northwest of Shanghai during the Sino-Japanese War.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I was not hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This was God's keeping me through that tribulation; it was not His keeping me from the hour of that tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we want to be kept from the hour, we must be kept out of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If God wants to keep us out of this world, there are only two ways: death and rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Those in Philadelphia have died already, so they are kept from the hour of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But God cannot kill today's church just because He wants to keep it from the hour of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hence, the only way is to rapture it.</S>
