   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. To Open Ourselves to the Lord, Who Is Shut outside the Door of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to overcome lukewarmness, we need to open ourselves to the Lord, who is shut outside the door of the lukewarm church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 3:20 reveals that the Lord is outside the door of the church in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, He is not within the church in Laodicea but is outside knocking at the door.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The door is the door of the church, but the door is opened by individual believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To the one who opens the door, the Lord will enter into him to feast with him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should have the assurance that every morning our door is wide open to the Lord so that He can come in to dine with us, to feast with us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>E. The Reward 1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To Feast with the Lord, Signifying the Rich and Full Enjoyment of the Unsearchable Riches of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The overcomers will be rewarded by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They will feast with the Lord, signifying the rich and full enjoyment of the unsearchable riches of Christ Rev 3:20b; Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we open to the Lord, He and we will enjoy each other.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then His presence becomes our feast, and our presence becomes His feast.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, we dine with each other, feasting together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the practical and full enjoyment of Christ in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every day we should have such a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To Participate in Sitting with Christ on His Throne for the Fellowship in His Kingship in Authority</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, the overcomers will participate in sitting with Christ as the King on His throne for the fellowship, the participation, in His kingship as His co-kings in authority to rule over all the nations Rev 3:21; 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can see from this fellowship that we all need to aspire to be the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to overcome big things like the three deformed religions and small things like our attitude and the way that we dress.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a husband loses his temper with his wife, at that moment he is no longer an overcomer but a failure in his daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Day by day we have to overcome in all the small things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not say "no" to the Lord and "yes" to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should always practice to say "yes" to the Lord and "no" to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should say "no" to all of the "isms."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should say "no" to the denominations, to the exalting of all the names other than the unique name of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For a Christian to take another name besides the name of Christ is a shame and an insult to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must make a definite decision to take the Lord's way, the way of being an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must overcome the trend of not keeping the Lord's word, the tide of denying the Lord's name, and the lukewarmness in the Lord's testimony.</S>
