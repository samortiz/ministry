<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Through the Father's Strengthening of the Saints<br>into Their Inner Man with the Dispensing<br>of the Riches of the Father's Glory</H2><P>The operation of the Divine Trinity is needed for Christ to make home in our hearts. It is for this reason that Paul prayed to the Father as the source that He would strengthen the saints into their inner man with the dispensing of the riches of the Father's glory (Eph. 3:16). The Father's glory is the Father's splendor. Splendor refers to the outward expression of something. If you are a proper person, you will have human virtues such as wisdom, knowledge, and love. If you are such a person, you will have a certain kind of expression. This expression is your splendor, your glory. The glory of God is just the expression of what God is in all of His divine attributes. These attributes include love, light, power, patience, and mercy. The expression of God in His attributes is His splendor.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Through the Spirit's Operating within the Saints<br>with the Dispensing of the Divine Power</H2><P>Christ makes His home in the hearts of the saints through the Spirit's operating within the saints with the dispensing of the divine power (Eph. 3:16). The Spirit is within us as the power of God. Just as power can be a synonym for electricity, the Spirit is a synonym for the power of God. Today many Christians lack this proper knowledge. They may know that the Spirit is within them, but they do not realize that this Spirit is not only their life but also their power. The power has been installed. Our need is to "switch on" the Spirit. The Spirit will then operate within us with the dispensing of the divine power.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>That Christ May Make His Home<br>in the Saints' Hearts</H2><P>Christ makes His home in the hearts of the saints through the operation of the Triune God (Eph. 3:17a). The Father strengthens us according to the riches of what He is, the Spirit operates in power, and the Son makes His home in our hearts. With the Father's strengthening and the Spirit's empowering, the Son has the ground, the opportunity, to enlarge Himself in our inner being. He enlarges Himself in our being by penetrating into our mind, spreading into our will, occupying our emotion, and taking over our entire conscience. In this way Christ occupies our entire inner being, making home in all of our heart. This takes place by the dispensing of Himself into all the parts of our heart.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Having Been Rooted and Grounded in Love</H2><P>As Christ is making home in our hearts, we are being rooted and grounded in love (Eph. 3:17b). We are God's farm and God's building (1 Cor. 3:9). As God's farm we need to be rooted for growth, and as God's building we need to be grounded for building up. Being rooted and grounded is in love. To experience Christ, we need faith and love (1 Tim. 1:14). Faith enables us to realize Christ, and love enables us to enjoy Him. Both faith and love are not ours but His. His faith becomes our faith to believe in Him, and His love becomes our love to love Him.</P>
