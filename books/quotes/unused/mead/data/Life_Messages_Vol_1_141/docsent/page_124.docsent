   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST IN US Formed</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One aspect of this heavenly vision seen by Paul is that Christ has to be wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Galatians 4:19 says, "My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It became the apostle's deep longing that the believers might have Christ take shape in them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Settling Down</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The apostle prayed in Ephesians 3:17 "that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Have you ever thought that Christ needs you to provide a home for him?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He wants to settle down in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may think heaven is a wonderful place to be, but Christ does not appreciate being there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is homeless without you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He longs to make His home in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The theologians may think such a thought is too subjective, that your heart is too small to contain the great Christ, and that He is far off in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, Paul prayed that Christ may make His home in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the intimate relationship that should exist between Christ and you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Magnified</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death" Phil 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To be magnified is to be expressed in an enlarged way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was the longing and expectation of Paul that Christ be so expressed in him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For Him to be magnified in you is for Him to be shown without limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Your love or your humility is superficial and of short duration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to Ephesians 3:18-19, Christ is the universal breadth, length, height, and depth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is the dimension of the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no limit to His love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Your family can quickly exhaust all your virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let this One with His unsearchable, inexhaustible riches make His home in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is magnified by His riches being made known to all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"TO LIVE IS CHRIST"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Colossians 2:6-7 Paul tells us to walk in Christ, rooted and built up in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He becomes the country in which we walk, the sphere in which we live, the soil in which we are rooted, and the foundation on which we are built up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The heavenly vision is that this Christ must be wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Paul said, "I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision" Acts 26:19 , he implied that he no longer had any regard for tradition or religious teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His only concern was the living, present Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That is why he could later say, "To me to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>REPENTING OF GOOD BEHAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once you see this, you will repent of many good things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose, for example, you talk to a brother in a harsh way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later, when you go to the Lord, you confess, "Lord, I'm sorry I was so mean to my brother.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From now on, help me to treat all the brothers right.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Help me not to be so harsh."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you think that is the right way to pray?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you do, you have not seen the heavenly vision that Christ must live.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not a matter of your being nice to others, but of Christ being your life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such a prayer itself needs to be repented of.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We want to live a good Christian life studying the Bible, preaching the gospel, honoring our parents, being a good neighbor, not losing our temper, and being kind to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I beg you, discard all these concepts!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The vision we need to see is that Christ must be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Have you ever repented of your good behavior? of your love? of your kindness?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You must have, if you have seen the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God does not want you to be full of love, but to be full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In our early Christian experience, our repentance is for bad things, but later we shall find that our repentance is mostly for good things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"Lord, forgive me for my kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Forgive me for all my virtues, void of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A Christian who is full of humility without Christ is a rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is rebelling against the heavenly vision that Christ must be everything to him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Your thinking, your emotion, your intention, your motive, your quickness or your slowness all these must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>FULFILLING THE VISION</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How far-reaching was the vision Paul was granted in answer to his question, "Who art Thou, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The revelation that came to him filled his writings; through them, under the heavenly enlightening, the same vision can be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This Jesus of Nazareth embodies the fullness of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church, the embodiment of the Son, takes in His riches and thus becomes His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christ Himself must be wrought into us and become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We obey this vision by taking Him as our life, not allowing ourselves to be distracted by doctrines nor striving after good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All day long, throughout all our activities, we must maintain contact with this Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As we constantly talk to Him in prayer 1 Thes 5:17 , we shall be spontaneously taking Him as our person and thus living according to the heavenly vision.</S>
