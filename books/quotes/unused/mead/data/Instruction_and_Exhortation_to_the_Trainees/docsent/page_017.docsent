   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO LABELING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Fifth, you should not label others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not say that this one is an old-timer and that one is not taking the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must condemn all kinds of labeling.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sometimes we label others as Texans, Californians, New Englanders, or New Yorkers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Learn never to label anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>NO FORMALITY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sixth, there should be no formality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we began the training in Taiwan, that was a time of experimentation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We tried many different ways of doing things, some of which had never been tried before in history, such as baptizing the believers in the bathtub.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our training we considered how we could baptize people immediately after visiting them and bringing them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Taipei today nearly every home has a bathtub because of today's modern conveniences.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because of this, we could baptize them in the bathtub.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, when some of the trainees returned, they insisted that the newly saved must not be baptized in the meeting hall, but in their own home in a bathtub.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As a result they made this a formality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, you should avoid having any formality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>NO LEGALITY</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Seventh, there should be no legality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After one or two terms of training in Taipei, some younger trainees returned to their locality and made what we were experimenting with in Taipei a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We were studying the fastest way to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Taipei there are a lot of high-rise buildings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On one story there may be seventy apartments.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we visited them, we would start from one door and keep moving to the left.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some trainees returned and taught people to always keep turning to the left in visiting people at their doors, so this became a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>BURNING IN SPIRIT AND</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>FANNING INTO FLAME THE GIFT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eighth, you should have no legality but to be burning in spirit Rom 12:11 , fanning the God-given gift into flame 2 Tim 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have the gift, but the gift within you is without a flame.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You must fan it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You should not fan someone else's gift, but your own gift, into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You need to be burning within, not burning without.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is wonderful when you are burning yet no one knows you are burning.</S>
