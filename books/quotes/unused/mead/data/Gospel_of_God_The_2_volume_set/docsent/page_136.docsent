   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING THE PRACTICE OF CONFESSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let me say a few words concerning the practice of confessing sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all know whom we have offended and defrauded before we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After we were saved, we felt sorrowful in our heart and wished to confess to those same people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is something that we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God commands, even compels us to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is something taught in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Having seen God's righteousness and the glory in His presence, we now realize that it is unrighteous to be indebted to others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What then shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We refuse to be unrighteous persons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We even tell ourselves, "I am saved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I will be a righteous man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I will thoroughly deal with all the areas in which I have been unrighteous or not right with others so that they may forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no problem with your sins being forgiven before God, but you must make confession to men of your offenses to men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, confession and restitution are absolutely not the way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You do not need to make confessions and recompense before you can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As a saved person, and one who is just, you are merely asking pardon from people you have wronged.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The thief on the cross must have robbed many and sinned against many.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, he had no opportunity to confess and make recompense to anyone, because he could hardly move on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was not able to return any item which he had plundered from others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet, without any confession or restitution, he still could be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus said to him, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise" Luke 23:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may consider this robber as the first person to be saved in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was the first to be saved after the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, the problem is not one of confession.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The thief on the cross, though deprived of the opportunity of making recompense, was nevertheless saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If he had lived on, he should have made recompense for righteousness' sake.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the question of his salvation was resolved on the cross in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Confession is something that follows salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was already saved on the cross; his salvation was altogether not due to any kind of confession or restitution.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If he confessed his sins again at some later date, it would not have saved him more.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here we are clearly shown that salvation is by faith, whereas confession is a spontaneous expression of Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since we now know our righteous God, we desire to clear up the problem of our sins before man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our salvation is totally a matter between us and the Lord Jesus; it is resolved through Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are three things here which we must be clear about.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, we confess our sins before God, judging ourselves, repenting, and acknowledging that we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All these are done before God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This causes us to have faith to receive the Lord Jesus as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second, after we are saved, we become aware of our offenses towards others and wish to clear them up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We wish to make recompense and to confess to those whom we have defrauded so that we may live a righteous life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Third, after we are saved, as the Holy Spirit works in us, we want to tell others what kind of sinners we were and how many sins we have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may do this during our baptism, and we may do this after baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I do not know if you are clear or not.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Never deem the confessing of sins so highly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must put it in the place accorded by the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since the Bible never considers it as a way to salvation, neither should we.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thank God it is the Lord Jesus who saved me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I did not save myself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thank God it is the cross of Christ that saved me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am not saved by my own cross; the cross of Christ did the saving work.</S>
