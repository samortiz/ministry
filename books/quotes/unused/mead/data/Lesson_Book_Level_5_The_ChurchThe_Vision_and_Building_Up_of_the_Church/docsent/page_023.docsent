   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Bearing God's Image to Express Him</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's creation of man in Genesis 1 is a picture of the new man in God's new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that the old creation is a figure, a type, of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In God's old creation the central character is man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is the same in God's new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, in both the old creation and the new creation man is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God created man in His own image Gen 1:26 and then gave man His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Image is for expression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God wants man to be His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Dominion, however, is a matter not of expression but of representation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God wants man to represent Him in His authority for His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the old creation man was created to have God's image to express Him and also to have His dominion to represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The image refers to God's positive intention, and dominion to God's negative intention.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's positive intention is that man would express Him, whereas God's negative intention is that man would deal with God's enemy, Satan, the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the universe God has a problem, the problem of dealing with His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since God's enemy, the Devil, is a creature, God will not deal with him directly Himself; instead, He will deal with him by man, a creature of His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God deals with His enemy through man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, in God's creation of man there were two intentions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The positive intention is that man would bear God's image for His expression; the negative intention is that man would have God's dominion to represent Him to deal with His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>C. Fighting as a Warrior</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The new man has the obligation of fighting against God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the church as the new man is a warrior fighting against God's enemy, for the new man is now fulfilling God's purpose to express God and to fight against God's enemy for God's dominion, God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Ephesians 6:12 Paul says, "Our wrestling is not against blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies.''</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"Blood and flesh'' refers to human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Behind men of blood and flesh are the evil forces of the Devil, fighting against God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, our wrestling, our fighting, must not be against men but against the evil spiritual forces in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The principalities, the authorities, and the world-rulers of this darkness are the rebellious angels who followed Satan in his rebellion against God and who now rule in the heavenlies over the nations of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"This darkness'' refers to today's world, which is fully under the dark ruling of the Devil through his evil angels.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"The world-rulers of this darkness'' are the princes Satan has set up to rule the various nations.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because of the working of Satan, who is the authority of darkness, the earth and its atmosphere have become "this darkness.''</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"The spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies'' are Satan and his spiritual forces of evil in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The warfare between the church and Satan is a battle between us who love the Lord and who are in His church and the evil powers in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must fight against these spiritual forces.</S>
