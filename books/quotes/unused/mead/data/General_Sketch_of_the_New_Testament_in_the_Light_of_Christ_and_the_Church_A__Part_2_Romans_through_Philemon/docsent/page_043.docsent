   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S ETERNAL PURPOSE AND ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The best way to realize the sketch of Ephesians is to identify its main points.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, this book reveals God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many Christians have never noticed that in the New Testament there is such a special term, the eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even after I had been a Christian for nearly fifteen years and had studied the New Testament and read the book of Ephesians many times, I did not yet see this matter of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 3:11 says, "According to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word eternal in Greek is derived from aion, meaning of the ages, that is, eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ephesians speaks of the eternal purpose, and here purpose equals plan; both terms are correct and meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we may speak of the eternal plan which God planned in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verses 9 and 10 of chapter one also refer to the divine plan, the eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why is this plan called the eternal purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is because this purpose was planned in eternity past and for eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, it is the purpose of eternity, that is, the purpose of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, it must be accomplished in time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Between the two ends of eternity there is an interval, which is the bridge of time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Time bridges the two ends of eternity, and upon this bridge there is a process in which God's purpose is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's purpose in eternity past and for eternity future is now being completed on this bridge of time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ephesians also uses the term economy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ephesians 1:10 says, "Unto the economy of the fullness of the times."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the King James Version this word is translated as dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, it does not refer to a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It refers to a way of dispensing, thus an arrangement or management.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In different translations this word is rendered dispensation, arrangement, administration, stewardship, or government, but the best word is economy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because God has an eternal plan, He needs an economy, a dispensation, arrangement, administration, stewardship, and government.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In chapter three the same Greek word is used twice.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 2 says, "If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me for you."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The grace of God may be compared to the capital in a business.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to fulfill God's plan, God has an operation, and the grace of God is the spiritual and divine capital in God's operation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just as a corporation needs an economy for its capital, God's operation requires an economy, a stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ephesians 3:9 says, "And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The King James Version follows a less trustworthy manuscript to translate economy as fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the better manuscripts, the Greek word here is economy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE GOAL OF GOD'S ETERNAL PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second main point in Ephesians is the aim, the goal, of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is a great matter; it was planned by God, and strictly speaking it is the very economy of God for His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's economy is wholly related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What God planned and what He is operating to carry out is the church, so the church is the very center of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the reason that this book particularly speaks of the eternal purpose of God and the economy of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to understand the church, we must realize that it is the center of God's plan and the very substance of His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may say that the aim of God's eternal purpose is to have the church, but this is too general.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we study Ephesians with a spirit of revelation, we will realize that the aim of God's plan is to have an expression of Himself in Christ the Son by the Spirit through a Body composed and built up with many regenerated and transformed people by the mingling of Himself with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we read Ephesians with the foregoing sentence in view, we will see exactly what is in this book.</S>
