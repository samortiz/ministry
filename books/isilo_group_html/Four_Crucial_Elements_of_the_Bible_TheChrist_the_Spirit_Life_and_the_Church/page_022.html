One day, after they had been following the Lord Jesus for less than three years, suddenly He indicated to them that He was going to die. He said, &#8220;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day. For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink&#8221; (John 6:54-55). Here the Lord spoke of flesh and blood being separated, clearly indicating His death, that is, His being slain. When the disciples heard this word, they may have known that He spoke of death. Because they were unable to bear it, they said, &#8220;This word is hard; who can hear it?&#8221; (v. 60). Moreover, no one understood what the Lord subsequently said concerning His resurrection and ascension: &#8220;Then what if you saw the Son of Man ascending to where He was before?&#8221; (vv. 61-62). From that time many of His disciples went back to what they had left behind and no longer walked with Him.<p>On the last day of the feast, the Lord Jesus told the crowd, &#8220;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified&#8221; (7:37-39). When the people heard this word, many of them, including the disciples, may have gathered together for a discussion, saying, &#8220;What is the Spirit? In the Old Testament there were only the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah. What does it mean to be glorified? Does it mean to be enthroned as a king?&#8221; Not only the Jews and the disciples in the ancient days were perplexed; many Christians throughout the generations have felt the same way.<p>After our many years of studying the Word and of experience, and after our reading the writings of many people, the Lord has opened our eyes to see that God&#8217;s becoming flesh brought divinity into humanity. However, this human part had not been made divine but remained human. It still needed to go through the process of resurrection. Through His death and resurrection His humanity was brought into divinity. The resurrection of the Lord Jesus was His glorification because His humanity was brought into divinity through resurrection and was thus glorified.<p>According to the Scriptures, the Lord Jesus had two births. The first was His birth in incarnation. He was God, but He came out of the womb of a virgin and was born to be a man. This was divinity being born into humanity. Therefore, the Lord Jesus was a man with divinity. He was truly a man, a genuine man, a perfect man, yet He lived with divinity in Him. However, His humanity was still humanity and had not entered into divinity. He still needed to pass through the process of death and resurrection. Crucifixion brought Him into death, and death ushered Him into resurrection. Through such a process His humanity was brought into divinity. This was His second birth. Hence, Acts 13:33 says, &#8220;You are My Son; this day have I begotten You.&#8221; This day refers to the day of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. This means that in resurrection the humanity of the Lord Jesus was born into divinity.<p>Since the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, there has been a God-man in the universe with His divinity brought into humanity and His humanity brought into divinity. This One became the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45). Then on the night of His resurrection He came into the midst of His disciples and breathed into them, saying, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (John 20:19, 22). The Holy Spirit here is the Spirit referred to in John 7:38-39, because this is the Spirit whom the Lord has become in His glorification through resurrection that the believers may receive Him into them and that He may flow out of them as rivers of living water.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Four Crucial Elements of the Bible, The-Christ, the Spirit, Life, and the Church &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
