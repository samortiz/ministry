   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-FOUR EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 60 Date:September 16, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER P. H.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In myself, I find nothing worthy of a testimony; there is nothing but corruption in me weeping as she testified .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I was born in 1909 and almost died the day I was born.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My family put me on the floor and called for a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They placed me in a tub of hot water.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My parents prayed for me the whole night.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After fifty days I became well.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was a child, I consecrated myself to the Lord in a gospel church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After I grew up, I decided to study medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I graduated from Peking Medical College.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Others considered me a saint in school because I was both the leader of the Bible study group and the superintendent of the Moral Department.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When others asked if I was saved, I would retort arrogantly, "Are you more saved than I am?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Later someone else asked me the same question.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I was convicted, for I was not clear about my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In time someone showed me the book Why Did He Come?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After I read it, I became clear about my need for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I accepted the Lord but still had many questions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Brother Nee came, I presented these questions to him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later I began to cover my head and was baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I also had a desire to go to the inland regions to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Three years after I was saved, I married a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Later I went to Yunnan, Kunming, and worked in a hospital through the Lord's arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I had one son who died soon after he was born.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have often grieved over this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Your words today show that you are not yet free from your past feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some of the events, like your son's death, happened seven or eight years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These feelings should have faded after so many years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You should have been dealt with in your emotion already.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Of course, the death of a dear son is a great thing to a mother, but if you have indeed experienced God's dealing, this should have been set aside already.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If your present state still reflects your past feelings, it means that you need more dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If your emotion is truly dealt with, your feelings today should not be so entangled with your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You should only be slightly affected now.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Any dealing that you have is reflected in the degree of intensity of your feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Apparently, the dealings our sister experienced were very cruel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even though she cried, her crying was not bitter enough.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although she was sad, she was not sad and heartbroken enough.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although she was sorrowful, her sorrow did not make others sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Please forgive me for saying such a strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A man's spirit is like a camera; it must be in focus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the focus is proper, the pictures are clear.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the focus is not proper, one can still identify the shapes, but he cannot know who is in the picture.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If your spirit is calibrated to the Spirit of God's Son, your spirit will also be calibrated to others' spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order for your spirit to make an impact on others' spirit, it must aim accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If your spirit is without emotional mixture and if your scars are deep enough, it will easily reach others' spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if your spirit is mixed, it will not be easy to direct it toward others' spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The mixture of emotions will reach others first.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They will not be able to feel what you feel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They will not be able to sense the problems you are facing, because your spirit will be contaminated by your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is the Lord's wonderful arrangement that you have a very emotional husband.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although your emotion is strong, your husband's emotion is even stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A joyful spirit can make everyone joyful, and a wounded spirit can touch others' spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not like shaking hands with gloves on.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If your spirit is without any mixture, everyone will respond with an amen when you speak; that is the ministry of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the Lord has operated on you once, whenever He is released through your spirit, there will be an impact on others' spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It will be like touching some with ice or scalding others with hot water.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let me say a cruel word to you again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you contact others in your present condition, they will never feel your pain.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although you have experienced some dealings from the Lord, your spirit has not broken through; it is not released enough.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A man with a strong spirit will release his spirit as soon as he testifies, and the spirit of others will be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They will feel as if they are taking a cold shower in the hot summer.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If your emotion is dealt with seriously, you will no longer be able to return to your former feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you can return to your former feelings, it means that the dealings you have received are not deep enough.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If your emotion is truly dealt with, you will forget about the feelings you had a few years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They will seem as if they are the feelings of someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The apostle Peter denied the Lord, but a month later, he was able to forget everything and rebuke the men of Israel, saying, "But you denied the holy and righteous One" Acts 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In Greek the word deny is the same word that is used when Peter denied the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Peter was a man with feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Yet he put the greatest denial in the whole world, which he himself committed, behind him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>His denial was more serious than that of the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, you have to ask the Lord to deal with your emotion in a strict way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You have to ask Him to deal with you to such an extent that you become absolutely free from your past feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then you will live in an entirely different realm.</S>
