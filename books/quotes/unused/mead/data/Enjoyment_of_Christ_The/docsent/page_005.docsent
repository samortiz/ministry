   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to consider the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The items of His riches in the Scriptures are much more numerous than the items of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whatever God is, dwells in Christ, but the Bible does not tell us that God is the door, the Lamb, or the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is the door John 10:9 , the Lamb 1:29 , and the reality of all the offerings Heb 10:5-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With Christ we also have the element of incarnation because Christ is not only the complete God but also the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With Him there are the elements of crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ as the Way</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is also the way John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that He is the way for us to enter into God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Also, He is the way for us to behave as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The way for us to live and to deal with people is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is our way not only for us to enter into God but also for us to live.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we have Christ, we have the way to live, the way to behave, and the way to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ as the Door and the Pasture</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John 10 says that Christ is the door.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to this chapter He is not the door to heaven but the door to the sheepfold.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Judaism as the religion of the law is the sheepfold.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ was the door of the sheepfold for Moses, David, and all the prophets such as Isaiah and Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To them He was the door through which they entered into the custody of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the New Testament, Peter, John, James, and Paul experienced Christ as the door to come out of the fold of Judaism with its law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through Christ as the door all the early disciples came out of the custody of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The thieves and robbers in John 10 signify those who came into Judaism, but not through Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These were the unbelieving Pharisees who opposed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In John 10:9 the Lord said, "I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the pasture is not available, in the wintertime or in the night, the sheep must be kept in the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Old Testament, before Christ came, it was the time of night.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, God's flock was put into the fold to be kept in custody during the night.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Christ came, the day dawned.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, the flock had to be released from the fold into the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ is the living pasture as the feeding place for the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ was the door for all the Old Testament sheep to enter into Judaism for protection, for being kept in custody.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Christ came, they needed to be let out of the fold of Judaism to enjoy Him as their living pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They entered into Judaism through Christ and were released from Judaism through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to apply this revelation to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is also the door for us to come out of any religious fold into Himself as the rich pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Formerly, this religion may have been our protection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But when we met Christ, it became a bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ then became the door to us to release us from the bondage of religion so that He could become our pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are enjoying Christ, He is the door and the pasture to us, and we are out of the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Without Christ, we would be kept in the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When someone realizes Christ as his enjoyment, he will come out through Christ as the door to enjoy Christ as the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The sheep to which the Lord referred in John 10 were those in Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He went on to say, "I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must lead them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one Shepherd" v. 16 . The other sheep are the Gentile believers Acts 11:18 . The one flock signifies the one church, the one Body of Christ Eph 2:14-16; 3:6 . The Lord would bring the Jewish and Gentile believers together to make them one flock, one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, there should no longer be any fold, but only the one flock and the one Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The way to get people out of the religious fold is to help them enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When they enjoy Christ, He will become the door to them to release them from the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When they come through the door, Christ will become their pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The only thing that can keep us from becoming a religious fold is the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only the enjoyment of Christ can keep us in a proper relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Without the enjoyment of Christ, we will become a fold.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But when we enjoy Him, He becomes the door to release us and the pasture to feed us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ is the door for us to be released from bondage and the pasture for us to enjoy.</S>
