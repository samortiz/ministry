<h1 class="title">MEETING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:25; Matt. 18:20; Acts 2:42; 1 Cor. 14:23, 26</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. CORPORATE GRACE BEING FOUND IN THE MEETING</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s Word says, &ldquo;Not abandoning our own assembling together&rdquo; (Heb. 10:25). Why should we not abandon the assembling together? Because God dispenses His grace to us through the assembling together. God&rsquo;s grace to man can be divided into two categories&mdash;personal and corporate. God gives us not only personal grace but also corporate grace. This corporate grace can be found only in the assembling together or the meetings.</p>
<p>We have already spoken of the subject of prayer. One can learn to pray by himself at home; there is no doubt that God listens to such prayers. God listens to individual prayers. However, there is another kind of prayer. In order for this other kind of prayer to be answered, it must be prayed in the meetings, in the principle of two or three asking together in the Lord&rsquo;s name. If a person tries to do this alone, he will not get any answer. Many great matters must be prayed over in the meetings before God will answer. They must be brought to the prayer meeting before we see them come to pass. God&rsquo;s corporate grace comes to man only through the meetings. You may think that it is sufficient for a man to pray alone and that he can seek God&rsquo;s mercy by himself. But the experience of many people tells us that individual prayers alone will not work. It seems that unless two or three people pray, or all the brothers and sisters come together to pray, God will not answer. Therefore, we have two kinds of answers to prayers: One is answer to individual prayers, and the other is answer to assembly prayers. If we do not meet with others, some prayers will not be answered.</p>
<p>We have also spoken of reading the Bible. Of course, God will give us individual grace when we read the Bible. However, some portions of the Word cannot be opened up by one person alone. God gives light when we meet, when we assemble ourselves together. In such a meeting, some brothers may be led to open up a particular portion of the Word. There may not be any speaking concerning that particular portion of the Word, yet the fact that everyone is assembled together gives God the opportunity to shed His light. Many brothers and sisters can testify that they understand more of God&rsquo;s Word in the meeting than when they study it individually. Many times in the meeting, God opens up one portion of the Word through another portion of the Word. As one person speaks on one passage, light shines on another passage. In this way more light is unveiled, and we receive grace in a corporate way.</p>
<p>If we do not meet with others, the most we can have is individual grace; we will miss a great part of the corporate grace. God will only give us corporate grace in the meeting. If we do not meet with others, we will not receive this grace. This is why the Bible charges us not to abandon our assembling together.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE CHURCH AND THE MEETING</h2>
<p>One outstanding characteristic of the church is that it meets. A Christian can never substitute meetings with &ldquo;self-taught&rdquo; pursuits. God has a category of grace reserved for the meetings only. If we do not meet with others, that portion of corporate grace will not be available to us.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament God commanded the Israelites to meet. In many places in the Bible they are called <em>the congregation</em>. That they were called a congregation meant they had to meet together. When we come to the New Testament, the revelation is even clearer. We have the clear commandment not to abandon &ldquo;our own assembling together.&rdquo; God is not that interested in individuals being &ldquo;self-taught.&rdquo; We must assemble ourselves together before we can receive His corporate grace. No forsaker of meetings will keep His grace. It is a foolish thing to abandon assembling together. A man must meet; he must come together with other children of God before he can receive the corporate grace.</p>
<p>The Bible gives explicit commandments as well as clear examples of people meeting together. When the Lord was on the earth, He often met with His disciples. He met with them on the mountain (Matt. 5:1), in the wilderness (Mark 6:32-34), at home (2:1-2), and at the seaside (4:1). On the last evening before His crucifixion, He borrowed a large upper room and met with the disciples (14:15-17). After His resurrection, He appeared in the midst of their gathering (John 20:19, 26; Acts 1:4). Before the day of Pentecost, the disciples gathered together in one accord to pray (v. 14). When the day of Pentecost came, they were also gathered together (2:1). After that they continued steadfastly in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers. Shortly thereafter, they were persecuted and went back to their own places. Yet they still met together (4:23-31). After Peter was released, he went to the house where the disciples were gathered together (12:12). First Corinthians 14 tells us clearly that the whole church gathered together (v. 23). It was <em>the whole church</em> that gathered together. No one who is part of the church can be exempt from meeting together with the church.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of the word <em>church</em>? The word <em>church</em> is <em>ekklesia</em> in Greek. <em>Ek</em> means &ldquo;to come out,&rdquo; while <em>klesia</em> means &ldquo;to congregate or to gather.&rdquo; Thus, <em>ekklesia</em> means the gathering of those who have been called out. God is not only after some called out ones; He wants the called out ones to gather together. If all the called out ones are separated from one another, we will not have the church; the church will not be produced.</p>
<p>After we have believed in the Lord there is a basic need we must take care of, that is, to come together with other children of God. We should never have the strange thought that we can be &ldquo;self-taught&rdquo; Christians. We must eliminate such a thought from our mind. Christianity does not have &ldquo;self-taught&rdquo; Christians; it only has the gathering of the whole church. Do not think that we can be Christians who just shut ourselves up to pray and to read the Bible alone at home. Christianity is not built on just individuals but also on the assembling together.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> </body></html>
