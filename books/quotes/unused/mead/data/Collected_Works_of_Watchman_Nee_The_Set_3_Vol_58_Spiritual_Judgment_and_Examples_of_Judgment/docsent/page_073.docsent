   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 53 Date:September 4, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER K. K.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was greatly touched in 1928 when Brother Nee spoke on the story of Mary the Magdalene.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I became clear concerning my salvation in 1932 when I heard Dr. John Sung speak on the Samaritan woman.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For years I worked as a teacher but was weak and fraught with sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1935 I joined the Jin-Ning Bible College.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I thought that the college was the highest Bible institution on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Later I had neuritis and became very sick.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In my sickness I saw the transiency and vanity of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a result, I was baptized in 1937.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From that point forward my spiritual pathway had a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Later I read Rethinking the Work The Normal Christian Church Life , and I saw the need to be clear about my calling.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I was afraid that I was only a volunteer, so I decided to take up a teaching job instead.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>While on the mountain this time, I have seen the matter of authority as well as my need to submit to authority and to be under the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am willing to commit myself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the Lord will grant me mercy, He will bring me through all my problems.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Otherwise, even my pursuit of spirituality and my love for Him will amount to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our sister speaks quickly and softly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being quick in speaking means that one's mind runs fast.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It also means that too many thoughts are running through the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The mind is not calm, and the emotions are too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our sister's obedience is based mostly on doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Her mind is linked most readily to matters of doctrine because it is fast.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But her spirit is not strong enough, and there is not enough discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are two kinds of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First, there is obedience to the truth, and second, there is obedience to the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although you spoke of the discipline of the Holy Spirit, you did not emphasize it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I advise you to pay more attention to this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Your mind is strong, and your understanding of the truth is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You also have a desire to obey the Lord, but your spirit does not match these attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Your spirit is not strong enough; it does not match your mind and emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not allow your mind and emotions to become too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Learn to make your spirit strong instead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How can the spirit be strong?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order for the spirit to be strong, a man must have wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He must experience a breaking and a tearing down.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some experience some dealings, but there is no wound in them, and they do not have a feeling of hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such ones cannot have a strong spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are two ways to know the Lord: in the mind and emotion or in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not enough just to know Him in the mind and emotion; one has to know Him in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a man wants to serve the Lord properly, he has to know the Lord in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A man can direct his love for men toward loving the Lord, but it is not enough to love the Lord with an emotional love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He must touch something in his spirit; he must know the Lord according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, three things are needed: a strong mind, the discipline of the Holy Spirit, and knowing the Lord in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to know men, we first must be rich in our own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When a brother has a problem, simply saying a few simple words to him will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First, we have to see the problem more clearly than he sees it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Next, we should render a helping hand.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If he accepts it, we can lead him to the straight way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are definite ways to know men.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>First, we have to be calm in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must know the way ourselves before we can lead others to the way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must be judged ourselves before we can judge others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I can deal with a person because what is happening to him was judged in me some years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A psychologist judges men only according to their words.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, we first must go through the inward dealings ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After we have passed through these dealings, we will be sensitive to the same things when they surface in others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We may not be able to describe them, but inwardly we will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our judgment of others is based on our own condition.</S>
