A man should study the Bible, but he should also study man's heart. Daily we meet many people, and they all have similarities as well as dissimilarities.</p><p>For example, we can spend time to study man's conscience. We can ask the brothers and sisters to give testimonies about their salvation. We have to know how their feelings were developed and when these feelings reached a peak. How much did they hear before their conscience started condemning them of their sins? Did they become conscious of their sins after long discourses or as a result of one or two words?</p><p>We must also study man's thoughts. Every person has his own peculiar ways of thinking; everyone thinks that he is smart. We have to ask the brothers and sisters how they received God's light the first time. How were their thoughts turned the first time? Once we know these things, we can use the same method to save those with similar conditions. God is pleased to work on similar people with similar methods. This is a law. Once we discover such a law, our preaching will become easy. When a person has a problem in his mind and we solve his problem, all other things will fall into place. For example, a girl may not want to be saved because she was under instructions from her deceased mother to reject salvation. Luke 16, however, tells us that our relatives in Hades are praying that we will be saved. If we ask the girl to read this passage, her problem will go away. Once her problem is solved, other things will fall into place.</p><p>After studying man's thoughts and will, we have to study how he makes decisions. We have to study ourselves, the brothers and sisters, and the new ones. We have to know how a man makes decisions. When we preach to others again, we have to use similar methods to prompt them to a decision. Once we have studied all these things, we will have learned most of the lessons in saving men.</p><p>A gospel preacher should have a knowledge of the right kind of experience. He should not try to correct or adjust man's sin. Instead, he should help the sinner to bring his sins to God. God is the one who does the work of removing man's sin. Our responsibility is to preach God's word and to bring men to Him. Once a man turns to God, his sins are dealt with and he is recovered.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING GOD'S WAY</h2><p>We have to learn to study God's Word. We also have to learn to study man's heart. We have to be skillful using words with "hooks," taking into account man's condition but at the same time creating a sense of need and a sense of sin within him. This is the way sustained by the Holy Spirit. The biblical way is the way that will save the most number of people, because it is God's way. On the one hand, we need the utterance. On the other hand, we need to know men. In preaching the gospel, we need "hooks" to catch men, and we need to know men's heart. We have to consider men's heart condition and come up with the right clinchers. If we do this, we will bring men to salvation easily. A gospel preacher must not only count the number of people saved but must learn from his preaching the kind of words that will catch men, the kind of words that will touch and subdue them. We have to apply ourselves to this. We have to be wise in our skill of saving men.</p><p>Today in China, the number of saved ones is less than one-sixteenth of that in India. China must take the way of the church in preaching the gospel. On the one hand, we have to pursue deeper spiritual lessons individually. On the other hand, we have to learn how to bring men to salvation and to learn to coordinate with the other brothers and sisters in this effort. We have to study all the cases of preaching the gospel in the Bible. In this way we will become more effective in our own preaching.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 60: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (2) &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
