   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GIVING THANKS IN ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In addition to abiding in the Lord, we need to give thanks in all things and to pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here we must first say something about some language problems.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who read the Bible know that the problems with language come from the tower of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Greek text the clause in everything give thanks does not have the notion of blessings as the Chinese translation indicates.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Chinese translators rendered this clause as in everything thank the blessings because, according to its strict sense in Chinese, the word thank is a transitive verb and therefore requires a direct object; there would be no justification for not having a direct object.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason the word blessings was added.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But such an addition distorts the meaning of this particular clause.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In our experience we should not "thank the blessings"; rather, we should thank the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not "thanking the blessings"; it is giving thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To pray unceasingly means to use our spirit, to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, we use our feet to walk and our mouth to eat and talk.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, we use our spirit to pray, and when we pray, we use our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The many years of my speaking for the Lord in serving Him may be divided into several periods.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before 1943 the emphasis of my messages leaned heavily on the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I spoke on many truths, such as God's selection, predestination, sanctification, and justification.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Forty-two of the sixty topics in the book entitled Basic Truths in the Bible were written by me in 1943; in the previous year I had spoken on these forty-two topics, resulting in a great revival.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the revival came, I began to suffer persecutions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, the Japanese put me into prison and tortured me for a month before releasing me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Due to this kind of treatment, after I got out of prison, I became ill with tuberculosis, and I rested in bed for half a year according to my doctor's charge.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the time of my release the Japanese would not let me go but still required me to report all my movements subsequent to the release.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But then when I became sick with tuberculosis, they relented and let me go.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After a year my health improved a bit, and I then escaped to Chingtao to rest there for another year and a half until my health was recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During the period of my recuperation, the Lord shined on me, showing me that although my preaching from 1932 to 1942 resulted in a great revival, there was a great shortage of life in my messages.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There was much truth but too little life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that time the Lord showed me the tree of life and that this line runs through the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible begins with the tree of life and also ends with the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible is altogether concerning life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus said, "I am the life" John 14:6 ; He also said, "I am the true vine" 15:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we can conclude that He is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He came that we might have life and have it more abundantly 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This enlightening and seeing caused me to have a great turn.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 1946 after my health was restored and I was able to travel for the ministry, I went to Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that time, due to the flow of the revival in Chefoo, Nanking also had a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I arrived in Nanking and began to minister, speaking the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I kept speaking from Chefoo and Chingtao to Nanking, then to Shanghai, and eventually to Taiwan and southeast Asia until 1960.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For about twenty years I kept speaking on life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But honestly speaking, although I spoke of life there was not much life, because, I feel, I was not that living.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, I prayed, asking the Lord what the problem was and how it could be that I spoke of life yet I was not living.</S>
