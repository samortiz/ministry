<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2> 
<p>The messages contained in this book were released during an elders&rsquo; training in Anaheim, California from September 23 through 28, 1985.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GETTING PREPARED FOR THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>All of the elders need to take the way of labor to bring all the saints into the truth and into their function in life for the Body of Christ. We should still meet at the same time on the same day, but before we go to any meetings we need to get ourselves prepared. You may spend five days to get yourself prepared for one meeting. You should first pray, &ldquo;Lord, I just present myself to You. I am one appointed by You and established by You to take the lead in this locality. I present myself to You. Show me what You want to do, and I present and offer the entire church to You. Especially I give all the church meetings to You. Lead me and guide me that I may know what to do and how to render the proper ministry which is full of life and full of light to Your saints.&rdquo; If you pray in such a way, I do believe that the Lord will lead you. He will lead you to present some crucial points in the book of 1 Corinthians, in the book of Romans, in the book of John, or in some other book of the Bible. The Lord&rsquo;s leading you has very much to do with your daily fellowship with the Lord. If you are not one who fellowships with the Lord every day, regardless of how much you pray, your prayer may not work. There may not be an echo to your prayer. When you pray as one who fellowships with the Lord all the time, though, there will be an echo and that echo is the Lord&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO USE THE LIFE-STUDY MESSAGES</h2>
<p>During the last two or three years I have been very much concerned as to how we can use all the groceries of the Life-study Messages. In some meetings of the church a Life-study Message is read in the meeting, testimonies are given concerning the contents of this message, and prayers or hymns are offered which are related to the message. Although this way of getting into the Life-studies works to a certain extent, it is not the best way. The best way is not to go through a book of the Bible verse by verse or to read the Life-study Message from the first line to the last line. The best way is to pick out the crucial points and to get into these crucial points.</p>
<p>If you felt burdened from the Lord to study the book of 1 Corinthians the Lord might lead you to begin by picking up one crucial point in chapter one. Chapter one tells us that the Jews asked for signs and that the Greeks sought wisdom, but to we believers Christ is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom (vv. 22-25). Christ was made &ldquo;wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption&rdquo; (v. 30). This is one crucial point in chapter one of 1 Corinthians for you to study and get yourself into. You should get yourself into this crucial point until you are mingled with it and constituted with it. Then when you go to the meetings you can stress this crucial point in 1 Corinthians 1. Do not occupy the entire time of the meeting. Stress this point, but leave time for others to say something. You also have to make it clear that we are not just studying something for spiritual knowledge. We are studying the riches of Christ for our daily experience and enjoyment.</p>
<p>Encourage the saints to concentrate themselves on this crucial point during the week. They should concentrate themselves on Christ being God&rsquo;s wisdom and power to us and God having put us into Christ, who became wisdom to us as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. The saints should be encouraged to experience and enjoy this crucial point day by day and hour after hour during the week. Their assignment for the week would be to study, to learn, and to experience and enjoy this crucial point. When the saints come back to the next meeting a number of them will have the experience of this crucial point. Many times in the past the saints gave testimonies merely of their experiences with seemingly nothing related to the Word. By experiencing, enjoying, and laboring on a crucial point of the truth for an entire week, the saints will give testimonies not merely of their experiences, but of their experiences wrapped up with the divine revelation. Their testimonies will be a mingling of the divine Word with their experiences.</p>
<p>If we practiced in this way for one year, helping the saints to get into one crucial point a week, the result would be marvelous. Fifty-two crucial points will have been deposited into the saints. These crucial points are all deeper truths in the Scriptures. In 1 Corinthians the first deeper truth is Christ being given to us by God as our wisdom and power. We have been put into Him, so He is now our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. What a deeper truth this is! This truth will be worked into the saints. They will live this truth, they will enjoy this truth, and they will experience this truth. All of the saints will be getting into the deeper knowledge of the deeper truths week by week. In the Lord&rsquo;s day morning meeting and in the home meetings during that week the saints should concentrate themselves on one crucial point of the truth. You do not need to be concerned about their repeating something. Peter spoke on the day of Pentecost and in the homes all the believers repeated Peter&rsquo;s speaking. We have to build up an atmosphere in the local churches where nobody feels shameful to repeat another&rsquo;s word. Rather, we would all learn to speak the same thing (1 Cor. 1:10).</p>
<p>To practice in the way that we have described requires a much deeper exercise. For one crucial point you may need to go to some lexicon to study the Greek word for wisdom. This kind of study is not for the mere knowing of the New Testament in the way of knowledge. But there is a need for us to find out the real denotation or significance of certain crucial words used in God&rsquo;s holy Word. You may need to study the Greek words for wisdom, power, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Then you will need to get the help from the Life-study Messages on this particular crucial point. After half a year, twenty-six crucial points will have been put out. Some among you may pick up a burden to write a lesson book on these twenty-six crucial points. This lesson book could be used in your summer school to teach the young people. This needs a lot of labor. Just by this one illustration, you could see how much labor you brothers need to exercise.</p>
<p>For the elders merely to make the schedule for the church meetings and expect somebody to speak when the church gathers together does not work. Everybody wants to speak, but no one has anything to speak about. By laboring in a crucial point of the truth, you create something for the saints to speak about. This is why I say again&mdash;do not take the easy, short-cut way. We all need to take the way of labor for the long run. If you practice like this week after week, month after month, and year after year, consider what the issue will be in your locality after four years. The issue will be something marvelous. After four years, two hundred and eight crucial points will have been covered. If you were to cover all the crucial points in 1 Corinthians in this way, this book would become transparent and clear to all the saints. You may decide to pick up just one crucial point in each chapter of 1 Corinthians. When you get through 1 Corinthians, even though you did not read it verse by verse and you did not read all the Life-studies line by line, you will have acquired a bird&rsquo;s-eye-view of this book, and this book will have been deposited into your being.</p>
<p>After fifteen years of this kind of study and endeavor, many of the young ones among us will have a rich deposit of the truth in them and some of them will have been raised up by the Lord to be the proper leading ones. Regretfully, you do not have that much of a deposit of the truth in you because no one practiced in this way. You only received &ldquo;the raw groceries&rdquo; from the Life-studies, but you did not know how to cook the Life-studies in a proper way. If you were to go to the store and buy many groceries and pass them on to me, I would not know how to cook them. In like manner, we all have the divine groceries of the Life-study Messages, but we all need to be trained to cook them.</p>
<p>The Lord has given us the Holy Bible, the Word, and His Holy Spirit always goes along with the Bible. When we preach the Word, the Spirit honors this. The Baptist denomination is the one who uses the Bible the most among all the big denominations. According to a 1984 statistic concerning American and Canadian churches, the Catholic church has fifty-two million members and the Baptists are second with twenty-five and a half million members. The Catholic church has been on this earth for at least fifteen centuries while the Baptists have been existing for about four centuries at the most. Despite this the Baptists have nearly half the membership as the Catholic church does in America and Canada. This statistic shows us the power of the Word. The third biggest group is the Methodists with approximately thirteen million members. Especially in their earlier days, the Methodist denomination used the Bible very much. Based upon the foundation that John Wesley laid, the Methodist denomination used to use the Bible to the uttermost. Among all the churches of the Pentecostal movement, the one with the greatest number of members is the Assembly of God. The reason for this is because they used the Bible to establish their assemblies. These statistics show us that the best way for the Lord&rsquo;s children to take is to use the Word.</p>
<p>If we brothers would be so faithful to use the Word as I have suggested to you in this chapter, after ten years all the teenagers among us will be good Bible teachers. We will have a younger generation filled up and saturated with all the divine truths in the local churches. It is altogether worthwhile for us to labor in this way. I assure you that this is the best way not just to use the Bible in the way of knowledge but in the way of life. We can use the notes of the Recovery Version plus the Life-study Messages in order to dive into the crucial points of the Scriptures. The notes of the Recovery Version and the Life-studies are a mine that requires much digging on your part. Going to these two sources will save you much time. If you get into these mines you will see something more and something higher. Take the way of laboring on the crucial points of the truth. You should even take this way for the gospel preaching. Some of the brothers can testify that when they preach the gospel using the high, deeper truths, they have been warmly welcomed. This kind of preaching will capture the higher class, highly educated people on the college campuses.</p>
<p>I believe that what I have presented to you in this chapter is an endless way to get into the truths of God&rsquo;s economy. You can drive on this highway in a free way, but you do have the heavenly white lines to restrain you. This is exactly what the Lord needs in order for Him to build up the church upon the high revelation of Christ Himself. If you were to pick up the crucial points from the book of 1 Corinthians, you would be occupied with this book at least sixteen weeks. Think about how high this would be. All the saints should be encouraged to speak these crucial points in their homes. We need to talk to the children, to our parents, to our relatives, neighbors, and colleagues concerning these crucial points of the truth. During the whole week we should concentrate our talking and speaking on this one crucial point. Then the next week we could go on to another crucial point. I believe we all would see a tremendous improvement and change in the church life.</p>
<p>If you would pick up the crucial points of a certain chapter, all the rest of the verses would be clear. Do not forget, however, that to take this way will make you busy. You will have nearly no time to rest. If you labor in such a way, the Lord will send a blessing. Forget about all the problems in your church and go back to do this one thing. This one thing will swallow up all the death. You do not need to control the church, but these truths will control your church. Bring your church under this heavenly vision. When there is no vision, the people run wild. You must render the vision to the saints under your care.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF FULL-TIME WORKERS</h2>
<p>To labor in this way there is the need of full-time workers. In every church there is the need of some full-timers to spend more time on the Word. It would be hard to have a full-time job and bear the responsibility for the church meetings by laboring on the Word in this way to bring the saints into the crucial points of the truth. If we do go full-time for the Lord we may suffer poverty, but this is still worthwhile. All of us have to endeavor. If we will be so busy in the Lord&rsquo;s interest, many saints will follow us to get into the Lord&rsquo;s interest. If we take the short-cut, lazy way, the saints will also take this way. May the Lord grace us all to take the way of labor to get into the crucial points of the truth in the divine revelation.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH<br />
IN ROMANS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE DESIGNATION OF JESUS CHRIST<br />
TO BE THE SON OF GOD</h2>
<p>Romans 1:3 and 4 tell us that the gospel of God is &ldquo;concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, and was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.&rdquo; First, the gospel of God is concerning a Person and this Person is Jesus Christ. Second, this Person has two essences or two natures&mdash;the human nature and the divine nature. According to His human nature and essence, Christ is out of the seed of David. Third, He was designated to be the Son of God. This designation is to sonize His humanity with His divinity.</p>
<p>Christ is both the Son of Man and the Son of God. As the Son of Man He is human, possessing humanity, and as the Son of God He is divine, possessing divinity. The man Jesus was designated to be the Son of God in His humanity. The Son of God in verse 4 does not refer to Christ as the only begotten Son of God from eternity but to Christ as the firstborn Son of God referred to in Romans 8:29. The firstborn Son of God was designated. His humanity was designated into the sonship with the divine element. The man Jesus was sonized with divinity to be the Son of God. Now He is not only the only begotten Son of God, but also the firstborn Son of God. With the only begotten Son of God there was no humanity but only divinity. In the firstborn Son of God there is humanity and also divinity. The firstborn Son of God&rsquo;s humanity has been designated; a man has been designated to be the Son of God. His humanity has been sonized with His divinity for Him to become the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<p>The central aim of God&rsquo;s gospel is to produce many sons conformed to His Son (8:29). His firstborn Son is a pattern, a model, for the producing of the many sons. Romans 1:3-4 describes this model, whereas Romans 8 reveals the mass production. The central message of the book of Romans is that sinful, fleshly people are made sons of God and conformed to the image of the Son of God. In this way Christ becomes the Firstborn among many brothers. In order to get into this crucial point, you need to spend much time to study, using the Life-study Messages on the book of Romans.</p>
<p>We need to tell people that the gospel is a matter of a Person who has a double nature&mdash;the human nature and the divine nature. His humanity has been sonized with divinity for Him to become the firstborn Son of God. We believers could be conformed to Him to be His brothers. All the learned and logical people would admire such a truth. They would appreciate your &ldquo;logics.&rdquo; They would declare that the people in the local churches are the top philosophers, even today&rsquo;s Plato&rsquo;s. The teachings of Confucius have no comparison with these deeper truths.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD<br />
REVEALED IN THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Romans 1:16 and 17 say, &ldquo;For I am not ashamed of the gospel; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes, both to Jew first and to Greek. For the righteousness of God is revealed in it out of faith to faith: as it is written, But the just shall live by faith.&rdquo; The righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel of God. This is a very crucial point that requires much teaching. Why is the gospel of God powerful? It is powerful because the righteousness of God is revealed in it. If the righteousness of man were revealed in the gospel, the gospel would be weak, but the power of the gospel is the righteousness of God Himself. There is no power in the law because the law has only man&rsquo;s righteousness, but in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed.</p>
<p>The righteousness of God in the book of Romans is Christ Himself. Christ as the righteousness of God is given to us, so the power of the gospel of God is actually Christ as the righteousness of God. This righteousness is revealed in the gospel. When we preach the gospel, we have to preach the righteousness of God given to us, which is the very Christ.</p>
<p>The righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel out of faith to faith. Out of faith indicates faith as the source of the revelation of God&rsquo;s righteousness; to faith indicates faith as the recipient and retainer of God&rsquo;s righteousness. Romans 1:17 goes on to tell us that the just shall live by faith. Live here indicates that we firstly receive the life, and then we live by the life. This crucial point again requires very much study and labor. You do not need to go to other books for your study. Just use the book of Romans with the footnotes of the Recovery Version and the Life-study Messages.</p><h2 class="head1">THE POWER AND CHARACTERISTICS OF GOD<br />
MANIFESTED IN HIS CREATION</h2>
<p>In the history of mankind the righteousness of God is not revealed, but the wrath of God is. &ldquo;For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold down the truth in unrighteousness, because that which may be known of God is manifest among them, for God has manifested it to them. For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world, being apprehended by the things made, are clearly seen, both His eternal power and divinity, for them to be without excuse&rdquo; (1:18-20). God&rsquo;s eternal power and His divinity, which is the divine characteristics of God manifested in His creation, is a very good point for gospel preaching. People may say that they do not know God and may even ask where God is. Paul preaches the gospel of God in Romans beginning from God, not from sin. Today we have to do the same thing. We must present God to people. Paul presented God in the way of pointing out God&rsquo;s eternal power and God&rsquo;s personal characteristics expressed in His creation. Divinity means the divine characteristics of God.</p>
<p>Anyone who looks at the universe scientifically and objectively can realize that the universe itself indicates a certain extraordinary power. This power is actually the eternal power. The brothers who are going to the campuses to preach the gospel have to study much to find the evidences of this eternal power which is shown in the creation. Without such an eternal, unlimited power, there could never be such a universe. By looking at the universe, you can see the power, the eternal power, the unlimited power, of God.</p>
<p>By looking at the universe we can also see the personal characteristics of this divine Being. Every attribute of God is a divine characteristic. Light is one of God&rsquo;s many attributes. This attribute or characteristic of God is expressed in God&rsquo;s creation of the universe. This is why the entire universe is not under darkness but in light. In Genesis 1:3 God said, &ldquo;Let there be light.&rdquo; It would be helpful to study some science to find out something concerning the light in Genesis 1 to help you in the preaching of the gospel. Genesis 1 also mentions the &ldquo;fourth-day lights&rdquo; such as the light of the sun, the light of the moon, and the light of the stars. James refers to God as the &ldquo;Father of the lights&rdquo; (1:17). Lights in this verse refer to the heavenly luminaries. The Father is the Creator, the source, of these shining bodies. God created all the luminaries such as the sun, moon, and stars so He is the Father, the source, of the luminaries, the lights.</p>
<p>Beauty is another one of God&rsquo;s characteristics or attributes. The universe is beautiful. Only a beautiful person would and could create something beautiful. The universe is also full of life. Three categories of life can be seen in creation: the plant life, the animal life, and the human life. All these different types of life point to the very God who Himself is life.</p>
<p>Our God being manifested in His creation is a great truth which we need to teach to the Lord&rsquo;s children. He is manifested in the aspect of His eternal, unlimited power, and He is also manifested in the aspect of His characteristics such as light, beauty, and life. Light, beauty, and life are a few of the many characteristics or attributes of God which show how marvelous He is.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HUMAN CONSCIENCE AS<br />
THE LAW TO THE GENTILES</h2>
<p>Romans 2:14 and 15 say, &ldquo;For when the nations, who have no law, do by nature the things of the law, these, having no law, are a law to themselves: who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing joint witness, and their reasonings accusing or else excusing one another.&rdquo; This is the human conscience as the law to the Gentiles. God gave the outward law to the Jews, so the Jews have to behave and act before God according to the God-given, outward law. God did not give the Gentiles an outward law, but in the nature of every human being there is a conscience, and that conscience is in the function of the law. The function of the conscience is just the same as the function of the law. The Jews are under the law condemned by God, and the Gentiles are also condemned before God according to their conscience. The conscience works to accuse you or excuse you. When the conscience accuses you it means that you are wrong, and when it excuses you it means that you are right. There is something within you by nature, in your nature, that condemns, accuses you or justifies, excuses you. This is a major point for you to study with the help of the Life-study Messages.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPITIATION-COVER<br />
FOR GOD&rsquo;S JUSTIFICATION</h2>
<p>Romans 3:23-26 says, &ldquo;For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by His grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus: whom God set forth a propitiation-cover through faith in His blood, for the showing forth of His righteousness in respect of the passing by of the sins that occurred before in the forbearance of God; for the showing forth of His righteousness in the present time, that He should be just and justify the one who is of the faith of Jesus.&rdquo; The crucial point in these verses is the propitiation-cover for God&rsquo;s justification. Very few know what the propitiation-cover for God&rsquo;s justification of His chosen people is. The propitiation-cover is typified by the lid, the cover, of the ark in the Old Testament tabernacle (Exo. 25:17, 21). The ark has a cover on the top of it and on the day of atonement the blood was sprinkled on that cover. The King James Version of the Bible refers to this cover as the mercy seat, where God met with His people. Above this seat were the cherubim, signifying God&rsquo;s glory; underneath the cover and inside the ark was the law of the ten commandments, exposing and condemning by its righteous requirement the sin of the people who came to contact God (Exo. 25:16-22). Above the lid was the glory of God and underneath the lid was the law of God. The glory of God requires that God&rsquo;s people should match His glory, and the law of God requires His chosen people to have the proper righteousness with God and with man. Since no one can answer these two kinds of requirements or fulfill them, there is the need of Christ&rsquo;s redemption fully symbolized by the blood sprinkled upon this cover (Lev. 16:12-16). This blood satisfies God in answering the requirement of His glory and in answering the requirement of His law. By this redemption God can justify His people in the Old Testament time and in the New Testament time. This is the propitiation-cover for God&rsquo;s justification of His chosen people. You have to labor on such a crucial point with the help of the notes in the Recovery Version and Life-study Messages.</p><h2 class="head1">JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH IN THE ONE<br />
WHO GIVES LIFE TO THE DEAD AND<br />
CALLS THE THINGS NOT BEING AS BEING</h2>
<p>Romans 4:17 says, &ldquo;(As it is written, I have appointed you a father of many nations,) before the God whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being.&rdquo; Justification by faith is the crucial point in this chapter, but the crucial element is not justification by faith. We are justified by faith in the very God who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being. It is this kind of faith by which God justifies us. Usually we understand justification by faith in Jesus Christ, who died for us and who resurrected for us. In Romans 4, however, we see justification by faith in the One who gives life to the dead and who calls not being as being. When we believe in the Lord Jesus we are justified by the very God who gives life and who calls not being as being. When He justifies you, He gives you life and He calls not being as being.</p>
<p>When the very God justifies you, at that time He makes you a new creation. This is to call not being as being. At one time nothing was within you as a new creation. But when God justified you, at that very moment He called not being as being. Now within you there is the new creation. At the same time He gives you the eternal, divine life. If you get into this point with much labor, you will be brought into the central thought of Romans 4. In the past we only saw that when we were justified by God He forgave us of all our sins and reconciled us back to Himself. As a result, we have no more condemnation but peace toward God. We never thought that justification involved the new creation being called into being and the divine life given to us. When we go as a gospel team to a campus to preach the gospel, we need to tell others this wonderful truth. We may say, &ldquo;Today you can be justified by the One that justifies, the Justifier. When He justifies you, He gives you life, and He calls not being as being to make you a new creation.&rdquo; The presentation of such a wonderful truth would be powerful. Such a gospel would be the power to convince many professors on the college campuses. We all have to learn to labor in such a truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN ADAM</h2>
<p>The crucial point in chapter five is &ldquo;in Adam.&rdquo; In Adam we were born sinners, we were constituted sinners, and we inherited sin and death (5:12). The contrast to being in Adam is to be in Christ. In Christ we receive righteousness versus sin and life versus death. In this life we can reign as kings (5:17). These are the main aspects of this crucial point.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>The way we got into Christ was by being baptized into Christ (6:3). This point must be stressed in the gospel. We must tell others: &ldquo;Since you have believed, you must be baptized. When we baptize you in the water, we are actually baptizing you into Christ. You were in Adam and now we are transferring you out of Adam into Christ. Since you are in Christ, you are identified with Christ in His death and in His resurrection. In His death you are out of the sinful flesh and out of the power of sin. In His resurrection you are in newness of life, so you can live a life that is out of the flesh and out of sin and in His resurrection life with its newness.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE FLESH</h2>
<p>Romans 7 reveals the bondage in the flesh under the law by the indwelling sin unto death and wretchedness. In the flesh you are sinful because in the flesh you have been sold under sin (7:14). In the flesh sin is your master, sin is your director, sin is your boss. Because you are in the flesh there is no way to get out of sin. This sin masters you, governs you, enslaves you, and eventually kills you (7:11, 17, 20). Your weakness is fully exposed in the flesh. You become a wretched man and this issues in death (7:24).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In Romans 8 is the freedom in the Spirit without law by the indwelling Christ unto life and peace. In the Spirit you are set free from sin and death. In the Spirit you enjoy life because you have the law of the Spirit of life (8:2). This divine life can be enjoyed in all three parts of our being. First, this life is in our spirit (8:10). Then we enjoy this life in our mind (8:6). Finally, we can enjoy this life in our mortal body (8:11). If we walk according to the spirit, the righteous requirements of the law will be fulfilled (8:4) and we will be led as the sons of God (8:14).</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR LAWS</h2>
<p>In Romans 7 and 8 there are four laws. The law of God is the outward law written in letters (7:22). The law of good is in our natural being represented by our mind. In our mind is a law that always tries to do good and this is the law of good (7:23). Also, the law of sin is in our members (7:23). When a person wants to do good, there is another law, the law of sin, that defeats him and captures him. Lastly, Romans 8:2 refers to the law of the Spirit of life.</p>
<p>The first law is the law of God, the Mosaic law. The second law is the law of good which is a kind of natural law of mankind. Mankind was created according to God, and because God is good, there is a natural law within man always trying to do good. The third law is called the law of sin, and sin is the very embodiment of Satan. The law of sin may be called a satanic law. The fourth law is called the law of the Spirit of life. This is the divine law because the very Spirit is also the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God in contrast to Sin, which is the embodiment of Satan. The law of sin is satanic and the law of the Spirit of life is divine. The four laws are the Mosaic law, the natural law of the human being, the satanic law, and the divine law.</p>
<p>Furthermore, every life is a law. The satanic life is the satanic law, the divine life is the divine law, and the natural life is the natural law. As a believer in Christ we are also a created person. As a created person, within our being we have the natural law. We became fallen and received the satanic life and nature into our being and with this satanic life is the satanic law. Then we got saved and we received the divine life with the divine law. Therefore, in Romans 7 and 8 we see four laws and three lives.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD DISPENSING HIMSELF<br />
INTO THE TRIPARTITE MAN</h2>
<p>Our God is the Triune God who has passed through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Now He is the all-inclusive Spirit to be the divine life for our participation, experience, and enjoyment. First, He dispenses Himself into our spirit, the center of our being (8:10). From the center, He spreads into our mind and saturates it with life (8:6). Then He extends into our mortal body and thereby makes our whole tripartite being life (8:11). In this way we become men of life in all three parts of our being. This is the Triune God dispensing Himself into the tripartite man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONFORMATION OF THE BROTHERS<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S FIRSTBORN SON INTO HIS IMAGE</h2>
<p>Romans 8:29 and 30 say, &ldquo;Because whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers; and whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.&rdquo; This particular crucial point is fully and adequately covered in the Life-study Messages. You have to go to the Life-study Messages to labor on this crucial point.</p>
<p>Along with this crucial point, you need to study the first-fruit of the Spirit (8:23). The firstfruit of the Spirit simply denotes that the Spirit has been given to us as a first taste, a foretaste, of our eternal inheritance, which is the very processed Triune God. In the New Testament we have received an inheritance. The Spirit is given to us as a foretaste of the full taste of this inheritance, which is the Triune God Himself given to us for our enjoyment. This Spirit who was given to us as a foretaste of our divine inheritance is called the firstfruit of the Spirit. The firstfruit of the Spirit means that the firstfruit is the Spirit. In any kind of harvest the firstfruit is a foretaste of the full taste of the harvest. For us, the many brothers of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, to be conformed to His image, we need to enjoy the Spirit as the firstfruit. The firstfruit of the Spirit as the foretaste of the divine enjoyment is the very element for our conformation into the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son.</p>
<p>The issue of the enjoyment of the Spirit as the foretaste is the redemption of our body, which is the full sonship. The firstfruit of the Spirit and the redemption of our body, the full sonship, are both in 8:23&mdash;&ldquo;And not only so, but we ourselves also, having the firstfruit of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting sonship, the redemption of our body.&rdquo; As we are enjoying the Spirit as the foretaste we are still groaning for and eagerly expecting sonship. The sonship in this verse is the consummation of the sonship, not the initiation of the sonship as in Galatians 4:5. The full sonship is the redemption of our body. We have received the sonship already, but we will not receive the full sonship until our body is transfigured or conformed to the glorious body of Christ (Phil. 3:21). The full sonship is the redemption of our body, which is also the transfiguration of our body.</p>
<p>Romans 8:18 says, &ldquo;For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed to us.&rdquo; Romans 8:30 tells us, &ldquo;And whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.&rdquo; To glorify is to bring us into the coming glory. This will not be done outside of us objectively, but this is being done right now inside of us subjectively. The work of transformation is a process to bring us into glorification, the upcoming glory. The consummation of transformation is conformation; transformation results in conformation, and conformation issues from transformation. Also, conformation equals glorification.</p>
<p>Romans 8:19 says, &ldquo;For the anxious watching of the creation eagerly expects the revelation of the sons of God.&rdquo; The revelation of the sons of God is in the full sonship. Someday we sons of God will be revealed to the entire universe, especially to the angels and mankind and the demons. That revelation of the sons of God is the full sonship in glorification. Romans 8:20 and 21 say, &ldquo;For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.&rdquo; The creation will not participate in the glory, but they will enjoy the freedom of the glory. Today all the creation is under slavery. When our full sonship comes, we will be glorified and that glory will set the entire creation free from the bondage of slavery.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S SELECTION IN HIS MERCY</h2>
<p>For this crucial point we have to read 9:14-18. By studying these verses along with the Life-study Messages, you will get a clear picture of God&rsquo;s selection in His mercy. Romans 9:16 tells us that &ldquo;it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy.&rdquo; Our concept is that the one who wills will get what he wills to get and that the one who runs will gain what he runs after. If this were the case, then God&rsquo;s selection would be according to our effort and labor. But it is not so. It is altogether of God who shows mercy. We do not need to will or to run, for God has mercy on us. If we do know God&rsquo;s mercy, we will not put our trust in our efforts; neither will we be disappointed by our failure. The hope for our wretched condition is God&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VESSELS OF MERCY<br />
TO HONOR AND UNTO GLORY</h2>
<p>Romans 9:20-24 says that man was made a vessel and that this vessel is a vessel to honor because God is contained in this vessel (2 Cor. 4:7). The contents of the vessel is a Person of high honor, so this container is called a vessel to honor. Eventually, this vessel will be brought into glory. In other words, the contents of the vessel will saturate this vessel with Himself who is the glory. When the glory saturates the entire vessel, the vessel will be in glory, so it is unto glory. Being vessels to honor is not the result of our choice; it originates with God&rsquo;s sovereignty. It is of God&rsquo;s sovereignty that He makes His glory known by creating vessels of mercy to contain Himself. According to His sovereign authority, God before prepared us unto glory. We were predestinated by His sovereignty to be His containers, vessels to honor to express what He is in glory. That is not only a matter of His mercy, but also of His sovereignty.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE RICHES OF THE LORD<br />
BY CALLING ON HIS NAME</h2>
<p>Romans 10:12 and 13 say, &ldquo;For there is no difference between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him. For, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo; To be saved here means to be brought into the enjoyment of the riches of the Lord. The Lord is rich both to the Jews and to the Greeks. He is the rich Lord of all the peoples who call on His name. When we call &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we are calling upon the Lord because His name is His Person. This kind of enjoyment is the filling up of the vessel in Romans 9. The vessel in chapter nine can only be filled up with the riches of the Lord by our calling on Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A GRAFTED LIFE</h2>
<p>Romans 11:17 says, &ldquo;But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them and became a fellow partaker of the root of the fatness of the olive tree.&rdquo; Romans 9, 10, and 11 are on God&rsquo;s selection by His mercy and these three chapters show us that the olive tree refers to God&rsquo;s chosen people, the real children of Israel, not in the physical sense, but in the spiritual sense. Romans 9:6 says that &ldquo;not all are Israel who are out of Israel.&rdquo; The children of the flesh are not the children of God but the children of the promise (9:8). Therefore, the olive tree refers to the genuine people of God&rsquo;s selection. This tree includes us because we all have been grafted into this tree, of which Christ is the root. The wild branches are grafted into this cultivated olive tree to partake of Christ as the root of this tree.</p>
<p>Romans 11:17 refers to the root of the fatness of the olive tree. The fatness refers to the riches of this tree. Christ is the root of the riches of this cultivated olive tree which is somewhat like the vine in John 15. The vine is the divine organism for God to dispense Himself into His chosen people. In John 15, though, we cannot see the grafting. The fact that we Gentiles were grafted into the divine organism of the Triune God is revealed in Romans 11. We were branches of the wild olive tree, which means that we were born in Adam. But we were transferred into Christ by being grafted into Christ. Therefore, we become the cultivated olive tree, which is somewhat like the grapevine in John 15. Now we are enjoying Christ as the fatness, the riches, of this divine organism for God to dispense Himself into our being. Studying the Life-study Messages of Romans and some of the Life-study Messages related to John 15 will help you get into this crucial point of the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; TRIPARTITE BEING<br />
FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Nearly every teacher of the book of Romans knows that chapter twelve is on the practice of the Body of Christ. In order to practice the Body of Christ we first have to consecrate our body (v. 1). Second, we have to be renewed in our mind, which means that our soul has to be renewed (v. 2). Finally, our spirit has to be on fire (v. 11). The three parts of our being all need to be exercised for the practice of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE KINGDOM OF GOD<br />
AS THE REALITY OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>Romans 14 is a chapter on the church life. It tells us how to maintain the fellowship with the saints to have the church life. Verse 17 says, &ldquo;For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This verse strongly proves that the reality of the church life is the kingdom life. This realization requires you to go to Matthew 5 through 7. In those three chapters is the reality of the kingdom life. Romans 14:17 only gives us an extract of the reality of the kingdom life in three items: righteousness toward ourselves, peace toward others, and joy with God. In Matthew 5 those who hunger and thirst for righteousness and those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness are blessed (vv. 6, 10). Also, our righteousness should surpass that of the Pharisees. If we do not have such a surpassing righteousness, we cannot enter into the kingdom of the heavens (v. 20). Matthew 5 also tells us, &ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God&rdquo; (v. 9). Our Father is the God of peace (Rom. 15:33; 16:20), having a peaceful life with a peaceful nature. The sons of the kingdom are makers of peace. Matthew 5 also tells us that we are blessed when others reproach and persecute us, and that when this happens we are to rejoice and be glad (vv. 11-12). Romans 14:17 says that this joy is in the Holy Spirit. This is the kingdom life which is the reality of the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SUBJECTIVE SANCTIFICATION<br />
OF THE PEOPLE GAINED<br />
THROUGH THE GOSPEL PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>Romans 15:16 says, &ldquo;That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s work was to minister Christ to the Gentiles and His gospel preaching was a priestly service. He was an evangelist, yet in the eyes of God He was a priest in the service of the gospel, which I call the gospel priesthood. The nations, the believing Gentiles, became an offering to God. Paul as an evangelistic priest offered the believing nations, the Gentiles, to God as a kind of offering that the offering of the nations might be acceptable. After being sanctified, the Gentile believers are an offering acceptable to God. The Gentiles have to be sanctified not only positionally but also dispositionally. This kind of sanctification is a transformation in the Holy Spirit. When we preach the gospel, we must do it as a priest, not merely as a preacher. In our priestly preaching we minister Christ to the unbelievers. After believing they become our offering. As an offering they have to be sanctified, transformed, in their disposition, in their nature. God then accepts these transformed believers as an offering to Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES</h2>
<p>The practice of the local churches is in Romans 16. Verse 1 tells us that Phoebe is a deaconess of the church which is at Cenchrea. In verse 5 is the church in the house of Prisca and Aquila. Verse 16 refers to the churches of Christ and verse 4 to the churches of the nations. Then verse 23 says, &ldquo;Gaius, my host, and of the whole church, greets you.&rdquo; By putting all these verses together, you can see that the last chapter of the book of Romans is a chapter on the practice of the local churches. Romans begins from the designation of Jesus Christ to be the Son of God for the mass production of the many sons of God to be the components of the church, the members of the Body of Christ, and ends with the practice of the local churches as the expressions of the Body of Christ in many localities.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if we would all rise up to study these crucial points and to teach the saints to speak them, this would attract, gain, and keep people. We need a lot of labor to get ourselves constituted with all these things; then spontaneously we will be able to speak, teach, instruct, and train others in these crucial points of the truth. All of the saints in the churches will then speak the same thing in their homes, schools, offices, and everywhere. Everyone who hears these deeper truths will be surprised at the real riches of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. From now on we must be people on a higher level, speaking the higher truths. This kind of speaking will be very dynamic.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH<br />
IN FIRST CORINTHIANS</h1>
<p>To pick up the crucial points in the New Testament books is the way for us to uplift the standard of the truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If we neglect this way we will remain in a low standard of knowing and speaking the truth. We must pick up these high, crucial points, learn to get into them, learn to teach the saints, and learn to help all the saints, including ourselves, speak these things in our daily life. To some extent I feel we are still in the basement, speaking things that are so low. Getting into the crucial points will get us out of the basement and onto the third floor.</p>
<p>The last time I was in Taipei I proposed for the church there to get into the Life-study Messages on Galatians. In the first Galatians message I mentioned something about the various kinds of life being reduced during the winter season and thus prepared for further growth. Such a little section is in the message. When the saints there used that message in the meeting, nearly everyone stressed the winter. In such a message there are many points, but the readers, including you and me, are too used to picking up only the convenient points. It seems that nobody cares for the matter of God revealing His Son in us (Gal. 1:15-16). Talking so much about the winter in Galatians message one indicates that you do not know much truth. Based upon my consideration, I believe it is of the Lord for us to take the way of picking up the crucial points.</p>
<p>A great number of points have been covered in the sixteen chapters of Romans in the Recovery Version footnotes plus sixty-nine Life-study Messages. If the saints try to study this book without help they may not know what to pick up. In these sixteen chapters we have pointed out only twenty-one crucial points, and I hope some of you who are good writers could compose each point as a message with outlines. Then we could publish a book on Romans containing these twenty-one lessons which everyone can use. It would be marvelous if our young people who are even twelve years of age would be able to speak these crucial points. Forget about the hundreds of subpoints in Romans which are there as sand to bury the diamonds. Instead, pull out the diamonds. I believe if we all would be faithful to this way, the standard of the Lord&rsquo;s truth will be highly uplifted, and this will become a great attraction of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING OURS</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:2 is the expression, &ldquo;Our Lord Jesus Christ...theirs and ours.&rdquo; Christ as the all-inclusive One belongs to all believers. The crucial point of chapter one is that Christ is ours. We have been called by the faithful God into the fellowship of this Christ who is ours (1:9). That Christ is ours means that Christ is our portion. We have been called into the fellowship, that is, into the participation, the enjoyment of this portion, and this portion is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom to us (1:24). In God&rsquo;s economy we have been put into this portion, and God has made this portion our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1:30).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEEP THINGS OF GOD</h2>
<p>In chapter one Christ is our portion. In chapter two the crucial point is Christ as the deep things of God (v. 10). This one point needs the entire chapter two as a background. The Christ who is the deep things of God is the very Christ in God&rsquo;s mystery (2:7). The very Christ in God&rsquo;s mystery whom God dispenses to us is a kind of blessing and enjoyment &ldquo;which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, and which have not come up in man&rsquo;s heart&rdquo; (2:9). Christ as the deep things of God is Christ in God&rsquo;s mystery as the divine blessings dispensed to us which eye has never seen, ear has never heard, and which have never come up in man&rsquo;s heart. All of this is for our glory (2:7). To enjoy such a deep Christ is to enter into glory. This is altogether God&rsquo;s wisdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<p>In chapter three, both the growth of the plant life and the transformation of the minerals are for God&rsquo;s building. The believers who have been regenerated in Christ with God&rsquo;s life are God&rsquo;s cultivated land with its plants, a farm in God&rsquo;s new creation to grow Christ, that precious material may be produced for God&rsquo;s building (3:9). Hence, we are not only God&rsquo;s farm but also God&rsquo;s building. Corporately, we as the church of God have Christ planted in us. Christ must also grow in us and out of us produce, in the sense of this chapter, not the fruit, but the precious materials of gold, silver, and precious stones (v. 12) for the building of God&rsquo;s habitation on earth. Thus, the building of God, the house of God, the church, is the increase of Christ, the enlargement of Christ in His unlimitedness.</p>
<p>As God&rsquo;s farm with planting, watering, and growing (v. 6), the church should produce plants; but the proper materials for the building up of the church are gold, silver, and precious stones all of which are minerals. Hence, the thought of transformation is implied here. We need not only to grow in life but also to be transformed in life. In the church God transforms us from the plant life into minerals, which is fully illustrated by the petrification of wood into stone. Transformation produces the divine, building materials of God, gold, silver, and precious stones, which signify the various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DESTINY OF<br />
THE NEW TESTAMENT BELIEVERS<br />
IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 4:9 says, &ldquo;For, I think, God has set forth us the apostles last of all, as doomed to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.&rdquo; In Paul&rsquo;s time, when criminals fought with wild beasts in the amphitheater for the entertainment of the populace, the criminals were exhibited last of all. The apostles considered themselves as criminals doomed to death before the world, not as kings destined to reign. In 4:13 Paul said, &ldquo;Being defamed we appeal; we have become as the offscouring of the world, as the scum of all things until now.&rdquo; The destiny of the New Testament believers in the eyes of the world is firstly to be a spectacle like the criminals in the Roman amphitheater, then to be despised, looked down upon, and considered as the offscouring of the world and the scum of all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE UNLEAVENED BREAD<br />
TO BE OUR FEAST</h2>
<p>The crucial point in chapter five is Christ as the unleavened bread to be a feast to us (v. 8). This feast refers to the feast of unleavened bread as a continuation of the Passover (Exo. 12:15-20). It lasted seven days, a period of completion, signifying the entire period of our Christian life, from the day of our conversion to the day of rapture. This is a long feast which we must keep, not with the sin of our old nature, the old leaven, but with unleavened bread, which is the Christ of our new nature as our nourishment and enjoyment. Only He is the life supply of sincerity and truth, absolutely pure, without mixture, and full of reality. The feast is a time for the enjoyment of the banquet. The entire Christian life should be such a feast, such an enjoyment of Christ as our banquet, the rich supply of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING JOINED TO THE LORD<br />
AS ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In chapter six the crucial point is being joined to the Lord as one spirit that our body may be the temple of the Holy Spirit (vv. 17-20). Verse 17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Then verses 19 and 20 continue, &ldquo;Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For you were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body.&rdquo; The crucial thing in these few verses is that our being joined to the Lord as one spirit is so that we could be the temple of God. This implies that when you are joined to the Lord as one spirit in your spirit, this joining should affect your body, control your body, and keep your body from anything that is evil, especially from fornication. Then, not only is your spirit the habitation of God but also your body. For your body to be a temple of the Holy Spirit means that your union with the Lord as one spirit affects your body in a positive sense. This effect is to separate your body, to sanctify your body, that not only your spirit but even your body is the temple of God. Thus, your entire being becomes the temple of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HUMAN OPINIONS GIVEN WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD</h2>
<p>The crucial point in chapter seven is that human opinions could be given with the Spirit of God. In verse 10 the apostle says, &ldquo;I charge, not I but the Lord.&rdquo; In verse 12 he says, &ldquo;I say, not the Lord.&rdquo; In verse 25 he says, &ldquo;I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as having received mercy of the Lord to be faithful.&rdquo; Then in verse 40 he says, &ldquo;According to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God.&rdquo; All these words indicate the New Testament principle of incarnation (that is, God and man, man and God becoming one). This differs drastically from the principle of Old Testament prophecy&mdash;speaking for God. In the Old Testament the word of Jehovah came upon a prophet (Jer. 1:2; Ezek. 1:3), the prophet being simply the mouthpiece of God. But in the New Testament the Lord becomes one with His apostles, and they become one with Him; thus they both speak together. His word becomes their word, and whatever they utter is His word. Hence, the apostle&rsquo;s charge is the Lord&rsquo;s charge (v. 10). What he says, though not by the Lord, still becomes a part of the divine revelation in the New Testament (v. 12). He is so one with the Lord that even when he gives his own opinion, not the commandment of the Lord (v. 25), he still thinks that he also has the Spirit of God. He does not claim definitely to have the Spirit of God, but he <em>thinks</em> that he <em>also</em> has the Spirit of God. This is the highest spirituality; it is based upon the principle of incarnation.</p><h2 class="head1">RUNNING THE RACE TO OBTAIN THE REWARD</h2>
<p>In chapter nine the point we should pick up is the matter of running the race to obtain the reward. In verse 17 Paul says that if he preaches the gospel voluntarily he has a reward; but if not of his own will, he has been entrusted with a stewardship. Paul continues to say, &ldquo;What then is my reward? That in preaching the gospel I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel&rdquo; (v. 18). Then he continues in verses 24 through 27: &ldquo;Do you not know that those who run in a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may lay hold. And everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; those, therefore, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so I box, not as beating the air; but I buffet my body and lead it as a slave, lest having preached to others, I myself should become disapproved.&rdquo; The crucial point is to run the race to obtain the reward. Here Paul uses two illustrations from the Olympics: running a race and contending in a game. Both are illustrations for our Christian walk and work. Our Christian walk and work are like running in a race-course and contending in a game. The reward which the Lord will award His overcoming saints who win the race, is something in addition to salvation. We, His believers, have all received His salvation through faith in Him. This was settled once for all. But whether we shall be rewarded by Him depends upon how we run the race.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING CHRIST FOR<br />
OUR FELLOWSHIP WITH ALL THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>The main point in chapter ten is the enjoyment of Christ for our fellowship with all the saints. The beginning of this chapter refers to the eating and drinking by the children of Israel. &ldquo;And all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ&rdquo; (vv. 3-4). They ate the manna and drank the water from the rock. At the end of verse 4, Paul indicated definitely that this is a type because he said &ldquo;the rock was Christ.&rdquo; The manna must therefore also be Christ and the living water must be the very Spirit that comes out of Christ, the cleft rock. These two items are for enjoyment.</p>
<p>In verses 14 through 22 of this chapter the Lord&rsquo;s table is mentioned. According to the context of the entire chapter, our enjoyment at the Lord&rsquo;s table should equal the Israelites&rsquo; enjoyment of eating manna, the spiritual food, and drinking the spiritual drink, the living water. Today we enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s table, where the manna is the bread on the table and the spiritual drink is in the cup on the table. In all of these verses are many good points which are defined either in the footnotes of the Recovery Version or in the Life-study Messages.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s people should be a people of enjoyment. Their enjoyment is of God Himself embodied in Christ. In the Old Testament, the very God was embodied in manna and in the spiritual drink that came out of the rock. Then in the New Testament, God is embodied in the bread and the cup. We eat Him, we drink Him, and thus we enjoy Him. This is for our fellowship of the blood of Christ and of the Body of Christ. This means that we have fellowship in the Body and that we have fellowship in the blood by our eating and drinking. When we enjoy the Lord by eating and drinking Him, we have the fellowship with all the saints. Our fellowship with all the saints is in our enjoyment of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIVERSAL HEADSHIP</h2>
<p>In 11:3 Paul says, &ldquo;But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.&rdquo; In three aspects this is the universal headship. This is not a very interesting or exciting point, but it is something very solid which we cannot skip over. Here the headship of Christ over every man is concerning individuals. Christ is both the Head corporately of the Body, the church, and individually of the believers. He is the Head directly of every one of us. In the divine governmental ordination, woman is under the headship of man. God created the female in this way (Gen. 2:18-24; 1 Tim. 2:13). According to the nature (v. 14) created by God, woman is subordinate to man. Paul also says in verse 3 that the head of Christ is God. Christ is God&rsquo;s anointed One, appointed by God. Hence, He is under God, and God as the Originator is His Head. This refers to the relationship between Christ and God in the divine government.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S SUPPER</h2>
<p>Following the universal headship, Paul comes to the Lord&rsquo;s supper in 11:17-34. The emphasis of the table of the Lord is the fellowship of His blood and of His body (10:16-17), the participation in the Lord, the enjoyment of the Lord in mutuality, in fellowship; whereas the stress of the Lord&rsquo;s supper is the remembrance of the Lord (11:24-25). At the Lord&rsquo;s table we receive His body and blood for our enjoyment; at the Lord&rsquo;s supper we give Him our remembrance for His enjoyment.</p>
<p>The real remembrance of the Lord is to eat the bread and drink the cup (v. 26), that is, to participate in, to enjoy, the Lord who has given Himself to us through His redeeming death. To eat the bread and drink the cup is to take in the redeeming Lord as our portion, as our life and blessing. This is to remember Him in a genuine way.</p>
<p>The thought of the apostle in using this expression &ldquo;the body&rdquo; (v. 29), not &ldquo;the body of the Lord,&rdquo; may imply the mystical Body of Christ (Eph. 4:4) in addition to the physical body of the Lord (v. 24). In taking the Lord&rsquo;s supper we need to discern the Lord&rsquo;s Body. Therefore, when we participate in the Lord&rsquo;s table, we must discern whether the bread on the table signifies the one Body of Christ or any division of man (any denomination). In discerning the Body of Christ we should not partake of the bread in any division or with any divisive spirit. Our participation in the Lord&rsquo;s table must be the unique fellowship of His unique Body without any division either in practice or in spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY IN THE<br />
DIVINE OPERATIONS, MINISTRIES, AND GIFTS</h2>
<p>Chapter twelve is mainly on the divine Trinity in the divine operations, ministries, and gifts. These three are the Trinity in expression, not the Trinity in existence. Verses 4-6 say, &ldquo;But there are distributions of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are distributions of ministries, and the same Lord; and there are distributions of operations, but the same God, who is operating all things in all.&rdquo; The gifts are by the Spirit; the ministries, the services, are for the Lord; and the operations are of God. Here the Triune God is involved in these three things&mdash;gifts, ministries, and operations. The gifts by the Spirit are to carry out the ministries, the services, for the Lord, and the ministries for the Lord are to accomplish the operations, the works, of God. This is the Triune God moving in the believers for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose to build up the church, the Body of Christ, for the expression of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 12:7 says, &ldquo;But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit.&rdquo; The manifestation of the Spirit is unique but has a number of aspects. The apostle listed here only nine items of the Spirit&rsquo;s manifestation (vv. 8-10) as an illustration. Of these nine, speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues are listed as the last two, because they are not as profitable as the other items for the building up of the church (14:2-6, 18-19). Of these nine gifts and those listed in verses 28-30, prophecy as prediction, faith, gifts of healing, works of power, speaking in tongues, and interpretation of tongues are miraculous. All the rest, a word of wisdom, a word of knowledge, and speaking for God and speaking forth God in prophecy by the prophets, discerning of spirits, helps, and administrations, are gifts developed by the growth in life as those listed in Romans 12:6 through 8. The miraculous gifts, especially speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues, do not require any growth in life. The Corinthians did much speaking in tongues, yet they still remained in infancy (3:1-3). However, the gifts developed in life require growth in life, even maturity, for the building up of the church. It was for this purpose that this Epistle was written to the Corinthians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FORMATION AND<br />
CONSTITUTION OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>Verses 12 and 13 say, &ldquo;For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body being many are one body, so also is Christ; for also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; The Body has been formed by the baptism in the one Spirit. In one Spirit we have all been baptized into one Body. The baptism into the one Body has positioned us all to drink, and by drinking of the Spirit we are constituted to be the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MUTUALITY IN SPEAKING<br />
FOR THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The crucial point in chapter fourteen is mutuality in speaking for the church meetings. The church meeting is by mutuality in speaking, and speaking is mainly prophesying (14:4, 19, 26). The primary denotation of the word prophesy in chapter fourteen is not to predict but to speak a particular word concerning Christ. To prophesy is to speak Christ, to speak forth Christ, and to speak for Christ. This kind of speaking not only builds up the individual saints but also the church (14:3-4).</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BECOMING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT<br />
THROUGH RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The crucial point in chapter fifteen is Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit through resurrection (v. 45). Resurrection was not merely an objective act accomplished by Christ. It is very much related to us subjectively. Incarnation was much more than an objective fact; it was a process that brought God into humanity. The principle is the same with the process of resurrection. Resurrection was not merely an act in itself; it was a process to bring forth the life-giving Spirit. Through the process of resurrection, the Man, the last Adam, who ended the old creation became the life-giving Spirit, the germinating element of the new creation.</p>
<p>First Corinthians unveils to us that the very Christ, who is the portion of all the believers, and into whose fellowship we all have been called, is all-inclusive. He is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom, as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us (1:24, 30). He is our glory for our glorification (2:7), hence, the Lord of glory (2:8). He is the depths (deep things) of God (2:10). He is the unique foundation of God&rsquo;s building (3:11). He is our Passover (5:7), the unleavened bread (5:8), the spiritual food, and the spiritual rock flowing out the spiritual drink (10:3-4). He is the Head (11:3) and the Body (12:12). He is the firstfruit (15:20, 23), the second Man (15:47), and the last Adam (15:45); and as such He became the life-giving Spirit (15:45). The life-giving Spirit is the totality of all the other foregoing items, and we have to experience this life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;MY SPIRIT AND YOURS&rdquo;</h2>
<p>A number of things are covered in chapter sixteen but the crucial point is in verse 18: &ldquo;For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Acknowledge therefore those that are such.&rdquo; After the foregoing sixteen chapters Paul concluded his Epistle with this expression. Some of the saints who came to Paul refreshed his spirit and the Corinthians&rsquo; spirit. This indicates that all of the items in this first book to the Corinthians should be experiences in our spirit, because such an expression indicates that the writer is a person living, acting, and working in the spirit. He expects that his recipients, the Corinthians, would be such persons in the spirit also. This is the conclusion of this book. The verse is very short but the point in it is very crucial. In chapter fifteen is the life-giving Spirit and in chapter sixteen is our spirit that we may experience Christ in such a rich way as our portion. Then the fact that Christ is ours becomes our reality.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH<br />
IN SECOND CORINTHIANS</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, bring us all into Yourself. Lord, we are here with You, waiting on You. We believe that You are really with us. O Lord Jesus, open Yourself to us and open Your Word to us. Lord, help us to open ourselves to You, to Your Word, and to Your up-to-date revelation. We trust in You for Your speaking. Lord, do cover us and cleanse us. Once again, Lord, we take You as our sin offering and trespass offering that we may be accepted in You by God the Father. Lord, do anoint us. Amen.</p>
<p>I believe that all the saints can attain to the standard of the truth as presented here. I do not know how much the Lord will do and how far the Lord will go, but I believe a number of new ones and young ones will be raised up among us who will be able to exceed us in knowing the truth. Those who follow after us will be excellent. I believe this will bring in a new age among the Christians, an age of speaking the higher things and the deeper things. If we are faithful, after a few years all the truths which we present will become so common to many of the Lord&rsquo;s children. All the saints will speak these truths very commonly, and they will never be so hidden or so hard to understand.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ATTACHED UNTO THE ANOINTED ONE</h2>
<p>Now we shall consider the crucial points of the truth in Second Corinthians. Second Corinthians is much deeper than First Corinthians. For this reason, in this chapter we can only consider the most crucial points. The first crucial point is found at the end of chapter one, in verses 21 and 22. These verses say, &ldquo;But He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God, who has also sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.&rdquo; This crucial point is the base of all the truths found in this book. The base of all the following truths is that we have been attached to Christ, the anointed One. The apostles, who preached Christ according to God&rsquo;s promises and lived Christ according to their preaching, and the believers who received Christ according to the apostles&rsquo; preaching, are attached, joined to Christ, becoming one with Him. Christ, the anointed One, is full of ointment, full of anointing. Hallelujah, God attaches the apostles with all the believers to this anointed One! Because we have been attached to Him, the ointment flows in us. This point, as well as the other points of the truth presented here, have been covered in the Recovery Version footnotes and in the Life-study Messages.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CAPTIVES AND INCENSE BEARERS</h2>
<p>Another crucial point is found in 2:14-16. Verse 14 says, &ldquo;But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and manifests through us the savor of the knowledge of Him in every place.&rdquo; Verse 15 says, &ldquo;For we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing.&rdquo; Here two figures of speech are used; one is the celebration of a victory, and the other is the scattering of the incense in the celebration. In the first figure of speech we are captive ones in the triumphal procession. In ancient time a procession, consisting mostly of captives, was used to celebrate the victory. We all are the captured ones. While Paul was traveling in his ministry, he was a minister. But as he was traveling in his ministry, he considered that he was a captive and that his ministry was a procession celebrating Christ&rsquo;s victory. The gospel team must consider themselves as captives in the procession celebrating Christ&rsquo;s victory. Whenever you go to a campus, you go as captives in a procession. You may give a message to present this point to people. You can tell the students, &ldquo;Friends, we are not preachers; we are captives. We are not merely in the ministry but rather in a procession to celebrate Christ&rsquo;s victory. We hope that you would join us in this procession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventually, all the captives become incense bearers. First, we are the captives in the procession celebrating Christ&rsquo;s victory, then right away we become incense bearers to scatter incense or fragrance, the savor of the knowledge of Christ in His triumphant ministry. The apostles, being permeated with Christ, become a fragrance of Christ. They are not merely a sweet savor produced by Christ, but Christ Himself is the savor being exhaled in their life and work to God, both in those who are being saved, as a savor from life to life, and in those who are perishing, as a savor from death to death. The phrases &ldquo;unto death&rdquo; and &ldquo;unto life&rdquo; in 2:16 refer to the different effects of the apostles&rsquo; ministry upon different persons.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LETTER OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:3 says, &ldquo;Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.&rdquo; We, the New Testament believers, are living letters of Christ. The believers are the fruit of the apostles&rsquo; labor, commending the apostles in their ministry to others. Thus they have become the apostles&rsquo; living letter of commendation, written by the apostles with the indwelling Christ as the content in every part of their inner being. A letter of Christ is one composed of Christ as the content to convey and express Christ. All believers of Christ should be such a living letter of Christ, that others may read and know Christ in their being. In this living letter Christ is all the letters of the alphabet. He is every letter composing every word that composes every sentence. The Spirit of the living God, who is the living God Himself, is not an instrument like a pen for writing, but the very element, like the ink, with which the apostles minister Christ as the content for the writing of living letters that convey Christ. The Spirit of the living God is the &ldquo;ink,&rdquo; the element, the essence, of the writing, conveying Christ as the alphabet, the sentences, and the words.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTRY</h2>
<p>Another crucial point is found in 3:7-11, concerning the New Testament ministry. The New Testament ministry here is called the ministry of the Spirit (v. 8), the ministry in glory (v. 8), and the ministry of righteousness (v. 9). This ministry is the apostolic ministry of the new covenant, a covenant of the living Spirit, who gives life. The glory here is the glory of God manifested in the face of Christ, which is God Himself shining forever in the hearts of the apostles (4:6), surpassing the glory of the Mosaic ministry of the old covenant (v. 10). The ministry of the old covenant became one of death because the old covenant brought in condemnation unto death (Rom. 5:13, 18, 20-21) and death unto condemnation. Hence, it was also the ministry of condemnation. The ministry of the new covenant is one of the Spirit that gives life (vv. 8, 6), because the new covenant brings in God&rsquo;s righteousness unto life (Rom. 5:17, 21) and life that brings forth righteousness. Hence, it is also the ministry of righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRANSFORMATION FROM THE LORD SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Verse 18 of chapter three says, &ldquo;And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; When we with unveiled face are beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the element of what He is and what He has done. Thus, we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence, transfigured, mainly by the renewing of our mind (Rom. 12:2), into His image. Being transformed indicates that we are in the process of transformation. The same image means we are being conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, being made the same as He is (Rom. 8:29).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TREASURE IN EARTHEN VESSELS</h2>
<p>Thus far, four figures of speech have been used: captives, incense bearers, letters, and mirrors. A fifth figure is used in 4:7 which says, &ldquo;But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything. But we who contain this treasure are earthen vessels, worthless and fragile. A priceless treasure is contained in the worthless vessels. This has made the worthless vessels ministers of the new covenant with a priceless ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING BY THE SPIRIT OF FAITH</h2>
<p>Verse 13 of chapter four says, &ldquo;Having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, therefore I spoke; we also believe, therefore also we speak.&rdquo; Speaking by the spirit of faith in our practical life is a great, crucial point. This very particular expression is used only once in the entire Bible. The spirit of faith is a mingling of the Holy Spirit with our spirit. The phrase &ldquo;spirit of faith&rdquo; places the spirit in apposition to faith. Faith is of the spirit. Therefore, the spirit of faith is faith. Our faith is just the mingled spirit. Furthermore, faith comes from hearing and hearing comes from the preaching of the word (Rom. 10:14). The very source of faith is the word (Rom. 10:17). This is why we must get into the Word. The more we get into the Word, the more we will have faith, and this faith is the spirit. Now by such a spirit you may speak the Word which is the source of your faith. Here is a cycle. The Word produces faith, faith is the spirit, and by this spirit you speak the Word. Your speaking will become the source of faith in others. The faith in them then becomes the spirit by which they speak.</p>
<p>According to the context, the apostle&rsquo;s speaking by the spirit of faith was related to the death and resurrection of Christ. Verses 11 and 12 say, &ldquo;For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh. So then death operates in us, but life in you.&rdquo; Paul spoke his experience of the death and resurrection of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF RECONCILIATION</h2>
<p>A very crucial point, the ministry of reconciliation, is found in 2 Corinthians 5:16-21. Reconciliation is in two steps. These two steps of reconciliation are clearly portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle. The first veil is called the screen (Exo. 26:37, lit.). A sinner was brought to God through the reconciliation of the atoning blood to enter into the Holy Place by passing this screen. This typifies the first step of reconciliation. The second veil (Exo. 26:31-35; Heb. 9:3) still separated him from God who is in the Holy of Holies. This veil needed to be rent that he might be brought to God in the Holy of Holies. This is the second step of reconciliation. First we were sinners in the outer court. After being reconciled, passing through the first veil, we became saved persons. From this time we became a new creation (v. 17). However, we may have continued to live in the natural life. At most we could only be in the Holy Place. The natural life in the flesh was still there separating us from the Holy of Holies. Therefore, we needed a second step, to be reconciled out of the natural life unto God.</p>
<p>In the first step of reconciliation, we were reconciled to God from sins. For this purpose Christ died for our sins (1 Cor. 15:3) that they might be forgiven by God. This is the objective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death. In this aspect He bore our sins on the cross to be judged by God upon Him for us. In the second step, we as believers living in the natural life were reconciled to God from the flesh of sin. For this purpose Christ died for us&mdash;the persons&mdash;that we may live to Him in the resurrection life. (2 Cor. 5:14-15). This is the subjective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death. In this aspect He was made sin for us to be judged and done away with by God that we may become the righteousness of God in Him. By the two aspects of His death He has fully reconciled God&rsquo;s chosen people to God. This is not simply to be justified by God, but to be made the righteousness of God in Christ. For Christ to become sin is higher than for Christ to bear our sins. Likewise, to be made the righteousness of God is deeper than justification.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BETROTHED AS A PURE VIRGIN TO CHRIST</h2>
<p>There are a number of points in chapters six through ten, but these points should not be considered as crucial. In considering the crucial points in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, our standard is very high. When we use the Life-study Messages, it is not necessary to use every message and every part of the messages. When the messages were given as a study of a particular book, every verse was covered. However, we should focus on the crucial points in the central line of the book. These are the things which are neglected and overlooked by many of the saints.</p>
<p>In 11:2 Paul says, &ldquo;For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one Husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.&rdquo; Verse 4 says, &ldquo;For if indeed he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different gospel, which you did not accept, you bear well with him.&rdquo; In verse 5 Paul referred to the super-apostles. Super-apostles is an ironic term. Besides Paul and his co-workers, there were others who taught differently. Paul considered that all those different teachings were replacements of the unique Husband. The unique Husband is Christ in His unique revelation. Other teachers came in pretending to be even higher than the apostles. However, Paul said that they were &ldquo;super,&rdquo; not higher, and that what they taught may become another husband to the Corinthians. To take their teachings is to take another husband.</p>
<p>The enemy is very subtle. Throughout the centuries many fundamental and scriptural teachings have been used by the enemy to replace Christ and the revelation concerning Christ. These teachings are more subtle than the Judaic teachings. The Judaic teachings of the Old Testament law and genealogy are not so fundamental as so many of the teachings given in past centuries, especially since the Reformation. Many good fundamental and spiritual teachings all became replacements for the proper revelation of Christ. According to Paul these are other husbands. When the super-apostles taught, they also used the name Jesus and the term gospel. Otherwise, Paul would not have referred to another Jesus and another gospel. This was very subtle. This point is very crucial and impresses us with a principle&mdash;anything that distracts people from the central line and from the focus of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, even though it may be quite fundamental and scriptural, is a replacement of Christ and of the revelation of Christ. If it is a replacement, it is another husband to us as the pure virgins.</p><h2 class="head1">A MAN IN CHRIST AND<br />
THE SUFFICIENT GRACE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Chapter twelve covers two very crucial points. In verse 2 Paul said, &ldquo;I know a man in Christ,&rdquo; and in verse 9 he said, &ldquo;And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you.&rdquo; At least to some degree Paul considered these points together in the writing of this chapter. The man in Christ has a particular characteristic in that he always shows his weakness. Although his weakness was not actually great, he still preferred to display it. In this respect he takes the Lord Jesus as his pattern. We know that the Lord Jesus was not weak; rather He was powerful. However, when He was arrested, brought to the cross, and nailed there, Christ appeared to be weak. When Judas brought the officers from the temple to arrest Christ, Christ did not struggle. In the eyes of the arresting ones Christ was very weak. If He were not weak, surely he would have fought back, not tolerating their arresting. He did not struggle. He did not have any reaction. That was His display of weakness. When He was brought the long distance from Gethsemane to Golgotha, He did not resist. That was a sign of His weakness. To nail a living person on a cross is not easy. Even an animal resists being slaughtered. The Lord Jesus, however, apparently had no strength to struggle. In this He showed His weakness.</p>
<p>Paul, as a man in Christ, was just like Christ. In the preceding chapters Paul reminds the Corinthians of the many ways in which they had wronged him. However, Paul never reacted to them. He always showed them his weakness. Even when they accused him of manipulating them for the sake of money, he did not fight back or react (vv. 16-19). Instead he displayed his weakness. In verse 5 Paul said, &ldquo;On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.&rdquo; The weakness here does not refer to the actual weakness of Paul. Rather it is like that of the Lord Jesus, who when He was arrested, brought to Golgotha, and put on the cross, did not do anything to resist. Apparently He was weak, not doing anything. If while one is suffering persecution, he reacts and struggles against it, he is not under the cross. Rather, he is quite strong. No strong person could ever be crucified. Every crucified one must firstly be a subdued one. Only when one is subdued could he be put on the cross. Being subdued is a sign of weakness. Throughout His whole life, Christ was subdued. He was subdued by His opposers, and He was subdued by His environment. Paul followed the Lord to be subdued. The Corinthians did many unfair and unrighteous things to him. Yet Paul remained subdued, showing his weakness. The sign of a man in Christ is weakness. This is opposite to our natural feeling. We may consider that the sign of a man in Christ would be his power and his strength. It seems that such a man should be very great. But Paul as a man in Christ appeared to be so small.</p>
<p>In verse 9 Paul comes to the matter of the Lord&rsquo;s sufficient grace. However, when he comes to this point, he comes in the way of weakness. In verses 7 and 8 he tells us that there was a thorn in his flesh. Although he entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from him, the Lord would not answer him. The thorn remained there, and Paul was eventually subdued by it.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the great teachers of the Bible agree that the thorn in his flesh was a disease in his body. In Acts Paul performed mighty miracles. Even handkerchiefs carried away from him healed people (Acts 19:12). However, he himself could obtain no healing. This disease was a sign to him. A thorn is not a knife to kill you. A thorn is something which penetrates into your skin to bother you. Certain diseases do not kill you but instead bother you continually. As an old brother I know what the thorn in the flesh is. How glad I would be if there were no thorn. However, I am subdued by the thorn. The thorn was assigned by the Lord to subdue Paul continually. Paul prayed three times. This indicates that he bargained with the Lord. He may have said, &ldquo;Lord, why would You not take this away? You used me to do miracles in a mighty way. In Acts 19 I could perform miracles of healing. But now I cannot.&rdquo; Apparently, the great miracle worker could do nothing. Not only could Paul not heal himself, but he would not even heal his intimate spiritual son Timothy (1 Tim. 5:23). Some of today&rsquo;s Pentecostals might pray on a handkerchief and mail it to the ailing co-worker. This has been done many times in this country. Instead, Paul returned to the practices of ancient medicine. In the ancient time, one with stomach trouble drank less water and took a little wine. It seems that Paul had forgotten his healing miracles and had returned to the natural way. In 2 Timothy 4:20 Paul said, &ldquo;But Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.&rdquo; Although he cared for his co-worker, he had no way to heal him. This word is for those who seek after the Lord to be subdued, to learn how to be weak, that they may enjoy the sufficient grace of Christ.</p>
<p>In verse 5 Paul mentioned his weaknesses, and in verse 9 he again said that he would rather boast in his weaknesses. This indicates that these two portions are related and should be combined together as one crucial point. Quite often we understand the sufficiency of grace not in the way related to the man in Christ. A real man in Christ is one who is not so strong in the physical, natural sense. Rather he is always troubled. This means he is subdued, unable to handle his situation. This kind of weakness affords a good opportunity for the sufficient grace of Christ. If we are not weak but are strong in any way, we do not need Christ&rsquo;s sufficient grace. If I am a millionaire, I do not need your help. But if I am poor in every way, I need your sufficient help. If I were so strong and rich so that I had the means to walk, act, and do everything, I would not need your help. I would be strong, weak in nothing, and poor in nothing. In such a case how can I be a man in Christ? If we are so strong, so rich, and so perfect in everything, then not only would we not need the grace of Christ, we would not even need Christ Himself. We would be sufficient in ourselves.</p>
<p>The Lord, in order to train us as a man in Christ to enjoy Himself as the all-inclusive Christ, surely needs to subdue us. In the past I have seen some strong brothers, wise and capable in every way, nearly lacking nothing. I have seen such a one carefully select his wife from among the sisters. Eventually his selection became the best thorn for him. Before their marriage no one knew that this sister would be such a thorn. But after their marriage, she became a typical thorn, not to anyone else but to her husband. Throughout the following years that brother became fully subdued by that thorn. In one sense his situation was pitiful, but in another sense it was glorious, because under that thorn that brother experienced the sufficient grace of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">CRUCIFIED OUT OF WEAKNESS</h2>
<p>The next crucial point is found in 13:4 which says, &ldquo;For indeed He was crucified out of weakness, but He lives by the power of God.&rdquo; Apparently this portion of the Word is easy to understand. However there is a difficult element here. Christ was crucified out of, or because of, weakness. If Christ had not been weak, He would never have been arrested. Weakness here is the weakness of the body, the same as in 10:10. For Himself Christ did not need to be weak in any way. But for accomplishing redemption on our behalf, He was willing to be weak in His body that He might be crucified. If He was not willing to be weak, how could He have been crucified? He was crucified out of weakness, but He lives by the power of God. Paul told the Corinthians that he followed Christ to be weak in Him for their sake. Verse 4 continues, &ldquo;For indeed we are weak in Him, but we shall live together with Him by the power of God toward you.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">TESTING YOURSELVES<br />
WHETHER YOU ARE IN THE FAITH</h2>
<p>The crucial point in 13:5 is closely related to the previous point. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves; or do you not recognize yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?&rdquo; The crucial and difficult point here is the faith. What does it mean to test yourselves whether you are in the faith? Verses 6 and 7 continue, &ldquo;But I hope that you will know that we are not disapproved. Now we pray to God that you do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do what is good, and we may be as disapproved.&rdquo; This is one of the hardest portions in the New Testament for New Testament readers to understand. The Corinthians altogether lived not only in the natural life but also in the flesh. They considered that Paul was not so strong, not so excellent as an apostle, and even unlearned. Most Bible teachers agree that Paul was a short man. Perhaps Peter may have been a taller man. In this sense, Peter may have been more preferable than Paul. Also, Apollos may have seemed to be more learned than Paul. Among the Corinthians, some may have admired Peter as a giant, and others may have admired Apollos as a learned one. However, Paul may not have been admired among them.</p>
<p>Paul was certainly not unlearned, but he did not behave in a way to display his learning. In these two books he told us that when he came to the Corinthians he did not come with excellency of speech (1 Cor. 2:1, 2 Cor. 11:6). He had the proper knowledge, but he did not apply it in his speech. He had the adequate education, but he did not seem to use it. For this reason the Corinthians considered him as weak. Paul, standing on this point, told them that he was indeed weak. However, he charged the Corinthians to test themselves whether they were in the faith. In doing this Paul was wise. When he said this, he actually was asking them to test themselves whether they were in the faith related to knowing the apostles. Apparently in verse 5 he did not ask the Corinthians to test themselves concerning knowing the apostles, but concerning knowing themselves. However, if one is in the faith, he would not consider anyone, including himself, according to appearance. In chapter five Paul says that we know no one according to flesh (5:16). We know persons not by what we can see, but by what we cannot see.</p>
<p>Faith is the substantiating of things not seen. Paul asked the Corinthians to test themselves whether or not they were in the faith. If they were in the faith, they would not consider themselves by what they saw or by what they felt. Rather they would consider themselves by faith. They needed to be in faith. If they would have considered themselves not by faith and not in faith, they may have said that Christ was not in them. They may not have felt it to be so, and even the more they could not have seen it to be so. They needed to be persons in faith. Just as they should have considered themselves in the faith, so also they should have done the same concerning the apostles. The apostles should be regarded not according to sight or appearance, but rather in faith. Such a brother as Paul appeared to be weak. But if you would consider him by faith, you would realize that he is powerful, not in himself but in the One who is in him. To consider others in this way, you must first test yourself, by considering yourself in the faith.</p>
<p>The Corinthians regarded Paul according to the outward appearance. They regarded others in this way because they had never considered themselves by faith rather than by sight. This is why Paul told them to test themselves not by appearance but by faith. If they would not have tested themselves in the way of faith, they would have concluded that they were in the flesh. It would have seemed to them that they were not in Christ, that they had nothing to do with Christ, and that Christ was not in them. They would have considered that only the flesh and the natural life were in them. However, the Corinthians did not consider themselves in this way. They considered that Christ was in them, even though according to their appearance they were natural men in the flesh. But even though they would prefer to consider themselves not according to appearance, they still considered the apostle according to his appearance.</p>
<p>This is a very crucial point. We should always consider ourselves not by what we see or feel but in faith. When we would consider ourselves in faith, we would realize that we are a person in weakness and a person in the enjoyment of the sufficient grace of Christ. Chapter thirteen of Second Corinthians should be regarded as a continuation of chapter twelve. Putting these two chapters together we can see that we must be persons always considering ourselves as well as others not by sight or by appearance but in faith. In this state we will appear to be weak, but we will continually enjoy the sufficient grace of Christ. Whenever we feel that we are strong and see the signs of our strength, we are through with the enjoyment of the grace of Christ. This is a great lesson. If I would tell you of the lofty visions that I have received, you would all admire me. But if I would indicate to you that my vision is small, you may all put me aside. The Corinthians had almost entirely disregarded Paul. To them he was weak and was even as nothing. Therefore Paul asked them to test themselves to see whether or not they were in the faith. If they would test themselves by faith, they would learn the lesson. Without the testing by faith, they themselves would appear even as nothing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ENJOYMENT OF THE PROCESSED AND<br />
CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>The final crucial point of this book is the so-called benediction, the blessing of 13:14. At the conclusion of the first book to the Corinthians the human spirit is mentioned. First Corinthians 16:18 says, &ldquo;For they refreshed my spirit and yours.&rdquo; The second book ends in a marvelous, excellent way. Chapter thirteen verse 14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; This is surely a great, crucial point. This is the conclusion of all the crucial points covered in the preceding chapters. In chapter one we are attached to the anointed One. By being attached to the anointed One, we enjoy the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging. Our attachment to the anointed One is altogether due to the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Not only is this attachment due to this benediction, but this attachment issues in this benediction. The attachment becomes the cause for such a blessing. In chapter two there are the captives and the incense-bearers in the procession to celebrate Christ&rsquo;s victory. To be such captives and incense-bearers, we must be in this divine benediction. If the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit are with us, then we can be such captives and incense-bearers. In chapter three are the letters and the mirrors to behold and reflect the glorious image of Christ that we may be transformed into His image. To be such a letter continually speaking Christ, and to be such a mirror beholding Christ, we must be in this divine benediction. The treasure in chapter four and the second step of reconciliation in chapter five, as well as all the other crucial points, are also related to this benediction. We must have the enjoyment of the processed and consummated Triune God as described in 2 Corinthians 13:14.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CRUCIAL POINTS<br />
OF THE TRUTH IN GALATIANS</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will cover the crucial points of the truth in Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the Galatians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT EVIL AGE</h2>
<p>In 1:4 Paul says that Christ &ldquo;gave Himself for our sins, that He might rescue us out of the present evil age.&rdquo; The crucial point in this verse is the present evil age. Although this point has been covered in a clear way in the Life-study of Galatians and in the footnotes of the Recovery Version, I would like to briefly cover it again. At Paul&rsquo;s time, a kind of evil age was prevailing which Paul called the present evil age. An age is a part, a section, or an aspect of the world as the system of Satan, which is used by him to usurp and occupy people and keep them away from God and His purpose. The present evil age here, according to the contents of this book, refers to the religious world, the religious course of the world, the Jewish religion. This is confirmed by 6:14-15, where circumcision is considered a part of the world&mdash;the religious world which, to the Apostle Paul, is crucified. Here the apostle emphasizes that the purpose of Christ giving Himself for our sins was to rescue us, to pluck us, out of the Jewish religion, the present evil age. This is to release God&rsquo;s chosen people from the custody of the law (3:23), to bring them out of the sheepfold (John 10:1, 3), according to the will of God. Thus, in his opening word, Paul indicates what he is going to deal with, that is, to rescue the churches which were distracted by Judaism with its law and to bring them back to the grace of the gospel.</p>
<p>While the Lord Jesus was on this earth, the Jewish religion was exposed to the uttermost that it was an evil age. If the Jewish religion had not been such an evil age, how could its leaders have put the Lord Jesus on the cross? To crucify Jesus was absolutely more than an evil thing. His crucifixion exposed the Jewish religion to be the present evil age. This matter was not merely individual but involved a generation. An age refers to one aspect of the world. The world is composed of many ages, while a generation refers to the people, to the Jews. Therefore, on the day of Pentecost in Acts 2:40, Peter, at the conclusion of his message, does not say be saved from God&rsquo;s condemnation or from eternal perdition, but be saved from this crooked generation! This refers to the perverted Jews in this age, who rejected God&rsquo;s Christ (Acts 2:36) and whose religion was considered by God as the present evil age. The Jews themselves cannot be separated from the Jewish religion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF GOD&rsquo;S SON IN US</h2>
<p>Another crucial point in chapter one of Galatians is the revelation of God&rsquo;s Son in us (1:16). This point implies that Christ is versus religion, tradition, and law. The Son of God as the embodiment and expression of God the Father (John 1:18; 14:9-11; Heb. 1:3) is life to us (John 10:10; 1 John 5:12; Col. 3:4). God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life (John 17:3; 3:16), and become the sons of God (John 1:12; Gal. 4:5-6). As the Son of the living God (Matt. 16:16), He is far superior to Judaism and its tradition (vv. 13-14). The Judaizers bewitched the Galatians so that they considered the ordinances of the law above the Son of the living God. Hence, the apostle, in the opening of this Epistle, testified that he had been deeply involved and far advanced in that realm. God, however, had rescued him out of that course of the world, which was evil in God&rsquo;s eyes, by revealing His Son in him. In his experience, he realized that there was no comparison between the Son of the living God and Judaism with its dead traditions from his fathers.</p>
<p>Christ being versus religion, tradition, and law can be fully applied to our present situation. In a very positive sense, in the eyes of God today&rsquo;s religion is an evil age, a crooked generation. Yet in such an evil age, Christ is being revealed in us. Therefore, this revealed Christ is versus religion, tradition, regulations, rules, and ordinances. God&rsquo;s revealing of His Son to us is in us, not outwardly but inwardly: not by an outward vision but by an inward seeing. This is not an objective revelation but a subjective one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>In chapter two there is a crucial point in verse 5&mdash;the truth of the gospel. Paul was strong against the Judaizers who made circumcision a condition for salvation. To such ones Paul &ldquo;yielded in subjection not even for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might remain with you&rdquo; (2:5). We have to spend some time to pick up all the related points to be able to present this item of the gospel to others as basic knowledge. In 2:5 and 14 Paul speaks of the truth of the gospel. The word truth in these verses does not mean the doctrine or teaching of the gospel; it denotes the reality of the gospel. Although Galatians is a short book, it affords us a complete revelation of the reality of the gospel in certain basic principles.</p>
<p>The first principle of the truth of the gospel is that fallen man cannot be justified by works of law (2:16, 3:11). On the contrary, we are justified by faith in Christ. Faith in Christ denotes an organic union through believing. There is only one term or condition of the gospel, that is, to believe in the Lord Jesus. Besides believing in Him there should be no other condition, no other term. You need to spend some time to study and to make an outline of this portion of the Word related to the truth of the gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">HAVING DIED TO LAW<br />
THAT WE MIGHT LIVE TO GOD</h2>
<p>The next crucial point is in verses 19 and 20 of chapter two where Paul says, &ldquo;For I through law have died to law that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.&rdquo; The crucial point here is that we have died to law so that we might live to God. This point includes the fact that we are in Christ, and therefore, not held responsible to keep the law. We have died to the law. That means we are freed from the law. A dead person is freed from the law and has no duty, responsibility, to keep the law. We have been freed from all regulations, all law and bondage, by our having been crucified with Christ. So, we are not responsible to keep the law; we are only responsible to God and we live to Him. Now it is not we who live, but Christ who lives in us through His resurrection. His living in us is entirely by His being the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b).</p>
<p>This point has been fully and adequately covered in the Life-study Messages, so you need to go there for your study. These messages especially point out that the Christian life is not an exchanged life, the exchange of a lower life for a higher one, but a life in union with Christ, a grafted life, the grafting of the human life into the life of Christ. This point is worthy of much study. Also, it may take two or three meetings to adequately cover such a crucial point.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE SPIRIT BY THE HEARING OF FAITH</h2>
<p>Chapter three of Galatians is a long and difficult chapter to understand. The crucial point that is so unique in this chapter is the matter of receiving the Spirit by the hearing of faith. In verse 2 Paul says, &ldquo;This only I wish to learn from you, Did you receive the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith?&rdquo; Today among the Christians there are many arguments concerning the receiving of the Spirit. The Pentecostal saints would say that the receiving of the Spirit is by the baptism of the Holy Spirit. They even say that the unique sign of the baptism of the Holy Spirit is speaking in tongues. However, we have received the Spirit by the hearing of faith.</p>
<p>What is the faith for us to hear? Faith implies our believing in Christ, taking His person and His redemptive work as the object of our faith. This replacing the law, by which God dealt with people in the Old Testament, becomes the principle of God&rsquo;s dealing with people in the New Testament. This faith characterizes the believers in Christ and distinguishes them from the keepers of the law. This is the main emphasis of the book of Galatians.</p>
<p>Some other verses in Galatians 3 show us that faith is a wonderful thing. Verse 23 says, &ldquo;But before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed.&rdquo; Until faith came, the law was our child conductor, guardian, escort, custodian, used by God to watch over His chosen people (v. 24). In verse 25 Paul says, &ldquo;But faith having come.&rdquo; Since faith in Christ has come, we do not need to be under the guarding of the law any longer. It is by the hearing of this faith that Paul says we receive the Spirit. In verse 14 this Spirit becomes the very blessing of the gospel which was promised to Abraham.</p>
<p>Law was the basic term of the relationship between man and God in God&rsquo;s Old Testament economy (3:23); faith is the unique requirement for man to contact God in His New Testament economy (Heb. 11:6) that we may participate in God&rsquo;s promised blessing and live Christ. Faith here stands for the entire picture of the New Testament. The law in the Old Testament is always accompanied by works not by faith. The law is not a matter of faith but altogether a matter of works. When John the Baptist came, his preaching put the law aside. In other words, his preaching put the entire Old Testament aside. In his preaching he said, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (Matt. 3:2). John also preached that &ldquo;he who believes in the Son has eternal life&rdquo; (John 3:36). First, John preached repentance, and then the Lord Jesus followed John. After John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of God (Mark 1:14). In Mark 1:15 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Repent and believe in the gospel!&rdquo; From this verse onward the key word in the entire New Testament is faith which means to believe. John 3:14-16 says, &ldquo;Even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life. For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.&rdquo; In the Gospel of John alone a form of the word believe is used more than eighty times. Faith has two denotations: objective faith referring to the things we believe in and subjective faith referring to our believing act.</p>
<p>Faith can be illustrated in the following way. In photography there is always some scenery. Within the camera there is the film. Light is needed to expose the scenery to the film. There is also the need for the camera to &ldquo;click.&rdquo; When the camera clicks that means the camera was open to the light and the light is able to expose the scenery onto the film and produce a picture. This picture will be exactly the same as the scenery. The exposure causes a reaction, and that reaction fully illustrates our faith. Our faith is a reaction to the scenery of the entire New Testament. The New Testament tells us how Christ was God from the beginning, how as the Word He was incarnated to be a man, how He lived on this earth, how He died an all-inclusive death to solve all the problems and to release God&rsquo;s divine life, and how He resurrected to become a life-giving Spirit to enter into us. The New Testament also tells us how Christ ascended to the heavens, how He was glorified, enthroned, and made both Lord and Christ, and how he poured out Himself as the consummated Spirit upon all of us. It shows us that the Triune God&rsquo;s full salvation has been fully completed by seven major steps or processes which He has passed through: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, the breathing of the Spirit, ascension, and the outpouring of the Spirit. The New Testament also goes on to tell us that we are sinners and that we have to repent. Whosoever would repent and believe in Christ would be forgiven, reconciled, justified, and regenerated to have eternal life. This is the scenery of the New Testament.</p>
<p>When we preach the gospel, we are showing people this New Testament scenery. The more you show the audience this scenery in detail the better it is. When you are showing the scenery by the Word, the Holy Spirit works with the Word not only as the power but also as the light. As the audience listens to and hears the Word, the scenery is there and the Holy Spirit as the power and the light is also there. Suddenly there is an inward &ldquo;click&rdquo; in the ones we are speaking to. This click means repentance. This means they have opened themselves up a little bit and there is an exposure. That exposure issues in a reaction and this reaction is their faith. Now the scenery of the New Testament has been brought into their spirit, &ldquo;the film.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The faith in Galatians and in the other books of the New Testament equals the economy, the household administration, the dispensation of God. The truth is the contents, the reality, of the faith according to God&rsquo;s economy. Faith (subjective) is the response to the truth of the faith (objective), receiving and participating in the divine realities. Faith is produced by the showing of the New Testament scenery plus the power and the light of the Holy Spirit. Once faith is produced in you, it cannot be taken away. Even if you were to regret believing and were to decide not to believe anymore, this faith would still be in you. The proper way to receive the Spirit is by the hearing of faith.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:13 says, &ldquo;In whom you also, hearing the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.&rdquo; After hearing and believing, you are immediately sealed with the Holy Spirit. In other words, this verse also tells us the receiving of the Spirit is by believing. Faith is a reaction to the entire scenery of the New Testament. By this reaction we received the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BLESSING OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>In Galatians 3:14 Paul says, &ldquo;In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&rdquo; This verse tells us that the Spirit is the blessing of the New Testament gospel. This is the blessing promised by God to Abraham for all the nations of the earth (Gen. 12:3).</p>
<p>The context of 3:14 indicates that the Spirit is the blessing which God promised to Abraham for all the nations and which has been received by the believers through faith in Christ. &ldquo;The Spirit&rdquo; is the compound Spirit, and actually is God Himself processed in His Trinity through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension, for us to receive as our life and our everything. This is the focus of the gospel of God.</p>
<p>The physical aspect of the blessing God promised to Abraham was the good land (Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 17:8; 26:3-4), which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ (Col. 1:12). Since Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17), the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds to the blessing of the promised land. Actually, the Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God&rsquo;s bountiful supply for us to enjoy.</p>
<p>The Spirit in 3:14 is the consummation of the Triune God reaching us. This consummating and reaching Spirit is now the very reality of the Triune God as our blessing in the gospel. This is why after the Lord Jesus resurrected, He told His disciples to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19), immersing them into all that the Triune God is as their portion. This is a major point in the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST AND PUTTING ON CHRIST</h2>
<p>Galatians 3:27 says, &ldquo;As many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; Here is another crucial point, that is, we have been baptized into Christ, and as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. Now the Spirit as the blessing of the gospel is within us and the very Christ is upon us. Within us essentially, He is our inner life, and upon us economically, He is our clothing. He is our life and life supply that satisfies us within, and He is our clothing that beautifies us without. Essentially He is our life and life supply and economically He is our beauty.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SONSHIP</h2>
<p>In Galatians 4:4-7 is the crucial point of the sonship. These verses say, &ldquo;When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law, that He might redeem those under law, that we might receive the sonship. And because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father! So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, an heir also through God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s redemption is to bring us into the sonship of God that we might enjoy the divine life. God&rsquo;s economy is not to make us keepers of law, obeying the commandments and ordinances of the law, which was given only for a temporary purpose, but to make us sons of God, inheriting the blessing of God&rsquo;s promise, which was given for His eternal purpose. His eternal purpose is to have many sons for His corporate expression (Heb. 2:10; Rom. 8:19). Hence, He predestinated us unto sonship (Eph. 1:5) and regenerated us to be His sons (John 1:13). We should remain in the reality of His sonship that we may become His heirs to inherit all He has planned for His eternal expression, and should not be distracted to Judaism by the appreciation of law. The Triune God is producing many sons for the fulfilling of His eternal purpose. God the Father sent forth God the Son to redeem us from the law that we might receive the sonship. He also sent forth God the Spirit to impart His life into us that we might become His sons in reality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING FORMED IN US</h2>
<p>In Galatians 1 Christ is revealed in us (v. 16), in chapter two Christ is living in us (v. 20), and in chapter four Christ is being formed in us (v. 19). Christ was born into the Galatian believers, but not formed in them, when they were regenerated through Paul&rsquo;s preaching of the gospel to them the first time. Now the apostle travails again that Christ may be formed in them. To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ grown in us in full. Christ was first born into us, revealed in us, at our conversion, then lives in us in our Christian life, and will be formed in us at our maturity. This is needed that we may be sons of full age, heirs to inherit God&rsquo;s promised blessing, and mature in the divine sonship.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO WOMEN SYMBOLIZING TWO COVENANTS</h2>
<p>The last crucial point in chapter four is the two women symbolizing the two covenants (vv. 21-31). Hagar, the concubine of Abraham, symbolizes the old covenant, and Sarah, the wife of Abraham, symbolizes the new covenant. Hagar, the concubine of Abraham, symbolizes the law. Hence, the position of the law is that of a concubine. Sarah, the wife of Abraham, symbolizes the grace of God (John 1:17), which has the right position in God&rsquo;s economy. The law, like Hagar, brought forth children unto slavery like the Judaizers. Grace, like Sarah, brings forth children unto sonship; these are the New Testament believers. They are no longer under law but under grace (Rom. 6:14). They should stand in this grace (Rom. 5:2) and not fall from it (5:4).</p>
<p>The Jerusalem above is free, who is our mother (v. 26). This is a strong proof that the coming New Jerusalem will not be a physical city because it is our mother and it is free. I believe that the notes in the Recovery Version and the Life-study Messages are adequate to help you to take care of this crucial point. This point, in particular, is more than crucial for us to study.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BROUGHT TO NAUGHT FROM CHRIST</h2>
<p>Galatians 5:4-6 is the particular text for this crucial point. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;You have been brought to naught from Christ, you who are justified by law; you have fallen from grace.&rdquo; This verse says, firstly, that you have been brought to naught, to nothing, from Christ because you are justified by law, and secondly, you have fallen from grace. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;For we by the Spirit by faith eagerly expect the hope of righteousness.&rdquo; In this verse the Spirit and faith are in apposition. The Spirit is the faith and the faith is the Spirit. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith operating through love.&rdquo; In the book of Galatians Paul stresses continually the Spirit and faith.</p>
<p>The crucial point in these three verses is that we may be brought to nothing from Christ and that we may also fall from grace. To be brought to naught from Christ is to be reduced to nothing from Christ, deprived of all profit from Christ and so separated from Him (Darby&rsquo;s New Translation), making Him void of effect. To go back to the law is to become severed from Christ, to be brought to naught from Christ, which is to fall from grace.</p>
<p>It is quite possible for a believer to be brought to nothing concerning the enjoyment of Christ. These verses are on the enjoyment of Christ. To be brought to naught from Christ does not mean you will perish. It means that your enjoyment of Christ has been confiscated. If you go to other things such as the law or character improvement and do not cleave to Christ that you may enjoy Him all the time, you will be brought to naught from the enjoyment of Christ. That means you have fallen from grace. The Arminians may interpret this as a kind of perdition. They may say that since you have fallen from grace, you have lost grace, meaning that you have lost your salvation. But we know by the context that verse 4 does not mean that. To fall from grace means you lose the enjoyment of grace. Again, this crucial point has been fully and adequately covered in the footnotes of the Recovery Version and the Galatians Life-study Messages. It will help you to get into this material.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF WALK BY THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In Galatians 5 the last crucial point is the two kinds of walk by the Spirit. In 5:16 Paul says, &ldquo;But I say, walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.&rdquo; Galatians 5:25 says, &ldquo;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&rdquo; In these two verses Paul uses two different Greek words for walk. You must pay your full attention to the footnotes in the Recovery Version and the Life-study Messages on these verses.</p>
<p>The Greek word for walk in verse 16, <em>peripateo</em>, denotes the daily, ordinary, regular walk. The Greek word for walk in verse 25, <em>stoicheo</em>, denotes an official walk, a walk to carry out a certain commission. As we compare these two kinds of walks, we see that the second is more regulated than the first. In the second walk we need to walk like an army and keep in step, whereas in the first kind of walk we are free to walk about. However, both kinds of walk, the common, ordinary walk and the walking in line or in rank, are by the Spirit.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, every believer in Christ should have two kinds of walk by the Spirit. The first walk is our daily walk; the second is the walk in the divine rules and steps. As Christians, we are not those walking on earth without a purpose. We have been created by God and recreated and regenerated by Him with a definite purpose. Therefore, we must have the second kind of walk, a walk to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose and reach the goal of our life on earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SOWING UNTO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In Galatians 6 the first crucial point is the sowing unto the Spirit in verse 8. Sowing unto the Spirit is sowing for the Spirit. &ldquo;Unto&rdquo; means &ldquo;with a view to&rdquo; or &ldquo;for.&rdquo; To sow unto the flesh is to sow for the flesh, with the purpose of the flesh in view, fulfilling what the flesh covets. To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with the aim of the Spirit, accomplishing what the Spirit desires. Your life, your work, and your behavior should be considered as a sowing of seed. Whatever you do, whatever you are, and however you behave, you are sowing something. Since you are sowing something, you will eventually reap something. Do not think that to be angry with someone for a while is a small thing. Actually that is sowing. From that sowing, you will have a harvest. You have to sow, which means you have to behave, act, do things, and work, all the time with the Spirit as a view, as a goal to reach. This implies that you have to sow always by the Spirit with a view that you can reap the Spirit. If in all things you sow by the Spirit, along with the Spirit, and unto the Spirit, you will reap the Spirit as your harvest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CRUCIFIED TO THE RELIGIOUS WORLD</h2>
<p>Galatians 6:14 and 15, say, &ldquo;But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world. For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.&rdquo; These verses indicate that you must keep yourself on the cross towards the religious world. &ldquo;For&rdquo; in verse 15 shows that this verse is an explanation of the foregoing verse, and circumcision being a religious matter, indicates that world in verse 14 must be mainly the religious world.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GRACE WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The entire book of Galatians ends with 6:18&mdash;&ldquo;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.&rdquo; Because of the background of today&rsquo;s situation we have stressed again and again that the grace of our Lord Jesus is in our spirit. If we are going to experience the grace, to enjoy the grace, we must be in our spirit. We must exercise our spirit. We have covered all the points concerning the exercise of our spirit in the past, but when we cover the book of Galatians, we must stress this point and make this point a major, crucial point. All the Christians, including ourselves, have to learn all our days that by exercising our spirit we may really enjoy and realize the grace of Christ. Actually, the grace of Christ is Christ Himself.</p>
<p>The book of Galatians, no doubt, has more points than what we have given in this chapter. In this chapter I have set up a pattern to show you how to pick up the crucial points. When we are helping the saints to know the truth, we can never cover all the points. We just take those that are considered the most crucial to uplift the standard of the knowledge of the truth in the churches and with all the Lord&rsquo;s children.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH<br />
IN EPHESIANS</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to see the crucial points in Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the Ephesians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS TO THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:3 says, &ldquo;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.&rdquo; This particular, crucial point comprises verses 3 through 14 of chapter one. In this portion of the Word are the Father&rsquo;s selection and predestination, speaking forth God&rsquo;s eternal purpose (vv. 3-6), the Son&rsquo;s redemption, speaking forth the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose (vv. 7-12), and the Spirit&rsquo;s sealing and pledging, speaking forth the application of God&rsquo;s accomplished purpose (vv. 13-14). God&rsquo;s blessings to the church are comprised of the Father&rsquo;s being and doing, the Son&rsquo;s being and doing, and the Spirit&rsquo;s being and doing. The main thing that issues from this threefold blessing is the sonship. Ephesians 1:5 tells us that the Father has predestinated us unto sonship. The Father&rsquo;s selection and predestination are for sonship, are unto sonship. Sonship is the goal of His selection and predestination. The Son&rsquo;s redemption is also to bring forth the sonship, and the Spirit&rsquo;s sealing and pledging are for the purpose of sonship. Thus, the threefold blessing of the Triune God is for sonship, to produce the sonship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLE&rsquo;S PRAYER FOR THE CHURCH<br />
REGARDING REVELATION</h2>
<p>The Apostle Paul&rsquo;s prayer in Ephesians 1:15-23 is magnificent. Paul prays that we might have &ldquo;a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him&rdquo; (v. 17). Such a spirit is given to us by God that we may have wisdom and revelation to know Him and His economy. Verses 18 through 23 tell us that the eyes of our heart need to be enlightened that we may know three marvelous things: the hope of His calling, the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe (vv. 18-19). This magnificent prayer as a crucial point of the truth in Ephesians has been more than adequately covered in the footnotes of the Recovery Version and the Life-study Messages of Ephesians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEAD IN OFFENSES AND SINS</h2>
<p>Before we were saved, we were dead. &ldquo;Being dead&rdquo; (2:1) refers to the death of our spirit that pervades our entire being. Being dead in our offenses and sins, we &ldquo;once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit who now is operating in the sons of disobedience; among whom also we all behaved ourselves once in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest&rdquo; (2:2-3). &ldquo;This world&rdquo; refers to the satanic system composed of many ages. Hence, &ldquo;the age&rdquo; here refers to a part, a section, an aspect, the present and modern appearance of the system of Satan, which is used by him to usurp and occupy people and keep them away from God and His purpose. When we were dead in offenses and sins, we walked according to the age, the modern appearance, the present course of the world, the satanic system.</p>
<p>When we were dead in offenses and sins, we also behaved according to the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires not only of the flesh but also of the thoughts. Three evil things&mdash;the age of this world outside of us, the ruler of the aerial authority above and within us, and the lusts of our flesh in our fallen nature&mdash;dominated our life. From these evil things we have been saved to be the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING MADE ALIVE</h2>
<p>This crucial point is covered in 2:4-10. To make us alive is the initial step of God&rsquo;s salvation in life. Following this, God raised us up from the death position. From our standpoint we have been raised up from our death position one by one. But in God&rsquo;s view we were all raised up together, just as all the Israelites were raised up together from the death waters of the Red Sea (Exo. 14). The third step of God&rsquo;s salvation in life is to seat us together in the heavenlies. He not only raised us up from the death position, but He also seated us in the highest place in the universe. When we were dead, we were &ldquo;in the tomb.&rdquo; Now we are not in the tomb, but in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus. The heavenlies not only indicates the heavenly place, but also the heavenly nature, state, characteristic, and atmosphere. The sphere, atmosphere, condition, and reality which we are in now are heavenly.</p>
<p>Eventually, we become the masterpiece of God (2:10). Paul tells us in 2:10 that we are His workmanship. The Greek word for workmanship can also be translated into masterpiece. This Greek word is <em>poiema</em>, which means something which has been made, a handiwork, or something which has been written or composed as a poem. This is not only poetic writing, but also any work of art that expresses the maker&rsquo;s wisdom and design. We, the church, the masterpiece of God&rsquo;s work, are also a poem, expressing God&rsquo;s infinite wisdom and divine design. We, the church, as the masterpiece of God&rsquo;s work, are an absolutely new item in the universe, a new invention by God. We have been created by God in Christ through regeneration to be His new creation (2 Cor. 5:17). Our being made alive is so that we might become God&rsquo;s new creation, His masterpiece.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ABOLISHING OF THE ORDINANCES<br />
TO CREATE ONE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>This crucial point is covered in 2:11-22. Christ broke down the middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles by abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances. When He was crucified on the cross, all the ordinances were nailed there. The law spoken of in 2:15 is not the law of the moral commandments, but the law of the ritual commandments, such as the ordinances of circumcision, keeping the sabbath, and eating certain foods.</p>
<p>When Christ died on the cross, He not only dealt with sins, the old man, Satan, and the world; He also dealt with the ordinances. On the cross Christ abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances. Therefore, by His death on the cross, Christ dealt with five categories of things: sins, the old man, Satan, the world, and the ordinances. We cannot be all right until the ordinances have been dealt with. The ordinances, the different ways of living and worshipping, had to be abolished by Christ on the cross so that He could create in Himself the one new man.</p>
<p>The new man, which is the church, is corporate and universal. There are many believers, but there is only one new man in the universe. All the believers are the components of this one corporate and universal new man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIVERSAL BUILDING AND THE LOCAL BUILDING</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 2:20-22 is the revelation of the building in two aspects&mdash;the universal aspect and the local aspect. Universally the church is uniquely one, and the church in a particular locality is locally one. In verse 21 we see the universal aspect of the church: &ldquo;All the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord.&rdquo; Then in verse 22 we have the local aspect: &ldquo;You also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; Therefore, the holy temple refers to the universal aspect, and the dwelling place of God to the local aspect.</p>
<p>All the local churches are part of the universal church, not something in addition to it or apart from it. All the local churches added together equal the universal church. This means that apart from the local churches there is no universal church. Hence, the building of the local church is the building of the universal church. All the local churches have just one building. The church in Anaheim does not have one building, neither does any other church have one. However, our natural concept of the building is that there is a different building in each locality. In this universe there is just one building with a universal aspect and a local aspect. No matter how many churches there may be on earth, there is still just one building with these two aspects.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The first great crucial point in Ephesians 3 is the mystery of Christ (v. 4). The mystery of God in Colossians 2:2 is Christ; whereas the mystery of Christ is the church. God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God. Christ is also a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ to express Him, is the mystery of Christ. The church, which is mentioned in 3:10, is the mystery of Christ. In order to see the definition of the mystery of Christ, we need to study verses 3-11 of chapter three.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Apostle Paul preached, not the doctrines, but the riches of Christ. The riches of Christ are what Christ is to us, such as light, life, righteousness, and holiness. These riches are unsearchable and untraceable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ETERNAL ECONOMY OF GOD<br />
TO PRODUCE THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>This crucial point is in 3:9-11. To fully understand this crucial point you also need to study 1:9-11.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal economy is according to His hidden purpose. His purpose is to dispense Himself into His chosen people. Hence, there is the dispensation of the mystery of God. This mystery was hidden in God from the ages (that is, from eternity) and through all past ages, but now it has been brought to light to the New Testament believers.</p>
<p>The church is produced from the unsearchable riches of Christ as revealed in 3:8. When God&rsquo;s chosen people partake of and enjoy the riches of Christ, these riches constitute them the church, through which God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom is made known to the angelic rulers and authorities in the heavenlies. Hence, the church is God&rsquo;s wise exhibition of all that Christ is.</p><h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLE&rsquo;S PRAYER<br />
FOR THE CHURCH REGARDING EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s prayer in Ephesians 1 is a prayer for revelation. His prayer in chapter three is a prayer for experience. We need to experience Christ making His home in our heart, that is, Christ settling down within us. The prayer in chapter one ends with the church. In 1:22 Christ is head over all things to the church. The prayer in chapter three also ends with the church as an issue of our experience of Christ making His home in our hearts. We are eventually &ldquo;filled unto all the fullness of God&rdquo; (v. 19). In chapter one the church is the fullness of the One Who fills all in all (v. 23) and in chapter three the church is the fullness of God (v. 19). Both of Paul&rsquo;s prayers in chapters one and three of Ephesians are great crucial points. Paul&rsquo;s prayer in chapter three may take three or four meetings to be covered adequately. There is much material for you to study in the footnotes of the Recovery Version and in the Life-study Messages of Ephesians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASE OF OUR ONENESS</h2>
<p>In 4:1-6 is the keeping of the oneness of the Spirit and the base of our oneness. In exhorting us to safeguard the oneness (4:3), the Apostle Paul points out seven things as the base, the very foundation, of our oneness: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father. These seven ones are of three groups. The first three can be grouped together, the Spirit with the Body as His expression, and the Body related to the one hope. This Body, having been regenerated and being saturated with the Spirit as its essence, has the hope of being transfigured into the full likeness of Christ. The next three can also be grouped together, the Lord with faith and baptism, that we may be joined to Him. Then we have one God and Father, who is the Originator and Source of all. The Spirit as the Executor of the Body, the Son as the Creator of the Body, and God the Father as the Originator of the Body&mdash;all three of the Triune God are related to the Body. The third of the Trinity is mentioned first because the main concern here is the Body, and the Spirit is the essence of the Body. Then the course is traced back to the Son and then to the Father.</p>
 <h2 class="head1">THE ASCENSION OF CHRIST<br />
AND THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>Through His ascension, Christ gained many captives. &ldquo;He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men&rdquo; (4:8). &ldquo;Those&rdquo; were first the redeemed saints who were taken captive by Satan before they were saved by Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. In His ascension, Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan&rsquo;s captivity and took them to Himself. This indicates that He has conquered and overcome Satan, who captured them by sin and death. After rescuing them from Satan and death through His death and resurrection, Christ in His ascension made the rescued sinners themselves such gifts with His resurrection life and gave them to His Body for its building up. Through Christ&rsquo;s ascension many captives were made gifted persons, whom Christ gave to His church as the gifts for the building up of His Body. To fully enter into Paul&rsquo;s thought in this crucial point we need to study 4:7-16 with the help of the footnotes of the Recovery Version of Ephesians and the Life-study Messages.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>For this crucial point we need to study Ephesians 4:22-24 and Colossians 3:10-11. The new man has already been created and, by regeneration, has been born into our spirit. The need now is for our spirit to become the dominant part of our being. This means that our spirit mingled with the Spirit of God must become the spirit of our mind (4:23). If our spirit is the spirit of our mind, then all our living will be by the spirit. Whatever we do will be according to the spirit. This spirit of our mind will then become the renewing spirit. As we are renewed by this spirit, we put on the new man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEALING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
UNTO THE REDEMPTION OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:30 says, &ldquo;And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.&rdquo; The sealing of the Spirit has a goal, and this goal is the redemption of our body. From the day we receive the Spirit, the Spirit becomes not only a seal to us but a sealing. The Spirit&rsquo;s indwelling is a sealing and this sealing is still going on. It never stops because this sealing carries out a purpose to saturate our being with the divine element that we might be transformed and eventually conformed to the image of Christ. Then our body will be fully redeemed. The transfiguration of our body will not be an accident but a result of our being saturated with the Spirit by His sealing of us inwardly. Today the Holy Spirit is sealing within us. For this crucial point we also need to use the entire context of verse 30, namely, verses 25-32, to tell people what can grieve the Spirit. If you grieve the Spirit, you frustrate His sealing. He is now within us doing a sealing work, &ldquo;painting&rdquo; us with the divine element. We should not do something to frustrate His painting of Himself into our being. All the negative things listed in verses 25-32 of chapter four are frustrations to the sealing of the Spirit. These frustrations are a grieving. As long as your spirit does not feel happy about a situation, you have to realize that this is a grieving, and that grieving is a kind of frustration to the Spirit&rsquo;s sealing.</p><h2 class="head1">A WALK IN LOVE AND IN LIGHT</h2>
<p>The text for this crucial point is in Ephesians 5:1-15. Verse 2 tells us to walk in love, and verse 8 tells us to walk as children of light. As grace and truth are the basic elements in 4:17-32, so love and light (vv. 8, 9, 13) are the basic elements in the apostle&rsquo;s exhortation in 5:1-33. Grace is the expression of love and love is the source of grace. Truth is the revelation of light and light is the origin of truth. God is love and light (1 John 4:8; 1:5). When God is expressed and revealed in the Lord Jesus, His love becomes grace, and His light becomes truth. After we have, in the Lord, received God as grace and realized Him as truth, we come to Him and enjoy His love and light. Love and light are deeper than grace and truth. Hence, the apostle first takes grace and truth as the basic elements for his exhortation and then love and light. This implies that he wants our daily walk to grow deeper, from the outward element to the inward.</p>
<p>Love is the inner substance of God, whereas light is the expressed element of God. The inner love of God is sensible, and the outer light of God is visible. Our walk in love should be constituted of both the loving substance and the shining element of God. This should be the inner source of our walk. It is deeper than grace and truth. In studying this crucial point it will also help you to refer to the Life-study Messages and to note 53 in 1 John 1 (Recovery Version).</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO BE FILLED IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 5:18 to be drunk with wine is to be filled in the body, whereas to be filled in the spirit (our regenerated spirit, not God&rsquo;s Spirit) is to be filled with Christ (1:23), unto the fullness of God (3:19). To be drunk with wine in the body dissipates us, but to be filled with Christ, the fullness of God, causes us to overflow with Him in speaking, singing, psalming, and giving thanks to God (5:19-20) and to subject ourselves to one another (v. 21). The issue of our being filled in spirit is that we will have spirit-filled ethical relationships for the expression of the Body in the normal church life (v. 22&mdash;6:9). The proper daily life and family life is the issue of being filled in spirit. This crucial point is covered in 5:18&mdash;6:9.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GREAT MYSTERY&mdash;CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>This particular crucial point is covered in Ephesians 5:23-33. In his exhortation in chapter five, the apostle presents the church as the Bride of Christ. This aspect of the church reveals that the church comes out of Christ, as Eve came out of Adam (Gen. 2:21-22), that she has the same life and nature as Christ, and that she, as His counterpart, becomes one with Him as Eve became one flesh with Adam (Gen. 2:24). Christ and the church being one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17) as typified by the husband and wife being one flesh, are the great mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL WARFARE</h2>
<p>On the positive side, the church is portrayed in many ways in the first five chapters of Ephesians to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. On the negative side, the church is seen in chapter six as a warrior to defeat God&rsquo;s enemy, the Devil (vv. 10-20). To do this we need to put on the whole armor of God (v. 11).</p>
<p>To fight the spiritual warfare, we need not only the power of the Lord but also the armor of God. Our weapons do not avail, but God&rsquo;s armor, even the whole armor of God, does. The whole armor of God is for the entire Body, not for any individual member of the Body. The church is a corporate warrior, and the believers are parts of this unique warrior. Only the corporate warrior, not any individual believer, can wear the whole armor of God. We must fight the spiritual warfare in the Body, not individually. This crucial point is covered in verses 10 through 20 of Ephesians 6.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO LOVE THE LORD IN INCORRUPTION</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6:24 says, &ldquo;Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption.&rdquo; We all must ask ourselves what it means to love the Lord in incorruption. In 1 Timothy 1:17 Paul says that God is incorruptible, and in 2 Timothy 1:10 he says that the Lord &ldquo;nullified death, and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel.&rdquo; First Corinthians 15 tells us that in resurrection the corruptible things will become incorruptible (vv. 50-53). To love the Lord in incorruption means to love Him in the new creation. All the things of the old creation are corruptible. This is proved by Romans 8 where we see that the whole creation is groaning under the slavery of corruption (vv. 21-22). Everything of the old creation is corrupting. Only the new creation is not.</p>
<p>Ephesians 6:24 is a total conclusion of the entire book of Ephesians. In the six chapters of Ephesians Paul surely reveals to us the incorruptible things. Christ is incorruptible, the church is incorruptible, and all the positive items related to Christ and the church in chapters one through six are incorruptible items. We must love the Lord in these incorruptible things. This means we must love the Lord in the new creation and not in the old creation. We have to love the Lord according to the Father&rsquo;s predestination unto sonship. We have to love the Lord according to the Son&rsquo;s redemption. We have to love the Lord according to the sealing and the pledging of the Spirit. We have to love the Lord according to the hope of God&rsquo;s calling, according to the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and according to the surpassing greatness of His power which made Christ the Head of all things to the church. We have to love the Lord according to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection which made us alive, resurrected us, and seated us in the heavens. We have to love the Lord according to all the incorruptible things revealed in the six chapters of Ephesians. We must love the Lord in incorruption.</p>
<p>Many times we love the Lord in the way of corruption. We should not love the Lord in a natural way, in the way of the old creation, but in the new creation. When some Christian groups wanted to raise money, they put out a list of those who gave, with the ones giving the most at the top of the list. This is to love the Lord in corruption. What is it to love the Lord in incorruption in giving? Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing (Matt. 6:3). To give in the way of making a show is in the old creation. As the kingdom people, our righteous deeds should be kept secret as much as possible (Matt. 6:4, 6, 18). What we do in our spirit, under the heavenly rule to please solely our Father, must not be interfered with by our flesh lusting for man&rsquo;s glory. The kingdom people&rsquo;s living is by the Father&rsquo;s divine life according to their spirit. Thus, they are required to do good things in secret, not in public. Any public exhibition does not correspond with the mysterious, hidden nature of the divine life. In Matthew 6:4 the Lord says that our alms should be in secret, and our Father who sees in secret shall repay us.</p>
<p>To do things in the way of not making a display or a show of oneself is in the new creation. Sometimes when a brother testifies, he testifies because he likes to make a show or a display. When his testifying gets many &ldquo;amens,&rdquo; he feels glorious. This is to function in corruption because it is in the old creation. When you are testifying, you must remain on the cross. When you are giving a testimony, try the best not to make a show. The Lord Jesus told us that the Pharisees always liked to make a show. Whatever they did, they did to be seen by men (Matt. 23:5a). The Lord also told us that whenever we fast, &ldquo;do not be as the hypocrites of a sad countenance; for they disguise their faces so that they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly I say to you, they have their reward. But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you may not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret shall repay you&quot; (Matt. 6:16-18). This shows us that we should not make a show in anything we do. If we do, we are serving in corruption.</p>
<p>To love the Lord in incorruption is to love Him in the regenerated, renewed, and indwelt spirit. If you do anything in your flesh, that is in corruption. I believe that when Paul was writing the book of Ephesians and was giving a conclusion to his writing, he was filled with the feeling that whatever he taught in the preceding six chapters was all incorruptible. Then he concluded that we have to love the Lord in incorruption.</p>
<p>Many Christians love the Lord concerning the church in corruption. The organization and some of the practices of the denominations are corruptible things, since they are something of the old creation. If one loves the Lord and yet serves the Lord in the denominational way, this is in corruption.</p>
<p>To love the Lord in incorruption we have to love the Lord according to everything revealed in Ephesians. At the end of Ephesians 1 is the church which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all. This surely does not refer to any religious organization. The church is incorruptible, but the religious organizations are corruptible. To stand on the proper ground is something incorruptible. To take any other ground other than that of the unique oneness of the Body of Christ kept and expressed in each local church at its locality (Rev. 1:11) is to take the ground of corruption. We should not love the Lord in corruption; we should love Him in a pure way, in the way of incorruption that could stand forever.</p>
<p>Paul concluded his Epistle according to its contents because whatever is revealed in his Epistle to the Ephesians is incorruptible. At the conclusion he charged his recipients to love the Lord in incorruption, which means to love the Lord according to what he revealed in the entire book. Paul does not conclude his Epistle by only saying, &ldquo;Grace be with everyone.&rdquo; The condition for receiving the grace is that we love the Lord in incorruption. For the proper church life we need to love the Lord in incorruption, that is, in a condition which is incorruptible. For the church our love toward the Lord must be incorruptible, immortal, and imperishable.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH<br />
IN PHILIPPIANS AND COLOSSIANS</h1>
<p>In this chapter we shall consider the crucial points in the books of Philippians and Colossians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PHILIPPIANS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Bountiful Supply<br />
of the Spirit of Jesus Christ<br />
for Living and Magnifying Christ</h2>
<p>The first crucial point in this book is found in 1:19-21. The Spirit here is not merely the Spirit of God before the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, but the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit with divinity, after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, compounded with the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, human living under the cross, crucifixion, and resurrection. According to verses 20 and 21, this bountiful supply is for the believers to live Christ and to magnify Christ. The living and magnifying of Christ is our daily salvation. We need to be saved daily by experiencing Christ to live Him and to magnify Him by the all-inclusive, bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Letting the Mind of Christ Be in Us</h2>
<p>Chapter two of Philippians contains several crucial points. The first is found in verse 5 which says, &ldquo;Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; This verse is similar to Colossians 3:16 which says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.&rdquo; Something that can dwell in you must be living. The word there is personified; it is the word as a person. We must let this Person dwell in us. For the mind which was in Christ Jesus to be in us means that this mind is something living. To translate this phrase as &ldquo;take the mind of Christ,&rdquo; or &ldquo;possess the mind of Christ&rdquo; would be to lose the proper significance of this verse. The mind of Christ actually is just Christ Himself. However, Paul did not say, &ldquo;Let Christ be in you.&rdquo; Rather, he said to let this mind, this particular mind which was in Christ Jesus, be in you.</p>
<p>We must not forget that the subject of the book of Philippians is the experience of Christ. This book firstly tells us in chapter one that we need the all-inclusive bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Furthermore, this bountiful supply is for us to live Christ and to magnify Christ. The means for us to live Christ is the bountiful supply of the Spirit. Following this, chapter two gives us another point concerning our experience of Christ. The second means for us to experience Christ is to let the living mind which was in Christ Jesus be in us. There is in the universe a living Mind, a mind which Paul calls &ldquo;this mind.&rdquo; This living Mind is waiting for you to open up yourself and let Him in. It is not simply that you take Christ as a pattern to imitate Him. The point here is that the Christ whom we experience is very practical and available. His mind especially is so living and active. Just as our minds are so active, the mind of Christ is even more active.</p>
<p>In Paul&rsquo;s writings he sometimes refers to Christ&rsquo;s meekness and Christ&rsquo;s forbearance (2 Cor. 10:1). However, meekness and forbearance are not personified. But here His mind is likened to a person. You cannot say that the meekness or the forbearance of Christ dwell in you. Paul does not use this expression. Rather he says to let this mind which is in Christ Jesus be in you. This means practically speaking the Person of Christ is manifested in His mind. We must take the practical Christ. He is living, and His mind is living and waiting for us to open to Him. We must open ourselves to let such a mind be in us.</p>
<p>Once we let the living mind of Christ be in us, this mind will transform us. Ephesians 4:23 says that we need to be renewed in the spirit of our mind, and Romans 12:2 says, &ldquo;Be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; The renewed mind, the mind with the spirit, is the mind indwelt by the mind of Christ. This mind which was in Christ is a transforming mind, a renewing mind. To have the mind of Christ in us is for our transformation. We do not merely follow Christ&rsquo;s steps outwardly, but we let Christ&rsquo;s living mind be in us inwardly to transform us. By this we will live a life that is a mingled life, a life of divinity mingled with humanity.</p>
<p>This portion of Philippians 2 shows us a mingled life. Christ is revealed here to be both God and man. The life lived by this God-man is a mingled life. It is not an exchanged life but two lives in one union. He was God yet He did not live in the form of God. Rather He took the form of a slave and was found in fashion as a man. Such a one was God living in humanity with the form of a slave in the fashion of a man. Christ did not simply spend one year in the fashion of a man. For thirty-three and a half years He was found in the fashion of a man. His living was His work. In Philippians 3:9 Paul desired to &ldquo;be found in Him.&rdquo; In chapter two Christ was found in the fashion of a man, and in chapter three Paul desired to be found in Him. This refers to his living.</p>
<p>When we have the living mind of Christ, this mind will transform us. Our transformed form will simply be His image. Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we are being transformed into the same image. Whatever Christ lived will be lived out by us. Christ was humble, and spontaneously we will be the same, because He will be the mind acting and living in us to transform us. Spontaneously we will live a life which is a grafted life, two lives mingled together as He had. When He was being found in the fashion of a man, He lived a life which was the divine life and the human life. The life of God and the life of man became the mingled life of the God-man. Now we repeat His history by living a mingled life of two natures, both human and divine. His life was both divine and human, and our life is human and divine. In principle, our life is the same as His.</p><h2 class="head2">The Triune God&rsquo;s Operating in the Believers</h2>
<p>The second crucial point for our experience of Christ in Philippians 2 is found in verse 13. This verse says, &ldquo;For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;for&rdquo; in verse 13 connects this verse to verse 12, and the phrase &ldquo;so then&rdquo; in verse 12 connects this portion to verses 5 through 11, which tell us to let the living mind of Christ be in us to transform us that we may live a mingled life of God and man. By this we live Christ and magnify Christ. Based on this, verse 12 says, &ldquo;So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only as in my presence, but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.&rdquo; Some may use this verse to argue that salvation is not by faith but by works. However, salvation here is not the eternal salvation from eternal perdition. Salvation here as in chapter one is our daily salvation. To work out our salvation is to live out our salvation with fear and trembling.</p>
<p>According to verse 14 this daily salvation saves us from murmurings and reasonings. These two small &ldquo;gophers&rdquo; require a very powerful, practical, daily salvation. Without this strong and practical daily salvation we will all remain in murmurings and reasonings. Therefore, we need a divine operation. Verse 13 says that it is God who operates in you. God here is not simply God the Father, but rather is the processed Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. It is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit who operate in us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure. When we let the living mind of Christ be in us, we live a life that is a mingled life, and we will experience the Triune God operating in us. He is operating in us both the willing and the working. The willing is a decision within, and the working is an action without to carry out the decision within.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Holding Forth the Word of Life as Luminaries</h2>
<p>The third crucial point in chapter two is found in verses 15 and 16 which tell us that we are to hold forth the word of life as luminaries. As the luminaries hold forth the light of the sun, we as luminaries of Christ hold forth the word of life. Holding forth strongly implies speaking. If we do not speak the word of life, how could we hold it forth? If we let Christ&rsquo;s living mind be in us doing His transforming work, then we can experience the Triune God operating in us. Right away we become the luminaries of Christ speaking His word of life. This is the experience of Christ in chapter two.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Counting All Things Refuse<br />
for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ</h2>
<p>Chapter three verse 8 speaks of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. Paul does not say the excellency of Christ, but the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. To experience Christ we firstly need the knowledge of Christ. We must know Him. This chapter stresses very much the knowledge of Christ. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection.&rdquo; Therefore, to know Him is crucial to our experience of Him. We cannot experience Him without knowing Him. The knowledge of Christ is excellent, and this knowledge is even an excellency. Paul counted everything refuse, rubbish, dog food, for the excellency of knowing Christ. Most readers of Philippians 3 consider the excellency here to be the excellency of Christ the Person. However, this is not correct. We must stress here the knowing of Christ. Christ Himself stressed that He would build His church not upon Himself as the rock but upon the revelation concerning Him. The revelation is for knowing. Without the revelation concerning Christ surely we could not know Him. We need this revelation to know Christ. When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, Christ was there, having passed through all the major steps, perfected, completed, and consummated in full. However, Saul of Tarsus had no knowledge concerning this Christ. On his way to Damascus the day dawned and the light came. He began to see the vision, the revelation concerning Christ (Acts 26:19). By seeing this vision he gained a knowledge, and that knowledge became to him a treasure, an excellency. For this knowledge which he treasured, he counted everything as refuse, dregs, rubbish, filth, which is thrown to the dogs, the dog food or dung.</p>
<p>Among all the things which Paul counted dung the first was the religious or Judaic things. In verses 5 and 6 he gives us a list of his Judaic status. He counted not only these things as loss but also all things, including rank, position, fame, and wealth. The loss of all things to Paul was the loss not only of his Jewish status but of everything.</p><h2 class="head2">To Know Christ, the Power of His Resurrection,<br />
and the Fellowship of His Sufferings</h2>
<p>Verses 10-11 say, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, if by any means I may attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead.&rdquo; To know Christ here is by experience&mdash;to have the experiential knowledge of Him, to experience Him in the full knowledge of Him. The power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is His resurrection life which raised Him from among the dead. The fellowship of His sufferings is the participation in Christ&rsquo;s sufferings by being conformed to His death. The result of this experience is that we attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead, the outstanding resurrection, the extra-resurrection, which will be a prize to the overcoming saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Transfiguration of Our Body</h2>
<p>Philippians 3:21 speaks of the transfiguration of our body, the conformation of our body to the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory. The transfiguration of our body is the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23). This is the conformation of our body to the form of the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory. In chapter one to experience Christ is a matter of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. No doubt, this is a matter in our spirit. In chapter two to experience Christ is a matter in our mind. Our mind should be indwelt by Christ&rsquo;s mind. Murmurings and especially reasonings are a matter of the mind. To think the same thing in 2:2 is also a matter in the mind. In chapter three to experience Christ in the final stage is to experience Him in our body. When we experience Him in our body, that will be the consummation of the experience of Christ, the transfiguration, the redemption of our body. This will be the conformation of our natural body to the heavenly form of the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory. Our entire being will be brought into glory by experiencing Christ. Philippians 1 through 3 reveals our progressive experience of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Life Full of Forbearance but without Anxiety</h2>
<p>Philippians 4:5 and 6 say, &ldquo;Let your forbearance be known to all men. The Lord is near. In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.&rdquo; Near in verse 5 means near in space and time. Spacewise, the Lord is nigh to us, ready to help. Timewise, the Lord is at hand, coming soon. The forbearance mentioned in 4:5 is not an ordinary forbearance or an ethical forbearance. It is the forbearance of Christ, the spiritual attribute or virtue of Christ. If we exercise such forbearance, we shall not be anxious. A life full of forbearance but without anxiety was the subject of messages 56 through 62 of the Life-study of Philippians.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Empowering of Christ</h2>
<p>Philippians 4:8 says, &ldquo;For the rest, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is righteous, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is well-spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things.&rdquo; The first six items in verse 8 are summed up in virtue and praise. Virtue and praise are the totality, the result, and issue of these six foregoing things. In verse 13 Paul says, &ldquo;I can do all things in Him who empowers me.&rdquo; &ldquo;All things&rdquo; does not refer to healing the sick, raising the dead, or performing certain miracles. However, this is the thought of many Christians. Perhaps some from a Pentecostal background would apply verse 13 to the performing of certain miracles. &ldquo;All things&rdquo; in verse 13 refers to the all things mentioned in verse 12 and the virtues listed in verse 8. The application of verse 13 is limited by the context of verses 8 through 13. By the empowering of Christ we can live a contented life (vv. 11-12) and be true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of.</p>
<p>If you put all the points from these four chapters together you will see something very meaningful. First we experience Christ in our spirit by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ in our spirit. Then we experience Christ in our mind by letting Christ&rsquo;s mind indwell our mind and do the transforming work. This saves us primarily from murmurings and reasonings. Third, we experience Christ consummately in chapter three in that our body will be transfigured, conformed to the glorious form of His body. Eventually, we are persons in Christ who empowers us to live out every kind of virtue. This is to live Christ, to magnify Christ in His virtues.</p>
<p>The six virtues mentioned in verse 8 are actually the image of God. God created man in His image, that is, in His attributes. The law came to describe what kind of God He is and to show us the main attributes of God. God is love, light, holiness, and righteousness. These four things are God&rsquo;s attributes which constitute the image of God. That man was made in the image of God means that he was made in the form of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. These six items, whatever is true, honorable, pure, righteous, lovely, and reputable or well-spoken of, are in those four divine attributes of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. This is the real virtue, and this is the praise which is the very expression of our processed Triune God. This is to live Christ and this is to magnify Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">COLOSSIANS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Portion of the Saints</h2>
<p>The first crucial point of the truth in Colossians is found in 1:12. This verse says, &ldquo;Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.&rdquo; &ldquo;Portion&rdquo; in this verse may also be translated into &ldquo;lot.&rdquo; Lot refers to the allotment of the good land in the Old Testament. Each of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel received an allotment of the good land. The good land as a whole is the portion of God&rsquo;s chosen people. This good land was an all-inclusive type of Christ. Today as God&rsquo;s chosen people, the saints, we all have Christ as our portion. To understand this point we must read from verse 12 to the end of this chapter. This portion of the Word describes the different aspects of this lot. First, this portion is the image of the invisible God (v. 15). Second, He is the first item, the Firstborn of all creation (v. 15). As to His divinity He is the image of the invisible God. In His humanity He is the first item of God&rsquo;s creation. He is also the Firstborn in resurrection (v. 18), the Firstborn of the new creation. He is the One in whom all the fullness of the divine Trinity dwells (v. 19). This One must have the preeminence, the first position in everything. Because He is the One who has the preeminence in all things, He redeemed and reconciled all things to God. This wonderful, all-inclusive Christ is our portion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ in Us the Hope of Glory</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:27 says, &ldquo;To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; This mystery full of glory among the nations is Christ in us. Christ in us is mysterious as well as glorious. Christ is the mystery which is full of glory now. This glory will be manifested to its fullest extent when Christ returns to glorify His saints (Rom. 8:30). Hence, it is a hope, the hope of glory. Christ Himself is also this hope of glory. Today He is our life, and when He comes back we shall be manifested with Him in glory (3:4).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Mystery of God</h2>
<p>The first crucial point in chapter two is found in verse 2. At the end of 2:2 Paul speaks of the &ldquo;full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.&rdquo; The book of Ephesians is on the mystery of Christ, which is the church, the Body (Eph. 3:4). This book is on the mystery of God, which is Christ, the Head. God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God. It is crucial that we know Christ not only as our Savior and Lord, but also as the mystery of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Embodiment of the Fullness of the Godhead</h2>
<p>In Colossians 2:9 Paul says, &ldquo;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; This means that Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, that the fullness of the Triune God dwells in Christ in a bodily form. Fullness refers not to the riches of God but to the overflow, the expression, of the riches of God. What dwells in Christ is not only the riches of the Godhead, but the expression of the riches of what God is. Godhead refers to deity, which is different from divinity in Romans 1:20. This strongly indicates the deity of Christ. The fact that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily means that it dwells in Him in a way that is both real and practical. This implies the physical body which Christ put on in His humanity, indicating that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ as One who has a human body. Before His incarnation, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the eternal Word, but not bodily. Since He became incarnate, clothed with a human body, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in a bodily way, and in His glorified body (Phil. 3:21) now and forever it dwells.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Walk in Him</h2>
<p>In 2:6 and 7 Paul says, &ldquo;As therefore you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him.&rdquo; According to chapter one, the One in whom we are to walk is the portion of the saints, who according to His divinity is the image of God, and in His humanity is the Firstborn of the old creation and the Firstborn of the new creation. He is the One in whom the fullness of the Godhead dwells to have preeminence in all things. He is the One by whom all things were redeemed and reconciled to God (1:20). Furthermore, according to chapter two He is the mystery of God and the embodiment of God. In such a One we have to walk.</p>
<p>As we have received Christ, we should walk in Him. To walk is to live, to act, to behave, and to have our being. We should walk, live, and act in Christ as our portion (1:12), that we may enjoy His riches, just as the children of Israel lived in the good land, enjoying all its rich produce.</p>
<p>By walking in Him we will be rooted and built up in Him. To walk in such a One is to be rooted in Him and to be built up in Him. To be rooted is to have downward growth, and to be built up is to have upward growth. A tree grows in two directions. The roots of the tree grow downward, and the branches grow upward. We Christians must be like a tree. Our growing up depends upon our growing down. The branches can never go up without the roots going down.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ as the Body of All the Shadows</h2>
<p>In 2:16 and 17 Paul says, &ldquo;Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All these items of the ceremonial law are a shadow of the spiritual things in Christ, which are the things to come. The body in verse 17, like a man&rsquo;s physical body, is the substance. The rituals in the law are a shadow of the real things in the gospel, like the shadow of a man&rsquo;s body. Christ is the reality of the gospel. He is all the good things in the gospel. The book of Colossians unveils such an all-inclusive Christ as the focus of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Holding the Head to Grow with the<br />
Growth of God</h2>
<p>In 2:19 Paul refers to &ldquo;holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, by means of the joints and bands being supplied and knit together, grows with the growth of God.&rdquo; Holding the Head that we may grow with the growth of God is related primarily to His subjective death. Verse 20 says, &ldquo;If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why as living in the world do you subject yourself to ordinances.&rdquo; The elements of the world are the ordinances, primarily the Jewish ordinances, but also the ordinances of the Greeks. These ordinances are related to &ldquo;do not handle, do not taste, do not touch&rdquo; (v. 21). We must hold the Head that we may grow with the growth of God, with the increase of God as life. If we live such a life, surely we will experience His subjective death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Our Life</h2>
<p>Colossians 3:3 and 4 say, &ldquo;For you died, and your life has been hidden with Christ in God. When Christ our life is manifested, then you also shall be manifested with Him in glory.&rdquo; Because our life (not our natural life, but our spiritual life which is Christ) has been hidden with Christ in God, who is in the heavens, we should no longer care for things on the earth. God in the heavens should be the sphere of our living. With Christ we should live in God. In God, Christ, not ourself, our soul, is our life. This life is now hidden, but it will be manifested. Then we shall be manifested with this life in glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Letting the Word of Christ Dwell in Us</h2>
<p>In 3:16 Paul says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.&rdquo; First, we have Christ as our life, then we have His living Word personified as His Person dwelling in us. The word of Christ is the word spoken by Christ. In His New Testament economy God speaks in the Son, and the Son speaks not only directly in the Gospels, but also through His members, the apostles and prophets, in Acts, in the Epistles, and in Revelation. All these may be considered as His word.</p>
<p>In this passage the infilling of spiritual life that overflows in praising and singing is related to the Word, whereas in its parallel passage, Ephesians 5:18-20, the infilling of spiritual life is related to the Spirit. This indicates that the Word and the Spirit are identical (John 6:63b). A normal Christian life should be one that is filled with the Word so that the Spirit may bubble from within us in lauding melodies, melodies of praise.</p>
<p>The word of Christ includes the entire New Testament. We need to be filled with this word. This means that we should allow the word of Christ to dwell in us, to inhabit us, to make home in us. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;dwell&rdquo; literally means to be in a house, to inhabit. The word of the Lord must have adequate room within us so that it may operate and minister the riches of Christ into our inner being.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Pray that the Door<br />
May Be Opened for the Word</h2>
<p>In 4:3 Paul says, &ldquo;Praying at the same time for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, because of which also I have been bound.&rdquo; In chapter three the last crucial point is to let the word of Christ dwell in us. The crucial point in chapter four, the last crucial point of the entire book, is to pray for the door to be opened for the word. The open door for the word is related to the divine speaking. In this matter I would recommend two books for you to prayerfully read&mdash;<em>The Home Meetings&mdash;The Unique Way for the Increase and Building Up of the Church</em> and <em>The Divine Speaking.</em></p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH<br />
IN 1 AND 2 THESSALONIANS</h1>
<p>If you have ever studied 1 and 2 Thessalonians with adequate attention, you could see it is hard to separate these two books. I believe these two books were written by Paul under the same kind of burden. In our fellowship, we want to pick up three main, crucial points in these two Epistles. These two books as well as 1 and 2 Corinthians, Romans, and Galatians, were written very early in Paul&rsquo;s ministry while the churches were still in their youth. In the beginning of the church life, there was not much degradation. Some corruption could be seen in Corinthians, but still there was not much degradation yet. Because of this there was not the need of the revealing of the deeper things which are found in Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Hebrews, and 1 and 2 Timothy.</p>
<p>We do find, however, some very crucial points in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles to the Thessalonians concerning the Christian life. These two books are on a holy life for the church life. The saints in those days were living a church life with the expectation of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. We have to realize that all the early apostles, including Paul, thought the Lord would come back in their time. History tells us that the early believers in the first century all had this thought. As a result, they were waiting for the Lord to come. Today if we received a cable or telephone call from Taipei that a certain brother was coming, we would get ourselves ready to welcome him when he came. The thought of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming was very prevailing in all the early apostles and disciples. In 1 and 2 Thessalonians we can see that the saints were eagerly waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back.</p>
<p>According to 1 Thessalonians 4, Paul received a revelation that the Savior would not come back as fast as they had expected (vv. 13-18). In 2 Thessalonians 2:2 Paul told the saints not to be alarmed that &ldquo;the day of the Lord is present.&rdquo; Paul told them that before the Lord&rsquo;s coming, the man of sin, the Antichrist, must be manifested (2 Thes. 2:3). Unless the man of sin is revealed, the saints should not believe that the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is imminent. Keep in mind that the two books to the Thessalonians were written under an atmosphere in which the believers all had the thought that the Lord was coming immediately, so they were waiting for the coming One.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPECTING THE SAVIOR&rsquo;S RETURN AND<br />
LIVING A SANCTIFIED LIFE</h2>
<p>The first crucial point in these two Epistles is expecting the Savior&rsquo;s return and living a sanctified life. This point is clear from reading the concluding verses of each of the first three chapters in 1 Thessalonians. The last verse of chapter one, verse 10, says, &ldquo;And to wait for His Son from the heavens, whom He raised from among the dead&mdash;Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath which is coming.&rdquo; This verse says that the early Christians were waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, for the Savior&rsquo;s return. First Thessalonians 2:19 says, &ldquo;For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting? Are not even you, before our Lord Jesus at His coming?&rdquo; The Thessalonians were all expecting the return of the Savior, and the apostle who served them was also expecting that they could be his joy and crown at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. Then the last verse of chapter two, verse 20, says, &ldquo;For you are our glory and joy.&rdquo; At His coming the saints would be Paul&rsquo;s glory and joy. First Thessalonians 3:13, the last verse of chapter three, is quite crucial&mdash;&ldquo;That He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.&rdquo; The ending of the first three chapters of 1 Thessalonians clearly indicates that those early believers were expecting the Savior&rsquo;s coming back by living a sanctified life.</p>
<p>Relating to living a sanctified life, 1 Thessalonians 4:3-4 says, &ldquo;For this is the will of God, your sanctification...that each one of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor.&rdquo; Verse 7 continues, &ldquo;For God has not called us for uncleanness but in sanctification.&rdquo; Finally, the entire book of 1 Thessalonians ends with a wonderful word. First Thessalonians 5:23 says, &ldquo;And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; In this first crucial point we have to realize that the proper church life depends on a life of expecting the Savior&rsquo;s return and living a sanctified life. Even though we are not the early believers, we still have to keep the principle that the church life depends on us living a sanctified life always with the expectation that our dear Lord is coming. You have to develop this crucial point according to the many footnotes in the Recovery Version and the appropriate Life-study Messages, stressing what a sanctified life is.</p><h2 class="head1">A SPIRITUAL LIFE FOR OUR FULL SANCTIFICATION</h2>
<p>The second crucial point in these Epistles is at the end of 1 Thessalonians 5&mdash;a spiritual life for our full sanctification. The items listed in verses 12-24 of chapter five show the believers&rsquo; cooperation in living a spiritual, separated, sanctified life, and God&rsquo;s operation in sanctifying and preserving the believers. We believers should live a spiritual life for our full sanctification. This spiritual life is mainly in verses 16-22. In these verses are seven points of the spiritual life: always rejoice (v. 16), unceasingly pray (v. 17), in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you (v. 18), do not quench the Spirit (v. 19), do not despise prophecies (v. 20), prove all things; hold fast what is good (v. 21), and finally, abstain from every form of evil (v. 22). These are the seven items that constitute a spiritual life.</p>
<p>As Christians we should abstain, stay away, and even escape, not only from evil, but also from the form, the appearance, of evil. For a male to talk with a female alone in a private, dark room is not sinning, but there is a form of evil there. To pass through a bar is not sin, but if every night you pass through the bar, that is a form of evil. You should abstain from that, not only for others&rsquo; sake, but even for your own sake.</p>
<p>If you walk around a deep well five inches from its opening, you may say you are just taking a walk. But you may fall into the well and be seriously hurt. If you walk this close to the well day after day, eventually you will fall into it. To have a talk by oneself with a member of the opposite sex in a private, dark room is running a risk. If you are going to abstain from evil, you first have to abstain from its form. Suppose you are peeling off the skin of a peach. You may say, &ldquo;I am not going to eat a peach.&rdquo; If you keep peeling off the skin of peaches for half an hour, though, eventually one peach will get into your stomach. You should not remain there peeling the skins off of peaches, if you do not want to eat one. In like manner, we should abstain from the form of evil, so we do not fall into the evil itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&rdquo; in 5:23 indicates the continuation of the seven items listed in verses 16-22 which constitute the spiritual life for you to be wholly sanctified. &ldquo;And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is He who calls you, who also will do it&rdquo; (5:23-24). The first seven items form the spiritual life and the last item is the whole, full sanctification. This is the spiritual life for the full sanctification.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SALVATION IN SANCTIFICATION</h2>
<p>In 2 Thessalonians the most crucial verse is 2:13 which says, &ldquo;But we ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.&rdquo; We all need to have a deep impression concerning the expression&mdash;&ldquo;salvation in sanctification.&rdquo; This is one of the strongest expressions in the entire New Testament. Martin Luther paid his full attention to justification by faith. The Southern Baptists have nearly made a slogan of the phrase&mdash;&ldquo;saved by grace.&rdquo; The expressions &ldquo;justification by faith&rdquo; and &ldquo;saved by grace&rdquo; are crucial and very common among Christians, especially in the past five hundred years. But such a term &ldquo;salvation in sanctification&rdquo; probably has never been picked up by the Lord&rsquo;s children. Since Paul uses this term, we need a revelation and realization of the truth embodied in it.</p>
<p>God chose us from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit. God chose us before the foundation of the world in eternity past. The word &ldquo;unto&rdquo; in Greek means with a view to or in view of. From the beginning, from eternity past, God&rsquo;s selection was with a view to reach a certain goal. God&rsquo;s selection has a goal and that goal is salvation in sanctification of the Spirit. Salvation in sanctification means that if you are going to enjoy and participate in this salvation, you must be in the sanctification of the Spirit. From the day you believed, the day you received salvation, the Spirit began to work on you. Whatever work He is doing on you is to sanctify you. Your daily salvation is in two things: the sanctification of the Spirit and the belief of the truth.</p>
<p>In eternity, God selected us with a goal to reach. That goal is His salvation, and His salvation is in two things: in the Spirit and in the belief, the faith, of the truth. God&rsquo;s salvation as a whole includes salvation from eternal perdition and also a daily salvation from many things. Due to the fall, human life has become a kind of suffering. Do you believe that before the fall Adam was sweating? Actually, sweating came from the fall (Gen. 3:19). Sweating is a curse. There is some enjoyment in the human life, but in the human life the debits are bigger than the credits. If a couple does not have children they may long to have children. Not to have any children is a curse. After they get a child, however, they begin to worry about this child. This child becomes the cause of much anxiety. Even the homes we live in become a problem to us. Many things in our home need to be maintained and repaired periodically. This is why we need salvation in our daily life. In Philippians Paul tells us that we even need salvation from murmuring and reasoning (2:14). We need a daily salvation.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation also includes a salvation to come that will save us from the great tribulation of three and a half years. Luke 21:36 warns us to be &ldquo;watchful, at every time beseeching, that you may prevail to escape all these things which are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.&rdquo; This world will end in a great tribulation of three and a half years. During this time the entire universe will suffer calamity after calamity. Satan will do his best to damage mankind, and God will do His best to judge rebellious mankind. The outpouring of the seven bowls in Revelation 15 and 16 will contain God&rsquo;s ultimate fury in His judgment upon the earth for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. Also, during the great tribulation the Antichrist and his false prophet will do much destroying and will cause the Lord&rsquo;s chosen people to suffer greatly. It will be a dreadful thing to live on the earth during the great tribulation. We need a salvation from the sufferings in the great tribulation (Rev. 3:10).</p>
<p>In addition to salvation from eternal perdition, salvation from the many things in our daily life, and salvation from the great tribulation, we also need the salvation of our soul (1 Pet. 1:9) which will save us from being judged at the judgment seat of Christ with a dispensational punishment (2 Cor. 5:10). If we are not saved in our soul, we will suffer the Lord&rsquo;s discipline in the coming age. We all need a salvation from the dispensational judgment in the kingdom age. God&rsquo;s salvation as a whole delivers us from these fourfold sufferings.</p>
<p>We need to thank Him that we have been rescued, saved, from eternal perdition. As believers our eternal destiny is not the lake of fire. We need to ask ourselves, however, about the salvation we are enjoying in our daily life and about the salvation from the coming tribulation and from the discipline in the kingdom age. Will we enjoy the reward or will we receive the discipline, the punishment, in the next age? We all need to get into the depths of this truth. This is God&rsquo;s complete and full salvation and this salvation is the goal unto which God selected us. God&rsquo;s selection from eternity was with the intention that we might enjoy such a full salvation, not just the initial salvation through the redemption of Christ. Christ&rsquo;s redemption saves us from eternal perdition, but after that, in the daily salvation, you need the sanctification of the Spirit and the belief of the truth.</p>
<p>We also need to consider what salvation in belief of the truth or in faith of the truth is. The word rendered &ldquo;belief&rdquo; in 2 Thessalonians 2:13 may also be rendered &ldquo;faith&rdquo;. This verse shows us that the daily salvation is a matter altogether in the Spirit and in the Word. Sanctification is in the Spirit and is also in belief of the truth, that is, in the Word. In John 17:17 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.&rdquo; Many Christians may know the sanctification of the Spirit, but not many know the sanctification in the Word. The holy Word is very consistent. To be sanctified in the belief or the faith of the truth corresponds with the Lord&rsquo;s word in John 17:17. We must be balanced. Our daily salvation is not only in the Spirit, but also in the Word as the truth.</p>
<p>If we had never discovered all these higher truths revealed in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, but we had only trusted in the so-called Spirit in a superstitious way, how much sanctification could we enjoy? We would only have sanctification as a term. In order to receive the sanctification of the Spirit we must go to the Word. From the age of the Reformers to this present day, the Lord has recovered much in His Word. The more truth that has been recovered in His Word, the more that we enjoy the sanctification. The more we see the truth, the more the reality is revealed in the New Testament, the more we enjoy sanctification. This is why we have to speak the Word. We must not merely speak the shallow Word but speak the deeper Word. If we would speak all the crucial points of the truth in Romans to the saints and all the saints would learn to speak these crucial points of the truth, there would be an atmosphere in all the churches of enjoying the sanctification of the Spirit to a great extent. This is not only sanctification in the Spirit but also in the Word.</p>
<p>We need to consider the Lord&rsquo;s word in John 17:17. He asked the Father to sanctify us in the truth and declared that the Father&rsquo;s word is truth. If we do not know the Word, how could the Father sanctify us? There would be nothing with which God could sanctify us. But when we pray with the rich Word, the profound Word, the high Word, we will surely be sanctified with something solid. The more we would pray over the twenty-one crucial points of the truth in the book of Romans, the more we would enjoy the sanctification. The Spirit always goes with the Word.</p>
<p>In 2 Thessalonians 2:13 the Spirit is in pair with the truth. Salvation in sanctification is not only of the Spirit but also in the belief of the truth. Just as electricity needs a wire to convey it, so the Holy Spirit needs the Word as its wire. If there is no Word, there is no divine electricity. If you only have the wire without the electricity, that is empty. If you only have the electricity with no wire, the electricity does not work. If you only have the Word in letters without the Spirit, that is empty. But if you want to have the Spirit without the Word, this cannot be done. The Spirit and the truth embodied in the Word are a pair. The very salvation which is the goal of God&rsquo;s eternal selection is in two things: in the sanctification of the Spirit and also in the faith of the truth.</p>
<p>To be sanctified in the belief, in the faith, of the truth is very subjective. Faith is the reaction, the substantiation, of the unseen scenery (the truth). Now we do not only have the knowledge of the truth, but also the faith of the truth. We have the reaction to the truth we have come to know objectively. We must learn all the twenty-one crucial points in Romans. When we learn these truths and we hear these truths, we will have the hearing of faith (Gal. 3:2, 5). The scenery (truth) and the seeing (faith) are objective to the camera (us). But when the light (the Spirit) brings the scenery to the film (our spirit) within the camera, both the seeing and the scenery become subjective to it. When the light brings the scenery to the film there is a click within the camera. That &lsquo;click&rsquo; within us which brings the scenery of the truth into our spirit is faith. This is the faith of the truth.</p>
<p>Now we do not only have the truth as some objective scenery, but we have the faith of the truth. In this faith of the truth we are being saved. Our daily salvation is in this faith, in this reaction, to the scenery of the truth. We all are short of the vision that comes from the faith of the truth. We need to pray for ourselves and for all the brothers. All the problems come from the shortage of a clear and adequate vision. The Bible may be in our hand, but it may also be veiled to us in the same way it was veiled to many of the Jews when they read the Old Testament (2 Cor. 3:15). In 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul says that he and his co-workers were beholding the Lord with an unveiled face. They were beholding Him as a mirror without any veils, without any covering. All the leading ones in the churches bear a great responsibility and I do believe all of us will be held responsible for the churches at the judgment seat. In light of the judgment seat we need to be in fear and trembling that we would delay the saints or veil them in any way. We need to expose the truth to the saints and minister the proper truth, the proper scenery, into them. The Lord may ask us at the judgment seat, &ldquo;as a leader in the church were you taking the veils away from My people? Did you bring them to the best scenery in My divine revelation of the sixty-six books of the Bible?&rdquo; If the Lord would check with us in such a way what would we say?</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal selection is toward this goal of complete salvation. This salvation is to be carried out in the sanctification of the Spirit and in the &ldquo;reaction&rdquo; to the truth. It is carried out in our subjective apprehension of the truth, not just our mere knowledge of the truth. We must realize, though, that we must have the knowledge first. Without the scenery to react to, what could you do? First, you must have the objective scenery. While we are studying the Word prayerfully and laboring over it, the Spirit works with the Word. As we open to the Lord the light will come in, and there will be a reaction, &ldquo;a click,&rdquo; which will bring the divine scenery of the truth into our spirit. This reaction is faith. In this way, we get the divine scenery not outwardly, but inwardly in our spirit, the film. On your spirit there is an impression of the divine scenery, and this divine scenery becomes yours. This is the full realization of the way to enjoy God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p>
<p>First, we need the knowledge of the truth. We need somebody to speak the truth. Romans 10:17 tells us, &ldquo;Faith comes out of hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.&rdquo; We have to preach, to speak, the Word. This preaching, this speaking, of the Word produces the hearing, and the hearing will produce the reaction within others. This reaction is the &ldquo;click&rdquo; of faith impressing whatever you speak into the spirits of the ones you are speaking to. There will be a photograph impressed upon their spirit and this will become their property, their possession, for them to enjoy. This is the proper understanding of this particular crucial point in 2 Thessalonians. We all need to be delivered from skating on the surface of the divine truth, and we need to cooperate with the Lord by laboring together with Him to dive into the depths of the truth of His marvelous New Testament economy.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH<br />
IN 1 AND 2 TIMOTHY,<br />
TITUS, AND PHILEMON</h1>
<p>Now we come to the crucial points of the truth in 1 and 2 Timothy. First Timothy unveils to us God&rsquo;s dispensation, His New Testament economy, concerning the church. The purpose of 2 Timothy is to inoculate the church against the decline. On the one hand, an inoculation is positive, and on the other hand, it is negative, because it indicates that we need to be protected from a disease that could kill us. Paul&rsquo;s purpose in writing 2 Timothy was to inoculate the church against decline, degradation, and deterioration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FIRST TIMOTHY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Economy in Faith</h2>
<p>The first crucial point in 1 Timothy is God&rsquo;s economy in faith. In 1:3-4 Paul says, &ldquo;Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently, nor to occupy themselves with myths and unending genealogies, which give occasion for questionings rather than God&rsquo;s dispensation which is in faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s dispensation (v. 4) or God&rsquo;s household economy (Eph. 1:10; 3:9) is God&rsquo;s household administration to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people, that He may have a house, a household to express Himself, which household is the church, the Body of Christ (3:15). The apostle&rsquo;s ministry was centered upon this economy of God (Col. 1:25; 1 Cor. 9:17), whereas the different teachings of the dissenting ones were used by God&rsquo;s enemy to distract His people from this. This divine economy must be made fully clear to the saints in the administration and shepherding of a local church.</p>
<p>Faith in the New Testament bears two denotations, an objective denotation and a subjective denotation. The dispensation of God is a matter in faith, that is, in the sphere and element of faith, in God through Christ. Faith may be in contrast to questionings. God&rsquo;s economy to dispense Himself into His chosen people is not in the natural realm, nor in the work of law, but in the spiritual sphere of the new creation through regeneration by faith in Christ (Gal. 3:23-26). By faith we are born of God to be His sons, partaking of His life and the divine nature to express Him (1 John 5:11-12; 2 Pet. 1:4). By faith we are put into Christ to become the members of His Body (Eph. 5:30), sharing all that He is for His expression. This is God&rsquo;s dispensation according to His New Testament economy carried out in faith. God&rsquo;s economy is a matter in this kind of faith.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Full Knowledge of the Truth</h2>
<p>From God&rsquo;s economy in faith we come to 2:4, which says that God desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth. No other verse besides 1 Timothy 2:4 in the entire New Testament tells us that God wants all men to enter into two things: His salvation and His truth. God desires all men not only to be saved but also to have the full knowledge of the truth. Truth means reality, denoting all the real things revealed in the New Testament, which are mainly Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the Body of Christ. Every saved person should have a full knowledge, a complete realization of these things. By such a verse we can realize where we should be. We should be in the full knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>We should realize that God from the beginning has wanted all men to be saved, and for all these saved ones to come to the full knowledge of the truth. We should endeavor, spend our energy, our mind, and our time, to get into the full knowledge of the truth. This is the word to all the believers, not just to the leading ones. All the believers should come to the full knowledge of the truth. No doubt there is a terrible shortage of those who have come to the full knowledge of the truth. We all should endeavor to be in the full knowledge of the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Function of the Church</h2>
<p>In chapter three the crucial point of the truth is the function of the church in verses 15 and 16. In these verses the church is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, and the manifestation of God in the flesh. The church functions as the house and household of the living God for His move on the earth, as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, bearing the divine reality of Christ and His Body as a testimony to the world, and becomes the continuation of Christ&rsquo;s manifestation of God in the flesh. This is the great mystery of godliness&mdash;Christ lived out of the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh!</p><h2 class="head2">The Nourishing Words<br />
and the Exercise unto Godliness</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 4:6-8 there are two important matters, the nourishing words and the exercise unto godliness. To minister Christ to others first requires ourselves to be nourished with the words of life concerning Christ. Being nourished is for growth in life, differing merely from being taught, which is a matter of knowledge. Having been nourished with Christ, we shall then have Christ as the food, the life-supply, the nourishing words, to minister to others.</p>
<p>Godliness is Christ lived out of us as the manifestation of God. This very Christ is today the Spirit dwelling in our spirit (Rom. 8:9-10; 2 Tim. 4:22). Hence, to exercise ourselves unto godliness is to exercise our spirit to live Christ in our daily life.</p>
<p>It is of crucial importance that we exercise ourselves unto godliness. Inwardly we need nourishment, and outwardly we should have godliness. From within we should be nourished with Christ, and then we should have a living which is the expression of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Healthy Words and the Teaching<br />
according to Godliness</h2>
<p>In 6:3 there are two kinds of words: the words of the Lord Jesus which are the healthy words and the teaching according to godliness. The words of our Lord Jesus Christ are words of life (John 6:63); hence, healthy words. The healthy words of the Lord are the source of the teaching according to godliness. When the Lord&rsquo;s words of life are taught, particularly in certain aspects, they become the teaching according to godliness. The living words of the Lord always bring forth godliness&mdash;a life that lives Christ and expresses God in Christ. This is on the positive side.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Desire to Be Rich</h2>
<p>Another crucial point is found in 6:9 and 10: &ldquo;But those who resolve to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge men into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all evils, which some having aspired after have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.&rdquo; The resolve mentioned here is related to the strong desire to be rich. This is the love of riches, not the possession of them, that leads the avaricious into temptation. Some are actually rich; some are rich in their desire. This evil desire ruins and destroys them. Ruin here implies destruction, and destruction implies perdition, both temporal and eternal. Those who resolve to be rich fall into a snare, as into a net, and also into many foolish and harmful lustful desires, which cause men to drown or sink into ruin or destruction. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;aspired after&rdquo; in verse 10 means craved for, longed for. Those with this craving have wandered away from the faith; they have been led astray from the contents of our belief, from the faith of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Man of God Laying Hold on the Eternal Life</h2>
<p>In contrast to the man of riches desiring to be rich in 6:9 and 10 is the man of God laying hold on the eternal life in verses 11 and 12: &ldquo;But you, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, meekness. Fight the good fight of the faith; lay hold on the eternal life to which you were called and have confessed the good confession before many witnesses.&rdquo; A man of God is one who partakes of God&rsquo;s life and nature (John 1:13; 2 Peter 1:4), thus being one with Him in His life and nature (1 Cor. 6:17) and thereby expressing Him. This corresponds with the mystery of godliness, which is God manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16). We should not be men of riches wandering away from the truth that is revealed in the New Testament. Rather we should be men of God laying hold on the eternal life.</p>
<p>In 2 Timothy 1:1 Paul said he was &ldquo;an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Paul was an apostle established by the Lord according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus. This is the eternal life. Paul was not an apostle according to letters, or ordinances, or ordination, but according to the promise of life. He enjoyed eternal life in his apostolic ministry.</p><h2 class="head1">SECOND TIMOTHY</h2>
<p>Second Timothy is an inoculation against the decline of the church. The way to inoculate the churches against their decline is by teaching the truth. By teaching the truth the degraded churches can be brought back. Because we are still under the degradation of the church, there is much need of the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fanning the Teaching Spirit into Flame</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 1:5-7 says, &ldquo;Having been reminded of the unfeigned faith in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded dwells also in you. For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gift that the Lord had given to Timothy, according to the context of 1 and 2 Timothy, was probably the teaching gift (1 Tim. 4:14, 11, 13, 16). Teaching is altogether not a miraculous thing. Teaching is a matter of life, and life is a matter of our spirit. Thus, the gift of God Timothy needed to fan into flame was the gift of teaching. He needed to fan the teaching gift into flame. Timothy needed to teach. What is needed to inoculate the church against the decline, the degradation, is not a miraculous gift such as healing, but the sound, sober teaching by exercising one&rsquo;s regenerated spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;for&rdquo; at the beginning of verse 7, &ldquo;For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind,&rdquo; indicates that verse 7 is an explanation of verse 6. Thus, the gift of God in verse 6 should also be considered as the spirit given by God. Verse 6 refers to the gift of God, the spiritual ability, and verse 7 tells us what God has given&mdash;a spirit of power, love, and a sober mind. The spirit in this verse is our human spirit, regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit (John 3:6, Rom. 8:16). To fan into flame the gift of God is related to our regenerated spirit. Probably in the entire New Testament, verse 7 is the unique verse that fully develops our human spirit. &ldquo;Of power&rdquo; refers to our will, &ldquo;of love&rdquo; to our emotion, and &ldquo;of a sober mind&rdquo; to our mind. This indicates a strong will, a loving emotion, and a sober mind have very much to do with a strong spirit for the exercise of the gift of God which is in us.</p>
<p>Such a spirit of power and love with a sober mind is for teaching. We have to fan such a teaching spirit into flame. I feel that this point fits in our present situation. We all should fan our teaching spirit into flame. Fan the teaching spirit of power, of love, and of a sober mind. If you do not have a sober mind you will teach nonsensically. You need a very sober mind to apprehend all the truth. Then you can teach with power and with love.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Holding a Pattern of Healthy Words</h2>
<p>The next crucial point is in 1:13. A pattern of healthy words is an example. The word in verse 12 is a pattern, an example, of healthy words. To hold a pattern of healthy words means to live by the healthy words. Paul&rsquo;s intention in this section was to encourage and strengthen Timothy to not live in cooperation with the degradation but to live in another way. To live another way, in spite of the degradation of the church, is to be nourished with the healthy words. Then you yourself, your living, and your daily life will be a pattern of the healthy words.</p>
 <p>Now we have to apply this to our own experience. We should not just pass on these crucial points to others. Rather we should live these crucial points in spite of the environment of this age, in spite of the trend of today&rsquo;s Christianity, and even in spite of the world situation. Today&rsquo;s world situation is altogether concerning how to become rich, yet we should live in another way. This other way is to all the time be nourished with the healthy words. Then we will hold the healthy words in our living as a pattern. Paul was such a person. Paul lived such a pattern in front of Timothy. Therefore, Paul charged him to keep this pattern. All the saints should hold a pattern of the healthy words.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Empowered in the Grace</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 2:1 and 2 say, &ldquo;You therefore, my child, be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus, and the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also.&rdquo; Today we need to be empowered in grace, which is the processed Triune God given to us or dispensed into us for our enjoyment, to commit the healthy words we have experienced to faithful men who will be competent to teach the same healthy words to others also. We are to be empowered in this grace not to do miracles, but to commit the healthy words we have enjoyed to faithful men to produce many competent teachers, whose speaking will inoculate the church against the decline.</p>
<p>Being empowered in the grace will issue in you being a teacher (2:2), a soldier (v. 3), a contender (v. 5), a farmer (v. 6), a carpenter (v. 15) to cut the word of God with no bias, and a vessel unto honor (v. 21).</p><h2 class="head2">A Vessel unto Honor</h2>
<p>The crucial point in 2:18-22 is a vessel unto honor. Honorable vessels are of both the divine nature (gold) and the redeemed and regenerated human nature (silver). These, like Timothy and other genuine believers, constitute the sure foundation to hold the truth.</p>
<p>As vessels unto honor, we need to pursue the spiritual things with the callers of the Lord (2:22). To call on the Lord out of a pure heart is to name &ldquo;the name of the Lord&rdquo; (2:19) in our prayer and praise to Him. The Lord&rsquo;s seekers must be those who call on His name. Today those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart are found in His recovery. Thank the Lord that we are with those who call on Him out of a pure heart. With such believers we may pursue the virtues of righteousness, faith, love, and peace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Man of God with the Breath of God</h2>
<p>In 3:14-17 is a man of God with the breath of God. The Scripture, the Word of God, is the breath of God. God&rsquo;s speaking is God&rsquo;s breathing. Hence, His word is spirit (John 6:63), <em>pneuma,</em> or breath. Thus, the Scripture is the embodiment of God as the Spirit. The Spirit is therefore the very essence, the substance, of the Scripture, just as phosphorus is the essential substance in matches. We must strike the Spirit of the Scripture with our spirit to catch the divine fire.</p>
<p>As the embodiment of God the Spirit, the Scripture is also the embodiment of Christ. Christ is God&rsquo;s living Word (Rev. 19:13), and the Scripture is God&rsquo;s written word (Matt. 4:4). This Scripture makes the man of God complete and equips him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching the Word in Season and out of Season</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 4:2 says, &ldquo;Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season.&rdquo; In the original text the New Testament has no chapter divisions. Therefore verses 1 and 2 of chapter four are a continuation of 3:14-17. The word in 4:2 is the word of the Bible, comprised of what Timothy learned both of Paul and of the Old Testament (3:14-15). In caring for a local church, especially in a time of the church&rsquo;s decline, the preaching of the word is vital. In 3:14-17 God&rsquo;s speaking is His breathing. We should be men of God with the breath of God. Our reading of the Scripture is our inhaling of God&rsquo;s breath. God is breathing and we are inhaling. Then we are able to preach the word in season and out of season. Our preaching is our exhaling.</p>
<p>Physically, we breathe in season and out of season, without any choice. Harvesting may be in season or out of season, but breathing is not. Even eating and drinking may be at certain times, but breathing is in season and out of season because it must take place all the time. Our preaching should be like our breathing, our exhaling, in season and out of season, which means opportunely or inopportunely whether the opportunity is convenient or inconvenient, whether we are welcome or unwelcome.</p>
<p>Today we have so many diamonds of the truth, yet many times we do not speak. We should be today&rsquo;s Timothys, the ones charged to commit all the rich deposit of the truth to the faithful ones, making them competent speakers to go out to speak the truth in season and out of season, anytime and anywhere. This is our heavenly breathing. Every day we should inhale God&rsquo;s breath, and every day we should exhale by speaking. This will subdue today&rsquo;s situation in which many are devoid of the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Deliverance from the Earthly Kingdom<br />
into the Heavenly Kingdom</h2>
<p>In 4:18 Paul says, &ldquo;The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto His heavenly kingdom.&rdquo; In verse 6 Paul was expecting his imminent martyrdom for his Master: &ldquo;For I am already being poured out, and the time of my departure is at hand.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s martyrdom was an evil thing. Yet Paul says that the Lord will deliver him from every evil work. The Lord would deliver Paul from every evil work, but the Lord would not do this miraculously. When Paul was martyred, he was bold. That was something marvelous but not miraculous. He was not delivered from being martyred.</p>
<p>The Lord would deliver Paul to His heavenly kingdom. The heavenly kingdom here is different from the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 5&mdash;7. The kingdom of the heavens there denotes the reality of the divine kingdom. The heavenly kingdom in verse 18 is the kingdom of their Father (Matt. 13:43), the kingdom of My Father (Matt. 26:29), the kingdom of Christ and of God (Eph. 5:5), and the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (2 Peter 1:11), which will be a reward to the overcoming saints. It equals the crown of righteousness in 4:8, and is an incentive to the believers to run the heavenly course.</p>
<p>Paul knew that he was going to be martyred by the earthly kingdom, the earthly Roman empire, and that he would be rejected, killed, and cut off from the earthly kingdom. Yet, he also had the assurance that the Lord would deliver him into a heavenly empire, the heavenly kingdom. Therefore, he suffered martyrdom with no miraculous rescue. This indicates that in Paul there was no thought of something miraculous, but instead his thought was full of the spiritual, divine reality. As followers of the Lord Jesus Christ we should not expect the Lord to do something miraculous for us. But we have the full right to claim that the Lord has to do spiritual things, divine things, and heavenly things for us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Human Spirit and the Divine Grace</h2>
<p>The last point is in 4:22: &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.&rdquo; You have to join, or combine this point with fanning the teaching spirit into flame (1:6) and being empowered in the grace (2:1). This verse combines those two verses. In each of these verses the main items are our spirit and grace.</p>
<p>Second Timothy, which gives instruction on how to confront the degradation of the church, strongly stresses our spirit. In the beginning it emphasizes that a strong, loving, and sound spirit has been given to us by which we can fan the gift of God into flame and suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God and the Lord&rsquo;s life-imparting grace (1:6-10). In the conclusion it blesses us with the emphasis of the Lord being with our spirit that we may enjoy Him as grace to stand against the down current of the church&rsquo;s decline and to carry out God&rsquo;s economy through His indwelling Spirit (1:14) and equipping Word (3:16-17).</p>
<p>In the grievous days during the worsening degradation of the church, what is needed is the eternal grace of God, which was given to us in eternity (1:9) and is appropriated by us in this age. This grace, which is in the indestructible life, is nothing less than Christ the Son of God, who is the very embodiment of the divine life, dwelling and living in our spirit. We need to exercise this spirit to enjoy the riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8) as the sufficient grace (2 Cor. 12:9). Thus we may live Him as our godliness (1 Tim. 4:7-8) for the building up of the church as a testimony of Christ, bearing all the divine realities according to God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TITUS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Washing of Regeneration<br />
and the Renewing of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Titus is actually a continuation of 1 and 2 Timothy. In Titus, for our present need, I would only cover one crucial point in 3:4-7&mdash;&ldquo;But when the kindness and love to man of our Savior God appeared, not by works in righteousness which we have done but according to His mercy, He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, that, having been justified by the grace of that One, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.&rdquo; The washing of regeneration, the renewing of the Holy Spirit, the grace, the heirs, and the hope of eternal life all comprise a crucial point.</p>
<p>Verse 5 says God saved us. Whenever we talk about God&rsquo;s salvation, we generally would not think of the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit. We do not have this kind of idea or concept. The basic concept of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to make us a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17), and the way God makes us a new creation is to work Himself into our being by the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Regeneration in Titus 3:5 is not the same Greek word as in 1 Peter 1:23. John 3 tells us the fact of regeneration, but the word regeneration is not used there. The word regeneration is used in the real sense of being born of God by Peter in his first Epistle. He tells us that we have been regenerated through the incorruptible seed, which is the living word of God. The word translated &ldquo;having been regenerated&rdquo; in 1 Peter 1:23 means having been born again. This second birth is not merely to have an outward change, but a change by life, with life, and in life. Regeneration is altogether a matter of life and always brings in a kind of washing.</p>
<p>Then this washing does some kind of restoring work, but this restoring work does not transpire in the physical part of our being. When we were regenerated, something divine was imparted into our spirit to make our spirit alive. This is surely a kind of restoration, but this restoration is altogether unrelated to our physical body. It is altogether a matter that transpires in our spirit to make our dead spirit alive by the divine life imparted into it. The very imparted divine life was the factor to enliven our dead spirit. The regeneration in our spirit brought in a washing by the divine life as the washing water. The divine life coming into our spirit to make our dead spirit alive washes away the dead things, the dead elements. This restores our dead spirit, but has nothing to do with our physical being.</p>
<p>After this washing, something continues to go on&mdash;the renewing of the Holy Spirit. The renewing of the Holy Spirit is the continuation of the washing of the restoration in our spirit. This is the way through which God saved us. God has saved us, yet this saving is still going on because it is a saving through the washing, which is continued by the renewing. The washing is the restoration in our spirit, and the renewing is by the Holy Spirit continuously.</p>
<p>Verse 7 tells us &ldquo;that, having been justified by the grace of that One, we might become heirs.&rdquo; Thus far, we have not become heirs yet. At the most, we have become children of God. In ancient Rome, a child had to grow up to a certain age, probably twenty-one, so that he would be qualified and equipped to be the heir. In Romans 8 we are told that we are children, then heirs (v. 17). At our regeneration we became God&rsquo;s children, but we have not become heirs yet. We are on the renewing way to becoming heirs.</p>
<p>We become heirs according to the hope of eternal life, which we have gained and by which we became children of God. This eternal life we are enjoying brings in a hope to inherit the divine inheritance. When you are enrolled in graduate school, your being enrolled brings you a hope to graduate from graduate school. In like manner, when you were regenerated you received eternal life, and this eternal life brings you a hope that you may become an heir.</p>
<p>Your enrolling in graduate school brings you a hope to graduate. Your graduation is not a certainty and you may fail. The hope of your enrolling is graduation. Enrolling is not the hope, but enrolling brings in the hope. Our spiritual graduation is our maturity in life, and our maturity in life is our glorification. This is fully mentioned and defined in Romans 8 (vv. 17, 30). Glorification will be our graduation, and this means that we have to be renewed, which is another term for being transformed. The renewing of the Holy Spirit is the transforming work of the Spirit to transform us into His image, from glory to glory (2 Cor. 3:18). Transformation is the way to enter into glorification. Although many Christians love the world and are indulging in worldly pleasures, they think they will be glorified automatically. When the Lord returns, however, many Christians will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10) and assigned by the Lord with a certain amount of discipline or dispensational punishment (Matt. 25:30).</p>
<p>When we were regenerated, we were restored in our spirit, and God put Himself within us as the renewing Spirit. This Spirit continues or follows the washing of regeneration to renew us bit by bit every day, every morning, every evening, and minute by minute in every aspect of our daily life. In everything, everywhere, and at every time He is renewing us. By this renewing we are being gradually brought from one degree of glory to another into glorification. Glorification, which is like the blossom of a carnation, is our graduation. In that graduation we will surely be heirs. We have been born sons, but we will be heirs through the long procedure of being renewed unto glorification. When we are completely renewed unto glorification, that will be our graduation. By that time, we will have become heirs to inherit what God promised as a reward in the coming kingdom. This is the right understanding of the Bible concerning our salvation. God saved us and yet His saving is still going on by the renewing, the transforming work of the Spirit. God&rsquo;s saving will be completed by the last step of glorification.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PHILEMON</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Believers&rsquo; Equal Status<br />
in the New Man</h2>
<p>Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty in the arrangement of the New Testament canon, the book of Philemon was placed as a conclusion of the three foregoing books, 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus. In this book the major point, which is more than crucial, is the believers&rsquo; equal status in the new man. This short Epistle serves the special purpose of showing us the equality in eternal life and divine love of all the members in the Body of Christ. In the semisavage age of Paul the life of Christ had annulled, among the believers, the strong institution of slavery. Since the sentiment of the love of the Christian fellowship was so powerful and prevailing that the evil social order among fallen mankind was spontaneously ignored, any need for institutional emancipation was obviated. Because of the divine birth and living by the divine life, all the believers in Christ had equal status in the church, which was the new man in Christ, with no discrimination between free and bond (Col. 3:10-11). This is based upon three facts: 1) Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross has abolished the ordinances of the different ways of life for the creation of the one new man (Eph. 2:15); 2) we all have been baptized into Christ and made one in Him without any difference (Gal. 3:27-28); and 3) in the new man Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:11). Such a life with such a love in equal fellowship is well able to maintain good order in the church (in Titus), carry out God&rsquo;s economy concerning the church (in 1 Timothy), and stand against the tide of the church&rsquo;s decline (in 2 Timothy). It is of the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty that this Epistle was positioned after the three preceding books in the arrangement of the New Testament.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH<br />
IN HEBREWS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">AN INTRODUCTION TO HEBREWS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God Speaking in Son</h2>
<p>The real subject of the book of Hebrews is God speaking in the Son. In other words, the whole book is the Son speaking God. God speaking in the Son means that the Son speaks God. The Son is the High Priest (8:1), and the aspect of the High Priest as the Son is speaking God. His being the Mediator of a better covenant speaks God (8:6). His being superior to the angels speaks God (1:4). His being superior to Moses (3:3), Joshua (4:8), and Aaron (5:4-6) speaks God. Whatever He is speaks God, and the entire book of Hebrews is the Son&rsquo;s speaking of God or God speaking in the Son.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1:1-2a says, &ldquo;In many portions and in many ways, God, having spoken of old to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in Son&rdquo; (lit.). &ldquo;In Son&rdquo; is the literal translation from the Greek text. No article between &ldquo;in&rdquo; and &ldquo;Son&rdquo; indicates that God and Son are not two separate Persons. God and Son are one. He is God but He speaks in Son. I am Witness Lee but when I speak, I speak &ldquo;in brother.&rdquo; Witness Lee and &ldquo;brother&rdquo; are one. It is not merely Witness Lee speaking, but Witness Lee &ldquo;in brother&rdquo; speaking. &ldquo;Witness Lee&rdquo; is not my qualification to speak. &ldquo;Brother&rdquo; is my qualification to speak. God, in the last days, spoke in Son. God did not speak anything merely as God, but He spoke everything in the New Testament in Son. This is why the Son is called the Word. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God&rdquo; (John 1:1). The Word is for speaking. Eventually, His title is the Word of God in Revelation 19:13.</p>
<p>God speaks in Son and the Son speaks by what He is. Whatever He is is His speaking. He is Jesus. Jesus is His speaking. He is Christ. Christ is His speaking. He is a man, and this man is His speaking. He is a slave, and this slave is His speaking. He is a carpenter, and this carpenter is His speaking. He spoke Matthew 5, 6, and 7. He spoke John 14, 15, and 16, and spoke in His prayer in John 17. He spoke a lot by words, but He spoke even more by what He was. The entire four Gospels were His speaking, either by word directly or by what He was. The entire four Gospels are God&rsquo;s speaking in Son. Whatever He did, whatever He spoke, whatever He worked, and whatever He behaved was altogether His speaking. The Son&rsquo;s speaking is God&rsquo;s speaking in Son. This is a crucial point which we all must realize.</p>
<p>The Hebrew believers may have thought the Son&rsquo;s speaking stopped when He went to the heavens. This speaking, however, is still going on. If we did not have Hebrews in the Bible, we might think that the Son&rsquo;s speaking stopped when He ascended to heaven.</p>
<p>Hebrews and Revelation were the two main books of the seven books which were not recognized as part of the divine revelation until A.D. 397. (The other five were James, 2 and 3 John, 2 Peter, and Jude.) The Nicene Creed was made in A.D. 325, and by that time Hebrews and Revelation, which both refer to God&rsquo;s speaking in Son in the heavens, were not yet recognized as Scripture. This shows the subtlety of the enemy. It was in Carthage, North Africa in A.D. 397 that these two books with the other five were fully recognized to complete the twenty-seven books of our present New Testament. Without these two books we could only realize that God spoke in Son while He was on the earth. Acts does not tell us what the ascended Christ is doing in the heavens. Without Hebrews and Revelation it would be hard for us to know anything concerning the speaking of God in Son in the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Good Word of God<br />
and the Word of Righteousness</h2>
<p>In the Son&rsquo;s speaking God or in God speaking in Son there are two categories of the word: the good word of God, that is, the word of the beginning of the Christ, and the word of righteousness. Hebrews 6:1 says, &ldquo;Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ.&rdquo; The beginning of today&rsquo;s educational system is kindergarten. This may be likened to the stage of the word of the beginning of the Christ which is only good as milk for babes (5:12-13). Paul continues in 6:1&mdash;&ldquo;Let us be brought on to maturity.&rdquo; Paul is telling the Hebrew believers not to remain in the kindergarten stage but to go on to maturity, &ldquo;not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, of the teaching of baptisms and of laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment.&rdquo; Many Christians are laying foundation after foundation. Sometimes they may think that a certain foundation is not so good, so they replace it with another foundation. Consequently, there is no building up. The foundation, which is the word of the beginning of the Christ, is firstly repentance from dead works and then faith toward God. A certain Christian may have repented and believed in the Lord Jesus. A year later, he may have heard a revival message and gone back to repent and believe again. After another period of time another revivalist came and stirred him up again. This is the work of today&rsquo;s Christianity. Every year there is a revival and every year there is a stirring up. People repent again and believe in God again year after year. Is anyone, however, going on to maturity?</p>
<p>The word of the beginning of the Christ also involves the teaching of baptisms, including water baptism and Spirit baptism. Specifically, baptisms here refer to the washings of utensils and vessels used in the tabernacle or temple for God&rsquo;s service (Lev. 6:28). The washings of the priests are probably also included (Exo. 30:18-21; Lev. 16:4). This word, no doubt, also applies to the New Testament baptism. The word of the beginning of the Christ, which is mentioned as the good word of God, also includes the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</p>
<p>Paul says in 6:3, &ldquo;And this we will do if God permits.&rdquo; This means we will do what is mentioned in verse 1: &ldquo;let us be brought on to maturity.&rdquo; Paul continues to say, &ldquo;For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those who were once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the works of power of the coming age&rdquo; (6:4-5). Those who were once enlightened, and who tasted of the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God and the works of power of the coming age, laid the foundation already at the time they believed. Once they have fallen away and turned back there is no need for them to lay the foundation again (v. 1), but only to go on, to be brought on, to maturity. There is no need to repeat their repentance, for it is impossible to renew again that repentance. Hebrews 6:1 indicates that this is not needed; verse 4 says that it is not possible; and verses 7 and 8 show that it is not right.</p>
<p>The good word of God is the word of the beginning of the Christ in the kindergarten stage. Repentance, faith in God, baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection, and eternal judgment are all concerned and wrapped up with Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry. Without His earthly ministry you have no way to repent, to receive baptism, to lay hands on others, to receive resurrection, or to escape eternal judgment. Any word concerning Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry is the word of the beginning of the Christ in the kindergarten stage. This is surely the good word because it is the glad tidings, the good news. The very good news preached by today&rsquo;s Christians is the word of the beginning of the Christ, the good word of God, the word in the beginning stage of the Christian life. In 5:12-13 the good word of God is considered by Paul as milk, not solid food. Even Peter says that as newborn babes we should desire the milk of the word (1 Pet. 2:2). This is also the word of the beginning of the Christ, the good word of God, the word in the kindergarten stage.</p>
<p>With this enjoyment of the tasting of the heavenly gift, the partaking of the Holy Spirit, and the tasting of the good word of God, there is another tasting&mdash;the tasting of the works of power of the coming age (6:5). The works of power of the coming age are listed with the good word of God in the kindergarten stage. The tasting of the works of power of the coming age is the subsidiary tasting, not the main tasting.</p>
<p>The first category of the word is the word of the beginning of the Christ which is the good word of God and in 5:13 is another category&mdash;the word of righteousness. Verses 12 and 13 say, &ldquo;For when because of the time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you what are the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God, and have become those who have need of milk and not of solid food. For everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe.&rdquo; The beginning of the oracles of God equals the word of the beginning of the Christ. Milk in verse 13 refers to the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God mentioned in verse 12, whereas the word of righteousness refers to the solid food. &ldquo;The good word&rdquo; mentioned in 6:5 is &ldquo;the word of the beginning of the Christ&rdquo; (6:1). But the word of righteousness is deeper than the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God because it embodies the deeper thought of God&rsquo;s justice and righteousness in His dispensational and governmental dealings with His people. This word is more difficult to discriminate than the word of grace (Acts 14:3; 20:32) and the word of life (Phil. 2:16).</p>
<p>This is why very few Christians today understand the Bible in the way of God&rsquo;s dispensations. Among all the different theologies, according to my study, only the theology of the Brethren has opened up the dispensations. When we come to the Word of God, we must take care of God&rsquo;s dispensations. To take care of God&rsquo;s dispensations is to understand the word of righteousness.</p>
<p>The word of righteousness comprises the entire book of Hebrews. God&rsquo;s speaking in Son and the Son&rsquo;s speaking God has two categories of word&mdash;the word of the beginning of the Christ which is for the babes, and the word of righteousness which is the solid food for the mature ones. In this word of righteousness the heavenly ministry of Christ is unveiled. This is only revealed in Hebrews and in Revelation. Only in these two books can we see a clear picture of what Christ is doing in the heavens.</p>
<p>In Hebrews we are told that now in the heavens Christ is the heavenly Minister (8:2) and He is also the heavenly High Priest (8:1). Furthermore, He is the heavenly Mediator to execute the very will He made as a new covenant bequeathed to us (8:6). In this will there are many bequests, and He is now in the heavens to carry out this will as a Mediator. Then in the book of Revelation we are told that He is now in the heavens as the Lord of lords and the King of kings (17:14; 19:16), and He is the one that is carrying out God&rsquo;s governmental administration in the whole universe (5:5-6). Without these two books we would not know what Christ is doing in the heavenlies after His ascension. We would only know the speaking of God in Son concerning His earthly ministry which is only in the kindergarten stage.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CRUCIAL POINTS IN HEBREWS</h2>
<p>There are at least thirteen crucial points in the book of Hebrews which I consider to be thirteen &ldquo;mountain peaks.&rdquo; Every chapter has a peak and we must have the view to see these peaks in Hebrews.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Chapter One</h2>
<p>The crucial point in chapter one of Hebrews is that the very Son in whom God speaks is the very God (v. 8), the Creator of the universe (v. 10), the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the express image of His substance (v. 3), God&rsquo;s anointed One (v. 9), and also God&rsquo;s firstborn Son (v. 6). When God will send the Son back He will be the firstborn Son of God. As all these items, He is superior to the angels (v. 4), who are merely servants.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Chapter Two</h2>
<p>The crucial point in chapter two is that this Son in whom God speaks is a Man a little inferior to the angels (vv. 7, 9), a man with blood and flesh who destroyed the Devil, who has the might of death, on the cross (v. 14). He made propitiation for the sins of God&rsquo;s people (v. 17). He was made a little inferior to the angels, yet He destroyed the Devil and He was glorified, crowned with glory and honor (v. 7). He also produced many brothers or many sons in addition to Himself as the firstborn Son of God, and He made them a church (vv. 11-12). He is leading these many sons into glory (v. 10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Chapter Three</h2>
<p>The crucial point in chapter three is that the One who speaks God, in whom God speaks, is the very Apostle sent by God to His people (v. 1) and the Builder of God&rsquo;s house (vv. 3-4). In this sense, He is superior to Moses who was also sent as an apostle from God to God&rsquo;s chosen people, but he was not the builder of God&rsquo;s house, just a part of the house itself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Chapter Four</h2>
<p>In chapter four this One in whom God speaks is the real Joshua (v. 8). The Greek name Jesus is an equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua which means Jehovah the Savior. This Joshua brings us into the real rest of the Sabbath (v. 9). (To cover this point you have to study the Life-study Messages on the Sabbath rest&mdash;messages 18 through 24.)</p>
<h2 class="head2">Chapter Five</h2>
<p>In chapter five the crucial point is that the One in whom God speaks is the heavenly High Priest, much higher than Aaron as the high priest. Aaron&rsquo;s priesthood was according to the order of Aaron, but this One&rsquo;s priesthood is according to the order of Melchisedec (vv. 5-6). The order of Aaron was temporary, but the order of Melchisedec is eternal, so His priesthood is much superior to that of Aaron.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Chapter Six</h2>
<p>The crucial point in chapter six is concerning the good word of God as a part of the genuine enjoyment of the New Testament. But whatever is in chapter six as the enjoyment of the New Testament bequests as the blessing of the gospel is in the &ldquo;kindergarten stage.&rdquo; Therefore, in this chapter all the believers are encouraged to go on to reach maturity (v. 1), to go on to the heavenly ministry of Christ in the Holy of Holies in the heavens. To go on to this ministry we have to learn how to follow the Forerunner, the Pioneer, and this Christ has become the Forerunner within the veil (v. 19-20). In order to go on to this heavenly ministry, we have to enter the veil. The way to enter the veil is fully explained in chapter ten.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Chapter Seven</h2>
<p>In chapter seven the crucial point is that this heavenly High Priest is ministering not by the commandment of letters but by a life of incorruption, an indestructible life (v. 16), which is the very uncreated, eternal life of God. Christ being the heavenly High Priest is not by commandments in dead letters but by the divine life which is eternal, indestructible, and in incorruption. He is now interceding for us so He can save us to the uttermost (v. 25).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Chapter Eight</h2>
<p>In chapter eight the crucial point is that this excellent One in whom God speaks or who speaks God is the heavenly Minister (v. 2) and the heavenly Mediator (v. 6) to execute the very New Testament, which is the new will bequeathed by Him in His resurrection and enacted by Him in His death. Now He is the heavenly Minister according to this New Testament, and He is executing all the bequests of this new will.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Chapter Nine</h2>
<p>In chapter nine the crucial point is that this very One in whom God speaks brings us into the Holy of Holies to enjoy all the riches within the ark where the two tablets of the law, the hidden manna, and the budding rod are (vv. 3-4, 8). This one is also the One who offered Himself as an eternal sacrifice through the eternal Spirit (v. 14). The Son&rsquo;s death was not only in His humanity but also with His divinity through the eternal Spirit. His offering of Himself on the cross is an eternal sacrifice offered by the eternal Spirit, so it bears an eternal efficacy. The very redemption accomplished by this offering is an eternal redemption (v. 12).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Chapter Ten</h2>
<p>Chapter ten tells us that this One in whom God speaks replaces all the offerings of the Old Testament according to God&rsquo;s will (vv. 4-12). He is <em>the</em> offering. He is the fulfillment, the termination, and the replacement of all the Old Testament offerings. Therefore, it says in chapter ten that there is no longer an offering for sin (v. 18). By such an all-inclusive offering He cut the way through His death by crucifying our old man in the flesh for us to enter into the Holy of Holies. In the Holy of Holies we enjoy Him in His heavenly ministry (vv. 20-22).</p>
<p>Also, we have to be faithful; otherwise, we will suffer discipline (vv. 23-39). If we will be faithful to follow the Lord according to His New Testament economy, we will receive a reward (v. 35). For this reason we should not forsake assembling together that we may exhort one another to go on to enjoy Him in His heavenly ministry (v. 25). If we still remain in His earthly ministry, we will miss the mark and will suffer a loss of discipline because we did not go on to His heavenly ministry. This means that we did not know God&rsquo;s word of righteousness concerning His justice and righteousness exercised in His dispensational and governmental dealings with His people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Chapter Eleven</h2>
<p>In chapter eleven the focal point is faith. Faith is a reaction to the scenery of the New Testament. It is &ldquo;the substantiating of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen&rdquo; (v. 1). For us to enjoy all the bequests of the New Testament we should exercise this faith. We walk according to faith, not according to any appearance by sight (2 Cor. 5:7). We have to take faith as our way. Faith is the way to enjoy the heavenly ministry of Christ bequeathed in the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Chapter Twelve</h2>
<p>Since we have seen all that Christ is in His heavenly ministry and we have the way to go on, we have to run the race (v. 1). We have to run the race because we all have come to eight things. We have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, to myriads of angels, to the church of the firstborn ones who have been enrolled in the heavens, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect, to Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks better than that of Abel (vv. 22-24). Mount Zion is mentioned not in a physical sense, but in a spiritual sense. In a spiritual sense we have come to the church already. We do not need to enter the New Jerusalem because we are in it already&mdash;&ldquo;we have come.&rdquo; Because we have come, then we run the race. In the Bible it is not firstly to run and then to enter. In the Bible we first enter the gate and then walk on the way (Matt. 7:13-14) and run the race.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Chapter Thirteen</h2>
<p>Chapter thirteen tells us we need to follow Jesus outside the camp, bearing His reproach (v. 13). Before chapter thirteen, all the chapters are on enjoying the heavenly Christ within the veil. Now chapter thirteen tells us to be outside the camp, outside religion, to follow the rejected Jesus. It is only when we enjoy the heavenly Christ within the veil (6:19) in the Holy of Holies, that we are able to follow outside the camp, outside religion, the very rejected Jesus who was walking on this earth.</p></body></html>
