   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SIN, SINS, AND THE SINNER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I will begin with a very basic foundation concerning the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet I hope that in every meeting we will advance a little.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this first meeting, our subject is one which most people do not like to hear about, but one which is unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our subject in this meeting is sin, sins, and sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible pays much attention to the matter of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only when we are clear about sin can we understand salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we want to know about the gospel of God and the salvation of God, we must first know what sin is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must firstly see how sin has affected us and how we have become sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only then will we be clear about what God's salvation is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We will first consider the ABCs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to see what sin is, what sins are, and who is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SIN AND SINS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can easily tell the difference between sin and sins: sin is singular, and sins are plural.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, we need to distinguish between sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you cannot differentiate between the two, it will be impossible for you to be clear about your salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If someone is not clear about the difference between sin and sins, even if he is saved, his salvation is probably an unclear one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is sin according to the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What are sins?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let me give a brief definition first.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sin refers to that power within us that motivates us to commit sinful acts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sins, on the other hand, refer to the particular individual sinful acts that we commit outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do not like to use terms such as "original sin," "the root of sin," "the source of sin," or the like.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These are terms created by theologians and are unnecessary for us now.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We will remain simple and consider this matter from our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We know that there is something within us that motivates and forces us to have certain spontaneous inclinations; it compels us toward the way of lust and passion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the Bible this something is sin Rom 7:8, 16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But not only is there this sin within us that forces and compels us, there are also the individual sinful acts, the sins, which are committed outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Bible sins are related to our conduct, while sin is related to our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sins are that which are committed by the hands, the feet, the heart, and even the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul refers to this when he speaks of the practices of the body Rom 8:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But what is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sin is a law that controls our members Rom 7:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is something within us that compels us to sin, to commit evil, and this something is sin.</S>
