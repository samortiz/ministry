   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY WAITING FOR THE LORD'S RETURN Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:7; 1 Thes 1:9-10; Phil 3:20; Titus 2:11-13 THE SCRIPTURAL TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING THE LORD'S SECOND COMING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the Scriptural teaching, the Lord came once in the flesh; He died for us on the cross to satisfy God's righteousness and then resurrected and ascended to be our High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is now interceding for us before God and acting on our behalf as our Executor and Guarantor.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He also will come to the earth a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Old Testament says that when the Lord comes back again there will be no more sin on earth Isa 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many portions of the Bible tell us specifically about the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Himself said, "I go to prepare a place for you....I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be" John 14:2b, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Acts 1:11 says that when the Lord was taken up to heaven, two angels declared, "This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you beheld Him going into heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This tells us that our Lord will come a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Hebrews 9:28 the writer declared to God's children, "So Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time to those who eagerly await Him, apart from sin, unto salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By the time of Revelation 22:20, the Lord had come once and had ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Holy Spirit had come.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most of the apostles were gone, and the holy city was destroyed; only John was left.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At this juncture the Lord comforted His saints, saying, "Yes, I come quickly."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John responded, saying, "Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Come, Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From these verses we can see that the Lord has not only come once.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He will come a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every Lord's Day evening, we gather together to break bread and remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord commanded us to do this, and we will continue to do this until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We will never stop this kind of glorious waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every time we break bread and remember the Lord, we are waiting for His return.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We believe that He has come not only once but that He will come a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This fact is as sure as the fact of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The cross dealt with our sins, but the history of sin is not finished.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To the believers, the matter of sin and the history of sin will not be terminated until the Lord comes back again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The cross judged sin, while the second coming will terminate sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are many testimonies concerning the Lord's coming in various passages in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE PROPER ATTITUDE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>TOWARDS THE LORD'S SECOND COMING</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Having realized that the Lord will come again, we need to have a proper attitude toward His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hearing a message on His coming and knowing the doctrine of His coming are not the end; we have to be those who wait for His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to read the passages concerning the Lord's coming to new ones right after they believe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This will make them persons who "await His Son from the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose your supervisor sends a letter saying that he will come back on July 1.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Would you merely mark "read" on the letter and file it away?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Of course not.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You would prepare for his return.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The proper attitude towards the Lord's coming is to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not search with curiosity the prophecies concerning His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A Christian who lives on earth today should adopt a waiting attitude for the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is wrong to give up this waiting attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Waiting for the Lord's return means that a man still goes about his business, but his eyes are set on the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He knows that when the Lord comes back, He will demand certain things and ask him certain questions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He waits for the Lord like a slave waiting for his master to return.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>While he waits, he cannot beat his fellow slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, he has to serve faithfully and wait patiently.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord said that He could come any time, but before He comes there will be signs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These signs will all be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There are five kinds of signs concerning His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The first concerns the Jews, the second concerns the Roman Catholic Church, the third concerns the church, the fourth concerns the world, and the fifth concerns other matters in general.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The signs concerning the Jews are mostly fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>During the first half of the twentieth century, Palestine freed itself from the British colonial rule, and the Jews formed their own nation in 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They had been without a nation for 2,600 years, but the time of their restoration has come.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Matthew 24:32 the Lord told the disciples to learn from the fig tree.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the nation of Israel is restored, we know that the day of the Lord is near.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God's children should be aware of the events leading to the Lord's soon return and wait for His return daily.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to show new ones that it is one thing to believe in the Lord's return and to research the subject, but it is altogether a different matter to wait for His return.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Not many people see the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>First Thessalonians 1:9-10 says that the believers reported how they turned from the idols to serve a living and true God and awaited His Son from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This shows that as soon as a person believes in the Lord, his attitude toward the Lord and His return changes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Waiting for His return is not the same as studying prophecy or researching the millennium and the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The latter belong to a different category.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As soon as a person believes in the Lord, he should have a different attitude toward the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is right and proper.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Unless he makes this turn, all his actions and possessions will still be earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A believer has been brought into the heavenly new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All his actions and possessions should work towards his heavenly deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A person who waits for the Lord's return does not busy himself with writing books and establishing a name for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>While he is on earth, he waits for the Lord to return from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He is a heavenly citizen, one who follows the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This waiting should be a lifetime yardstick of a believer; it should bring about a change in his living and lifestyle.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He has touched the city which has the foundations, and he has no further hope for anything earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Everything about him should revolve around his hope for the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In my whole life I have never been impressed by another person like I was by Miss M. E. Barber.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>She was indeed a person who waited for the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There are many famous men in Christianity who studied prophecy, such as D. M. Panton.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They all knew about the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But to my knowledge, only Miss Barber was a person who truly waited for His return.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It was a big surprise to her that the Lord had not returned in her time.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>One year I spent the last day, New Year's eve, with her.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>She prayed, "Lord, if You want to come now, there is still time this year; You do not have to wait until next year."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Her face was towards the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Christians do not wait for a time when we will serve the church; we wait for a time when the Lord will come again.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If a believer is not careful, but substitutes other things for the Lord's return, he becomes fallen immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Once Miss Barber wrote a hymn concerning the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I did not understand one line she wrote in her hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>She answered, "Come with me and I will show you."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We went out and took a walk.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When we were about to turn a corner, she said to me, "The Lord is coming; He is getting closer and closer.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Perhaps we will see Him around the corner."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In her I saw a person who was waiting for the Lord's return, and I realized what it means to wait for the Lord to return.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Her whole life was a life of preparing for the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Day by day, while she lived on the earth, she waited eagerly for the Lord to return.</S>
