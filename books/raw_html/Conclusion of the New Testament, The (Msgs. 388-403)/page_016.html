<h2 class="head3">114. An Advocate</h2>
<p>In 1 John 2:1-2 Christ is presented as an Advocate. &ldquo;My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;Advocate&rdquo; is a translation of the Greek word <em>parakletos,</em> which is translated &ldquo;Comforter&rdquo; in John&rsquo;s Gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. An Advocate with the Father,<br />
Jesus Christ the Righteous</h2>
<p>The Lord is &ldquo;an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous&rdquo; (v. 1).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) An Advocate</h2>
<p>The Greek word rendered &ldquo;Advocate&rdquo; refers to one who is called to another&rsquo;s side to aid him; hence, a helper. It refers also to one who offers legal aid or one who intercedes on behalf of someone else; hence, an advocate, counsel, or intercessor. The word carries the sense of consoling and consolation; hence, a consoler, a comforter. It is used in the Gospel of John (14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7) for the Spirit of reality as our Comforter within us, the One who takes care of our case or our affairs. It is used in 1 John 2 in reference to the Lord Jesus as our Advocate with the Father. When we sin, He, based on the propitiation that He accomplished, takes care of our case by interceding (Rom. 8:34) and pleading for us.</p>
<p>As we have seen, &ldquo;Advocate&rdquo; is a translation of the Greek word <em>parakletos.</em> This word is formed of two words: the preposition <em>para</em> (used here as a prefix) and the word <em>kletos.</em> Put together, these words denote someone called to our side. The Greek word <em>parakletos</em> is used in the New Testament only by John. In his Gospel John says, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever&rdquo; (14:16). This indicates that while the Lord was with the disciples, one <em>parakletos,</em> one Comforter, was there with them. But this <em>parakletos</em> was about to leave. Thus, there was the need for another <em>parakletos,</em> another Comforter, to come. Actually, the first <em>parakletos</em> and the other <em>parakletos</em> are one. The One who is called &ldquo;another Comforter&rdquo; is now in us as the life-giving Spirit, and the One who was the first Comforter, the Lord Jesus Christ, is now in the heavens at the right hand of God.</p>
<p>In the heavens we have the Lord Jesus Christ as our Comforter, and in our spirit we have the Spirit as another Comforter. However, these two are one. For this reason, the Greek word <em>parakletos</em> is used for both the Comforter in the heavens and the Comforter in our spirit. If we put 1 John 2:1 together with John 14:16, we see that today the Lord Jesus is our Advocate at the right hand of God in the heavens; at the same time, He is also the Comforter in our spirit. In the heavens He is the Advocate with the Father; in our spirit He is the Comforter. This is why He is the ladder upon whom the angels of God are ascending and descending (1:51). As the ascended Lord, He is our Paraclete with the Father, taking care of our case in the heavens. As the indwelling Spirit, He is the &ldquo;Paraclete with us&rdquo; (14:16-17), the One alongside of us who is taking care of us.</p>
<p>The Greek word <em>parakletos</em> is rendered &ldquo;Comforter&rdquo; in John 14:16 and &ldquo;Advocate&rdquo; in 1 John 2:1. Also, in John 14:26 and 15:26 this Greek word is translated &ldquo;Comforter.&rdquo; &ldquo;Comforter&rdquo; is an appropriate translation of <em>parakletos</em> in John 14:16, for in this verse there is a certain feeling that this Paraclete comes to comfort the disciples in their sorrow caused by the Lord&rsquo;s leaving them. The Lord had told His disciples that He was leaving, and they were troubled by this. Therefore, in this chapter the Lord indicated to the disciples that they did not need to be sorrowful, for He would ask the Father to send them another Paraclete, another Comforter. Because the troubled disciples were in need of comfort, it is correct to render <em>parakletos</em> in John 14:26 as &ldquo;Comforter.&rdquo; This Greek word implies the thought of comfort and refers to one who helps us, serves us, stands by us, and goes along with us. Such a one surely is a comforter.</p>
<p>It is also correct to translate <em>parakletos</em> in 1 John 2:1 as &ldquo;Advocate.&rdquo; According to the usage in ancient times, this Greek word may refer to a person who functions as an attorney, a legal advocate. The situation in 1 John 2:1, in contrast to that in John 14:16, is a situation that requires an advocate or attorney.</p>
<p>The Advocate in 2:1 is actually a spiritual attorney. This <em>parakletos</em> stands beside us, like a nurse caring for us, and serves us. The <em>parakletos</em> is also a counselor. At school the students have a counselor to help them choose the right courses. Our <em>parakletos</em> also helps us in making choices. In his translation of 1 John 2:1 J. N. Darby uses the word &ldquo;patron.&rdquo; In his note he explains that the word <em>patron</em> is used in the sense of a Roman patron, who maintained the interests of his clients in every way. One function of a Roman patron was much like that of an attorney today. When we are in a particular kind of situation, we may give the entire matter over into the hands of an attorney. The attorney then takes care of our case. This is the function of our Advocate in verse 1. <em>Parakletos</em> is an all-inclusive word. It implies the thought of helping and nourishing, the thought of counseling, and also the thought of consoling. It includes the concept of an advocate, an attorney, who takes care of our case.</p>
<p>Christ, an Advocate with the Father, takes our case as our attorney. Satan, the enemy of God and our subtle enemy, accuses us before our God day and night (Rev. 12:10). Perhaps he tells God that although God is holy and righteous, His children whom He loves are unrighteous and filthy. The Father then may tell him that His children have an excellent attorney, Jesus Christ. Our attorney, Christ, also may tell Satan to look upon His blood, which cleanses us from every sin, and to shut his accusing mouth.</p>
<p>According to Revelation 12:10 and 11, Satan accuses God&rsquo;s children day and night, but they can overcome him by the blood of the Lamb. Once we realize that we are unclean, unholy, and unrighteous, we may feel defeated and be cut off from the Lord&rsquo;s dispensing of His life into us. Yet we have not only the blood of Jesus but also Him as our Advocate, our Attorney. We should tell Satan to shut his mouth and should praise the Lamb of God for His overcoming blood. Then the divine life will be dispensed into us once again. Christ, our Advocate, takes care of our case so that life-dispensing can continue.</p>
