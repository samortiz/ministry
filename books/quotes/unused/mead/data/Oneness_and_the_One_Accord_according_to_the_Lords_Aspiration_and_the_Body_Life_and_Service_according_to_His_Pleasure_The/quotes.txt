[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE ASPIRATION OF THE LORD'S DESIRE THE ONENESS OF HIS BELIEVERS Scripture Reading: John 17:2, 6, 11b, 14-23; Matt 18:19; Acts 1:14; 1 Cor 1:10; Phil 2:2b; Eph 4:4-6; 1 Cor 4:17b; 7:17b; 11:16; 14:34a; Rev 2:7a, 11a, 17a, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 1:20 OUTLINE The aspiration of the Lord's desire becoming His specific prayer: Before going to the cross.
[3]  THE PRACTICE OF ONENESS The One Accord, Having the Same Mind, Speaking the Same Things
[4]  CHAPTER TWO THE PLEASURE OF THE LORD'S HEART THE EXPRESSION AND SERVICE OF HIS BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23; 4:4-6; 1 Cor 12:13, 27, 18, 21-25; Rom 12:5; Eph 4:15-16; 1 Cor 12:4-11; Rom 12:4-8 OUTLINE The expression of the Lord's Body: The church being the Body of Christ Eph 1:23.
[5]  One Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father, who is over all, through all, and in all Eph 4:4-6.
[6]  Many believers being baptized in one Spirit into one Body to be members in particular 1 Cor 12:13, 27: God having placed the members in the Body even as He willed; every member being necessary 1 Cor 12:18, 21-22.
[7]  God tempering the Body together, clothing the less honorable members with more abundant honor, lest there be division in the Body 1 Cor 12:23-25.
[8]  Out from the Head the whole Body, joined closely together through every joint of the rich supply and knit together through the operation in measure of each one part, causing the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love, that Christ may have a full expression Eph 4:16.
[9]  In the last message, we saw the genuine oneness in a simple and concise way.
[10]  Now, we have to go one step further to consider the Body of Christ.
[11]  ONENESS NULLIFYING THE NATURAL MAN, THE WORLD, SATAN, AND THE SELF
[12]  Many Believers Being Baptized into One Body, Being Members in Particular
[13]  Furthermore, this Body of Christ is composed of all the regenerated believers.
[14]  First Corinthians 12 says that we were all baptized in one Spirit into one Body v. 13 and are members in particular v. 27 . As soon as we were baptized, we were brought into an organic union with the Triune God to become living members of the Body of Christ.
[15]  Furthermore, He has placed all the members in the Body even as He willed v. 18 . Each one of us members has our own place in the Body of Christ.
[16]  The purpose of us believers being members one of another in the Body of Christ is that we would live Christ and express Him together Rom 12:5 .
[17]  The Service in the Lord's Body Having the Same Triune God, but with Different Operations, Ministries, and Gifts
[18]  Now let us come to the second main point, which is the service in the Lord's Body.
[19]  First Corinthians 12:4-6 shows us that we have the same God but different operations; we have the same Lord but different ministries; and we have the same Spirit but different gifts.
[20]  This is the operation of the Triune God in the believers for the accomplishment of God's plan unto the building up of the church, which is the Body of Christ, as the full expression of Christ.
[21]  CHAPTER THREE THE LIVING IN THE BODY Scripture Reading: Col 1:18; Eph 4:15-16; Rom 12:5; Eph 5:23-24; 1 Tim 5:17a; 1 Cor 3:10a; Heb 13:17; 2 Cor 3:17; Rom 8:11, 13; Phil 1:8; 1 Cor 12:25b-26 OUTLINE Living corporately with the members under the Head Col 1:18: Having the Head as the life, the principal object, and the center Eph 4:15-16.
[22]  We have seen that the Lord's aspiration is for all His believers to be one and that the Lord's pleasure is to have a Body to express and serve Him.
[23]  Ephesians 1 begins with the Father God's selection and predestination in eternity past, passes through Christ's accomplished redemption, with the Spirit's sealing and anointing, and through the power of resurrection and ascension and the power that operated in Christ to subject all things to Him and to head up all things in Him, and ends with the church, which is the Body of Christ, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.
[24]  NO NEED TO DEMAND, BUT TO WORK IN AN ORGANIC WAY
[25]  In order to live in the Body, we also have to recognize the authority in the Body.
[26]  CHAPTER FOUR THE SERVICE OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:5, 9; Rev 1:6; 5:9-10; Rom 15:16; Eph 4:11-12; Mark 16:15-16; Luke 10:2-3a, 5-6; 1 Thes 2:7; John 21:15; 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 23a, 24-25, 31; 1 Pet 2:2; Rom 12:1; Col 1:28-29.
[27]  Their duty being the preaching of the gospel to save sinners, making them sacrifices for the building up of the Body of Christ, the house of God Rom 15:16; 1 Pet 2:9b, 5b; Eph 4:11-12.
[28]  We have seen that the living in the Body is for the expression of Christ.
[29]  Now we have to see that the service in the Body is for the ministering of Christ.
[30]  If we do not have an adequate understanding of the Body of Christ, our frame of mind is not proper, and we will not be able to have the common recognition of the Body of Christ.
[31]  THE SERVICE OF THE BODY BEING THE SERVICE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS Being Built Up into a Priesthood in Which Everyone Participates and Coordinates in Service
[32]  The Body service that the Lord is after is the service of the New Testament priests.
[33]  THE PROCEDURE IN THE SERVICE OF THE BODY Preaching the Gospel to Save the Sinners
[34]  Now for the service of the Body we all have to learn, exercise, and use the excelling gift of prophesying to speak for the Lord, to speak the Lord forth, and to speak the Lord into others for the building up of the church, the Body of Christ.
[35]  THE THREE STEPS OF OFFERING BY THE PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL IN THE CHURCH SERVICE Preaching the Gospel to Save Sinners, Offering Them as Sacrifices to God
[36]  We live and serve in the Body in such a way, and we lead others to live and serve in the Body, so that everyone can be just as we are and can realize their function as members and live in the Body.
