   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1:11b-14; Rom 12:4-5 BY THE EAGLE'S WINGS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ezekiel 1:11b-14 reveals to us a very clear picture of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No other verses in the entire Bible reveal coordination in such a definite and practical way as these four verses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These verses tell us that the four living creatures are joined together by using two of their wings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They use two of their wings for moving, and this moving is in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By two of their wings they are joined one to another, and by two of their wings they are coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have already seen that they use the other two wings to cover themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have also seen that the eagle's wings in the Old Testament symbolize the divine strength, the divine power, and the divine supply.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that the coordination of the four living creatures is not in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In themselves they do not have the ability to be coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their coordination is in the divine power, the divine strength, and the divine supply, because the eagle's wings are the means for them to be coordinated with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, their coordination does not depend upon themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not a matter of what they are or of what they can do, but a matter of the eagle's wings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The eagle's wings are the means by which they are coordinated as one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is by the divine power and strength that they are coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By themselves the living creatures are individuals, but with the eagle's wings they are coordinated into one body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that the coordination among us Christians is not something of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What we have in ourselves does not coordinate, but rather divides.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In ourselves we are always dividing and separating, never coordinating.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Coordination in our human strength will not last very long.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we have the eagle's wings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With the eagle's wings we can be coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>TO EXPRESS AND MANIFEST CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must be coordinated as the four living creatures in order that Christ may be expressed and manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We also must be coordinated for the move of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord moves in the center of the coordination of the living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The coordination is also for God's divine administration and government, because the throne is in the clear sky above such a coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The throne is for God's government and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, the coordination of the living creatures is for manifesting Christ, for the Lord's move, and for God's divine government.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE TABERNACLE JOINED TOGETHER BY THE GOLD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The same principle can be seen in the tabernacle in the wilderness Exo 26:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The tabernacle was built of forty-eight boards coordinated into one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those boards were coordinated into one building not by themselves, but by the overlaying gold.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the boards were overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then upon the overlaying gold were the golden rings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through the golden rings were the golden bars.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The gold coordinated all forty-eight boards into one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The overlaying gold signifies the divine nature and indicates that God Himself was the coordinating factor that caused all the boards to be one tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE WAY OF COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now we need to see how the four living creatures are coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Each of the four living creatures faces one direction.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One of the living creatures faces the north; another living creature faces the south; another living creature faces the east; and the last living creature faces the west.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As they face these four directions, two of their wings spread out and touch the adjacent creatures' wings, forming a square.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Each of the living creatures uses two of his wings to join with the other living creatures.</S>
