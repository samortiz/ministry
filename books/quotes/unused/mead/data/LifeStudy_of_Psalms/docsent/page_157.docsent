   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE TWENTY THE PSALMISTS' INTENSIFIED ENJOYMENT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS HOUSE AND CITY THROUGH THE SUFFERING,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>EXALTED, AND REIGNING CHRIST 2 PRAISING CHRIST AS THE KING 1 Scripture Reading: Psa 45:1-8</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will begin to consider Psalm 45, the highest and the greatest of the one hundred fifty psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To enter into the significance of such a psalm is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All seventeen verses of Psalm 45 are quite common, but the way this psalm presents Christ is very peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The title of this psalm tells us that it is a song of love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word love in the title refers not to a father's love for his son but to the love between a male and a female.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is indicated by the fact that the Hebrew word for love here is in the feminine gender.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, the love in Psalm 45 is a feminine love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to understand this psalm, we need to turn to the particular book in the Bible which is concerned with love the Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Psalm 45 is a psalm of love, and Song of Songs is a book of love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In that book the word love is used in both the masculine and the feminine gender.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the English translation of Song of Songs, the Lord Jesus is called "the Beloved"; however, the Hebrew word is simply the word for love in the masculine gender.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Likewise, when the Lord calls His seeker "My love," the Hebrew word for love is in the feminine gender.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, Psalm 45:2a says, "You are fairer than the sons of men."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is similar to Song of Songs 5:10, where the seeker speaks of her beloved as "the chiefest among ten thousand."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a further indication that Song of Songs helps us to understand Psalm 45.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In one of the life-study messages on Hosea 11 14, we pointed out that throughout Hosea Israel is depicted as the wife of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, when God's everlasting love is touched, Israel is called God's son Hosea 11:1 , indicating that Israel has the Father's life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's everlasting love is not a love in affection, like the love of a husband toward a wife, but a love in life, like the love of a father toward a son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Love in affection does not transform, but love in life transforms people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is in the Father's love, the love in life, that Israel is transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A husband who loves his wife in affection may spoil her, but a father who loves his son in life never spoils his son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, a father's love in life perfects his son.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am not suggesting that Christ's love for us as virgins, as those who are females in relation to Him 2 Cor 11:2 , is a love that can spoil us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the biblical truth, Christ's love does not spoil His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nominal Christians, false Christians, do not know Christ's love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Genuine Christians, those who have a heart for the Lord, enjoy Christ's love, but they may enjoy it according to their own concept or feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a result they are spoiled not by Christ's love itself but by their wrong application of Christ's love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For instance, if you speak to them concerning the kingdom truth, dispensational punishment, and the casting of certain believers into the outer darkness Matt 22:13; 25:30 , they may say, "You are teaching heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jesus loves me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is not cruel, and He would not put me into outer darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As long as Jesus loves me, everything is all right."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that even genuine believers have been spoiled by their mistaken application of the love of Christ.</S>
