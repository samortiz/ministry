This matter is not only mentioned in the New Testament but is exemplified in the Old Testament. One of the examples is Abraham. According to Acts 7, when Abraham was in Mesopotamia, that is, Ur, God appeared to him and charged him to leave his country, his kindred, and his father's house to go into Canaan. How did he respond? If he disobeyed, he would lose his peace. Yet he was not willing to obey to the end. He came to Haran and became "a halfway Christian." He not only went out himself, but he also brought along his nephew Lot and his father. God told Abraham to leave his kindred, but he brought them along. God told him to go to Canaan, but he went only to the border. He became a "borderline Christian." With many Christians, you cannot consider them totally cold because you can sense a little warmth in them. But you cannot consider them hot because they are not. It was the same with Abraham; he left Ur of the Chaldees but had not entered into Canaan. Today some may think that they are too spiritual for the world and too worldly for the Christians. In this way, they become borderline Christians.</P><P>However, we see that God again called Abraham after his father died (Gen. 12). This time, God did not call him from Ur but rather from Haran. God's will never wavers. Once it is spoken, it stands forever. God told Abraham that he should move to Canaan. The fact that he had moved to Haran did not change God's will. God called him the second time, and Abraham had to leave. Surprisingly, as soon as he started his journey from Haran, the Bible immediately recorded his age as being seventy-five (Gen. 12:4). His age was not recorded when he was in Ur or when he reached Haran. Only when he left Haran and entered into Canaan did the Bible record his age as being seventy-five. This shows us the beginning of his years. God does not count the days that are in the halfway state and in the border region. He demands that we surrender to Him absolutely. Oh, the days spent in Haran are the lost and forgotten days! If we desire God's blessings, we need to leave Haran. God does not count any days in which the self is mixed. I do not know indeed how many days I have lost, how many years I have lost. When I review my past history, I do not know how many days are to be condemned. God did not take notice of any time that was spent in Haran. We spend many days in a foolish way, in a way that is against our conscience and according to our own will. Many times we are lazy and only care for an easy life. All these are just Haran. All these are lost and become null and void. The counting begins at age seventy-five.</P><P>Unfortunately, this was not the only period that Abraham lost. The same thing happened again in chapter sixteen. In chapter fifteen God promised Abraham that he would have a son. In chapter sixteen he was influenced by his wife's suggestion and fell into a presumptuous sin before God. Her intention was good, and she tried to help God. She gave Hagar, her maid, to Abraham, and the latter bore him a son. This was the effort of the flesh and was not something from God. Interestingly, Abraham was recorded as being eighty-six years old in the last verse of chapter sixteen; in the first verse of chapter seventeen he was recorded as being ninety-nine years old. There is a total gap of thirteen years. During these entire thirteen years, not one incident was recorded, nor was any altar built. (Altars were often built by Abraham.) Also, there was no appearance, no new revelation, or any new promise. This period was the period when Ishmael grew up. Let us remember that anything which comes out of our own will and our own flesh is not counted by God and is lost. God began to keep record again at the age of ninety-nine. The entire thirteen years were lost, forgotten, spent in vain, and counted as nothing.</P><P>Let us ask ourselves whether or not during the last few years we have had any new experiences, any new light, or any new messages? In these last few years, did we save any souls or help anyone? Oh, let us consider! A few years have passed. Do we know God in a deeper way? Do we have a renewed assurance concerning God's promise? Do we have any new consecration toward God? Do we have any new altar that we built ourselves? Please remember that if the answers are no, all those days were lost. There is an elderly sister who is still alive today; the time that we can still be with her may not be too long. Once she said that with a Christian, every day he lives on earth should count, and that this is the way to gain the reward. Many times for us, ten days of living do not add up to one day. If we would only live daily by fulfilling our duty, everything would be all right. Please remember that this is a daily matter and cannot be treated lightly. If we live foolishly, rebelliously, sinfully, and act according to the self's will, this type of living in God's eyes is a waste of time and a squandering of our days. What a pity!</P><P>Why did God mention the age of ninety-nine? Because Abraham was circumcised during that year. Abraham had to experience circumcision. After one year, Isaac was born to him. We know that the meaning of circumcision is to rid oneself of the flesh. Therefore, the days in which the self and everything of the flesh had not been dealt with cannot be counted. Because Abraham received circumcision, he was counted again at the age of ninety-nine. Oh, many Christians today are extremely loose; they make light of their daily lives. But let us begin from today to strip off everything fleshly and offer all on the altar so that we will not live a life in vain again and not waste our days any longer. All those of us who are saved know that we have eternal life, but let us count our days and strive to gain back our precious moments. No doubt, we very much desire the return of our Lord. But if the Lord delays, let us count every one of our days. Do not let fifty years pass by and find out that forty-nine of them were lost. Oh, let us consider how many days we have spent in a foolish way. We do not know how many days there are left. Therefore, awake! We see from Abraham that many of his years were lost and gone. How wonderful it would be if he had not lost all those years!</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 19: Notes on Scriptural Messages (3) &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
