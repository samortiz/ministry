<P>Verses 24-25:"Then he who had received the one talent also came and said, Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow. And I was afraid and went off and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours." This does not mean that anyone dares to speak in this way. Here, the Lord was trying to reveal man's hidden intentions. "Hard" means strict. Therefore, he was afraid. He failed because he did not know the Lord and His grace. He thought that the Lord was too strict, and he himself was still under Mount Sinai. Hence, we should not be afraid in the age of grace. The Lord is responsible for success or failure, but we are responsible for being faithful.</P><P>Verse 26:"And his master answered and said to him, Evil and slothful slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not winnow." If our Lord reaps where He has not sown and gathers where he has not winnowed, then what about that which has already been sowed and winnowed? The Lord surely would require of us. We have no ground for argument before His judgment seat. This was wholly due to the slave's laziness. Moody said that no lazy person can be saved. It is certain that no lazy person can receive a reward. A believer will probably receive judgment not only for wrongdoing, but also for not doing. Do not think that because your gift is so small, you would rather not use it. Do not wait until you have time to serve. The same principle applies when we persuade a person to believe in the Lord. We ask him to believe at once and not to wait until he has more time.</P><P>Verse 27:"Therefore you should have deposited my money with the money changers; and when I came, I would have recovered what is mine with interest." The phrase "deposited my money with the money changers" indicates that the gift can be distributed to others. To trade means nothing other than contacting more people. To deposit "with the money changers" means to have communication with a few or even only one. He should not have buried his gift and refrained from passing it along to at least one other person. Although he received a lesser gift than the others, he should have at least tried to use it a little bit. Why did he not save even one person, help even one person, or comfort even one person? We are not responsible for the success of our work, but it is a pity if we have not helped even one person to be saved. At the least we should save one person.</P><P>Verse 28:"Take away therefore the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents." The third slave received two punishments: the talent being taken away and him being cast out. The faithful slaves received two rewards: joy and authority. "Give it to him who has the ten talents." This proves that our Lord is not a hard man, for He did not reserve the one talent for Himself, but gave it to the one who had ten talents.</P><P>Verse 29:"For to every one who has, more shall be given, and he shall abound; but from him who does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away from him." This is the principle. "Has" and "does not have" both refer to having and not having today. The one who has today will experience increase and even abundance in the future, for he may be promoted to take care of even more things. There is more opportunity to exercise gifts in the kingdom. But for the one who does not pay serious attention to using his gift, the gift that he has will be taken away.</P><P>Verse 30:"And cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth." To be "cast...into the outer darkness" is the second punishment given to the third slave. The outer darkness is not absolute but relative. If we want to know what "the outer darkness" indicates, we need to understand at what time the Lord will say this. The Lord will say this when He descends and the saints are caught up to the air to be judged before the judgment seat of Christ. Therefore, "the outer darkness" refers to the outer part of the air. The New Testament never mentions that hell is the outer darkness. Hell has no darkness, but rather fire. However, there will be darkness around the Lord when He comes down, yet glory inside, as depicted by Psalm 18:9-11, which refers to His coming down (parousia). "Weeping" refers to the slave's regretting that he missed the opportunity to use his one talent wisely. "Gnashing" refers to grieving over the loss suffered, especially through his neglect in preaching the gospel. He will not pass through the punishment of fire, but he will not receive authority and joy.</P><P>There are three things here that are interrelated. They are the blood, the cross, and the judgment seat of Christ. Even though there are no apparent verses dealing with this relationship, it is a fact borne out in our life and experience that cannot be denied. Among the three, the cross of Christ is the center. The judgment seat of Christ is in the future, while the blood and the cross are in the past. However, the blood is on the side opposite the judgment seat. Those who miss the blood and the cross—those who have not been dealt with by the blood and the cross—will not miss the judgment seat of Christ. If one misses the cross, he must at least pass through the blood. The believer must pass through both the blood and the cross in order to have peace before the judgment seat of Christ. The blood is objective, for cleansing, redemption, and remission of sins, whereas the cross is subjective, to crucify sin, the old man, the world, and the old creation.</P><P>Our failure affects two parties: God and ourselves. Man can be washed clean and recover his fellowship with God by the blood alone if he has committed sins and broken his fellowship with God. The blood deals with sins, and the cross deals with the power of sin, which can never be washed away. The blood can forgive the sins but cannot keep one from committing the sins again. The soul, the world, and the flesh all need the dealing of the cross. The blood brings in forgiveness, but the cross brings in deliverance.</P><P>We can come forward boldly to the judgment seat only if we have passed under the blood and if we have been placed upon the cross. Before His judgment seat, the Lord will judge our gossip, our intentions, our work, and the works we have left undone. However, the failures that have become facts have to be put under the blood. Although the light is severe at the judgment seat, it cannot reveal the sins that are under the blood. How can we deal with a gossiping tongue? This requires the cross. We must receive the cross by faith and must acknowledge that the old man has been crucified on the cross. The judgment seat cannot search the cross for things to judge. After being washed by the blood, we must still come back to the cross. Otherwise, there is the possibility of repeating the offense, and we still could be rebuked before the judgment seat of Christ.</P>
