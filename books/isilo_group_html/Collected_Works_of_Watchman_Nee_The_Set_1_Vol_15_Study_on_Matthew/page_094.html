In the first coming of the Lord, He manifested authority (such as in casting out demons and healing the sick) and glory. The second coming of the Lord will manifest power and glory. During His earthly ministry, people were astonished that His teaching had authority (Matt. 7:28-29). The Pharisees asked about the source of His authority (Matt. 21:23). (See also the words of the centurion in Matthew 8:8-9.) The second coming will manifest not only authority but also power. He will no longer ride on the foal of a donkey (as the King of peace) but will ride on a white horse. His coming in power is for the execution of God's judgment. In the future Satan will perform many lawless deeds. The Lord will destroy him with His power. Authority and power are two things. The moving of a car demonstrates power, while the hand of a policeman is a sign of authority. In the Lord's first coming, His healing of the sick, casting out of demons, and calming of the wind and the waves were a matter of the exercise of authority. But at His second coming, He will exercise His power. The Lord overthrew the tables and whipped the sellers of cattle and sheep. Although this was an exercise of His human strength, the real whipping was not executed on the human bodies; the real significance was a demonstration of His authority. "Coming on the clouds of heaven." The first rapture will be a rapture to the throne; the second rapture will be to the clouds in the air. Then the Lord will descend on the clouds.</P><P>Verse 31:"And He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His chosen together from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other end." This verse has been fulfilled. Thus, according to Matthew 23:37, after the great tribulation the Lord will call together all the chosen who are scattered among the Gentiles (Isa. 45:4; 65:9; Deut. 7:6). "From the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other end" does not indicate a rapture, because the word used for "coming" in verse 30 is erchomai and not parousia, and here in verse 31 it is only a "gather[ing]...together" (Deut. 30:3-5). After the destruction of Jerusalem, the Jews were killed, captured, or scattered among all the nations. They will remain scattered until, according to this passage, the Lord begins to call them back (see Isa. 43:5-7: "From the east, / And...from the west. / I will say to the north...  / And to the south." Isaiah 49:9-13: "From the land of the Sinim," referring to China. In Hunan province there are still many Jews. They take the last name Tseng. Isaiah 49:22-26; 51:11; 56:8; 60:4; 62:10-12; 27:13; and Ezekiel 34:13; 37:21 also refer to the dispersed Jews. The expression "the four winds" means that there are Jews everywhere, because winds continually move and have no fixed place. Therefore, here the calling together, or gathering together, does not refer to the rapture of the church for the following reasons: (1) The parousia has passed, and the rapture is within the scope of the parousia. (2) Here it is a gathering together; it has nothing to do with the rapture. (3) To say that it is the rapture of the church does not agree with the previous texts. (4) If it refers to the Jews, it is consistent with Matthew 23:37. (5) In 1 Thessalonians 4 there is the sound of the trumpet and the Lord coming to the air. (6) The previous texts all refer to the Jews.</P><P>The above verses are the first large section.</P><P>Verse 32:"But learn the parable from the fig tree: As soon as its branch has become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near." The Lord spoke this section of the prophecy on the Mount of Olives. There were many fig trees there, so the Lord used them in the parable. "As soon as its branch has become tender" refers to the return of life. "Puts forth its leaves" indicates the manifestation of life. The fig tree signifies the Jews (Jer. 24:2, 5, 8). Previously the Lord cursed the fig tree that had leaves but no fruit. This means that He cursed those Jews who had an outward form but not the reality. Leaves signify a show or outward behavior, indicating the law of Moses. At that time the Passover, the Feast of Purim, and all the offerings and sacrifices will be restored. Summer refers to a time for growth. Winter refers to the time of death and drying up. In the summer everything is flourishing and full of life; everything is bright. It is a golden time. This is the kingdom. The Jews today are in the winter. Winter refers to tribulation, particularly to the great tribulation. Spring refers to the rapture (S.S. 2:10-11, 13). Summer refers to the kingdom (Luke 21:30-31). Luke 21:29-30 mentions all the other kinds of trees. These trees refer to the nations (see Daniel and Judges). All the nations also put forth branches; that is, today among all the tribes and races, nationalism is especially prevalent. Even Scotland, Mongolia, and the tribe of Hui in Xingjiang province have all tried to become independent.</P><P>Verse 33: "So also you, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the doors." Keep in mind that verses 4 through 31 constitute one continuous section and should not be broken up. The difference between 24:4-31 and 24:32-25:46 is that the first section refers to Jews and the second section refers to the church. The phrase "all these things" in verse 33 is linked to 23:36, which says, "All these things shall come upon this generation." In 24:8 "all these things" refers to the beginning of tribulation. Therefore, in verse 33 "all these things" refer to the false Christs, wars, famine, pestilence, earthquakes, etc.; they also refer to the beginning of the tribulation. "Know that it is near." "It" refers to the kingdom. This corresponds with Luke 21:31, which says that "the kingdom of God is near."</P><P>Verse 34:"Truly I say to you that this generation shall by no means pass away until all these things happen." "Generation" is genea, which is not the same as aeon. The Chinese interpret a generation as thirty years. Other nations consider forty years as a generation. Such an understanding makes it difficult to explain this passage. "This" generation would become the generation who lived when Matthew lived. Then these things should have already been fulfilled; by now they should have already taken place. The teaching of the historical school that Matthew 24 has taken place is based on this. They say that the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus was exactly forty years after the Lord spoke verse 34, and that was a generation. Because of this kind of difficulty, some change the word "generation" to "race," saying that it refers to the Jews. This is not correct, because: (1) in Matthew 1:17 there would be fourteen races from Abraham to David. (2) We cannot arbitrarily change the word because we encounter some difficulties. (3) If it were the word "race," then "this generation shall by no means pass away until" would indicate that the Jewish race can become extinct. This can never be. The Lord Himself was a Jew. What then is the explanation of genea? We should seek proofs from the Old Testament. According to Psalm 12:7, "this generation" means the moral condition of a people; it is not a physical generation. The generation in Deuteronomy 32:5 is not thirty or forty years or a lifetime, but the period in which the condition of crookedness and perversity lasts. That is how long the generation lasts. If the perversity is not taken away, it will continue to be the crooked generation. In Deuteronomy 32:20 the word "generation" is genea in the Septuagint. Proverbs 30:11-14 says, "There is a generation." Obviously, this does not refer to a lifetime or a few years; it refers to a period of time characterized by its moral climate. In what follows there is light also. In Matthew 11:16 and 12:39, 41 the sin of "this generation" refers to all the wicked and adulterous people of the past and future put together; thus, the generation lasts as long as the wicked and adulterous ones last. Matthew 12:42, 45 and 23:36 also contain the word "generation" ( genea). Therefore, the meaning of 24:34 is that before this wicked, adulterous, perverse, and crooked generation will pass away, all these things will have been fulfilled. The generations in Matthew 1:17 refer to people, not to people's morality; hence, it is different from "generation" in verse 34. "This generation" includes three kinds of people: (1) the Gentiles who worship idols and reject God, (2) the Jews who reject Christ, and (3) the apostates, the modernists. Before these people pass away, all the tribulations must be fulfilled. The Lord Himself will cast these things away. Before the kingdom comes, all these things shall be fulfilled. The kingdom comes after this generation passes away.</P><P>In the Scriptures cosmos should be translated "world"; aeon, "age"; and genea, "generation."</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_093.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_095.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 15: Study on Matthew &nbsp; pg 94</div><br></body></html>
