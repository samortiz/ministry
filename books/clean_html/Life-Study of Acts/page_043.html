<h2 class="head1">PETER AND JOHN BEFORE THE SANHEDRIN</h2><p>The crucial point in Acts 4 concerns Christ the Healer revealed in chapter three. The healing recorded in Acts 3 did not take place outside the holy city; it happened not only in the city but on the premises of the temple. Hence, many of those in the temple became involved in this case. However, the rulers and administrators in Judaism did not agree with any activity done in the name of the One they denied, condemned to death, and killed. But they could not deny the fact that the lame man had been healed, and he had been healed through the name of Jesus, not by human ability. Moreover, Peter and John were Galileans, not residents of Jerusalem. They came from the despised region of Galilee. Finally, there was great turmoil, and it was difficult for the Jewish leaders to handle the situation. The Jewish leaders could not go along with the Galilean fishermen nor agree with what they did in the name of the One they denied and crucified. Therefore, unable to keep silent, they came together and held a counsel.</p><p>Acts 4:15 says, &ldquo;But having ordered them to go away outside the Sanhedrin, they conferred with one another.&rdquo; The Sanhedrin was a council composed of the chief priests, the elders, the lawyers, and the scribes. It was the highest court of the Jews (Luke 22:66; Acts 5:27, 34, 41). The Sanhedrin had the authority to decide matters without consulting a higher power.</p><p>In Acts 4 we see that the Sanhedrin handled the matter concerning Peter and John in a very cautious way. They conferred with one another and said, &ldquo;What shall we do to these men? For that indeed a notable sign has occurred through them is manifest to all those dwelling in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. But in order that it may not be spread further among the people, let us threaten them to speak no longer to any man in this name. And having called them, they charged them not to utter anything at all nor teach in the name of Jesus&rdquo; (vv. 16-18). After threatening them, &ldquo;they released them, finding no way how they could punish them on account of the people, because they all were glorifying God for what had happened&rdquo; (v. 21). Perhaps fearing that the people might stone them if they punished Peter and John, the Sanhedrin released them.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE STONE FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2><p>When Peter and John were asked by what power or in what name they healed the lame man, Peter took the opportunity to say more concerning Christ as the Healer. Chapter four, therefore, is actually the continuation of Peter&rsquo;s presentation of the Healer. In chapter three he presented this Healer in six aspects: God&rsquo;s Servant, the Holy One, the Righteous One, the Author of life, the Prophet, and the seed in whom all the families of the earth will be blessed. All these aspects of the Healer are for our benefit. But in chapter four Peter presents an aspect of the Healer that is especially for God; he presents Christ as the stone for God&rsquo;s building.</p><h2 class="head2">The Stone-Savior</h2><p>Acts 4:12 says, &ldquo;And there is no salvation in any other; for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved.&rdquo; This verse is often used in the preaching of the gospel. But have you ever heard it used in relation to verse 11? Acts 4:11 says, &ldquo;This is the stone which was despised by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone.&rdquo; These verses indicate that the stone in verse 11 is the Savior. The stone despised by the builders has become the cornerstone, and there is no salvation in any other name. We can be saved only in the name of Jesus, and Jesus is the stone. This means that we have a Stone-Savior. In the four gospels we have the King-Savior in Matthew, the Slave-Savior in Mark, the Man-Savior in Luke, and the God-Savior in John. Now in the book of Acts we have the Stone-Savior. Our Savior is not only the King, a Slave, a Man, and God&mdash;He is also a stone for God&rsquo;s building.</p><p>In 4:7 Peter and John were asked by what power or in what name they had healed the lame man. Then in verse 10 Peter said, &ldquo;Let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in this name this man stands before you well.&rdquo; Here Peter speaks boldly concerning the name of Jesus Christ. Then in verse 11 he says that this name is the stone which was despised by the builders. Although Peter was uneducated and unlearned (v. 13) he could nevertheless declare that Jesus Christ is the stone despised by the builders. Who were the builders who despised this stone? These builders were the leaders in the Sanhedrin.</p>
