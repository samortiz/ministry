My thought was that if the Lord wanted to do something in America, He would surely raise up some saints in America to do this work
At that time the Lord greatly used two books written by Watchman Nee-The Normal Christian Life and The Normal Christian Church Life
Because the Lord had prepared all these seeking believers when these two books were published the hungry Christians devoured their contents
The second matter that we will consider in this message is the way that God takes to accomplish His eternal purpose
Once we have seen that God has purposed something according to His own desire, we need to find out how He accomplishes this purpose
God's eternal purpose is to have a living, corporate Body through which He can express Himself as the Triune God
God the Father in God the Son as God the Spirit will be expressed and manifested through a corporate Body composed of human beings
The fact that man was created in the image of God reveals that man was created to express God, for an image is an expression
The fact that man was given authority over all the earth means that man is to be God's representative on the earth
From the way in which God created man, we can see that God's purpose in creating man was that man would express Him and represent Him
On the day of Pentecost, following the Lord's resurrection, the Holy Spirit was poured out from the heavens to the earth
Christ's incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection are all in this Spirit, who is the realization of Christ
When we first heard the gospel and received the Lord, the all-inclusive Spirit entered into us and regenerated us
After regenerating us, the Spirit continues to work in us to transform us from our old, human nature into a new, divine nature
The third step that the Spirit takes is to work in us to cause us to realize that we are members of the Body of Christ
While the Spirit is transforming us, we will have the realization that we must fellowship with others and have a meeting life
If you meet with the Lord in the morning by yourself, surely the Lord within you will lead you to meet with the saints in the evening
At the Lords coming back His work of transformation in us will be completed and He will transform even our body into His glorious likeness
Upon hearing this answer, you may wonder, 'If Brother Lee is not starting a new movement, then what is he doing'?
We know from church history that Satan has done and continues to do many things to damage the Body of Christ and the genuine church life
The brother who wrote the article said that in 1919 there were more than one thousand five hundred denominations
We must forget about all the foreign things and all the division, and we must practice the church life in a simple and general way
The problem today is that when a believer goes to Los Angeles, he does not know where to go, because there is so much confusion
In addition to praying for these believers, we need to fellowship with them to stir up their hearts to love the Lord more
The Holy Spirit will have the ground in us to bring us on and to apply to us everything that God has accomplished for His eternal purpose
God's central thought and eternal intention is to work Himself into us to become life to us and even to become everything to us
We feel empty because we were made to contain God, and if we do not have God within us, we are merely empty vessels
To believe in the Lord Jesus is not merely to believe that He is our Savior; to believe in the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into our spirit
When we believe in the Lord Jesus, God in Christ as the Spirit enters into our spirit and begins to dwell within us
As the content within us, the Triune God wants to fill us with Himself in order to become our life and everything
After we have believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him into us, we can be filled with Him by eating and drinking Him
The Gospel of John reveals that the Lord is the heavenly bread for us to feed upon and the living water for us to drink
Matthew 4:4 also tells us that we should not live on bread alone but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God
To understand the way for us to unceasingly partake of the Lord as our food, drink, and life supply, we must see that God is triune
The Bible reveals that God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit , yet this does not mean that there are three Gods
Concerning those among the nations who receive the Lord, the Lord instructed us to baptize them into 'the name'
Over the course of the day, we will have ice, then water, and then vapor, but can we say that these are three different items?
When we tune our heart to Him, He comes into our spirit, and we have the sense that we have been touched within
Our love for the Lord may be very small, but even though we may have only a little love for Him in our heart, this is sufficient
To read the Word with our spirit means that when we come to the Word, we need to contact it with the innermost part of our being
We must contact the Word with the deepest part of our being, and we must not merely understand the Word but sense the Word
We must not only understand the Word with our mind and love it with our heart; we must also sense it with our spirit
To properly read the Word, we also need to use our heart to love the Word and our spirit to contact and sense the Word
If possible, we should rise up every morning and spend some time to contact the Lord by reading His Word in a living way
In those ten minutes we do not need to read too many verses, nor do we need to think too much about what we are reading
If we pray over the Word every day, we will sense the presence of the Lord and the anointing of the Holy Spirit
Of merely praying what we have memorized or what we are thinking, we pray according to the sense that is within us
Eventually, while he is in the presence of the Lord, the Lord within him will remind him to pray for his mother
When this brother prays for his mother, his prayer will not be out of his self but out of the Lord who is within him
The Lord can speak many things to us, bring us into His presence, enlighten us, and show us all our weaknesses, faults, and defilements
We grow by feeding on the Lord, and we feed on the Lord by reading the Word in a living way and by praying to the Lord with the Word
It would be wonderful if we had more time, but we should spend at least fifteen minutes to read the Word and pray to the Lord in this way
We will experience the infilling and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and spiritual gifts, light, life, and power will flow out of us
When they do, they pray according to their environment, situation, and circumstances, or solely from their memory or natural mentality
Even when they read the Word, they exercise only their mind, and the result is that they have many peculiar thoughts
When we pray and read the Word, we do so not to receive knowledge, doctrines, and teachings but to contact the Lord and to be fed by Him
The Lord will speak to us, reveal Himself to us, and bring us into the light, exposing to us our real condition
They will become rich, powerful, strong, and living, and in such an atmosphere many sinners will be brought to the Lord
The secret, the key, to all these wonderful things is to contact the Lord through reading the Word and praying in a prevailing way
In the evening after working the whole day, you may be tired, so it may be difficult to contact the Lord in a fresh and living way
In the Old Testament the children of Israel had to collect manna every day during the time that they were in the wilderness
In the past years in the Far East, we have strongly emphasized our need to spend time with the Lord in the morning
Every Christian should rise up early in the morning to keep the morning watch, spending time with the Lord by reading the Word and praying
If we realize that we are vessels and that the Lord desires to fill us with Himself, we should take action to contact Him
The way that we do this is by loving Him, consecrating ourselves to Him, and contacting Him in His Word every day
The Lord is living, real, and available, and He is waiting for us to enjoy Him, receive Him, and experience Him
If you understand the verses, you can pray over them, but if not, you can simply pass over the verses and go on to the next verses
Perhaps when you come to these verses again after two years, you will understand them and will be able to pray over them
Before you go to work, you eat breakfast, and the food that you eat in the morning energizes you and enables you to live during the day
Similarly, we need to exercise our being to contact the Lord in a living way so that He can become everything to us
Christ is living, real, rich, infinite, and available, yet He needs us to cooperate, enjoy, take, and experience Him
No one can dispute the fact that true Christians fear God, worship God, and seek to live and walk according to God's will
What does it mean to be spiritual, and what is the difference between being spiritual and being good or religious?
To be spiritual is also to be one who is filled with the Spirit, for the Spirit is the reality of Christ, and Christ today is the Spirit
A Christian is not a good man or a religious man; a Christian is a spiritual man, a man mingled and filled with Christ as the Spirit
Eventually, this man hears that he is a sinner before God and that God sent His Son, the Lord Jesus, to die on the cross to redeem man
From this we can see that it is very possible to become a religious person without becoming a truly spiritual person
When the opportunity arises for this brother to give a short word in the meeting, he stands up and speaks from his spirit
God's desire is that we would be spiritual, that is, that we would be filled, occupied, and saturated with Christ
Since our need today is to be filled and saturated with the Spirit, we must consider what we need to do in order to experience the Spirit
In order for us to become spiritual, we all need to have at least one time when we come to the Lord and are met by Him in a definite way
We must come to the Lord in a definite, purposeful way, not to pray for various things but to meet the Lord and to be met by Him
We will realize that to be a Christian is to be in the spirit and that the Christian life is absolutely a matter in the spirit
Question: Can going to the Lord in the way that you are speaking of and praying in such a prevailing way be considered complete surrender?
If we seek the Lord with a sincere heart, a right spirit, and a pure motive, the Lord will surely keep, guard, and protect us
May the Lord bring us all into such an experience and bring us from being good and religious men to being genuine spiritual men
When the early Christians came together during the time of the apostles, they did not have any regulations, forms, or rituals
It would not match his spirit, meet his need, fit his spiritual condition, or satisfy the longing of his spirit
At that time many of us felt that there was something wrong with Christianity, so we made a decision to forsake everything of Christianity
We received these three items absolutely, but outside of these three things we did not receive anything that Christianity brought to us
We made a list of all the things in Christianity and examined them one by one to see if we could find these things in the Scriptures
Eventually, we had to cross nearly every item off our list and let it go because we could not find it in the Scriptures
We checked the things that we saw in Christianity against the Scriptures, and one by one we crossed nearly everything off our list
In addition to abandoning all the things that were foreign to the Scriptures, we knew that we also needed to pray
We began to receive light from the Scriptures concerning the proper way for the Lord's children to meet together
After we sing a hymn, another brother may stand up and read a passage from the Scriptures and give a short message or testimony
If we meet in such a way, surely Christ will be exhibited and expressed, and all the saints will be strengthened, anointed, and enlightened
In the Old Testament when the children of Israel came together, the Lord demanded that they not come empty-handed
The rich produce that the children of Israel brought and offered to the Lord is a type of the all-inclusive Christ
A proper Christian meeting is one in which all the participants bring something of the Lord to exhibit, express, and share with one another
Of course, this is not a form, because forms never work, but we have found that sitting in this way can be very helpful to our meetings
To have proper Christian meetings, we must contact the Lord daily in our private life so that we will be living Christians
We must come to the meetings with the realization and understanding that we are coming to exhibit Christ and to share Christ with others
When some hear this word, they may feel that since their Christian life is marked by failure, they have nothing to bring to the meetings
If you come to the meeting and pray in this way, many of the saints may be deeply touched, and tears may come to their eyes
If you bring your failures to the meeting and open yourself to the Lord and to the Body, your failures will disappear
If you come at 7:15 and are the first one to arrive for the meeting, you can begin to pray to the Lord quietly
In everything we do, we must act according to the Spirit in a very fine, divine, and orderly way, but there is no need for us to be formal
The second requirement is that when we come together, we must forget about all regulations, forms, rituals, routines, and programs
Answer: In principle, we should end the meeting in the same way that we begin the meeting-according to the leading of the Spirit
It does not matter whether he believes in immersion or sprinkling or what he believes related to head covering or foot-washing
Others who were more subjective, however, stopped coming because they could not dance or play the tambourine as they wished
When they played the tambourine, we begged them not to, saying, 'Dear brother, please do not play the tambourine here
When you come together to share your testimonies or to study the Word in a mutual way, this is also a church meeting
Question If we were to have a meeting for young people on a certain evening during the week would that also be considered a ministry meeting
We must realize that in the meetings of the church, everyone has the responsibility to share something in a mutual and spontaneous way
If we will give up all the hindrances, bonds, and frustrating elements, the Holy Spirit will have a free way to move
If the believers in a particular city would practice this and be faithful in this matter, many believers would be attracted
Similarly, to maintain our spiritual health and to have a proper church life, we need to meet together several times in a given week
Every week we need to meet together to pray, to study the Word, and to fellowship together and admonish one another
The word often in the phrase as often as you drink it indicates that we need to have the Lord's table as often as possible
Ordinarily, the saints need to meet together three to four times a week for prayer, the study of the Word, fellowship, and the Lord's table
