MOVING AND LIVING WITH THE BELIEVERS</h2><p>In 21:1-14 we see the Lord moving and living with the believers. In resurrection, the Lord was not only meeting with the brothers but also moving and living with them. He is not only with us when we meet; He is even with us in our daily walk. Wherever we go, He goes. Whatever we do, He is there with us. Whether we are right or wrong, the Lord is with us.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Moving with the Disciples to the Sea</h2><p>In 21:1-11, the Lord moved with the disciples to the sea, manifesting Himself again to them at the sea of Tiberias. Peter, the leading brother, took the lead to backslide into the world, saying, &ldquo;I am going fishing&rdquo; (21:3). Six of the other disciples said, &ldquo;We also are coming with you.&rdquo; Not only did the six disciples follow Peter, but even the Lord Jesus followed him. The Lord did not say to Peter, &ldquo;Peter, what are you doing? Are you backsliding from My call? Are you going back to the sea? I will never go with you. If you go there, you must go on your own.&rdquo; Some may say, &ldquo;If I go to a movie theater, will the Lord Jesus go there with me?&rdquo; Yes, He will go with you. He is not only with you in the meeting place but even in a movie theater. But He will not go with you to the theater to give you peace, but to trouble you, to stir you up, and to tell you to leave that place. Because He would be with you at the movie theater, you could never have a sweet enjoyment while being there. Eventually you would have to say, &ldquo;I must forget about this movie, for Jesus will not leave me alone.&rdquo; This is life in resurrection. In resurrection, the Lord Jesus moved to the sea with the disciples.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Appearing Again to Train the Disciples<br />to Realize His Invisible Presence</h2><p>Verse 1 says, &ldquo;After these things, Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias.&rdquo; This proves that His coming to the disciples in 20:26 was actually a manifestation, for here it says that He &ldquo;manifested Himself again.&rdquo; Once again, He was training them to practice His invisible presence. It was not a matter of His coming but of His manifestation. Whether they were conscious of His presence or not, He was with them all the time. But for the sake of their weakness, He sometimes manifested His presence in order to strengthen their faith in Him.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Training the Disciples to Live by Faith in Him</h2><p>The Lord manifested Himself to the disciples in chapter twenty-one to train them, especially Peter, to live by faith in Him. John 21:2-14 reveals two main things: the weakness of the regenerated people who have been committed with the divine mission of God, and the all-sufficient provision of the Lord who can help us live on this earth for His commission, for His purpose, and for His testimony. Let us first consider the weakness of those who had been regenerated and commissioned by God.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Peter and Other Disciples<br />Backsliding to Their Old Occupation<br />from the Lord&rsquo;s Call</h2><p>At the beginning of this chapter, we see a picture of seven disciples under the leadership of Peter (vv. 2-3). Along with Peter, there were Thomas, Nathanael, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples. The number seven represents the whole Body. What were the whole Body and their leader doing? They were backsliding from the Lord&rsquo;s call to their old occupation (Matt. 4:19-20; Luke 5:3-11). Peter said to the other six disciples, &ldquo;I am going fishing&rdquo; (v. 3). His purpose in going fishing was to make a living, to get some food to eat. All the other disciples said, &ldquo;We also are coming with you&rdquo; (v. 3). Because Peter was the leader, the others went fishing under his leadership. Thus, the whole Body went fishing, forgetting their divine commission. The Lord had instructed them to tarry at Jerusalem, for they had been commissioned (Luke 24:49). The Lord had told them to wait in Jerusalem for the day when they would all be clothed with heavenly power from on high. But this picture in chapter twenty-one reveals that the disciples had left that position, giving up that ground. By leaving Jerusalem and coming to Galilee, they gave up their position. They had decided to go to the sea to fish. Peter and the other disciples went fishing because of their living. They might have lacked a sufficient supply of food and were very concerned about it. Peter might have said, &ldquo;We only have food for one meal. I don&rsquo;t know where the next meal is coming from. I&rsquo;m going fishing.&rdquo; Not only did the six disciples go fishing with Peter; the Lord Jesus went also.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_183.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_185.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of John &nbsp; pg 184</div><br></body></html>
