   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S UNIQUE INTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The heart of God is fully occupied with the living Person of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because His attention is focused on this living Person, God has no interest in giving us things such as immersion, tongues-speaking, healing, circumcision, the Sabbath, head covering, or doctrines about prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s unique intention is to give us His Son as a living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, because of the fall, we are easily distracted to care for other things in place of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is quite possible that even among us in the Lord s recovery we may care for any number of things instead of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For instance, we may care more about the church service than we care for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is crucial for us to have a vision of this all-inclusive living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This Person includes the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; He includes divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although this living Person is so all-inclusive, He is very practical to us, for, as the life-giving Spirit, He is in our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, He is in the heavens as the Lord, the Christ, the King, the Head, the High Priest, and the heavenly Minister; on the other hand, He is in our spirit to be everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is God, the Father, the Redeemer, the Savior, man, life, light, and the reality of every positive thing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the living Person of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE LIVING PERSON REVEALED</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have pointed out that Paul s Epistles were written according to God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But we also need to see that a very high degree of intelligence was required to interpret this revelation and to express it in words.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Others may receive such a revelation, but, unlike Paul, they may not have the ability to understand it and to convey it in language.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have seen that Paul, a highly educated person, was a leading religionist.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to his darkened mentality, nothing could compare to Judaism with its law, Scriptures, priestly service, and traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As one who always pursued what he thought was best, he was wholly given to these things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He despised the followers of Jesus; he considered that they were merely following an insignificant Nazarene, whereas he was zealous for the traditions of his fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But one day, when it pleased God the Father, the living Person of the Son of God was revealed in him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When this Person appeared to him, he fell to the ground and spontaneously called, Who art thou, Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Acts 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Immediately the Lord replied, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the darkened understanding of Saul of Tarsus, Jesus had been buried in a tomb, and His disciples had stolen His body and hidden it somewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But now Saul was shocked to realize that Jesus was living, was speaking from the heavens, and was being revealed to him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From the time this living Person was revealed in Saul, the veil was taken away and Saul s keen mind was enlightened with respect to the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Henceforth, he cared for this Person and no longer cared for religion or tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Pray that you may see such a vision of the living Person of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Also pray that others will see this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Pray that they will see this living Person and care for Him instead of things such as the Sabbath, head covering, healing, and spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to pray that we shall care for this living Person more than anything, even more than for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without this living Person as the reality and content of the church life, even the church life will become a tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Oh, it is vital that we see this living Person!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE LIVING PERSON VERSUS ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Though we have a good deal of knowledge of Bible doctrine, our burden is not to minister doctrine; it is to minister the living Son of God as the embodiment of the processed Triune God realized as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not treasure anything, including our Bible knowledge or spiritual experience and attainments, in place of this living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Daily and hourly, we need to experience this living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church is the Body of this Person, His practical and living expression.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because this living Person is everything to us, there is no need for us to seek mere holiness, spirituality, victory, love, or submission.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, He is within us to be whatever we need.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In a forthcoming message we shall see that this One is now living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What we lack is not holiness or victory it is this living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is versus everything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Without Him, everything is a tradition made either by others or by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May we all see that today this living Person is versus all things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Apart from Christ, the living Person of the Son of God, whatever we have is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, a brother may love his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But if he loves her apart from Christ, even this is religious.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The same is true of sisters who submit to their husbands apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This kind of submission is religious and traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I have known some Chinese wives who were submissive simply because they were submissive by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before they were saved, they were submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After they became Christians, they became good, submissive, Christian wives.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But this kind of submission has nothing to do with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is the expression of Chinese tradition, not of the living Person of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am concerned that many of us are trying to practice the church life apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If this is the case, our church life will be nothing more than a religion with its own kind of tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How desperately we need a vision of this living Person!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is crucial that He be revealed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Before I received a vision of the living Person, I was one who kept many traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But one day it pleased God to reveal His Son in me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now I know that this living Person is the embodiment of the processed, all-inclusive Triune God realized in my spirit as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In my spirit I enjoy Him, experience Him, partake of His riches, and live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To be a Christian is to be one who is occupied with the living Person, not with religion.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Judaism is a religion formed by man in dead letters with vain traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But the Son of God is life, the uncreated, eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For our experience and enjoyment, this One is the all-inclusive Spirit with the divine reality John 1:14; 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I do not want anything to do with religion I want this living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Which do you choose man s religion or the living Person of God s Son?</S>
