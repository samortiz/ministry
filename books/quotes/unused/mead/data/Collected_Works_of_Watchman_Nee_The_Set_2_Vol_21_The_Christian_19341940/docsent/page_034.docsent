   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD INTERRUPTING MAN'S SPEAKING Issue No. 13 Scripture Reading: Luke 9:33-35; Matt 17:24-27; Acts 10:34-35, 44-46</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God is a speaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many portions in the Bible are God's direct speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although other portions are not God's direct speaking, they are nevertheless spoken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Consequently, the Bible says that these other portions are also the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this world, only human beings can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But man's speaking cannot be compared with God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is best at speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nearly the whole Bible is filled with God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is constantly speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One interesting thing that the Bible shows us is that God is not only the best at speaking; He is also the best at listening.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many times, while men speak, God listens.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Old Testament, a few men spoke, and their speakings were very unpleasant and rather meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even I am annoyed by their speakings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet God listened; He listened to their speakings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of the sixty-six books of the Bible, do you know which one contains the most of man's speaking?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is one book in the Bible which records more of man's speaking than the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is the book of Job Of the forty-two chapters in Job, thirty-five chapters are on man's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We see Job speaking and his three friends speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We see Elihu speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One by one they spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In reading through the whole book, some of their speakings were not at all pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the end God came in and said, "You have all talked about Me. But you are all wrong; you are speaking blindly and guessing blindly." Job's friends spoke, and Job argued with them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This goes on chapter after chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Job's first friend gave his sermon, and Job spoke a sermon back to him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A second friend gave a sermon, and Job followed it with another sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A third friend gave a sermon, and Job followed it with another sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are six sermons in a row.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The three friends of Job each gave a sermon, and Job gave three sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What was God doing?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was silent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Elihu eventually became angry!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was a man who knew God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A man who knew God became angry!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"You are all talking nonsense here.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You are all wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Elihu became stirred up!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He could not hold himself back any longer!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He had to speak!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But still God was not stirred up!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God did not speak until chapter thirty-eight, after Elihu had finished his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The book of Job shows us that God is very capable of listening; He is never hasty.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even though these men were speaking nonsense and making wild guesses, God was still listening.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If it were us, we would have stopped them after one or two wrong words; we would have interrupted their speaking with our words.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We cannot listen.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet we see in the book of Job that God is a listening God; He listens all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Old Testament, the book of Job contains man's speaking the most.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the New Testament, we do not have a similar book.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But there is a talkative person in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Old Testament contains a talkative book, which is Job The New Testament contains a talkative person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Who is this talkative person?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I believe all of us know him, and there is no need for any introduction.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the New Testament, one person was very talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The minute there was an opportunity, he would speak.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Who is this person?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I believe we all know that he is our brother Peter, the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He loved to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The minute he showed up, he was speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The minute an opportunity arose, he spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Three passages in Luke 9, Matthew 17, and Acts 10 show us that Peter was full of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In these three instances, there is one thing in common: God never allowed Peter to finish his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Peter spoke three times, and in every instance God did not allow Peter to finish his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Peter would speak only a few words, and before finishing one sentence, or a long discourse, God would come in and interrupt his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hence, our subject today is "God Interrupting Man's Speaking."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are very familiar with these three stories.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But I will repeat them once more.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Peter beheld the glory of the Lord Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At that time, the Lord Jesus put aside His own flesh and revealed Himself in the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Both Moses and Elijah were there, and when they were about to leave, Peter said, "Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make three tents here, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah" Matt 17:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Immediately, God spoke from heaven, "This is My Son...Hear Him!" v. 5 . As Peter spoke, God interrupted him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We do not know what else Peter wanted to say.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But God interrupted him and did not allow him to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"Hear Him!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hear Him!"</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Peter needed to exercise his ears, not his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When you are before the Son of God, it is not the time to use your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is not the time to tell God what He should do.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When you are before the Son of God, you should use your ears to hear what He has to say.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is not the time to speak; it is the time to hear and see.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is why God interrupted Peter with His speaking from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Once a few tax collectors came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They did not come to collect Caesar's taxes; they collected taxes for the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They came for Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They did not come to anyone other than Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is like newspaper reporters, who look only for the government spokesman.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They do not look for anyone else; they always go to the spokesman because through his mouth they can always hear something.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Others may not be willing to say anything, but the spokesman will always leak some kind of news.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>They might not be able to find out anything from the other disciples, but they should be able to find out something from Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Hence, they went to see Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Peter did not go into the house to check with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Verse 25 says, "He came into the house."</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This proves that Peter and the Lord were in two different places.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Perhaps one was inside the house and the other was outside the house.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Peter did not go into the house to ask Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He answered rashly, "Yes."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But then he thought about it and wondered what would happen if He did not pay the tax.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The word was out, but he went into the house anyway to ask the Lord whether or not he should pay.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When Peter entered the house, the Lord Jesus anticipated his question.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Please pay attention to the word anticipated.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Jesus asked him first.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This means that Peter was about to ask a question, but the Lord asked him first.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Suppose that there are two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Both want to speak, but one speaks first.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This is what it means to anticipate.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The Lord anticipated Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>His interruption came even quicker than the time on the Mount of Transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>On the Mount of Transfiguration, God interrupted after a few sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>But here, no word had even been spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The words were interrupted while they were still inside Peter's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The Lord Jesus asked him, "From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?" v. 25 . Peter answered, "From strangers." Jesus answered, "So then the sons are free" v. 26 . When the Lord said that the sons do not need to pay tax, He annulled Peter's word outside the house or in the courtyard.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Later the Lord Jesus said, "But that we do not stumble them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>And when you open its mouth, you will find a stater; take that and give it to them for Me and you" v. 27 . Here Peter's words were interrupted the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The talkative Peter was interrupted by God the second time.</S>
