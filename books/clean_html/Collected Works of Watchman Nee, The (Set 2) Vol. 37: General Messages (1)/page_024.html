<h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>What is poverty? Poverty is not just a question of quantity but also a question of quality. First Corinthians 3 shows us the distinction between gold, silver, and precious stones, and the wood, grass, and stubble. Second Timothy 2 shows us the distinction between the vessels of honor and the vessels of dishonor. Such distinctions separate the poor ones from the rich ones. Even when we have something, we still have to ask what it is that we have. If all we have is a pile of wood, grass, and stubble, we are still poor. It is not enough for us to be a vessel; we still have to ask whether we are a wooden and earthen vessel or a gold and silver vessel. It is easy to be proud when we think that we have something. As long as we have something, we think that we are marvelous. Little do we know the kind of material that we have. This is poverty.</p><p>Poverty also means superficiality, childishness, and immaturity. A rich life is a mature life. We have to realize that there is a difference between growth and maturity. A child grows year by year, but after he becomes an adult, the important matter is no longer growth; rather, it is maturity. If one has only a period of growth, his life is not yet rich enough. There must be a period of maturity before there can be riches. Those who take the initial period as the whole period are those who think that they have something; they are Laodiceans, and they are poor ones. Therefore, initial experiences always spoil us from having further experiences, shallow experiences hinder us from having deep experiences, and shallow knowledge hinders us from acquiring deep knowledge.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>Being rich is not merely a question of having something. It is a question of how much one has, what he has, and to what degree he has it. It is not the initial experiences. It is not a mere understanding of doctrine or something that one claims with his mouth. When God opens the eyes of a person, he begins to enter the land of spiritual riches.</p><p>One brother spent a great deal of time to study the Bible during the first year after his salvation. He concentrated on one subject: the Lord's second coming. He did a clear analysis of the things concerning the Lord's second coming, and he felt quite proud of himself. One day he met a sister who was deep in the Lord. When she talked to him about the Lord's second coming, she did not analyze; her attention was on how one should prepare himself for His coming. On that day, he learned a lesson. While he was talking about the Lord's coming, here was a person who was waiting for the Lord's coming. The one who only talked about the Lord's coming was poor, while the sister who waited for the Lord's coming was rich.</p><p>All those who have truly seen something before the Lord are not presumptuous and do not think that they have something. For example, it may take a person one, two, ten, or even twenty times of revelation before he can really see the truth in Romans 6. The first time he sees the truth in Romans 6, he may feel that nothing more can top this experience. He may say that he has seen it. But the second time he sees it, he will say, "I did not see this before." This means that when the light comes, it will tear down what one originally had. There is a brother who knows the truth about the church very well. Once a few people gathered together and had some light concerning the church. This brother said, "How interesting! I never knew what the church was. But thank the Lord that I see it today." Others may think that if he did not know the church, then no one else would have known anything about the church. But the minute he saw the light, he realized that he had nothing. The shining of the light is also the swallowing of the light; the greater light swallows up the lesser light. All light disappears under greater light. Every time a person truly sees something before the Lord, he will feel that he has never seen anything. This does not mean that he has actually seen nothing; he may have seen something. But after he receives the greater light, he will not think much of what he saw before. On the contrary, he will realize that he had nothing.</p><p>Riches come from enlightenment. When the light shines, we become rich. However, when we are enlightened, we do not have a feeling of increase but one of stripping. Once the light comes, all the former things are shattered, and what we originally had is torn down. It is true that when we are under the light, we have some increase before God. But on our side, we do not feel anything. What goes on before the Lord is one thing, and what goes on in our feeling is another thing. God may give us something once, twice, or three times. If we feel that we have increased, it proves that we have not seen anything. If we truly see something, we will feel as if we are newly saved and just starting out on our journey. It does not mean that we were not saved before this time; it means that in our feeling, we feel as if we were not saved. We feel empty and feel as if we never had a beginning. Hence, those who are rich feel that they have nothing under the light.</p><p>Our God is a rich God. He does not wish to see His children being in poverty. His works are not works of wood, grass, and stubble. The vessels He uses are not vessels of dishonor. He is a rich God, and His vessels are rich vessels. God's riches are deep and profound; they are such that "there is no room for it" (Mal. 3:10). His grace is always such that there is not room enough to receive it! His works in us are always such that there is not room enough to receive them. God does not work in a stingy way. He is not weak or miserly. This rich God can make us rich people. He is always giving us more and more. Every time He gives us something, we feel as if we are receiving it for the first time. This may sound strange, yet this is a fact. May the Lord be merciful to us, so that we truly see something before Him and so that we truly have the light. The proud ones are the foolish ones, and they are always poor ones. May the Lord empty us so that we can enter into His riches.</p>
