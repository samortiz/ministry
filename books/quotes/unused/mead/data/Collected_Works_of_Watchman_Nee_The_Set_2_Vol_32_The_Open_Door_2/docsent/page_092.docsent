   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since quitting the work at the refugee center, I have been living with Brother Hu in Chen's house in Bai-Tse Alley.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>During the past days I have been remaining quietly in the Lord, praying, studying the Bible, and learning to take God's dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through His enlightening I have realized that I do not know God.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>During the past two or three months, the Lord has been showing me that much of my zeal for Him in the past, much of the work I was engaged in, and many of the things that I have written to the saints in my correspondence were done out of ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many of my prayers and pursuits, though honest in motive, were but expressions of my ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I thought that it was good to be pure in heart and honest in conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now I know that ignorance is a sin, and I am beginning to understand the meaning of the words: "We should imitate faith but not the act of faith."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am still inquiring of God and looking to Him day by day as to what my future should be.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He delights not in the strength of the horse or the legs of man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He takes pleasure in them that fear Him, in those that hope in His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The brothers in Hankow are all well.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A weak member in the Lord,</S>
