   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to understand worship we must understand John 4.</S>

   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God is Spirit; therefore, we must use our spirit to worship Him.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we pour water into water, the result is water.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are joined to the Lord because our spirit can be mingled with His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we are joined to Him, we do not become one body but one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Flesh and blood and will and feelings are useless to God; only our spirit can touch God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When God created man, He put a spirit within him.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man has an element in him which is like an element in God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is Spirit, and a little part of us is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This little part in us can touch God; it can touch eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The lower forms of created life have feelings; they can choose, but they cannot worship, because they have no spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although man is very small, he is very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is a special creation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If man wants to use his spirit to worship God, he must live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He must maintain his fellowship with God, his communication with God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man's fall not only resulted in wrong acts; it affected man's whole constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the fall we see the record of human behavior and the change in the human constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and as a result, his will changed, his feelings changed, and his thoughts changed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then he was able to understand the difference between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through their sin, Adam and Eve changed the constitution God had created in them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before the fall man had a spirit and could touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the fall his spirit died.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sin affected his constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man became different.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Biologically, he was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He added his own feelings to his power of decision.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If Satan wants worship, he needs something in man that will worship him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through his soul, man can worship Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Satan did not keep his original position.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He said, "I will be like the Most High" Isa 14:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When he deceives man, he induces him to abide by his soul, not his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It takes the life of God to enliven and nourish the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Satan originally had a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After he sinned, his spirit was cut off from fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Satan now lives by his "I."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As such, he works through the self, the "I" of man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must see the difference between the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The soul is now a faculty that can decide for itself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Man can be independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this way Satan receives worship.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the meaning of the story in Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Before the fall man had to trust in God for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After the fall it was no longer necessary for man to trust in God; he could decide for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Man was never created with such power, but through the fall his constitution was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The spirit is forever tied to dependence; whereas the soul is forever tied to independence.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The man God created was of no use to Satan; he had to have an independent and proud man for his purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When man lives by his soul, he has an arrogant attitude, and Satan gains his worship.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every means is used today to enlarge man's soul through education, knowledge, etc. This generation of men is very independent and stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God wants people who are dependent upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Satan wants men who can do everything by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>So we must learn how to live by the spirit and ask the Lord to deliver us from the power of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If one is spiritual, there will be humility; if he is soulish, he will be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What is salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Salvation not only deals with our sins, but also restores our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Man is wrong both inwardly and outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is why he needs both the outward restitution as well as the inward restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is regeneration in our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When a man is saved, he is cleansed outwardly as well as changed constitutionally.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The soul cannot understand God; only the Spirit can.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must learn to lose our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is a daily work to lose our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God does not deal with our soul in the same way that he dealt with our sins in his substitutionary work.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must lose our own souls, and we must bear our cross daily.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It means to come to God and not make any judgment by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>First Corinthians 1:27-28 says that God has chosen the foolish, weak, and the lowborn.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is because they are those whose souls are not enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we live according to the spirit, God will gain our worship.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But if we live according to the soul, Satan will gain our worship.</S>
