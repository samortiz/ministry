   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Joseph was a person who denied himself.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Whatever he did was based upon the principle of self-denial.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I do not know of any other person who was offended to the degree Joseph was, yet who had not the slightest desire for revenge.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When he revealed himself to his brothers, they were terrified 45:3, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Joseph, however, not only forgave them, but received them and comforted them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He said, "Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life" 45:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here we see that the offended one comforted the offending ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Often when Christians forgive someone, they say, "Yes, I forgive you, but I also want to remind you of the seriousness of what you have done."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This kind of forgiveness does not mean anything, for actually it is not forgiveness at all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Joseph forgave his brothers, he comforted them and told them not to be angry with themselves, but to forget what they had done to him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He said that their selling him into slavery was God's doing to preserve life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Joseph did not blame his brothers for what they had done; rather, he regarded them as God's helpers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They had helped God to get him to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 7 Joseph said, "God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Hebrew word rendered "posterity" is better translated "remnant."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's purpose required a remnant.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His intention was that the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob would build Him a tabernacle so that He might establish His kingdom on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the remnant had been cut off, God's purpose could not have been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In that case, the book of Genesis would have been the last book of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Knowing that the famine would have terminated everyone living in the land of Canaan, God prepared a way for the remnant of the chosen and called race to continue to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Joseph was able to comfort his brothers because he realized that God, not they, had sent him to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He might have said, "Thank you for selling me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you had not done that, how could I be here today?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whether or not we forgive others depends upon our vision and realization.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we know that we are here for the Lord's recovery, we shall not care how much others offend us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We shall realize that the more we are offended, the more good will result.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If Joseph's brothers had not sold him into slavery, how could his dreams have been fulfilled?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His dreams were fulfilled through the ones who hated him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Joseph had a thorough realization of this and thus he could forgive his brothers for the way they mistreated him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It should be the same with us today in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we realize that we are here for the Lord's purpose, for the Lord's recovery, then we shall know that whatever happens to us is for God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Romans 8:28 says, "And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to the purpose."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Joseph loved God; therefore, whatever happened to him was for good.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be unwilling to forgive those who have offended you indicates that you are shortsighted.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if you see into the depth of what God has done, you will never seek revenge.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead, you will always be willing to forgive those who have offended you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You will say, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whatever happened to me was for good, not only for me, but for God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whatever happens to me works good for the kingdom of God."</S>
