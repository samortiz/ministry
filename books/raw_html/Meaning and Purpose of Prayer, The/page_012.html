        <h2 class="head2">Human Opinions Frustrating<br />
the Power of the Lord<br />
from Bringing About a New Beginning</h2>
<p>Another case reveals at least two major principles: human opinions frustrate the Lord&rsquo;s power, and the Lord can only begin when man comes to an end. Chapter 11 shows how human opinions frustrate the Lord&rsquo;s power. Martha and Mary sent word to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick&rdquo; (v. 3). This was an expression of their opinion in order to get the Lord to come heal their brother Lazarus. But the Lord did not respond. He heard their cry, but He did not do anything. The Lord loved these three siblings, and He heard Martha and Mary&rsquo;s cry, but He remained in the place where He was for two days. He did not do anything until Lazarus died and was buried (vv. 5-6, 17). The first thing that Martha did when she saw the Lord was to complain that He was late. She said, &ldquo;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died&rdquo; (v. 21). Although she complained because of the Lord&rsquo;s delay, the Lord taught her to not depend on her timing but on Himself. The Lord said, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life&rdquo; (v. 25). He meant that Lazarus&rsquo;s condition was not dependent upon whether He came early or late. Thus, even if Lazarus was dead, he could be resurrected because the Lord had come. The Lord Jesus is the resurrection. When we have Him, we have everything. The Lord&rsquo;s work is not dependent upon our timing.</p>
<p>This is a very good lesson, but Martha did not understand the Lord&rsquo;s words. The Lord said, &ldquo;He who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live; and everyone who lives and believes into Me shall by no means die forever. Do you believe this?&rdquo; (vv. 25-26). Martha immediately said, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God&rdquo; (v. 27). Martha did not believe the Lord&rsquo;s word; she believed something else. The Lord spoke a revelation, but Martha focused on her understanding. She did not hear the Lord&rsquo;s revelation because of her opinions. Martha was a person full of opinions.</p>
<p>Later, Martha went and called Mary her sister, saying, &ldquo;The Teacher is here and is calling you&rdquo; (v. 28). Again, this was according to Martha&rsquo;s opinion and not the Lord&rsquo;s request. The phrase <em>the Teacher is here</em> was correct, but the phrase <em>is calling you</em> was not. When Mary saw the Lord Jesus, she also said, &ldquo;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died&rdquo; (v. 32). The Lord Jesus was moved with indignation in His spirit and was troubled when He saw Mary weeping and the Jews who had come with her also weeping (vv. 33, 35). The Lord did not weep because Lazarus was dead. The Lord wept because Martha and Mary did not know Him and because their spiritual condition was pitiful. The Lord wept because they were foolish spiritually.</p>
<p>A person who suffers pain under the discipline of the Lord yet remains foolish knows neither the Lord nor what the Lord wants. Such a person is filled with his own opinions and has much to say. His condition will grieve the Lord. The Jews saw the Lord weep and expressed different opinions. This moved the Lord with indignation again (v. 38). When the Lord went to the tomb and asked them to take away the stone that was laid against the cave, Martha still had more opinions. She said, &ldquo;Lord, by now he smells, for it is the fourth day that he is there&rdquo; (v. 39). She was an opinionated person.</p>
<p>Chapter 11 shows how human opinions frustrate the Lord&rsquo;s power. The Lord was not merely frustrated by the opinions of Martha, Mary, and the Jews; He was frustrated by the opinions of His disciples. Martha and Mary wanted the Lord to come when He was not ready. Later, when the Lord wanted to go, His disciples did not want Him to go (vv. 3-16). Human opinions frustrate the manifestation of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection power. On the one hand, the Lord wanted to do something; He wanted to perform a miracle, to manifest His power in raising the dead. On the other hand, human opinions hindered every step that He took and caused problems. It seemed as though the Lord needed to overthrow every opinion before He could manifest His resurrection power. These human opinions were thorns and thistles on the Lord&rsquo;s way into resurrection. Martha, Mary, the Jews, and the disciples were full of opinions. The Lord had to remove the human opinions before He could enter into resurrection. Human opinions hinder our contact with the Lord.</p>
<p>When we draw near to the Lord in prayer, we must learn the lesson of stopping our opinions. Whether the wine has run out or a person has been dead for four days, we do not need to counsel the Lord. We should simply give it to the Lord and hear what He has to say. The Lord is everything. He gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being (Rom. 4:17). He is the resurrection and the life (John 11:25). We do not need to say this or that; we should simply listen to Him. An opinion is a problem. Many who draw near to the Lord have a difficult time learning this lesson.</p>
<p>John 11 presents another principle: the Lord does not heal man; He resurrects man. Healing involves helping man&rsquo;s weaknesses, but the Lord will not do this. Instead of immediately healing Lazarus, the Lord waited for Lazarus to die in order to raise him, because the Lord only wants to raise man. Resurrection involves waiting until man comes to an end in order to give him a new beginning. For example, it is easy for a weak brother, who often fails, to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am weak in this matter. I cannot overcome. I am a failure.&rdquo; Such prayers seem very good, but they hinder the Lord. We may be weak, but we are not weak to the point of being hopeless. We may be a failure, but we have not failed to the uttermost. The Lord must wait until we are hopelessly weak, until we are an utter failure, and until we are completely dead before He can manifest His resurrection power in us.</p>
<p>Thus, we should let go of our weaknesses and failures when we draw near to the Lord. The Lord already knows our weaknesses and failures. There is nothing we can do if He wants to delay and to wait until we no longer have any hope because we are dead, buried, and stink. If He wants to wait, we cannot make Him hurry up. If He allows us to be defeated, even our imploring Him will not make us strong. Hence, we need to learn the lesson of dropping our problems when we pray. When we are truly hopeless and at an end, the Lord will come. This is resurrection, and this is salvation.</p>

 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
