   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO...TO...TO...</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These seven churches are not the seven churches on the streets, on the campuses, in the homes, or in the factories.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are seven churches in seven cities.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The seven churches are equal to seven cities.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may think that the Lord did not compose Revelation 1:11 very well.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I do not think that any one of us would compose this verse in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord composed it in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are seven to s. The Lord told John to send this book to the seven churches as follows: to, to, to, to, to, to, to.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To what?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To the local churches!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He had to repeat all the names of the cities with so many to s and so many conjunctions so that we might see the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Can you have a church on your campus?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you think you can, you had better come back and see the to s of Revelation 1:11.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus will repeat them for you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna...</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is to the city, not to the campuses, or streets, or homes, or factories, or any denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is to this city and to that city.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Praise the Lord for His sevenfold repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is entirely to show us that in one city there is, and should be, one church, and one church is, and should be, for one city.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not my teaching but my quotation, and this quotation is from the spoken word of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Where should the church be?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Praise the Lord, it should be in the city!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How many churches should there be in one city?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is abundantly clear that there should be only one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How many churches should many cities have?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There should be one church for each city.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many cities should have many churches, but one city should have only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must be clear about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the last book in the Bible, and it is closed to so many Christians because they would not see the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are willing to see the local churches, the whole book of Revelation will open to us because our position will be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When our position is proper, we can see.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands v. 12 . It is so marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we turn, we see; we cannot say that we have not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have been condemned by many people because of this matter of the local churches, but I cannot help it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I cannot say that I have not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am so burdened with the local churches because I have seen the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I cannot help but be burdened, because I have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all need a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am afraid that there are still some friends who are doubting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But these are not our words; these are the words spoken by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no word in the entire Bible as clear as this word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One local church equals one city.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The size, the jurisdiction, and the boundary of the local church must equal that of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Revelation 1:11 is exceedingly clear.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>SIMPLY EATING AND DRINKING</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must be in the local churches, and the Lord s intention in the local churches is simply for us to eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord did not say that He would teach us or that He would instruct us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He said that He would give us something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The local churches are a matter of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the time we must be feeding on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our meeting hall is really our dining hall.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whenever we come together, we come to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What is the right condition of a local church?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If it is full of teaching, it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The local churches must be full of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whenever we come to the meeting, we should be nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then after the meeting we will say, Praise the Lord, I am filled and I am satisfied!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If when we leave a meeting we say that we are clear, then we know that we have been taught and not fed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The first one who was clear was Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After tasting the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, she was made clear.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Formerly, in a sense, she did not know, but then she knew.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is awful!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But I am sorry to say that this is the concept of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They try their best to help people to know and be more clear.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But the more teaching people receive, the more fruit of the tree of knowledge they eat.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Every meeting of the local church must be full of Christ as food, and after every meeting we all must say, Hallelujah, I am satisfied!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Though we do not know much, we are full.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is a proper local church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The local church is not a place for us to know but a place for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The local church is not a school but a dining room for heavenly eating.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The very tree of life in Genesis 2 which Adam lost is now opened to us in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord told John to write to the church in Ephesus that he who overcomes will be given the tree of life to eat in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is so clear that it is in the local churches where the Lord gives us something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the last twenty years it has always been difficult for me to give a message of mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This does not mean that I lack doctrines to give.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But there is no anointing from the Lord to give such a message.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When I speak, I must say something according to the inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The only burden that I have within is to help the Lord s children to know how to enjoy Christ by eating and drinking of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We all must learn that the local churches are not places for teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They are places for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The local churches are places where the people of God can come together to eat and to drink of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Christ is the tree of life, and He is also the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Today s Christianity only knows Christ in a public way.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They do not know a hidden Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The hidden Christ is in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Many times others have asked why we go to meetings all the time and what we do in these meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When we tell them that we go to the meetings to feed upon Christ, they simply cannot understand.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is because it is something hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is Christ as the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We all have eaten of this hidden manna in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We daily enjoy something which no one understands.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Even if they come to our meetings, they still cannot understand.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>They only say that we are beside ourselves!</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We are satisfied, but they cannot enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It is something hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>It is hidden, but we enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>So many of us who have been in Christianity and are now in the local churches have found a hidden enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This is not only the tree of life but also the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is the real enjoyment in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>It is not only the tree of life and the hidden manna but also a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me Rev 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Every meeting is not only a dining table but also a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We are not only eating, but we are also feasting on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Then when we get into eternity, the Lamb will shepherd us and guide us to springs of waters of life.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>It is not only one spring but springs of waters of life.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Day by day we will drink of these springs.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>I believe we can understand this because we have enjoyed the foretaste in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The local churches should not be places for teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We should not care for teachings, but for eating and drinking of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>As we have seen, in the New Jerusalem there is a river of water of life flowing out of the throne of the redeeming God.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>In the flowing of the living water, on both sides of the river, grows the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This is for us to eat for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Our duty is simply to eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>We will do nothing but enjoy Christ as the living water and as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Praise the Lord, we have nothing to do with the world, and we have nothing to do with Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Our only concern is to enjoy Christ and to feed on Him in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Here we enjoy Christ, here we minister Christ, here we eat Christ, and here we drink Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Hallelujah, eventually we will feast in the New Jerusalem!</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>But today we have a real foretaste in the local churches.</S>
