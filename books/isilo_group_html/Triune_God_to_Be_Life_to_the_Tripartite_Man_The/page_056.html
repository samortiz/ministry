Chapters one and two of Genesis are a record of the old creation. According to the New Testament, God's intention in the old creation was to obtain the new creation. There is a great difference between these two creations. The old creation came out of the creating hand of God, but the new creation has God's essence and element within it. God did not get into the old creation with His nature, element, and essence; rather, Satan, God's enemy, worked himself into that creation through man's fall. That creation became his expression. God, however, wants an expression through His new creation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BRANCHING OUT OF GOD,<br>IN HIS DIVINITY, INTO HUMANITY</H2><P>God's intention was to gain the new creation for His expression, but to gain this was not easy. God finished the further creation and restoration of the old creation in six days, but to make the new creation from the old creation is much more difficult. In order to complete the work of the new creation, God had to act in His divine trinity&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In eternity past, there was a conference, a council, among the Three of the Godhead (Gen. 1:26; Acts 2:23). In that conference, it was decided that the Son, the Second of the Godhead, should be the centrality and universality of the new creation. In order to accomplish this, the Triune God had to pass through a unique process. The first step of this process was the Son as the embodiment of the Divine Trinity becoming a man through incarnation. Through this step divinity got into humanity. In eternity past the Triune God was merely in divinity, but through incarnation He branched out from His divinity and with His divinity into humanity. He became a particular man with both the divine nature and the human nature. The descendants of Adam had only the human nature, and God in eternity had only the divine nature. God was in His divinity, and we, the descendants of Adam, were in our humanity. God was in His territory of divinity, and we were in our territory of humanity. Before Christ's incarnation, these two territories had nothing to do with one another. But approximately two thousand years ago, four thousand years after His creation of man, God branched out from and with His divinity into humanity.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Triune God to Be Life to the Tripartite Man &nbsp; pg 56</div><br></body></html>
