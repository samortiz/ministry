   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVE CHRIST!</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GROW CHRIST!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>PRODUCE CHRIST!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By His mercy and grace I would like to share with you how to live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 7 the Lord says, "If My words abide in you," and in verse 26 He says, "I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Right in John 15 are mentioned the two matters of the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to my experience, there is no other way to live, grow, and produce Christ, except by receiving the Word and by touching the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These are our direct means.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE VALUE OF THE NAME</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Besides the Word and the Spirit we have two other provisions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One is His name.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you come to touch the Lord and to touch His Word, you should realize that your condition is not what it should be.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In yourself you are off; it is only in His name that you are in. If you will say, "O Lord, I am before You in Your name," you will sense right away that you are no longer off.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You cannot come in anything you are; you cannot come in anything you do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is in His name alone that you are accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE VALUE OF THE BLOOD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you come to the Lord with a sincere desire to live Him, grow Him, and produce Him, the light is there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You will sense not only that you are off, but even that you are sinful in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may say to others that everything is all right, but there will be a question within, "Are you sure you are all right?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Your present condition is not all right.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is too loose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You are too light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You are too much in the self and in the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You are too much in your lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You are sinful."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you think you are all right, then you are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No one who is in the light would think he is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why is it that whenever anyone comes to God he needs an offering?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is because while we are walking on this earth, we are contaminated with the natural things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because we are still living in our natural man, in the flesh, whenever we come to God we need the trespass offering or the sin offering see Lev 4 and 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without the shedding of the blood we could not come into the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No one who is in the light would dare to say that there is nothing wrong with him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without the light you may think that you are clean.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when you come under the light, you will see how dirty you are, and that you need a thorough cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the other provision God has made for us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In ourselves we cannot come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need both the name and the cleansing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we come, we say, "Lord, I come to You not in myself but in Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I come under the blood and with the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I take the cleansing of Your redeeming blood."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This will clear the way for us to receive the Word and touch the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>HOW TO TAKE IN THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You must spend time in the Word regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You can no more neglect the Word than you can your regular meals.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before you leave for work in the morning, you must spare at least ten minutes for reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Build up this habit in a legal, strict way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You will see what a difference it makes in your life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When you get home from work, again you must get into the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First take a short nap, then kneel down, open the Word, and begin to read, pray-read, study, and search for half an hour or so.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not say you are too busy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You are not too busy to talk on the phone!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Leave the yard work for another time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is your time to be watered and pruned!</S>
