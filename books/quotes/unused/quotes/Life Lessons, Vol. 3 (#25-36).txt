In our eyes, since the first man is Adam, the second man should be his firstborn son, Cain, as the second generation of mankind
All the other millions of people are either in Adam, of Adam, and one man with Adam, or in Christ, of Christ, and one man with Christ
Of all the items that we have obtained and now possess in Adam, the first is sin, the second is condemnation, and the third is death
It is the death of the spirit, that is, the human spirit losing its function because of the break in its fellowship with God
It is the second death, that is, the human spirit, soul, and body being cast into the lake of fire to suffer the eternal torment
When we believed into the Lord, our believing brought us into Christ that we might enter into Him and become a person in Him
Our believing is our entering into Christ in reality in our spirit; our being baptized is our entering into Christ practically in water
It is God who placed us in Christ and put the Spirit and the life of Christ into us that we might be joined as one with Christ in spirit
In this way, God practically transferred us out of Adam into Christ in the Spirit and in life that we may become a person fully in Christ
When we are transferred into Christ, we also possess the riches in Christ, which are the means by which our new man in Christ lives
The sins we have in Adam caused us to be condemned in him, while the righteousness we obtain in Christ causes us to be justified in Him
The resurrection Christ brings to us begins our life in the new creation that we may partake of everything in this life of the new creation
In Christ we obtain not only the three items of righteousness, justification, and life but also every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies
5) 'But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
Christ first became flesh to join Himself to us, and then He brought us with Him through death and resurrection and into ascension
In entering into us and being joined to us, Christ not only is in us but also is living in us; that is, He is living His life in us
When we believe into the Lord and are baptized, God puts His Spirit in us and anoints us, firmly attaching us to Christ
Being in Christ refers to the fact of our having entered into Christ to partake of Him and to be joined to Him
That you also may have fellowship with us , and indeed the fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ'
When we have fellowship with God, who is light, such fellowship brings us into God's light that we may be enlightened
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
If we confess our sins in God's light, He will forgive us our sins, and the blood of Jesus His Son will cleanse us from all sin
If we do not confess our sins in order to be cleansed, our sins will interrupt the fellowship which we have with God and with Christ
We must abide in Christ according to the teaching of the Holy Spirit inwardly and according to the walk of the Lord outwardly
1) 'Abide in Him , that if He is manifested, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming'
We believe and are baptized into Christ to be joined to Him and to abide in Him for the purpose of experiencing Him
1) 'And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness'
2) 'If anyone loves Me , he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him'
We must not only experience Christ abiding in us to be our life but also experience Christ living in us to be our living
We also must experience Christ being formed in us, that is, His growing in us unto maturity until we reach His very stature
Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian , slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all '
These verses say that we who have believed in the Lord and are regenerated have put off our old man and have put on the new man
1) 'If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him'
To be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts
1) 'With all boldness, as always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death'
We do not experience Christ by our ability or by our endeavoring, but through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
All his life and work were not for expressing himself or for displaying his knowledge, his ability, or his other merits and strong points
Paul not only took Christ as his living and expression without, but he also took the mind of Christ as his mind within
Paul, who pursued the knowledge of Christ in order to experience Him more deeply, considered his pursuit of Christ to be his only task
Truthfulness, honor, righteousness, purity, loveliness, and that which is well-spoken of are six praiseworthy virtues
These virtues are the expressions of God's attributes lived out from within the pursuers of Christ, who is the embodiment of God
Since he charged the brothers in this manner he himself must obviously have been expressing Gods attributes by taking Christ as his virtues
He took Christ as the secret to experience Christ, being content and rejoicing always in any situation and in any matter
The Father is the source, the Son is the expression of the Father, and the Spirit is the realization of the Son
The soul is the part between our body and our spirit as our personality and self, by which we contact the psychological things
The spirit is our innermost part by which we know and worship God, and by which we contact the spiritual things
After the Spirit of God regenerates our spirit, He remains in our spirit, witnessing with our spirit that we are the children of God
To worship God is to contact God, which includes such things as drawing near to God, praying to God, trusting in God, and thanking God
Combining these two verses, we see that the Spirit, the Spirit of God, is the Spirit who indwells us and who is joined to us as one
That you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed the fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ'
The other aspect of our fellowship in the Lord's life is our fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ
All these parties jointly participate in the Triune God and in the church, which is His organism, thus mutually sharing in one another
3) To walk in the light-'But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another'
If we live in the fellowship of the Lord's life, the Lord's light of life within will show us our sins in the fellowship of His life
When we abide in the Lord to have fellowship with Him, we have the Lord abiding in us as our enjoyment of life
If we are willing to confess our sins to God according to His shining, He will forgive us and cleanse us from our sins
Whenever we neglect the sense of life, the fellowship of life is broken and lost, and the sense of life thus becomes dull
2 Being fearful and put to shameAbide in Him that if He is manifested we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming
If we abide in the Lord and have fellowship with Him, we spontaneously walk before the Lord and live in His will
The moment we receive the Son of God as our Savior, we have the Son of God and we have the life, because the life is in Him
That the laws are written on our hearts indicates that these laws are in life, the emphasis being on the function of life
Once we are saved, God comes to live in us and to operate in us that we may will within and work without to fulfill His good pleasure
The moving of the Holy Spirit is like an ointment anointing us within, causing us to sense God's mind and teaching us in all things
Our first responsibility toward the sense of life is to walk only according to spirit, setting our mind on the spirit
We must obey with fear and trembling the operation of God which we sense within, whether this operation is for the willing or the working
The enjoyment of the satisfaction of life and the rest of peace is an immediate issue of our obeying the sense of life
When we obey with fear and trembling the sense of life that comes from Gods moving within us we live out the salvation that we have obtained
The fulfilling of God's good pleasure is another issue of our obeying the sense of life from the operation of God in us
Obeying the teaching of the anointing is intimately related to obeying the sense of life covered in the previous lesson
The more this anointing gently rubs us within, the more the elements of God and the substance of God are rubbed into us
In the Old Testament type, first the blood was put upon the person, and then the oil for anointing was put upon the blood
Obeying the teaching of the anointing, in the previous lesson, and obeying the sense of life, in Lesson Thirty-two, are closely related
The subject of this lesson- walking according to spirit-and obeying the teaching of the anointing, in the previous lesson, are just one
These threeobeying the sense of life obeying the teaching of the anointing and walking according to spiritare but three aspects of one thing
1) 'That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit'
It refers to the general walk in our living, and it is different from the walk in Galatians 5:25, which is according to a rule
Although this too is a 'walk by the Spirit' in our living, it is not general but specific and according to a definite rule
Any living and walking that is according to things other than the spirit is a living and walking according to flesh
In these two portions and in many other verses in the New Testament, the Lord definitely promised that He will come again
3) 'The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever
To give the reward to Your slaves the prophets, and to the saints and to those who fear Your name, to the small and to the great'
Even more, we need to desire and love the Lord's coming again, not that we may gain His reward, but that we may gain His lovely Self
The first is the rapture of the overcoming believers, and the second, the rapture of the majority of the believers
1) 'For then there shall be great tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever shall be'
And that day come upon you suddenly as a snare; for it will come in upon all those dwelling on the face of all the earth'
That day' refers to the day mentioned above, the day of the coming of the great tribulation, which is unequaled before or after its time
At the end of this age, the day of the great tribulation will suddenly come as a snare upon all the inhabitants of the earth
Before the end of this age, the overcomers among God's chosen people will be raptured to God and to His throne in the heavens
Purchased from among men, they are those who follow the Lamb absolutely and who have become the firstfruit to God and to the Lamb
1) 'I also will keep you out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth'
So that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days,' that is, 'a time, and times, and half a time'
Before the three and a half years, the overcoming man-child, the overcoming saints, will be raptured to God and to His throne in the heavens
Those who have loved His appearing' ; 'You have kept the word of My endurance' ; 'He who overcomes, and he who keeps My works until the end'
