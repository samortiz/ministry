   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INDWELLING THE BELIEVERS IN THEIR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ as the life-giving Spirit indwells the believers in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, as the life-giving Spirit, Christ regenerated us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now He dwells in our spirit Rom 8:9-11; 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is a wonderful fact that Christ is not only in us, but He also dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For a person to dwell in a room means that he occupies it and fills it with his activities.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, a person accomplishes many of his intentions in his own home.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although I have a very adequate office in which to do my work, I do not like to work there; rather, I like to work in my home.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While I am dwelling in my home, I work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus today only has a home; He does not have an office.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His home is His office.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord's office is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many of us may realize that the Lord Jesus has made us His home, but not many realize that, as the Lord's home, we are also His office.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus not only dwells in us as His home, but He also works within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is carrying out all His work within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because He has many things to do within us, He is working in us twenty-four hours a day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all need to realize that today the Lord Jesus indwells us, making us His home and also His office.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is working within us as His office.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What a wonderful thought this is!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our Lord dwells in us, and while He dwells in us, He works.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He has made us His home and His office as well.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the organic union which we have with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all need to know Christ in such a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN THE BELIEVERS' HEARTS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is making His home in the believers' hearts through the Spirit's strengthening them into their spirit, that is, into their inner man Eph 3:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The strangest thing, and also the sweetest and most enjoyable thing, is that within us, the believers in Christ, there is always a kind of strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Continually, both day and night, we are being strengthened from within.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is this inward strengthening which enables us to say, "Lord Jesus, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lord, occupy me and fill me up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I desire to be possessed and taken over by You.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I want to be fully occupied by You.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Lord, I simply want to be one with You."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We fail to realize that this strengthening has a direction, that is, that Christ would make His own home in our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By this inward strengthening, gradually we will say, "Lord Jesus, fill me with Yourself and possess me in my mind, my emotions, and my will.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Fill and possess me in every part, in every avenue, of my inward being."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is to allow Christ to make His home in our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the fullness of the organic union which we have with Christ, a union in which we are fully united with Christ in an organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>CHRIST AS THE HEAD OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>AND THE BELIEVERS AS THE MEMBERS OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>BEING JOINED TOGETHER TO BE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE GREAT, UNIVERSAL NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, Christ as the Head of the Body Col 1:18a and the believers as the members of the Body Eph 5:30 are joined together to be the great, universal new man Eph 2:15; Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the organic union, Christ becomes the Head of the universal new man, and we the believers all are the members of this great, universal new man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is the Head and we all are the members.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He and we, we and He, are organically united together to be one complete and perfect universal new man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In such an organic union we live together with Him, move together with Him, and work together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ and we have only one purpose, one goal, and one aim.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the ultimate consummation in full of our organic union with Him.</S>
