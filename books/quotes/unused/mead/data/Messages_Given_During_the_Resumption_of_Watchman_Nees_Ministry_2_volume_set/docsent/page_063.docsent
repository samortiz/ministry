   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Principle of Confession</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the principle of confession, we have to realize that the conscience deals only with unrighteous things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In dealing with our conscience, we need God to give us the wisdom so that we take care of matters in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The principle of dealing with our conscience is that in our dealings God would gain the glory, others would receive the benefit, and we would be edified.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need wisdom especially in dealing with matters related to adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are some things which cannot be dealt with, and we can only ask God for His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must not pursue peace in our conscience to the extent that it would cause damage to others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are certain things that cannot be dealt with, and we should not try to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These matters are over once they have been put under the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is true that we have to be faithful in dealing with the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But sometimes we can go too far.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we realize that we have gone too far, we should stop.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes, it is not God who is telling us to deal with the matters, but Satan who is telling us to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The principle of Satan is to hold us back initially and to keep us from advancing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When he cannot hold us back any longer, he will try to push us forward and make us go to the extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sometimes, in the matter of confession, time is a big factor.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With some matters, it is wrong to deal with them too early, and it is wrong to deal with them too late.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In all these matters, we need the Lord to grant us the wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Confession Needed Especially for Our Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One area that we have to make confessions in all the time is in the matter of speaking inaccurate words.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is particularly true with us who are speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not know how many times we have to make confessions in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to ask God to send His angels to guard our mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Psalm 19:14 says, "Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For a long time, this was my daily prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>BEING SENSITIVE IN OUR RESPONSE TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to maintain our fellowship with the Lord, we have to be sensitive to His calling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes the Lord calls us to fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not come to Him, and if we wait until it is too late, we may find that the Lord has left.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This kind of people will suffer the punishment of being cut off from the fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They have to suffer much punishment before they can come to Him again and meet Him once more.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the matter of fellowship, the Lord is not under our control.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why we have to be sensitive in our response to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord shows us in the Gospel of John that He is never under man's control.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In John 4, the Lord asked the disciples to buy food, but when the food came, He did not eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In chapter six, the Lord Jesus knew very well how to take care of the crowd, yet He asked the disciples what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In chapter seven, the Lord's brothers wanted to go to Jerusalem, but He would not go.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After a while, He Himself went.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In chapter eleven, Lazarus was sick, and Jesus remained in the same place for another two days.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After Lazarus died, He went.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When there was hope, He would not go.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the hope was gone, He went.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In all these cases in John, the Lord's intention was to train the disciples to know that the Lord had His timings; He wanted the disciples to know His timings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In chapter eleven, when the Lord came late, although Martha did not blame Him, she did murmur.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She did not realize that the Lord had His own timing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What the Lord wants us to learn is to accept His timing in all things, to allow Him to be the Lord, and to fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even when something appears to be unreasonable outwardly, He wants us to submit to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only by doing this will we be able to go on with the Lord.</S>
