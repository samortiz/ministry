   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. To Remain in the House</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Whose Door Has Been Touched with the Blood</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The children of Israel were required to stay in the house whose door had been touched with the blood; they were not to go out of it until the morning 12:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To understand the significance of this we need to see that the basic concept in the Bible with respect to redemption is identification or union.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without identification there can be no substitution, which is necessary for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the cross Christ died as our substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, His being our substitute requires us to be identified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Old Testament, the ark of Noah as a type illustrates this matter of identification.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to be saved from the waters of judgment, Noah and his family had to be in the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be in the ark was to be identified with the ark, to be one with the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The destiny of the ark was automatically the destiny of everyone in the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whatever happened to the ark became the experience of the people who were one with the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the door of the ark was closed, others may have held onto the ark in desperation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But they were not one with the ark or identified with it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The only way to be one with Christ is to enter into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the words of 1 Corinthians 1:30, it is of God that we are in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has put us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the eight persons were in the ark of Noah, so we, the redeemed ones, are in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our entrance into Christ is through the door to which the blood has been applied.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we use hyssop to put the blood on the door, we are able to enter into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After getting into Christ, we need to remain in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In John 15 the Lord Jesus says, Abide in Me. To abide in Christ is to remain in Him, that is, to maintain our identification, our union, with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The effect of many of the teachings in Christianity is to cause believers to be separate from Christ and to lose their identification with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No teaching that causes us to lose our union with Christ can avail anything.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Anything apart from Christ is human effort or strife.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no need for us to struggle or strive.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We simply need to enter into the house through the blood-sprinkled gate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once we are in the house, we are one with the house and identified with it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many who believe in Christ were in the house at the time of their conversion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But shortly thereafter, as far as their practical daily experience is concerned, they came out of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In their experience, not many Christians stay in the house after their conversion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that when they believed into Christ and were saved, they entered into the house.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But then they began to do many things apart from the house and outside of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that they did things outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This has been the experience of many of us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We entered into Christ when we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But in our effort to please God by ourselves, we came out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We did not remain in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After we came to the church, we were brought back into the house through the ministry of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who came into the church life still may not be in Christ in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a source of trouble in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everyone in the church should be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, there may arise an abnormal condition wherein many who are in the church life are not abiding in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Before coming into the church life you may have struggled in your own energy to please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now that you have come into the church, which is part of the house, you need also to come back to the house.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that you need to come back to Christ and remain in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We were all saved in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But, like the Galatians, we may try to go on apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, we must be brought back to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is no need for us to do so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should simply maintain our identification with Christ, with a constant realization that we are nothing and that He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to see that we are in Him and that He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As long as we abide in Him, He will abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As the Lord Himself said in John 15, Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some may have heard this teaching before they came into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The crucial matter, however, is not whether or not you know the teaching about abiding in Christ; it is whether or not you are actually abiding in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Where are you at this very moment?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Are you in Christ, or are you apart from Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord Jesus said that apart from Him we can do nothing John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To remain in the house is to abide in Christ and to be identified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In other words, it is to remain in oneness with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The greatest problem among believers today is that, in their experience, they are outside of Christ, apart from the oneness with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Moses charged the children of Israel to eat the lamb in the house and then to stay in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If they had come out of the house, they would have lost everything.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the house they had the full enjoyment of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Only in the house could the Passover become their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to be clear concerning what the house is and where the house is today.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have emphasized the fact that the house is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But where is the house?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The house is where there is the sprinkling of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The unique sign of the house is not what we are, have, or do.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is the sprinkled blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Where redemption is, there Christ is also.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Apart from redemption, we have no standing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Our unique standing is the redeeming blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you read the book of Galatians, you will see that the Galatians had been distracted from the standing of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They had come out of the house and were thus deprived of the benefit, the profit, of being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If the children of Israel had not remained in the house, they would have been deprived of the benefit, profit, enjoyment, and experience of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>To participate in the Passover there was the need to remain in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The reason we do not agree with so many of the teachings of today s Christianity is that these teachings cause Christians to get out of the house, to no longer remain in the standing of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Once we are saved, we need to remain in the very place where we have been redeemed, in the place where the blood has been sprinkled.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Here in this place we have the house.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The redeeming blood keeps us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Whenever we try in our own energy to do something for God, we violate the principle of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The principle of redemption is that there is no need for us to do anything other than to exercise our hyssop, our faith, to apply the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Whenever our hyssop applies the blood to the gate, the way is open for us to be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Let us remain in the place of redemption, in the house with the blood-sprinkled entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should not practice those things which cause us to come out of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Rather, we should stay in the house where we participate in the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The longer we remain in the house, the more light we receive; and the more light we receive, the more we see that everything we need is in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If you stay in the house, you will be filled, qualified, equipped, and formed into an army.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Our only need is to remain in Christ as the house.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When I was young, I heard a number of messages on the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>All these messages emphasized the one point that when God sees the blood, He passes over us.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>A well-known gospel song even uses the word from Exodus 12:13, When I see the blood, I will pass over you.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But in all these messages I heard on the Passover, not a word was spoken about remaining in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Only twice are we told that when God sees the blood, He will pass over us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>But time after time Moses spoke of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If you are enlightened of the Lord, you may realize that even now you may be outside of the house, outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The only way to get into the house is through the redeeming blood spread on the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>It is impossible to separate the redeeming blood from the house, for the blood and the house are one.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Whenever we maintain the standing of the redeeming blood, we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>However, whenever we endeavor in our natural energy to please God, we leave the standing of the redeeming blood and are outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Do you know what the children of Israel were doing inside the house?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>They were eating the flesh of the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Exodus 12:14 indicates that they were feasting.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This verse says, And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it as a feast to Jehovah throughout your generations Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>What does it mean to have a feast to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It means that we remain in the house and enjoy a full participation in the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In this way we feast on the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>However, the Lord enjoys this feast more than we do.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>To have a feast unto Him means that we feast for Him and with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We eat, but He enjoys.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We feast, and He is happy.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The more we feast, the more enjoyment He has and the happier He is.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>However, the more we endeavor to do things, the more displeased He becomes, for our endeavors do not give Him any enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>What a poor situation there is in today s Christianity!</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Most Christians are outside of the house trying to do things for the Lord; they are not in the house feasting unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Praise Him that we in the local churches are in the house feasting unto the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This principle of staying in the house by keeping the standing of redemption must govern our whole Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>All day long we, the redeemed ones, should remain in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>When some hear this, they may point out that the children of Israel left the house in order to make their exodus out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>However, the time they spent in the house signifies the full course of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>As we remain in the house feasting on the Passover lamb, we are equipped.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Actually, the feasting is the equipping.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>When the children of Israel were filled with the Passover lamb, they were ready to march out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Hence, they were equipped by being filled with the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>This is the reason we say that remaining in the house involves the full course of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Do not think that the blood sprinkled on the lintel and the door posts is sufficient for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>It is sufficient to usher us into the house and to keep us from the judgment of God, but it is not sufficient to equip us.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>It cannot enable us to make the journey.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>For this, we need to roast the lamb, eat its flesh in the house hastily, and be filled with the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Every part of the Passover lamb must be eaten, including the head, the legs, and the inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Nothing should be left over.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Perhaps the children of Israel had to encourage one another to eat certain parts of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Some may not have cared for the inward parts or the head, but nevertheless they had to eat the whole lamb in order to be fully equipped for the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>As we feast on Christ as the Passover lamb, God is happy and full of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Then He can say, Satan, look at My people.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>They are being equipped by feasting on the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Because they are being equipped in this way, they will be able to defeat you.</S>
