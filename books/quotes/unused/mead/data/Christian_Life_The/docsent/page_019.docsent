   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Before Christ's incarnation and resurrection, divinity and humanity were separate entities.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But humanity and divinity were mingled together in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jesus is the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In His incarnation divinity entered into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In His resurrection humanity entered into divinity, and divinity was mingled and compounded with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With the lemon tea, the water, the tea, and the lemon are no longer separate elements.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we drink this, we are drinking "lemon-tea-water."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The water has been compounded with another two elements.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our God has also been compounded with humanity and with all the elements of the process through which He passed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus charged His disciples to baptize people into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Acts and the Epistles say that the disciples baptized people into the name of the Lord Jesus Acts 8:16; 19:5 and into Christ Rom 6:3; Gal 3:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is because Christ is the totality of the three of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is like saying that tea is the totality of water, lemon, and tea.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In our baptizing of people, we may be too dogmatic.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may insist on saying, "Brother, we are baptizing you into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To repeat this, however, can be dogmatic.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is better to say, "Brother, I'm baptizing you into Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is the embodiment and totality of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is mingled and compounded with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Son entered into humanity, and He brought this humanity into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Into divinity means into the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today all three of the Godhead are involved with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The last Adam was Christ as a person in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This person in the flesh became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word became indicates mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ became a life-giving Spirit by the way of compounding, by the way of mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, the life-giving Spirit is the mingling of divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With the lemon-tea-water, the spirit the essence of the tea and the spirit the essence of the lemon are in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The essence of lemon and the essence of tea cannot be seen, but they can be tasted.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we cannot see how man is in God and God is in man, but these divine and human essences are mingled together and are included in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
