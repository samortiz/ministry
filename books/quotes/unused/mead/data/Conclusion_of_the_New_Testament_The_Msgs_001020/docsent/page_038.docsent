   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>H. WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 11:33 speaks of God's wisdom: "O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How inscrutable are His judgments, and untraceable His paths!"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the very end of the book of Romans Paul says, "To the only wise God through Jesus Christ be the glory forever and ever!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Amen" Rom 16:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Wisdom is different from cleverness and deeper than cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is possible to be clever without being wise.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, a criminal may be very clever, but he is altogether lacking in wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is very wise, and the universe reveals His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is important to see the difference between wisdom and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Wisdom is both higher and deeper than knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Wisdom is seen in the initiation of something, for example, in the formulation of a new invention, and knowledge is seen in the practical application.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you have only knowledge and lack wisdom, you will not be able to initiate anything or invent anything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is the unique Initiator.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has initiated many things, not by His knowledge but by His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When He comes in to apply what He has initiated, He displays His knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ephesians 3:10 speaks of the multifarious wisdom of God being made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Greek word translated "multifarious" indicates that God's wisdom has many sides, aspects, and directions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only through problems can all the aspects of God's wisdom be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that, in a sense, God needs problems and troubles: He even needs an adversary, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without Satan, God's wisdom cannot be fully manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Satan has created many opportunities for God's wisdom to be manifested in a multifarious way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The rebellion of Satan is within the realm of troubles for God's wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If it were not for Satan's rebellion, God's wisdom could not be made known in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you are a person full of wisdom, the more troubles and difficulties you have, the more wisdom you will express.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if everything related to you is peaceful and without problems, you will have no opportunity to express your wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You need problems in order to display your wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Likewise, God needs problems in order to display His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whatever the enemy of God does gives God the opportunity to show forth His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Another aspect of God's wisdom is revealed in 1 Corinthians 1:30, where we are told that of God we are in Christ Jesus, "who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For Christ to be our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption requires much wisdom on God's part.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many aspects of God's wisdom are manifested in His making Christ our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our experience of Christ in these matters is according to God's manifold wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, in His wisdom God is able to make us the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes God may say, "Look, Satan, I have taken the very people whom you have ruined and I have made them into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do you have the wisdom to do such a thing?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You do not have this wisdom, but I have it."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the sight of God the most marvelous thing in the universe is the church, for through it His multifarious wisdom is made known to Satan and his angels.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The day is coming when Satan and his angels will be put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They will realize that everything they have done has given God the opportunity to manifest His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the same principle, our failures, mistakes, defeats, and wrongdoings have also given God opportunities to display His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are God's chosen people, and even through our failures He manifests His multifarious wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such a wisdom is also a strong attribute of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I. PRUDENCE</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ephesians 1:8 indicates that there is a difference between wisdom and prudence.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this verse, Paul, speaking of the riches of God's grace says, "Which He caused to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Wisdom is what is within God to plan and purpose a will concerning us; prudence is the application of God's wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First, God planned and purposed in His wisdom, and then He applied what He had planned and purposed for us with prudence.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Wisdom was mainly for God's plan in eternity, and prudence is mainly for God's execution of His plan in time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What God planned in eternity in His wisdom He is now executing in time in His prudence.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may say that prudence is a "stairway" connecting cleverness, which is on a lower level, to wisdom, which is on a higher level.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In order to go up to wisdom from cleverness, we need prudence.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a certain person chooses not to remain in his cleverness but to advance to wisdom, he must ascend up the stairway of prudence.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may also say that prudence is a proper cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those who are prudent will not do things in a foolish way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This kind of prudence is also a divine attribute in God's move.</S>
