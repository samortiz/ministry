<h1 class="title">&ldquo;WHERE ARE YOU?&rdquo;&mdash;IN THE HAND OF SATAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Gen. 3:9; 1 John 5:19; Acts 26:18; John 12:31; 16:11; Eph. 2:2; Col. 1:13</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Man is not free<br />
<span class="normal">Describe how man is held in the hand of Satan, subject to his slaughtering, suffering his paralyzing and killing.</span>
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Satan moves within man&rsquo;s heart and causes him to do things not of himself and beyond his own control. Explain that playing cards, adultery, and various evils are something beyond self-control. Satan uses various kinds of habits to anesthetize and ensnare man.</li>
	<li>Satan has a power in man which no one can overcome. For example, dancing and drugs appear to be mere habits but they are actually the power of Satan.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Man&rsquo;s life is in Satan&rsquo;s hand<br />
<span class="normal">Describe the real situation of human living: Satan has caused man to sin, to covet fame, to steal money, to love the world, to envy others for the sake of higher position, to betray others, to scheme to destroy others&rsquo; families, and to take away another&rsquo;s wife. Men who do these things have been deceived by Satan. Satan would first destroy men&rsquo;s reputation and morality and then endanger men&rsquo;s lives.</span></li>
<li>The destiny of men that are in the hand of Satan
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Death.</li>
	<li>To be the companions of Satan in the lake of fire, because the lake of fire is prepared for Satan and his subordinates. Unless you escape from the hand of Satan, you will eventually fall into the lake of fire.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to be free from Satan&rsquo;s hand
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord Jesus through His death on the cross has crushed the Devil who had the power of death, that is, He has judged the prince of this world, Satan.</li>
	<li>If we receive the Lord Jesus as our Lord, we can overcome the power of Satan.<br />
	<em>By repeating the question, &ldquo;Where Are You?&rdquo; subjects 10 through 16 continue in the theme of seeking sinners and turning them to the Lord.</em></li>
