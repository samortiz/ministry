   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LOCAL CHURCHES NOT BECOMING A METHOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today we cannot make the truth concerning the local churches a method.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we make it a method, it will become very dead indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The question is not Catholicism or local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The question is the church being in doctrine or in life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I fear method as much as I fear Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The local church cannot become a method.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once it becomes a method, it will become very, very heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is our basic problem today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot say that the Catholic church is all wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the Catholic church would remove her idols, the oneness that she talks about is right.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>CONCERNING "HANDING OVER"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I still need to say something concerning the question of "handing over."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Handing Over Being a Make-up Lesson</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>and Not a Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The matter of "handing over" must never become our teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not a teaching, but a "make-up" lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The reason there is the need for such a make-up lesson is that the matter was not taken care of properly at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is like a man riding on a train; he should first buy the ticket and then board the train.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, some people have boarded the train without paying for the ticket.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a result, there is the need for some kind of make-up measure.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Originally, tickets should be bought at the train station.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After a man is saved, he should immediately consecrate himself Rom 6:6, 12-13 , and he should not have to wait until a later date to make it up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But many Christians have not done this properly, and the church has not presented this need to them properly right from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can say that today the church has given the believers a "bonus ride"; they board the train without paying for the ticket.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But sooner or later, they still must pay for the ticket.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For the new ones who have just come in, we do not need to ask them to hand themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What they need is to consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reason there is a "handing over" is that the consecration was not done properly at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a result, there is the need for such a make-up lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The standard of salvation is not high enough today, and many of the items a person should have acquired at the time of salvation are lost.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Strictly speaking, when a man is saved, he should be fully consecrated and should be a person who lives fully for the spread of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As soon as a person comes in, we should lay the full demand on his shoulder.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we can do this, none among us will still be holding hands with the world after we are saved, or will have to come back at a later date to consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Gospels, when men thronged to follow the Lord, He presented His requirements to them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He explained that a man must take up his own cross before he can follow Him Matt 10:38; 16:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord never lowers His standard.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the contrary, He lifts the standard high.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He says that man should follow Him, and that if a man is to follow Him, he has to do this and do that.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let me emphasize that after a man is saved, unless he consecrates himself, he cannot go on.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Unless he takes up his cross, he cannot go on.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you want to come to the Lord, you have to consecrate yourself, and you have to take up your cross and give up the world and your individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All these things must be clearly dealt with at the time a person is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The matter of "handing oneself over" is a measure taken because nothing else could be done.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is like a man boarding a train without a ticket.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since he cannot get off the train again, the only way is for him to buy a ticket then.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For now, we try to settle for the term "handing over."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One day, when everyone is consecrated as soon as he is saved, there will be no need for anyone to "hand themselves over" any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is because the things that should be there on the first day are lost, and everyone has boarded the train without a ticket; some have climbed into the carriages through the windows, while others have walked in without any ticket.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although these have boarded the train without any ticket, they cannot go on with their free ride the rest of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sooner or later, they nevertheless have to pay for their tickets.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is a difference between buying a ticket on the train and buying it at the station.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To buy it on the train is abnormal, whereas to buy it at the station is normal.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If everyone buys his ticket on the train, there will be no need for a ticket booth at the station any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If everyone buys his ticket on the train, you might just as well move the ticket booth into the train.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am afraid that after some time the matter of "handing over" will become a new terminology among us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is possible that in the future the matter of "handing over" will become a peculiar thing among us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If this happens, those teachers who come after us will write and ask us about the scriptural foundation for the practice of "handing oneself over."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is no such doctrinal term as "handing over."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We borrow this term today because men do not have a proper and good beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If everyone begins in a proper way, there is no need to bring up this question any longer.</S>
