   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIVE THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF JOSEPH AND BENJAMIN 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I became familiar with the history of Jacob's twelve sons long before I realized how sweet and wonderful their history was.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The more time I spend on Genesis 49, the more I appreciate these twelve sons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is very worthwhile to delve into their history.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first four sons Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah were all sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But Joseph and Benjamin, the last two, are without fault or defect.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Between the first four sons and the last two, we have the other six sons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With Dan we see apostasy; with Gad, recovery; with Asher, sufficiency; and with Naphtali, resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you put together the record of these twelve sons according to Genesis 49, you will have a portrait of yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the one hand, when I look at these twelve sons of Jacob, I marvel at them; on the other hand, I am thankful to God, because in them I see a picture of myself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I also see the very Christ I have experienced and the salvation and transformation that are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the past we all were Reubens, Simeons, Levis, and Judahs, but today we are Josephs and Benjamins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Two of the sinful ones, Levi and Judah, were transferred into something positive.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Levi was transferred into the priesthood, and Judah was transferred into the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, among the twelve sons of Jacob, we eventually have the priesthood, the kingship, and finally the ultimate consummation, which we see in Joseph and Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the following message we shall see that the ultimate consummation is of two things: blessing and dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We shall be brought fully into the universal blessing under God, and then we shall become His dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sinners become God's priests and kings, and ultimately they are under His universal blessing and become His eternal dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we saw the significance of this record, we would shout and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We would say, "Once I was a Reuben, but today I am a Levi, a Judah, a Joseph, and a Benjamin!"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For eternity, we shall be the kings under God's blessing, and we shall be God's dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Have you ever realized that the Bible could be so wonderful?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Have you ever seen that in one chapter, Genesis 49, we could have an abstract of the whole Bible and a summary of the history of the twelve sons of Jacob, of the history of the nation of Israel, of the history of the church, and of our own spiritual history?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everything is here.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although this chapter is poetic and very profound, it is nonetheless quite simple.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It includes all the Bible, it encompasses the history of the twelve tribes, it indicates the history of the church, and it portrays our personal history.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without doubt, this summarizes God's dealing with His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's dealing with His people began with sinners, it proceeds to transformation, and eventually it reaches the ultimate consummation, which is the blessing and the dwelling of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Among Jacob's twelve sons, there are various types of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How I thank God for giving Jacob twelve sons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What if Jacob had had just one son?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the eyes of God, Abraham and Isaac each had just one son, for God counted only Isaac and Jacob, not Ishmael or Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But God's economy required twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this, Jacob had to have twelve sons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not even ten tribes would have been sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One day, after the death of Solomon, the kingdom of Israel was divided into two parts with ten tribes in one part and two in the other.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But not even these ten tribes were sufficient; there had to be twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to remember the names of Jacob's twelve sons: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Zebulun, Issachar, Dan, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Joseph, and Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this message we shall consider part of the spiritual significance of Joseph and Benjamin, covering three matters: fruitfulness, victory, and trust.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the following message we shall consider the blessing and the dwelling.</S>
