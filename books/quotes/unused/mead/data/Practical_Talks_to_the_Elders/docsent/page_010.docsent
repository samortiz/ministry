   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MISUNDERSTANDING RELATED TO IMPURENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The prerequisite, however, in responsibility, in the eldership, in the leadership, is pureness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The coordination needs pureness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you are short of this, regardless of how careful you are, you will have trouble again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the church life, things are always happening.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you are not pure in your motive, you will be entangled either by this trouble or by the next one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By the same token, if you are pure, no trouble will entangle you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many times our seeming patience comes from impurity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We wait and do not take action because we are afraid of offending others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I don t mean that we should be rude or careless.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But pureness is a basic factor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It kills all the germs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you check with the elders of the church in Anaheim here, I believe they will all agree that, whatever I do, whether I am happy or not happy, they never doubt my motive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They do not doubt my motive, and I do not doubt theirs because we have a mutual history over many years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have known each other for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, we can save much time and trouble in the way we do things and still not have misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do you know where misunderstanding comes from?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Often its source is impureness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A husband and wife who truly love each other without impureness may quarrel and have disagreements, yet without misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once some impureness comes in, however, there is one misunderstanding after another.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They may try to be careful, patient, and wise, but the misunderstandings will continue because of the impureness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To offend others comes from the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Fear of offending others is also of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the world, say, in a corporation, people are very careful not to offend each other, because the world is filled with impurity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If this is true of the church also, we are no more the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the church there should be nothing but pureness in every avenue, every corner.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>SUSPICION AND IMPURENESS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is when we are impure that we become suspicious.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We become detectives to spy out the meaning behind what others say.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are pure in our motive, we do not have such a thought.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are on another globe, taking others words in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have heard that some brothers notice things happening that are not right, but they dare not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To avoid getting involved, they stay silent and let the suffering go on.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To do this is to play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is what some of you have been practicing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Dear brothers, change your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Repent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let us have no more such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You think someone has secretly reported to Brother Lee about you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Actually, I have not received any such report.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is a demon in your thinking, because you are doing something which you hope Brother Lee will not find out about.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No one gave me any information, but under the Lord s sovereignty I stepped in just to say that from today we will do things that way no more.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because my correction was exactly right, you thought someone had given me secret information about you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such was not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus Himself gave me the word to come to your meeting to correct certain things in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you are in this meeting tonight with an impure heart, you may think that what I am saying is the result of reports I have been given.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You may think that a certain remark specifically applies to you, because it fits your situation exactly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If no one had reported you, how could I have known about it?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Well, what I am sharing with you I wrote down six days ago.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I listed the points that I wanted to cover.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After our last meeting, I wrote them all down, because I realized that, now I am getting older, I would not remember the points without notes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From this it should be clear to you that what I am saying is not because of reports I have received.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Learn to be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now that the Chinese-speaking meeting has started, all these frogs from the depths of the well have come to the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Surely if you don t condemn those things, the blessing will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Such suspicious thoughts will kill your service.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you wonder how I can keep going on, I would say it is because I have no such way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You all know my frankness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you are pure, there is no need to be afraid of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Pureness is a basic condition of our service.</S>
