   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Five The Exercise of Our Spirit unto Godliness Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 4:7-8; 2 Tim 1:6-7; 4:22 In the blueprint of God s original intention, man is the center of the entire universe, and the center of man is his spirit Zech 12:1; Gen 2:7: The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man was created by God with a spirit that he may contact God, receive God, contain God, worship God, live God, fulfill God s purpose for God, express God, and be one with God Prov 20:27; John 4:24; 1 Cor 6:17.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Man s spirit became a broken lamp through his fall, but through God s recovery in His salvation, man s spirit is regenerated, rebuilt, and reinforced with the vivifying, sevenfold intensified Spirit Gen 2:7; Prov 20:27; John 3:6; Rev 4:5; 1 Cor 15:45b.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The building of God into man is typified by both the tabernacle and the breastplate, and the key to God s building is our mingled spirit: The uniting bars of the boards of the tabernacle, made of acacia wood overlaid with gold, signify the mingled spirit, the divine Spirit mingled with the human spirit to become the uniting bond of peace Exo 26:26-30; Rom 8:16; Eph 4:3-4.</S>
