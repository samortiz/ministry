Let me illustrate my point this way. A naughty boy may be severely punished by his father. At first he may think that the father has been too harsh. But later he will think that his father loves him and that he was wrong. In his mind he knows that he should be punished, and in his emotion he realizes that his father punishes him out of love. But these feelings only reach as far as the emotion and the mind; they have not produced a stricken spirit in him. If they have produced a stricken spirit in him, he will be sober after he has been punished. He will no longer make noise at the dinner table, and he will no longer be naughty. He will no longer be rowdy in his bedroom. Instead he will calm down. He will feel ashamed of the things he has done. This is the expression of a stricken spirit. We can say that he has the mark of the cross. In our service to the Lord, God deals with us in such a way that our mind and emotion are touched and our feelings before God are changed. However, in His dealing, something is seared into our spirit so that our spirit is stricken as well. The pain, the shame, and fear that we bear at the time of being stricken remain fresh in us. Everyone who has passed through the cross has a mark on him, the mark of a stricken spirit, which remains in him day by day. He can no longer be careless or jovial but bears a wound with him. Only such ones can impart life to others. Every time we suffer, it is for the purpose of producing a stricken spirit. Take the example of the child that we spoke of earlier. When his spirit becomes haughty and loose again, he will suffer another chastisement from his father. Every time we are chastised by God, we should end up with a chastised spirit. This is how our spirit is purified. This does not mean that we will no longer speak to our Father or that we will no longer dare to do anything. It means that our spirit will become different.</p><p>Naughtiness, looseness, and carelessness are marks of rawness in man; they are reflections of his original state. Such a one has to pass through the fire before he is "cooked." There is a mark with those who have a stricken spirit&mdash;they become fearful of God. They bear a spirit of fear within them. They are not only changed in their attitude, words, emotions, and thoughts, but they bear the expression of chastisement in their spirit. Such an expression is demonstrated through their daily life. Those who have a stricken spirit simply have it. When others touch it, they know it. Those who do not have the scar of the cross do not have it, and others know it; no one can fake this. We encounter sufferings and chastisements all the time. It would be a pity if these do not produce a stricken spirit in us. Every time God sends us suffering, it is for the purpose of producing a stricken spirit in us. If this is not produced in us, we are wasting our time. This is the way of the cross, and this is the way to spirituality. After the Lord resurrected, He allowed Thomas to touch the wound in His hand and His side. After we are wounded by the cross, we also should have clear marks of the cross in us. This is the way to be delivered from rawness. Daily we should live in this spirit of chastisement. Such a spirit will keep us from acting rashly or speaking carelessly. A person with such a spirit will come to God in fear and trembling. He will no longer be rough and coarse; he will become tender.</p><p>Our brother has to have a purified spirit. The Lord has done a great work in him. He has suffered over ten years, from 1936 to 1948. If he has not learned the lessons, he has wasted all this time. I have been too frank with you, but I cannot hide anything. Do not replace the fruit of the spirit with the works of the emotion and the mind. The spirit should not be entangled or polluted by the emotion and the mind. It should be fearful, disciplined, and careful. I feel that your spirit has been too free. It should bear the mark of the cross. In your speaking and praying, you should have the scar of the cross. A loose spirit is raw and cannot edify others. A rubber tree that has not been cut cannot supply others with its sap. A man who has not passed through the cross cannot bring others into the deep. A raw person cannot participate in God's work. Only those who have been made mature by God can lead others into the reality of life. During the past few days I have been a little impatient because I have seen many people who have been stricken but they have not received much spiritual benefit. I hope that as the days go by, a stricken spirit will be found in you. We are no longer young. We cannot waste the Lord's time any longer. Every time we experience trials and sufferings, we have to produce abundant results. This is a great thing. If we do not take care of this, we will be of little use to the Lord.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 58: Spiritual Judgment and Examples of Judgment &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
