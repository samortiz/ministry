   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I believe this matter is what the Lord hates the most; therefore, we have to pay special attention to it.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I recognize the matter of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I also acknowledge that Paul engaged in tent-making at the same time, and also that Peter, James, and John devoted themselves entirely to preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But today what we call the position of the brothers is not related to the position of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the local church, the brothers of the locality should be the deacons and the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the brothers and sisters should take care of spiritual matters; they are the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The elders should not do everything for them; the elders only "oversee."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As for the workers, when they come to the church, they have only the position of a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is where the difference between the Nicolaitans and the brothers lies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible shows us that all the children of the Lord testify, but the apostles testify more.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The difference is a matter of degree, not of nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The nature is identical; only the degree is different.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the teaching of the Nicolaitans changes this spiritual affairs are taken care of by a special class.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is rebuked by God, for if this is the case, the church may be worldly and content just to have a few spiritual deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Several especially spiritual people will be selected from the church to take care of the spiritual affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They will become another class to undertake all the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The system of fathers of the world church, the clergy system of the state church, and the pastoral system of the independent churches are all the same in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are all Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Bible there are only brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is the gift of a pastor, but no system of pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The pastoral system is man's tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the children of God are not willing to return to the position of that in the beginning, no matter what they do, it will not be right.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church must not unite with the world and must not receive unbelievers into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Otherwise, it will be easy to accept the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>People must be separated from the world before they can be brought into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever we allow an unbeliever to come into the church, the church is no longer the church, but the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The holiness and separation of the church must be maintained at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"Repent therefore; but if not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of My mouth" Rev 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here the Lord speaks very strong words.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If they will not repent, He will punish them with the sword of His mouth that is, He will punish and judge those who rebel against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We pray God that there will be no Nicolaitans among us!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I feel that if the church is spiritual, then Nicolaitans cannot be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once the church becomes worldly, the Nicolaitans appear.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's requirement in the beginning for the people of Israel was that the whole nation be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God separated the Levites to be priests because the people of Israel sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the church became worldly, the matter of serving God was committed to a few people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now God wants all the people in the church to do the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna, and to him I will give a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no one knows except he who receives it" v. 17 . Two things are promised to the overcomer the hidden manna and the white stone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The hidden manna and the manna in the wilderness are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the people of Israel were in the wilderness, manna came down from heaven daily for them to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then Moses told them to take a golden pot, fill it with an omer of manna, and keep it in the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When later generations would ask about the matter, they could tell them how God sent down manna from heaven to feed them while they were in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They had the manna in the ark as evidence Exo 16:14-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those of later generations who did not know what manna was could be shown the manna in the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then they would know.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But those who had eaten of the manna would have another feeling towards the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They had known the taste; thus, when they saw it again, they would have a kind of recollection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those who had not tasted it would not have such a recollection, even though they knew what it was.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To him who overcomes, the Lord will give to eat of the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means they will have recollections.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All our experiences before God are valuable and will not be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many brothers ask me whether what they have passed through before God will be of any use in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you know the meaning of the hidden manna, you will know whether or not these will be of any use.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we have the opportunity to see the "hidden manna," then we will be able to review the "daily manna" once more.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whatever difficulty we go through and whatever tears we shed today will become our review.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To me the hidden manna is the daily manna.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Those who have never seen the manna will not have any recollection of it when they see the hidden manna on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although they know the leading of His grace, they have not eaten of it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But those who have eaten of it will be full of recollections.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The hidden manna is a very great principle in the Bible and also a great treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>One day we shall eat of the heavenly, hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we do not have any scars here, we are not overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we have never passed through things here, there will be no recollections or retasting of experiences in the future, even if we are given the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Never say that what we encounter today is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>No experience is a lost experience.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On that day we all will be able to recall our experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must not say that everything in the kingdom is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>No, it is not the same!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our experience on this earth is related to what we will enjoy in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The hidden manna is known to those who know and unknown to those who do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Today we pass through hardships and tribulations, but on that day the Lord will wipe away our tears.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>How can those who have no tears know the preciousness of the wiping away of tears?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There is another reward, that is, the white stone, and the overcomer's new name is written upon the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord gives him a new name which corresponds with his condition before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A brother wants me to change his name for him, but I do not know whether the name will need to be changed again after I have changed it.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord writes the name on the white stone; only the Lord and you will know it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The overcomer does not receive a special name; rather, he receives the name which he deserves.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I hope that the Lord will open our eyes that we may know the way of the overcomer and that we may receive the hidden manna and the new name.</S>
