   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This time as I was preparing to come back to Taiwan, I had a deep and strong feeling within me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Based on my experience over the past sixty years in the Lord's recovery, I have put a question mark on the matter of a Christian's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From the day I was saved, I have not known any worldly friend.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even my relatives are not that frequently in touch with me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For the past sixty years, I have been in contact with only one kind of people, Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, most of those with whom I have had contact are Christians who love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But during the course of my contact with them during the past sixty years, what I have seen and experienced has put a question mark in me concerning a Christian's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 1922 I was saved in a little city in northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I was also raised up by the Lord there to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that time, I began to learn to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Later, the Lord led me step by step to move to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I was brought into contact with people of all nationalities.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All these experiences opened my eyes more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 1949 I came to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1956 I went to the Philippines and other parts of Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1960 I went further to the West, to the United States and Canada.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the end, I chose the uttermost part of the earth, Los Angeles, as the base of my work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the years subsequent to that, I passed through Pittsburgh, Detroit, New York, London, Denmark, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, India, Thailand, Japan, Guam, Hong Kong, Hawaii, and many other lands and countries.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are now over one thousand churches with about a hundred and fifty thousand saints all over the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All kinds of peoples are here.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have contacted all types of people, and I have encountered all kinds of situations.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because of this, by the Lord's mercy and according to the history of His leading in the past, I feel that I can say something to you concerning the humanity of those who serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the people with whom I have contact are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many of them are even seeking, loving, and world-forsaking Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But among all these people with whom I have contact, many are wrong in their humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is a problem and this bothers me very much.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I was therefore brought to further consider two great items of truth: regeneration and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although there are many Christian groups, I have not heard of any which emphasize regeneration and transformation more than we do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1962 when the Lord led me to begin working in America, prayer and the spirit were the first items to which we paid attention.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This was how we began.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After that, we released many truths concerning transformation and also put out some publications.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All this happened twenty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, in my observation and contact during all these years, a question has been raised within me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How is it that some can be regenerated and transformed and yet still have a problem with their humanity?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How is it possible that such a thing could ever happen in the Lord's recovery?</S>
