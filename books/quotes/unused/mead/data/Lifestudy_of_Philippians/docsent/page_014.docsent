   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE APOSTLE S REJOICING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN BOTH KINDS OF PREACHING OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1:18 Paul declares, What then?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is announced, and in this I rejoice, yes, and I will rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul s heart was so broadened by grace that he even rejoiced in his opposing ones preaching of Christ in pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What an upright spirit is this!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the outworking of the life, nature, and mind of Christ who lived in him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His experience of Christ was an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such a life rejoices no matter what the circumstances may be.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE PREACHING OF CHRIST IN BOTH WAYS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>TURNING OUT TO SALVATION FOR THE APOSTLE PAUL</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1:19 Paul continues, For I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul realized that both ways of preaching Christ would turn out to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Salvation in verse 19 means to be sustained and strengthened to magnify Christ and to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The circumstances in which Paul found himself forced him to experience Christ and enjoy Him in a fuller way through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Paul s experience God s salvation was carried out to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The experience of such a salvation is altogether related to the enjoyment of Christ and the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul s circumstances also encouraged him to live Christ and to magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul utilized the situations caused by the different preachings of the gospel to experience Christ, to live Christ, and to magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our situation is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, we cannot agree with certain ways in which Christ is preached; on the other hand, we must learn to be happy with the fact that Christ is being proclaimed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If this is our attitude, then the abnormal situation brought about by the different preachings of Christ will become an incentive for us to enjoy Christ, to live Him, and to magnify Him, as Paul did.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we have the fellowship unto the gospel, the defense and confirmation of the gospel, and the advancement of the gospel, our preaching of the gospel will be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The proper preaching of the gospel is safeguarded by these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The raising up of churches in South America illustrates this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1959 some brothers moved to Brazil with a burden for the spread of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During the first ten years these brothers faced much suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But during the next eleven years more than fifty churches were raised up in different countries.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A certain brother who has taken the lead in this matter is not a gifted speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But because his preaching is in the fellowship unto the gospel, with the advancement of the gospel, and for the defense and confirmation of the gospel, the Lord has used him in raising up these churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We praise the Lord for what He has done in South America through the proper, healthy preaching of the gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>May we all learn to discern the different ways of preaching Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In particular, may we discern between healthy preaching and that which is unhealthy.</S>
