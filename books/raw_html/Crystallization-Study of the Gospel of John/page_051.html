<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Consummated Spirit of the Triune God</H2><P>He is the consummated Spirit of the Triune God as the consummation of the Triune God. This means He is the totality of the consummated Triune God because He has gone through incarnation, human living, death on the cross, resurrection, and ascension.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Eternal Husband</H2><P>The Spirit who has been consummated to be the consummation of the Triune God is the eternal Husband speaking with His bride, the Body of Christ, to be the eternal and universal couple (Rev. 22:17). The consummation of the Triune God is a Husband. The Bridegroom is Christ (John 3:29) and the regenerated believers are the bride. Eventually, Christ will have a wedding, and that wedding day will last one thousand years in the kingdom age. The kingdom age will be a celebration of the wedding of Christ (Rev. 19:7-9) and the New Jerusalem will be the bride (Rev. 21:2). In Revelation 22:17 the Spirit is with the bride; therefore, the Spirit must be the Husband. This is a universal romance between the saving God and the saved believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Spirit of life</H2><P>The compounded Spirit is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Spirit of Christ</H2><P>He is also the Spirit of Christ, who is the Spirit of the Christ in resurrection&#151;the pneumatic Christ (Rom. 8:9). Romans 8 speaks of the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of God. These terms are interchangeably used. These are not three Spirits, but one Spirit in three aspects referring to the same person&#151;the pneumatic Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Indwelling Spirit</H2><P>The consummated Spirit is the indwelling Spirit who dispenses the resurrection life to the believers' mortal body (Rom. 8:11). If we allow the Spirit to indwell us, He will enliven and strengthen our weak and dying body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Spirit of Jesus</H2><P>The Spirit of Jesus is the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross. This indicates that in the Spirit of Jesus there is not only the divine element of God but also the human elements of His human living and His suffering of death (Acts 16:7).</P>
