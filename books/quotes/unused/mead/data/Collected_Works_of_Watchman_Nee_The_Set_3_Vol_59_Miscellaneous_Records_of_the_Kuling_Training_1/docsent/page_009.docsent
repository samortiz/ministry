   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The third result of the breaking of the outer man is the ability to release one's spirit, which is the same as the ability to release the power within.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a man releases his spirit, yet his spirit does not touch others' spirits, it will return like the dove that was sent out from Noah's ark.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The release of the spirit also brings in the inward operation of the Holy Spirit within us for others.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Another aspect of the power of the Holy Spirit is manifested from within man and is expressed in service.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, this is the proper source of power.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The goal of our work is to release our spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When our spirit is released, the Holy Spirit within us is released as well.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In many instances the word can refer either to the Holy Spirit or the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is hard to say what the various instances of the word spirit in Romans 8 refer to, whether they refer to the human spirit or the divine Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Unless our outer man is broken, our inner man will not be released.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Speaking for God involves the release of the inner man.</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some people, however, only give others an impression of their mind, emotion, eloquence, and wisdom when they open their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When they speak, one only hears words.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Their words are like a gust of wind which sweeps across one's face, leaving nothing behind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A man who has been broken by God, however, can release his spirit easily.</S>

   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These ones can only boast of their great mind; their spirit is never released, and they cannot render any help to others.</S>
