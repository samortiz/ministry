<h2 class="head1">WHAT MAN OBTAINS THROUGH BELIEVING</h2>
<p>What is believing? What portion of salvation do we obtain through believing? Mark 16:16 says, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved,&rdquo; whereas Romans 10:10 says, &ldquo;With the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation.&rdquo; These verses indicate that a person does not need to be baptized in order to obtain righteousness. A person needs only to believe. Hence, when we baptize people, our basis is that they have believed. In other words, they must be those who have obtained righteousness.</p>
<p>John 3:36 says, &ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life.&rdquo; Baptism is not mentioned in this verse. It does not say that he who is baptized has eternal life; rather, it says that he who believes has eternal life. One who is baptized is one who has already believed. Believing precedes baptism. When a person believes in the Lord, he is first justified and then he obtains eternal life. To believe is to be justified and to obtain eternal life. To baptize someone based upon his believing is to baptize him based upon his receiving justification and eternal life.</p>
<p>Acts 10:43 says, &ldquo;Through His name everyone who believes into Him will receive forgiveness of sins.&rdquo; Forgiveness of sins is the negative aspect of justification. Forgiveness of sins and justification are related and are actually one matter. This shows that one who believes receives forgiveness of sins, justification, and eternal life. Hence, the faith that qualifies a person to be baptized is a faith that brings him forgiveness of sins, justification, and eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BAPTISM BEING BASED UPON THE FAITH<br />
THAT ONE ALREADY HAS</h2>
<p>When we contact someone, in order to determine whether he has the faith that qualifies him to be baptized, we must verify whether he has received forgiveness of sins, justification, and the life of God. If he has not received forgiveness of sins, justification, and the life of God, his &ldquo;faith&rdquo; cannot qualify him to be baptized. The faith that qualifies him to be baptized must result in his receiving forgiveness, justification, and God&rsquo;s life. Only such a faith makes it possible for a person to be saved; hence, only this faith can be the basis of baptism. This is the basic definition of faith. Some people&rsquo;s believing, however, is not according to God&rsquo;s revelation but according to their mind. When we contact such people, it is difficult to discern whether they are genuinely saved.</p>
<p>How can we know if a person has received forgiveness of sins, justification, and the life of God? In other words, how can we know if a person has faith? This is a crucial matter. Faith is in the psychological realm and is abstract. It is not like the two eyes and the nose on a person&rsquo;s face, which everyone can see and about which there is no doubt of their existence. However, faith is something abstract. Although people can speak of it confidently, no one can bring it out and physically show it to others. Hence, in order to help people clearly understand the matter, we must discover the manifestations of faith. In this sense, faith may be likened to electricity. Electricity for the most part is invisible, but it does have certain manifestations. As far as man&rsquo;s sight is concerned, electricity is invisible. It cannot be shown and is abstract. But as far as its practicality is concerned, it has certain manifestations.</p>
<p>When we see light shining from an electric lamp, hear sounds emitting from a radio, and smell aromas coming out of an oven, we know that there is electricity. Electricity is invisible, but according to its manifestations, we know that it exists. In the same way, faith is something that cannot be shown. Whether a person&rsquo;s faith is only mental or based on revelation, it is something that cannot be shown to people. Nevertheless, man can perceive the manifestations of faith. One of the manifestations of faith is the forgiveness of sins, another is justification, and yet another is the receiving of God&rsquo;s life. Nevertheless, how can we perceive these manifestations? For many years we have paid much attention to and emphasized one thing; that is, when we contact people, we should not neglect to sense their inward feeling. When we discuss the matter of baptism with people, we may have paid more attention to what they have spoken than to their inward feeling.</p>
<p>In order to determine whether a person has received forgiveness of sins, we must first sense whether he has an inward feeling concerning sins. When we converse with him, we need to sense whether he has any feeling concerning sins. Paying attention to what he says explicitly or how much he knows concerning the truth of salvation is not as important as touching his inmost feeling concerning sins. He must sense before the Lord that he has sins and that within him he has the enlightening of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Sometimes I watched brothers converse with a person concerning baptism. After speaking with him for a long time, they were not clear whether he should be baptized. However, as I observed them, I became clear because his &ldquo;accent&rdquo; exposed him. If we want to know where a person is from, that is, whether he is from the South or North, we need him to speak only a few words. His accent will expose him. If I were to say that I am from southern China, few would believe me, because I speak with a northern accent. If I do not speak, even though a person may know that I am a Northerner, he would have no proof or evidence. As soon as I open my mouth and say that I am a Southerner, everyone will know that I am actually a Northerner. Despite what I say, my speaking, accent, and mannerisms will demonstrate that I am a Northerner.</p>
<p>Sometimes we may ask a person, &ldquo;Do you know that you are sinful?&rdquo; He may reply, &ldquo;I am not sure what is sin, but in regard to the Lord I have been feeling uneasy for several days and nights.&rdquo; In the end, we may judge that because this person is unclear regarding sin, he is not qualified to be baptized. This shows our spiritual blindness. We should not determine whether a person is ready to be baptized based on his words alone, that is, the explicit meaning of his words, but based on the spirit of his words.</p>
<p>A person may tell us that he hates someone, but actually, we may know that he loves this person very much. Although he uses the word <em>hate,</em> the spirit behind his word is love. In school, government, or license examinations the only thing that matters is what is explicitly said. There is no regard for the real condition or spirit behind what is spoken. A correct answer is right, and an incorrect answer is wrong. There is no concern for whether a person is genuinely right or genuinely wrong.</p>
<p>When we talk with people regarding baptism, our goal should not be for them to meet a formal requirement. Hence, we do not need to monotonously ask them about their consciousness of sins. Once while I was involved in interviews for baptism in Foochow, a woman came who was a gospel friend. The first question I asked her was, &ldquo;Have you consecrated yourself?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I am really sinful.&rdquo; Then I asked, &ldquo;What will you do then?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I have no way. I come to take refuge in the Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Then I continued to ask her, &ldquo;How can the Lord Jesus save you?&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;I thank Him for dying for me on the cross.&rdquo; I further asked her, &ldquo;Has He forgiven you of your sins?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I do not know. I only know that the Lord has died for me on the cross.&rdquo; At that point, I felt that there was no need to ask anything further and that it was proper to let her be baptized. She had been touched, contacted, and enlightened by the Holy Spirit. Hence, she needed to be baptized. Once she was baptized, she would be clear. This is what is meant by &ldquo;he who believes and is baptized shall be saved&rdquo; (Mark 16:16).</p>
<p>Many people have believed, but few are clear that they have been saved. They are not clear because they lack one thing&mdash;baptism. We cannot save people by baptizing them, but through baptism we can make them clear regarding their salvation. This is not a matter of doctrine. We cannot determine that a person is saved simply because he answers all our questions correctly. The most important matter to determine is whether he has contacted God and has been touched by God inwardly. This is a matter related to a person&rsquo;s inward feeling. All of us, especially the responsible brothers, must have a change in our understanding. We should not determine a person&rsquo;s readiness to be baptized based on his answering all of our questions correctly. Instead, we should look for indications or manifestations of his having been touched by the Holy Spirit. In other words, we have to see if the &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; has been transmitted into him. If he begins to give off &ldquo;light,&rdquo; &ldquo;sound,&rdquo; and &ldquo;aroma,&rdquo; this is proof that inwardly he has been connected to the electricity.</p>
<p>Once we have confirmed that a person has been forgiven, has been justified, and has received life, we will be able to prove that he has the faith necessary for baptism. Sometimes we are made clear by speaking merely one sentence. We may not even have finished half a question, yet we become clear that the person to whom we are speaking has contacted God inwardly. Of course, at other times we may talk with a person for two hours but still not be able to figure out if God has contacted him. Proper discernment requires that we develop certain skills. When we receive people and have a conversation with them regarding baptism, our decision regarding whether to baptize them should be made by sensing whether they have been contacted by God inwardly, not by testing them concerning doctrines.</p>
<p>When we address the matter of forgiveness of sins, we should first touch a person&rsquo;s feeling concerning sins and then ask whether he has repented and confessed his sins before God. When we ask someone regarding prayer and confession, he may say that he has prayed and confessed his sins; nevertheless in his speaking, we may sense that he does not have much inward feeling regarding confession. A person may confess his sins, but he may not have much feeling. For example, in a play an actor may call another person &ldquo;Daddy,&rdquo; but he does so without any feeling. However, when our children call us &ldquo;Daddy,&rdquo; it is full of affection. When a stranger calls us daddy, other people can tell that he is a stranger. When our children call us daddy, others can also tell that they are our own children. The feeling is altogether different.</p>
<p>Someone may tell us that he has confessed his sins, but we should determine whether he has truly confessed his sins by touching the feeling behind his words, not by the words themselves. Hence, we should question him further, asking, &ldquo;You have sins, and you have also confessed your sins, but how do you deal with your sins?&rdquo; This will lead him to the cross. We should not try to verify merely whether he knows about the cross but whether he has truly experienced the cross and whether he has a relationship with the cross, the Lord Jesus, and the blood of the Lord Jesus. Let us consider the sister from Foochow, whom we mentioned previously. She did not know if her sins were forgiven, but the feeling and taste made it clear that she had a relationship with the crucified Savior. It is one thing to have the relationship; it is another thing to merely know about the relationship. What we care for is not the knowing but the relationship itself. Hence, we need to observe what a person&rsquo;s inward feeling is upon receiving the cross and to ask him how he feels concerning the Lord&rsquo;s death and his being forgiven by the Lord. Perhaps he would say that he does not know and is not that clear; nevertheless, we need to touch his inner feeling. He should feel grateful to the Lord, be full of thanksgiving, and have a peace within that is incomprehensible to him. His words may not be clear, but behind his words there should be a tangible reality.</p>
<p>For example, when we go to Yangmingshan, a national park in Taiwan, it is easily identifiable by its streams of water and the odor of sulfur, which is due to the water passing through sulfur deposits as it flows out of the ground. The odor is strong, and there is no room for imitation. Likewise, when a person speaks, something within is expressed, producing a kind of &ldquo;flavor.&rdquo; When we hear a person&rsquo;s words, we should not only listen to the words that are spoken but should also sense the flavor that is brought forth through the words. Water is water, but some water carries the flavor of sulfur, some the flavor of a ditch, and some the flavor of a clear spring. Hence, the taste of the water is different because of the places through which the water flows.</p>
<p>Justification is a difficult experience to confirm. However, if a person has a clear experience of the forgiveness of sins, surely he is a justified person. In this sense, some can readily describe the feeling of justification. If you ask him, &ldquo;Do you know that you are saved?&rdquo; He would say, &ldquo;I truly know that I am saved. Formerly I was one who opposed God and was at enmity with Him; whenever I thought of God, I was full of hatred. But now whenever God&rsquo;s name is mentioned, I feel joyful and sweet within.&rdquo; There is usually no need to ask such a person any further questions. However, to be cautious, we should ask him, &ldquo;Do you have any feeling concerning sins? What is your realization concerning the Lord&rsquo;s dying on the cross for you?&rdquo; Such questions will help us verify that he is not experiencing mere psychological excitement without touching the spiritual reality.</p>
<p>We have indeed met this kind of person before; although, he does not know the Lord Jesus adequately and is not clear about the cross, he repeatedly says that whenever he hears God&rsquo;s name, he is joyful within. Hence, to be cautious, we should still ask him a few more questions. Of course, we also need to take into account a person&rsquo;s environment and background. If a person has been coming to the meetings for several days and is clear concerning the truths regarding the Lord Jesus and the redemption of the cross, we should have the confidence not to ask him any further questions. However, if a stranger tells us that whenever he hears God&rsquo;s name he is joyful, we should ask him a few more questions from another angle in order to have a clear sense of where he is at. We should do this because we do not know his background or real condition. Hence, when we are confirming a person&rsquo;s justification, first, we need to touch his former condition toward God; second, we need to find out his knowledge of the cross; third, we need to sense his inward response in regard to his receiving of the cross. The principle is always the same.</p>
<p>When we are confirming the experiences of life, we should not use too many words or pay too much attention to the outward changes in a person&rsquo;s living; rather, we should pay attention to his inward change in life, as expressed by his psychological being and his inner feeling. He may tell us that formerly he was happy doing certain things, but now he is not happy when he does them. Previously, he did not like certain things, but now he likes them very much. As we listen to him describing these things, we need to touch what is behind his words, that is, his change in life and disposition. In the past, when he heard of God, he felt disgusted inwardly, but now whenever God is mentioned, he is joyful. This is clearly a change in disposition. In the past he was happy when he danced, but now without any apparent reason he feels miserable when he goes dancing. This is a change in life, not a change merely in behavior.</p>
