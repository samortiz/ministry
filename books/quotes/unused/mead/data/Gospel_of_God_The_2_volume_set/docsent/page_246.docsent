   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Hence, the eternal life spoken of here is the eternal life in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The eternal life in the kingdom is obtained through works.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is acquired through consecration, through suffering and bearing reproach for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For the Christian, the question of eternal life in this age is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The question of eternal life in eternity is also solved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But whether or not he will have eternal life in the kingdom depends on whether he loves the Lord, forsakes everything for the sake of the gospel, denies himself in everything, and rejects the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It depends on whether or not he is living for money, for material gain, for his family, or for the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If he loves the Lord and forsakes all things for the sake of the gospel, the Lord promised that he will not lose these things even in this age, but on the contrary, he will gain a hundred times as much.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If one gives up a little for the Lord today, he will reap a hundredfold return in the heavenly bank.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Who can get such a high interest rate?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A deposit of one dollar will yield a hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You cannot find such a bank in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In addition, there is eternal life in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In many places in Matthew, the phrase "eternal life" is used interchangeably with the word "kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In these places the living ones are the ones who enter into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, Matthew 7:14 says that the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few that find it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today many preach the gospel using this passage, and exhort people to enter the narrow gate and take the constricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if one were saved through entering the narrow gate and taking the constricted way, salvation would not be of grace, but of works.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Salvation would then become a reward for entering the narrow gate and taking the constricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The eternal life revealed in the book of Matthew does not refer to the eternal life of today; rather, it refers to the life in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to reign with Christ in the kingdom, a person must enter the narrow gate and take the constricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If one does not obey God's commandments and God's will, he will lose his eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, this does not mean that he will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But he will lose the eternal life in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If this problem is solved, then the problem of the ages in the Bible will be clearly resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the age of the church, everything is by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the end of the church age, God will establish His kingdom through His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the kingdom only the faithful servants will reign with Christ by being resurrected from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible shows us this very clearly.</S>
