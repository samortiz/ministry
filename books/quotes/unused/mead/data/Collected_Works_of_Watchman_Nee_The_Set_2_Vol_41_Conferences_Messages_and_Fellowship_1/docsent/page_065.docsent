   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING BESIDE OURSELVES IN SUFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not only do we have to be beside ourselves in preaching the gospel and in offering our all, we must also be beside ourselves in suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Stephen was stoned to death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul and Silas were imprisoned for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The book of Acts, however, shows us that the disciples were rejoicing, even though they were suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After their release, they were not ashamed but exuberant.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They were truly beside themselves for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nothing was too great, too difficult, or too hard for them when it was done for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Polycarp, the eighty-six-year-old bishop of Smyrna, was taken to prison, the executioners could not bear to see him be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They tried to be lenient with him and only asked him to say, "I do not know Jesus the Nazarene" so that they could release him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet he answered, "I cannot deny Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have served Him for eighty-six years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During these eighty-six years, He has never denied me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How can I love my body and deny Him now?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They took him to the stake.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the lower part of his body was being burned, he was still able to speak, and he said, "Thank God that I have the opportunity to be burned here today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thank God that I can testify for Him with my life."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was truly beside himself in suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One sister was persecuted for the Lord's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the midst of her suffering, those who were persecuting her told her that if she would bow to the image of Artemis, they would let her go.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet she said, "Should I choose Christ, or should I choose Artemis?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From the first day I have chosen Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you ask me to choose again, I will still choose Him."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the end she was killed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Two other sisters who were still alive said, "Many of God's children are taken away and martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why are we still here?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Later, they were dragged into the prison.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They saw many people being taken to the arena and fed to the beasts, but none of them had any regret.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The two sisters said, "Many people have testified with their blood already.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why can we only testify with our mouth?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One of the two sisters was married, and the other one was engaged.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their parents, husband, and fianc came and begged them to change.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They even brought the little child of the married sister to plead with her to deny the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the sisters said, "What can you give to us in exchange for Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the end they were also taken away to the lions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While they were walking to their death, they were singing, and they did not stop singing until their bodies were torn into pieces by the lions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In his book, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon spoke of an officer in the Roman army who sent word to Caesar that if they sent all the Christians in the Roman Empire to the lions, there would not be any citizens left.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At that time the Christians in the Roman Empire did not testify with their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They testified with their blood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As soon as one of them was martyred, more Christians would be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They were not afraid of death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even though they were cruelly persecuted, they were still able to testify strongly for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When others saw them taking turns being killed, they thought these ones were crazy!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, this is the power of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today the Lord is calling men to forsake themselves to be martyrs for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord is now asking, "Where are the ones who are beside themselves?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Can you answer, "Here am I. I am absolutely for You"?</S>
