   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SAMUEL PRAYING AND CALLING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>UPON THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Samuel was another wonderful person in the Old Testament, a man who prayed for the children of God continually.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible says that Samuel told the people that he would not sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for them 1 Sam 12:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Samuel learned that King Saul offended God, he was grieved and cried to the Lord the entire night 1 Sam 15:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the Bible refers to Samuel as a man who called upon the name of the Lord Psa 99:6 and as a man who stood in the presence of God Jer 15:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All of this reveals to us that Samuel was a person who prayed continually, who called on the name of the Lord, and who stood in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By standing in the presence of the Lord and by calling on the name of the Lord, he enjoyed the Lord, partaking of Him as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This motivation and enjoyment made him such a wonderful person in human history.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>XIII.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>DAVID TRUSTING IN GOD, LOOKING TO HIM,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>AND ENJOYING GOD'S LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>David was a man who trusted in God and looked to Him 1 Sam 17:37, 45; 30:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The secret of David's life was that he desired to dwell continually in the house of God and to behold His beauty Psa 27:4, 8, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that he enjoyed the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, he enjoyed God as the fatness and as the river of joy Psa 36:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>David said, "With thee is the fountain of life."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This proves that even in ancient times David enjoyed God's life as the tree of life and as the river flowing within him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This enjoyment of God made him such a great king among the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>XIV.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>DANIEL PRAYING TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are all familiar with the story of Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, most Christians are just curious about Daniel's prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They want to know about the great image in Daniel 2, the image with the golden head, silver shoulders, brass abdomen, iron legs, and clay toes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They also want to know about the beasts that emerge from the sea in Daniel 7.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All of the young people are interested in these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although many years ago I spent a great deal of time studying these things, I eventually came to appreciate other aspects of the book of Daniel even more.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now I like the book of Daniel because in it I see a man who prayed constantly and contacted the Lord continually Dan 6:10-11; 9:3-4; 10:2-3, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to Daniel 6, Daniel was preeminent among the governors and princes in the kingdom of Darius.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The other governors and princes were jealous and plotted against him, seeking to destroy him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Daniel learned of this, he went to the Lord and prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The aim of the conspiracy of the one hundred twenty governors was to shake Daniel's relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, Daniel opened his windows toward Jerusalem and prayed three times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Daniel learned from reading the prophecy of Jeremiah that the seventy-year period of exile and captivity was soon to expire, he began to pray Dan 9:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then he received another vision and he prayed continually for three weeks until the answer came Dan 10:1-3, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Daniel's prayer life issued out of a holy life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He lived a holy life in the heathen land of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, Daniel refused to eat the king's food, the food which was first offered to idols and then used to feed the king and his people Dan 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Daniel refused that food, and he enjoyed God very much.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He enjoyed God as the tree of life.</S>
