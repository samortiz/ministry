<h2 class="head1">A PERSONAL TESTIMONY</h2><p>Before I came into the church, I was saved and was loving the Lord. I did not love the world. Rather, I was a clean, young Christian who sought the Lord, studied the Bible, and prayed every day. However, after I came into the church, I was thoroughly searched, not by any teacher, but by something within. At that time, I did not have the terms we have today. Nevertheless, I experienced the searching and made a thorough confession to the Lord. Before coming into the church meetings, I used to make a thorough confession of item after item. What a searching and digging that was! Many of us have had a similar experience. This was the experience of the enlightening, the searching, the exposing, and the judging of the Lord. I can still recall the judgment I underwent as I came to the meetings. I hated myself, my nature, my old man, and my disposition. Oh, how I hated and judged myself! I especially experienced this at the Lord&rsquo;s table. On the one hand, I was remembering the Lord, but, on the other hand, I was under His judgment. He seemed to be saying, &ldquo;You are so fleshly, so natural, and so much in yourself. You are still too much in the old creation.&rdquo; As I sat at the Lord&rsquo;s table, I was under this inner judgment. This was the work of the flaming lamps in the church. I had never experienced this before.</p><p>As a result of this flaming of the seven lamps, the Lord Jesus became so precious, so dear, and so lovable to me. Never before had I had such a deep sense of the Lord&rsquo;s preciousness and loveliness. This was the transfusing and infusing of the Lord Jesus Himself into my being. How dear, precious, and available the Lord was to me! He was a lovely treasure to me. I loved Him more than ever before. I had truly been infused with Him. I can testify that during that time I was in the third heaven and that every sin and weakness was under my feet. I had no need to try to overcome anything.</p><p>Following this infusing, there was the impartation of life. The seven lamps became the seven eyes, and the seven eyes became the seven Spirits. The enlightening, searching, exposing, and judging issued in the transfusing of the Lord Jesus into me, and this transfusion resulted in the impartation of life. I received more life, the life which is just Christ Himself. More of Christ was added into my being. He was imparted deeply into my whole being. In those days I did not have the terminology, but I did have the experience. As a result, I had some transformation, and I loved the church and all the saints meeting with me. This was the building.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SEVEN LAMPS<br />BECOMING THE FLOW OF LIVING WATER</h2><p>Ultimately, this building will consummate in the New Jerusalem, which will be the ultimate and eternal enlargement of our wonderful God. If you would understand the Gospel of John and the book of Revelation, and even the whole Bible, you must see the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits of God. Eventually, the New Jerusalem comes into existence, in which the seven Spirits before the throne of God&rsquo;s administration will become the flow of the river of water of life proceeding from the throne. In the New Jerusalem, the seven lamps before the administrative throne will become the water of life flowing out of the life-imparting throne, and the stone Himself will be the lamp shining God through the city for eternity. These are the crucial points of the revelation in the Bible. May we all see them.</p>
