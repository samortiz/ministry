   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LOCATION OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our spirit is the location of the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is based upon Philippians 2:1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to point out as clearly and strongly as possible that if our contact with one another is not in the spirit, right away it becomes a social thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our contact must be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then our contact becomes the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is because the flowing of the divine life is altogether not in our soul, our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is altogether in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The fellowship of life is carried out by God's Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our mind may apprehend the fellowship, but it is not in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our emotions may be happy about it, but the fellowship of life is not in our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is altogether in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>So if we are apart from our spirit or outside of our spirit, right away our contact with one another becomes a kind of social association that is no longer the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fellowship of life must be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>V. THE FUNCTION OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>SUPPLYING US WITH ALL THE RICHES</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>OF THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the fellowship of life did not have a function, it would be meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The function of the fellowship of life is to supply us with all the riches of the divine life John 15:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more the divine life flows within us the more supply of life it carries to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A good picture of this is the flowing of the river of the water of life in the New Jerusalem Rev 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In that river is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The tree of life indicates the supply that goes along with the flowing of the river of water of life, which is the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, the tree of life going along with the river indicates the function of the flowing of the river of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This function is to supply us with the riches of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 15:4-5 says that we abide in the vine and then the vine abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This abiding supplies us with the life-juice of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We know this because our abiding eventually issues in fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The fruit-bearing proves that the abiding supplies us with the rich life of the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fellowship of life functions in this unique thing to supply us with the riches of the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE ISSUE OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE A. Bringing Light to Us</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first issue of the fellowship of life is that it brings light to us 1 John 1:5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is light, and if we have fellowship with Him, we are in the light.</S>
