<P>Do you believe that all the members of the church are wonderful persons? It seems that the members of the Body, the saved ones, are peculiar people. This means that according to the flesh, according to the natural man, it is not easy to be together with the believers. Unless you learn the lessons, sooner or later, you will drop out. With the matter of the church there is no choice. This requires us to learn how to fear the Lord and deal with our flesh.</P><P>In 1926 Brother Watchman Nee started to work in Shanghai to establish the church there. Later, in 1942 the enemy raised up a big turmoil in the church in Shanghai. Brother Nee was put in a position that he could no longer minister there. Some of the saints came to Brother Nee, saying, "Brother Nee, let us have another start. Let us start another meeting." Brother Nee told them, "No. You have to continue going to that meeting. No matter what kind of attitude they have toward you or toward me, you have to go to that meeting. That is the church. Neither you nor I have the right to start another thing." This is the test to the self, to the soul-life. This is the biggest lesson.</P><P>Today it is very easy for the believers to form meetings. Many believers who are dissatisfied with the so-called traditional church service just meet in their homes. They think everyone has the right to set up a meeting. They are too free. There is no limitation, no rule. I once went to a certain city and met with at least three or four free groups. They all claimed that they were non-sectarian, yet they would not come together to be one with one another. Every group keeps itself independent, separate, from the others. Strictly speaking, this is lawlessness. There is no regulation, no rule. We should not be legalistic, but we should not be too liberal either. We need to be governed, ruled.</P><P>The proper governing rule or principle is the oneness. Suppose there are some brothers in a certain locality. They start to meet in the name of the Lord on the proper ground of oneness. When I go to their city, I have no right to set up another meeting. I have to keep the oneness with them. Right away, however, I am put on the test because human beings always like to take the lead. If I had started the meeting there, I might have been number one. But now that I come here to meet with them, I would be number two. Everyone likes to be the king. Because I do not want to be the second but the first, I would not submit to their meeting. Rather, I would set up another meeting so that I may be a little king. If there is not the grace and the lesson of the cross, everyone of us would be like this. But here is the test. If we are going to keep the oneness of the Body, we do not have a choice. There are many lessons for us to learn in order to keep the oneness.</P><P>Look at today's situation among the Christians. There are divisions after divisions because of the flesh, the self, and the natural man. There are the state churches and the denominational churches. Following this, there is the Brethren practice. Then today there are so many free groups. Today the practice of the free groups is fashionable. They say that they are really free from the denominational system, but the divisions created by the free groups are endless. If I do not agree with you who are meeting on Twenty-third Street, I will set up a meeting on Twenty-fifth Street. If I am not satisfied with the meeting that is in your home, I will set up a meeting in my home. This is too free. The free groups simply neglect the oneness of the Body of Christ. We have to honor this ground of oneness.</P><P>Do you think there is a proper reason for you to separate yourself from other Christians meeting in the Lord's name on the ground of oneness? No reason is proper, and no reason is valid. As long as you live in Israel, you have to go together with all of Israel to worship God. You have no choice but to do it. If you would not do it, that means you break the law and you have become lawless. Suppose you and another Israelite are enemies. It is a real problem. You and he, according to the law, have to go to the same place three times a year to worship God. This is a real test. Therefore, you have to forgive him, and he has to forgive you. You have to learn how to be happy with him by the Lord's grace, and he has to learn to be happy with you. You have to keep the oneness. I believe this is clear to all of us.</P>
