   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SEQUENCE OF THE FIVE CONDITIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order that we may be deeply impressed with these conditions, especially with the sequence in which they are presented, let me say a further word concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not only is every condition meaningful, but the sequence of the five conditions is particularly meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first condition is that of redeeming the firstling of a donkey with a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that if we would enjoy the Lord, we need to realize that we are donkeys, that we are poor beasts under the load of a heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, as donkeys we are unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Leviticus 11, a donkey is listed among the unclean animals.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have seen that the donkey here signifies our natural life and natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot enjoy the Lord with our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we remain unclean beasts under a heavy burden, we cannot have the enjoyment of Christ as the feasts, and we cannot rest with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, our natural life needs to be replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning this matter, the New Testament is full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The natural life has been crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now it must be rejected and fully abandoned by us in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the sequence, the next condition is that, as redeemed ones, we should not mix the redeeming blood with a sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we intend to enjoy the Lord, we must stay away from leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is logical that this condition is second and not first.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It would not make sense to first require that we not mix the redeeming blood with leaven and then go on to require that our natural life be replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The proper sequence is that first our natural life is replaced with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then after this replacement, we must learn to stay away from sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is to fulfill the condition of not mixing the redeeming blood with leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The third condition is that we enjoy our present portion of Christ to the uttermost and not leave any part of it for the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, very few of today s Christians exhaust the enjoyment of their portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not many Christians, including us, enjoy Christ to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As an illustration of the third condition, we may speak of a mother who tells her little child to finish his food, to clean his plate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>She may say to him, I want you to finish your food.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Clean your plate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you don t finish what you have, I won t give you anything else to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Certain mothers are strong with their children regarding this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But some mothers are too lenient and easily let their children have their way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They may give a child something to eat, and if he does not like it, they will offer him something else instead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, other mothers will insist that the children eat what they have before they give them something else.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I believe this illustrates the way God would train us to enjoy Christ today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He may say, Finish what I have already given you of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you do not enjoy the portion you have now, I will not give you anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You must exhaust your portion of Christ today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The next condition in the sequence is that as we enjoy our portion of Christ in a full way, we should reserve the topmost portion, the firstfruit, for God s enjoyment and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should bring this topmost portion of our enjoyment of Christ to God s house for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The last condition is that we should not kill any believers, especially young ones, in the sphere of the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The milk in 34:26 indicates the sphere of the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we are enjoying Christ to the uttermost and offering God something of Christ for His satisfaction, we should be careful to avoid killing others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should never boil a kid in its mother s milk.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These five conditions describe the actual experience of the enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I came to understand these conditions through my experience in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Through my experience I see that in my natural life I am a donkey and that I need to be replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I also see that I need to stay away from leaven, that I need to be obedient to the requirement to enjoy Christ today, that I need to have the topmost experience of the enjoyment of the Lord for God s satisfaction, and that I must not commit any kind of spiritual killing in the sphere of the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I believe that many of us can testify that what is signified by these five conditions corresponds to our spiritual experience.</S>
