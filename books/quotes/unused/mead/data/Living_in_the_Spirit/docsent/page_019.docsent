   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE GUARDING OURSELVES FROM IDOLS AND LIVING IN THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:24, 27-28; 4:13; 5:4, 18-21; Heb 4:12; 6:18-20 ABIDING IN THE LORD UNTIL HE COMES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Triune God became the life-giving Spirit to abide in our spirit and to become one with us 1 Cor 15:45; 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now He wants us to live by Him, having one life and one living with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe that we have all seen and heard this already.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What we need is to look to the Lord that He may continue to grant us mercy and grace so that we would live according to what we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not necessary to see this again or to seek some other method.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We just need to live according to the vision we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First John 2:24 says, "As for you, that which you heard from the beginning, let it abide in you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If that which you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should appreciate the words abide and abides.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we let that which we heard from the beginning abide in us, we will abide in the Son and in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This speaking is not of the earth but of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One cannot hear this kind of speaking among human beings on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of speaking is from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is amazing that we can abide in the Son and in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The apostle John said, "Little children, abide in Him" v. 28 . This does not mean to abide for just one day or three days, but to abide until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To abide in the Lord is not just to stay in Him but to live and move in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since we have heard this eternal mystery, from now on we should simply abide in the Lord, living and walking in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not ask how to abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Simply abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you have been saved, then you have the Lord in you, and you will surely know how to abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, do not study.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Simply abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to abide in Him until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A MYSTERIOUS FACT THE LORD BEING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In God's economy there is a great fact that we are often not conscious of and do not care much about.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This fact is that when we repented and believed into the Lord, the Lord as the living Spirit entered into us in an imperceptible way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you do not believe this, you can try an experiment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Try to say, "I do not feel that the Lord is abiding in me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not want Him, and I do not believe in Him anymore."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you would try such an experiment, immediately you would discover that the Lord is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more you would say, "I do not believe anymore," the more the Lord would say, "You cannot do that.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have to remain here."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may say, "I do not want Jesus anymore," but He would say, "I want you."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you would try this, you would realize that there is such a Person in you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The unbelievers do not have such a Person in them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How can we tell who are believers in Christ and who are not?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot judge merely by outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The believers have a mysterious person in them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is truly a very mysterious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are millions of people throughout the world today who have believed in Jesus, yet none of them have seen the Lord Jesus with their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In a sense, we have seen Him in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Outwardly, however, none of us have seen Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nevertheless, within us is something that makes it impossible for us to stay away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even if we were to fall and become degraded to the extent that we appeared improper to others, this mysterious Person would still be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The more we say, "I do not believe in Him, I do not want Him, I do not care about Him, and I do not care for Him," the tighter He will hold us within.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This proves that something mysterious has happened in us the wonderful One, the all-inclusive Lord Spirit, has entered into us.</S>
