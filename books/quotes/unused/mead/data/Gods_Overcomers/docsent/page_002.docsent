   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many people cannot stand and wait.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To stand is to wait for an order.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All those who cannot stand and wait before the Lord cannot minister to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have two kinds of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One is to receive a command and not obey it; this is rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The other is to have no command and yet do something; this is presumption Psa 19:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is not a matter of good or bad but of having or not having God s command.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Good things can damage the believers very much; they are a great enemy to God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the outer court one takes orders from the offerers of sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the Holy Place one takes orders from God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To present to Me the fat and the blood Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>44:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God s righteousness and holiness fill the Holy Place, and His glory fills the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The blood is for God s righteousness and holiness, while the fat is for God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Glory is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Holiness is God s nature, while righteousness is God s procedure, His way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The blood is there for the forgiveness of sins; it satisfies God s righteousness and holiness, and it enables us to come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The fat is to satisfy God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The blood deals with the old creation, while the fat is for the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the Lord poured out His blood, it meant that He poured out all His natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today the Lord has flesh and bones Luke 24:39 but no blood.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He does not have a drop of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Every day we have to learn to deny our natural life before the Lord; this is the aspect of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At the same time, we have to offer up the resurrection life; this is the aspect of the fat Rom 6:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is they who will enter My sanctuary Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>44:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To be in the sanctuary is to be in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are very afraid of being in the sanctuary because if we remain in the sanctuary it is easy to be misunderstood, slandered, and criticized.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But we should dwell in the house of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We are not narrow; our hearts are broad and ambitious.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Paul said in his Epistles that he was determined to be well pleasing to the Lord 2 Cor 5:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have to pursue ministering to the Lord rather than to the house.</S>

   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>One can sweat when he kills the bulls and the goats in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But he cannot sweat when he is ministering to the Lord in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>One can exert spiritual strength before the Lord, but he must not sweat.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Committees, discussions, and propagandas all belong to the realm of sweating.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Spiritual work touches God alone, while fleshly work touches men alone.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The more spiritual a work is, the more inward it is.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But the work of the flesh is all outward.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>God did not command all the Levites to minister to Him in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He only ordered the sons of Zadok to minister to Him in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>God invites men to minister to Him in His Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He wants men to preserve His Holy Place, shine out from there, and separate the holy things from the common things, and the clean things from the unclean things.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Acts 13:1-3 tells us when they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit sent them out on their missionary work abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Our work abroad should start with our ministering to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The Lord is after drafted workers, not volunteer workers.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Hebrews emphasizes two things: our ministering to God within the veil and our suffering the reproach of the Lord without the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Ministering to Him after Working</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>In Luke 17:7-10, plowing is preaching of the gospel, while tending sheep is caring for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>To serve me means that one has to minister to the Lord even after he has worked.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>To eat and drink is to remember and to enjoy the fruit of our work; we must first allow the Lord to eat and drink before we enjoy eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The result of our work should first satisfy the Lord s heart before it satisfies our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>After we have worked, we should not eat, drink, and enjoy; rather, we should say, We are unprofitable slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Gird yourself and serve me means that after one has worked, he should still be on the alert to minister to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>May we pursue a ministry to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The work in the field is not as good as the ministry in the house, and the field and the sheep are not as good as the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Morning, January 22, 1934</S>
