   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to God's Good Pleasure God's Heart Pleasure Which God Purposed in Himself</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's eternal purpose is of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we need to see that God's will is according to God's good pleasure Eph 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's good pleasure is His heart pleasure, which we may call the desire of His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our God is living, loving, and purposeful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The living, loving, and purposeful God surely has a desire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Every living thing and especially every living person has a desire, a good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we desire pleasure, then certainly God does also.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only something dead or nonliving has no such need.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more living we are, the more pleasure we need.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The degree of our livingness determines how much pleasure we need.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because God is certainly the most living One, He surely needs the most pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we, as fallen sinners, require pleasure, then how much more does God, the living One, have a deep need for it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The book of Ephesians reveals that God needs pleasure; it reveals the desire of God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The biblical term for "the desire of God's heart" is "the good pleasure of His will."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The good pleasure of God's will is the desire of God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our God is living and loving.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John 3:16 says, "God so loved the world."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why did God love the world?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He loved the world because out of the world He will have His good pleasure, His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The eternal purpose of God is of God's will according to God's good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's purpose, God's will, and God's good pleasure are interrelated.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The living, loving, purposeful God has a desire, which is His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God had this desire, this good pleasure, in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then within Himself He determined to accomplish something in order to have the fulfillment of His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that God's desire became His determined intent to have what He wants.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the source of God's eternal economy is actually God's good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First, God had a pleasure, a desire.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then He determined to carry out this desire, and this became God's will, what God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, God's good pleasure, His desire, comes first.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Within Himself God purposed to carry out this desire, to get what He wants, and that became His will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What God wants is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From this we can see that the church is God's good pleasure, God's will, God's purpose, and God's oikonomia.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, all this is a mystery, a hidden, mysterious story.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates that the church is a great matter, for the church is God's desire, God's good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's will is to have the church, and He has purposed to carry out the desire to have the church which He wants.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore based upon His desire, will, and purpose, God made a plan, an oikonomia, a household arrangement, a household administration.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, God's economy is His planned administration to carry out His eternal purpose to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God had a desire, a good pleasure, according to which He has a will.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Based upon His will, God made a purpose, a determined intent.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He then made a plan to administrate His purpose, and this plan is to dispense Himself as life, life supply, and everything into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the economy of God.</S>
