   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Three</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The basic concern today is that we must learn to live in a way that does not hinder God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some habits force God to withhold His blessing, and these must be eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some temperaments keep God from blessing, and these must be done away with.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must learn to believe in God's blessing, rely on it, and eliminate the barriers which prevent us from receiving it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us take Sian as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the brothers were divided into two parties, this definitely hindered God from blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If their problem had continued to exist, God's blessing would not have come in. In another example, there have been some difficulties in Szechuan recently.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we cannot expect Szechuan to have any special blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I merely mention these matters as examples.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must see that the Lord withholds no good thing from us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the work is not going well, if the brothers and sisters are in a poor condition, or if the number of saved ones is not increasing, we should not use the environment or certain people as an excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot blame the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am afraid that the real reason lies with our harboring of some frustrations to the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the Lord can get through in us, the Lord's blessing will be greater than our capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once God said to the Israelites, "Prove Me, if you will, by this,..whether I will open to you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it" Mal 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is still saying this today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The normal life of a Christian is a life of blessing, and the normal work of a Christian is a work of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not receive blessing, we should say, "Lord, perhaps I am the problem."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With the passing years it becomes more and more evident that some brothers receive God's blessing while others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Of ourselves, we are not able to form any judgment about this matter, but over the years this fact has become so evident that we know beforehand that there will be fruit if one brother goes out but none if another brother goes out.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We seemingly can forecast the result.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Four</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are definite requirements for receiving the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It does not come by accident or luck.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has His ways and works according to His principles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God likes certain conditions and does not like others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Esau was very good, but God did not like him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jacob was not good, but God liked him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has His own reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a person does not receive God's blessing, there is a reason for it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we do not receive God's blessing, we should not push the responsibility for it onto the situation or environment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is always a reason for not being blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we could be brought to the point in which we wholeheartedly hope for His blessing and wholeheartedly ask Him to show us the reason for not being blessed, God's work would have a great future.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I really hope that we could live on the earth by expecting the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nothing is as important as God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The results of the work are in the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am well aware that we all have our own particular weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God seems to overlook some of these, but He will not tolerate other ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Where these exist His blessing cannot rest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It seems that God does not care about some weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It does not bother Him if you make these mistakes over and over again, but God cares about other weaknesses very much.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, we must be very careful about the weaknesses which might cause us to lose God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may be unable to eliminate all our weaknesses, but we must ask God to have mercy on us so that we would be those who are able to receive His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should say to the Lord, "This vessel is weak, but forbid that it should be too shallow or too small to contain Your blessing."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even though we are shallow and small, we are still able to contain His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's blessing and gifts are His work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, we hope God would have mercy on us.</S>
