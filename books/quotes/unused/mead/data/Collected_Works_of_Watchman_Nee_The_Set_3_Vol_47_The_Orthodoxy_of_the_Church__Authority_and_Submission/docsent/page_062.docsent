   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God Never Reasoning</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Romans 9 Paul tried to prove to the Jews that God has called the Gentiles also.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He said that not all of the seed of Abraham were chosen; only Isaac was chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And not all of the seed of Isaac were chosen; God chose only Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since everything is of God's choice, can God not choose the Gentiles as well?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God will have mercy on whomever He will have mercy, and will have compassion on whomever He will have compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Humanly speaking, God loved the wicked Jacob, while He hated the honest Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He also hardened Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Is He then unfair?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to realize that God sits on His throne of glory, and man is under His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who are we but humble mortals, nothing but dust.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How can we reason with God?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He has the authority to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We cannot follow God on the one hand, while forcing Him to listen to our reason on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we want to serve Him, we must give up all reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every person who has met the Lord has to throw away all his reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can only stand on the position of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We cannot stand on the position of interference, attempting to act as God's counselor.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God says that He will have mercy on whomever He will have mercy 9:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How precious is the word "will have."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to worship Him for this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God does not reason at all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God chooses to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He delights in doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the God of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul went on to say, "So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy" v. 16 . God said of Pharaoh, "For this very thing I have raised you up, that I might show in you My power" v. 17 . Moreover, He said that "He hardens whom He wills" v. 18 . To harden does not mean to cause to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It means to "give one up" as recorded in 1:26.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Up to this point Paul anticipated that there would be more reasonings, such as, "Why does He still find fault?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For who withstands His will?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>9:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These reasons are very valid.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many will agree with them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul also knew that they were quite reasonable and sensible, but he retorted, "But rather, O man, who are you who answer back to God?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Shall the thing molded say to him who molded it, Why did you make me thus?" v. 20 . Paul did not counter the reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather he asked, "Who are you?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul did not ask what kind of words these are.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He asked rather what kind of person would dare reply against God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When God exercises His authority, He does not have to discuss it with us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He does not need our consent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All He asks is our submission to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As long as we say, "This is God's doing," everything will be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man is constantly trying to reason.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But please consider whether or not our salvation had any reason behind it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There was absolutely no reason for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We did not will, nor did we run.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the most unreasonable thing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But God will have mercy on whom He will have mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Out of the clay, the potter can make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is only the question of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is no question of reason.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The basic problem with man today is that he is still under the principle of the knowledge of good and evil, the principle of reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the Bible reasoned out everything, then we could be justified in reasoning out everything.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But in Romans 9 God opened up a special window from heaven to shine on us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He did not reason with us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He only asked, "Who are you?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Seeing God's Glory Delivering Us from Reasons</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not easy for man to be delivered from evil speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But it is more difficult for man to be delivered from reason.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When I was young, I was always bothered by God's unreasonable acts.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Later, when I read Romans 9, I touched God's authority for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I began to see who I am.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am His creature.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>My most reasonable words are but stubbornness before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The God who is far above all is unapproachable in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we would see only a millionth part of His glory, we would bow down and cast off all our reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only those who live far off can be proud, and only those who live in darkness can abide in reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>No one in the whole world can see himself in his own torchlight.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only when the Lord grants us a little light and reveals a little of His glory to us will we fall down as dead, just like the apostle John Rev 1:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>May God be merciful to us that we would see how unworthy and lowly a person we are.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>How dare we argue with God?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When the queen of the south came to visit Solomon and he revealed a little of his glory to her, there was no more spirit left in her.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But there is One who is greater than Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Is there any reason in me that cannot be given up?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Adam sinned because he ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>From then on, reason became rooted in man's very being.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But if God would reveal just a little of His glory to us, we would see that we are but a dead dog and a lump of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>All our reasons would vanish in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The more a person lives in glory, the less he will reason.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>However, the more you see a person reason, the more you know that he has never seen glory.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>During these years I have found out one thing God's work is never according to reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Even if I do not understand what He is doing, I still have to worship Him because I am His servant.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If everything that He does is understood and realized by me, I might as well be the one to sit on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Once I see that He is far above me, that only He is the Most High One, and that I should bow down in the dust, all reasons will disappear from me.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>From this day forward, authority only is the fact, not reasons, rights, and wrongs.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Those who know God surely know themselves, and once a person knows himself, all reasons are removed.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The way to know God is by submission.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Everyone who lives in reason does not know God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Only those who willingly submit to authority can truly know God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>All of the knowledge of good and evil that we inherited from Adam must be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Then our submission will be very easy.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>"I Am Jehovah" Being the Reason</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Every time the Lord commanded the Israelites to do something in Leviticus 18 22, He inserted the words, "I am Jehovah," in between the commands.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>There is not even the word because.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I speak this way, for I am Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>There need be no other reason.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>"I am Jehovah" is the reason.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If we see this, we will not live by reason from this day on.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We have to say to God, "In the past I lived by my thoughts and reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Today I bow down and worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>As long as it is of You, it is enough for me.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I will worship You."</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>When Paul was struck down on the way to Damascus, all reasons vanished from him.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Once light shines in, a person falls down.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The first word that came out of Paul's mouth was, "What shall I do, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Acts 22:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Immediately, he became obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Those who know God do not reason.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When the light judges, the reason disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>For man to reason with God is for him to say that God's work requires our consent.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This is the thought of the most foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>God does not have to tell us the reason for anything He does.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>God's way is higher than our way.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If we pulled God down to the level of reason, we would have God no longer, because He would be no different from us.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If we reason, there will be no more worship.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>When submission goes, a lack of worship follows.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>When this happens, the self becomes the judge of God and even becomes God.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>What difference then is there between the clay and the potter?</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Will the potter have to ask permission from the clay to do anything?</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>May God's glory be revealed so that all our reasons cease.</S>
