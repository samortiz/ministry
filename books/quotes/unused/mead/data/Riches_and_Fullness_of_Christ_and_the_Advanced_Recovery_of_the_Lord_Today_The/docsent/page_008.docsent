   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>As Power Tabernacling over the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This grace is what God is in Himself as all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now it is gradually wrought and constituted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this way, this power becomes everything to us, and it has become the power that tabernacles over us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Empowering the Believers in All Things, Making Them Uncommon</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moreover, this grace is empowering us in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul told us that he became an uncommon person not through himself, but through the grace of Christ that was present in him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can use electricity as an illustration of how Christ is present in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When electricity is present with the microphone, it will transmit our voice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of course, when electricity is present with man, man will be killed by it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the result of the presence of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Christ is present with us, the first thing He brings is the killing element.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After this, He enables us to live with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our destiny is to die with Christ and to live with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without the presence of Christ, we can never experience death, and we can never experience resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will remain in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is something to be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can only be a proper and right person when we die with Christ and live together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is like an electric toy: without electricity, it will not move but will remain in the same place all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when electricity is applied, it will turn around unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is the same way with us, the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the grace of Christ is present with the believers, it will empower them in all things and will make them uncommon persons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST The Spirit of Jesus Christ Being the Embodiment of Christ, Who Is the Pneumatic Christ in Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The all-inclusiveness and limitlessness of Christ become the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today, these riches become the grace that we enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This grace comes upon us through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Triune God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The ultimate consummation of the Triune God is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moreover, after the Lord Jesus resurrected from the dead, He also became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But this does not mean that there are three Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is only the three aspects of the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As far as God is concerned, His nature is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As far as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God is concerned, and as far as the Lord's incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension are concerned, He is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, all the riches of Christ that come to us as grace and enjoyment are also a matter of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From my youth, I learned to treasure the grace of God, but I had no idea what this grace is, or how this Spirit comes to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even at that time, however, grace came upon me day by day, and the Spirit was with me all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Grace be with you.''</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord's grace is simply the Lord being with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This morning we feel happy and sweet while we are singing the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is because the Spirit of God is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This Spirit of God that is with us is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If your parents bother you, you can still sing and can still say "Hallelujah.''</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is because grace is with you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If others praise you and commend your merits, you will not be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the contrary, you can be humble and can have the full sense that you are glorifying God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This shows that the Spirit is present with you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This Spirit that is present with you is the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whatever we could not do formerly but are able to do now is done through the presence of the Spirit, that is, through the presence of this instant grace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Riches of Christ Becoming the Bountiful Supply of This Spirit to the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The riches of Christ realized in the Spirit are the bountiful supply to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whatever we need is supplied to us in this bountiful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we need God, this bountiful Spirit is God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you think that your humanity is too poor, the Spirit within you will supply you with the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you need patience, this Spirit will supply you with patience.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you need utterance, this Spirit will supply you with utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you need joy or peace, this Spirit will supply you with joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These bountiful supplies are also the grace that continually supplies us within.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This Spirit Abiding in the Believers to Become One Spirit with Them, That They May Experience Christ and Live Him</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have seen that this grace is a Person, and this Person is the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Spirit of God is simply the reality of Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the end, what comes to us is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When He is enjoyed by us, He becomes grace.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hence, the key today is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He is not in our ears, or in our mind, but in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.''</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This shows that the Spirit can become one spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The end of this experience is that our whole being will become the grace of Christ, who is the all-inclusive and limitless One.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At the end of his Epistles, Paul often mentioned grace and peace being with us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We know that peace comes from grace, and grace is the Spirit that is present with us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Now this Spirit with His bountiful supply is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Whenever we exercise our spirit and use our spirit, we can contact the Spirit, and we can experience the God of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We can also experience His all-inclusiveness and limitlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>These are the riches of Christ that we enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Quezon City, Philippines, on March 23, 1989</S>
