In verse 18, Peter means a little rock, a stone; this rock refers to Christ with the living and real knowledge of Him
That tabernacle was not merely a tabernacle made of material things; it signified all the children of Israel as a dwelling place of God
If you are one of those who, like Peter, know Christ as the Son of the living God, you have to realize the building up of the church
From the second chapter of Acts to the last chapter of the New Testament, one thing is dealt with, that is, the church
The church is the house of God , the tabernacle of God , the temple of God , the city of God , and the army of God
Besides these seven items the man, the wife, the house, the tabernacle, the temple, the city, and the army there is the Body
We Christians are familiar with many of the biblical terms, but we probably do not know the right meaning of these terms
The church is a great, universal, corporate vessel, a great container, to contain the very Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
In Revelation we are told that God as the light is in Christ as the lamp, and the church is the lampstand, the lamp bearer, the lamp holder
Throughout all the generations the enemy has been doing his best to spoil, frustrate, damage, and even destroy this church
The church is the bride to the Bridegroom, and without the bride, there is no way and no purpose for the Bridegroom to come back
What is the life for us to practice the church, and what is the proper way for us to practice the church life?
It is hard to find a book telling us that this overcoming life, this spiritual life, the life of Christ, is for the church
Every piece of material has been dealt with and cut into a certain size and shape for the purpose of fitting the building
One day the Lord asked me, 'There are many spiritual persons as beautiful stones, beautiful materials, but where is the building'?
You may be spiritually beautiful, but are you just a beautiful stone or have you been built together with others in the house?
When we realize that we are members of the Body and live as such members, we will know the fullness of Christ's being life to us
If you would bring the matter to the Body and fellowship with the Body, you would be clear about the Lord's guidance
In this universe, with the wheel of God's move, God's activity, there is the need of the church as the rim to match Christ as the hub
When we have Christ as the center and the church as the rim, we will have the wheel of God moving all the time
With the divine move, there is the need of a hub, which is Christ Himself, and there is also the need of a rim, which is the church
Let us begin with verse 25: 'Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her'
The washing of the water in the word is the washing of life, the divine life, the Spirit of life, the life-giving Spirit
For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh
In the Old Testament there are seven items: the man, the wife, the house, the tabernacle, the temple, the city, and the army
In the New Testament four things are dealt with: the Body of Christ, the fullness, the vessel, and the lampstand
Eventually, the seven items in the Old Testament plus the four items in the New Testament equal the New Jerusalem
By going through the whole Bible in this way we can see what is in God's plan, God's economy, God's arrangement, God's administration
If possible, he would hinder, frustrate, and prevent people from coming to the Lord Jesus to receive Him as their Savior
Regardless of how much material and how many precious things there are, as long as the house is not there, it is all right with Satan
Look into the history of Christianity and the situation today; then you will realize what the enemy's intention is
The goal, the intention, of Satan is to spoil, to frustrate, and to hinder the building which God desires to accomplish
John the Baptist recommended the Lord not only as the Lamb of God but also as the Bridegroom who has the bride
Do you know that there is also Ephesians 5:25, which says that Christ 'loved the church and gave Himself up for her'?
You have to learn to know the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ, the corporate vessel, and the corporate lampstand
The Lord comes to give us His life with the intention of regenerating us as the true believers, the true Christians
The enemy Satan comes to bring into existence on the earth a great number of false believers, false Christians
The Roman Catholic Church put a lot of evil things into the truths concerning Christ to make them easy for people to take
In ancient times people worshipped the sun as their god and celebrated December 25 as the birthday of the sun god
After the Roman Empire accepted Christianity, the people were unwilling to drop this celebration on December 25
The Roman Catholic Church simply adopted this practice and told people that since Christ is the sun, December 25 is the birthday of Christ
The Catholic priests admit that Christmas is something false, but they also claim that it helps people to believe in the birth of Christ
He showed us a big rock on the top of that mountain and told us that it was the very spot where the Lord ascended
The Lord came with the intention to sow Himself as the good seed of life, to grow as the true wheat, and to produce the pure meal
Both the treasure, consisting of gold and precious stones, and the pearl are not something created by God but are something transformed
In the first four parables, the life is sown into us, and then in the fifth and sixth parables, there is the transformation of life
If you want to practice the church life, you must have a clear understanding of all these parables concerning the church
Today we are under the transformation of life to become gold, precious stones, and beautiful pearls as materials for God's building
They also show us how the enemy has come in to frustrate the Lord's purpose by damaging, spoiling, and corrupting the Body of Christ
Praise the Lord, eventually, the church will be built up with gold, precious stones, and pearls through the transformation of life
Ultimately, there will be a city built with gold, precious stones, and pearls as the ultimate consummation of the people of God
Corinthians 3 tells us that the church is, on the one hand, God's cultivated land, and on the other hand, God's building
On the other hand, we have to be transformed by this divine life into precious materials for the building up of the church
That means we have not learned from the history of the church and that we are going to repeat the past mistakes
We do not need to be formed or organized, but we need to be transformed into precious materials for the building up of the Body of Christ
The Lord being life to us is for transforming us in our nature metabolically, not for changing or correcting our behavior outwardly
Hinduism Buddhism and Confucianism attempt to change the outward behavior but the Lords being life to us is to transform our inward nature
After he hears a message telling him that pride is damaging, he receives the help and makes a decision to be humble
When we know the way to take Christ as life, day by day we will be filled with Christ, occupied with Christ, and saturated with Christ
The most important thing is for us to realize that Christ today within us is the law of life and the anointing
Is there always a checking of the cross in our daily life in whatever we say, whatever we do, and wherever we go?
The more we talk about the doctrine, the more we will be in darkness about the church life; our inner eyes will be veiled
Brothers and sisters, the church life needs the real growth in life and the transformation by the life of Christ
If you take the cross and are checked by the cross, you will realize that Christ is so living and real within you
Because He is living, you will sense something acting, enlightening, anointing, regulating, ruling, and governing within you
You will have the living Christ, the acting Christ, and the anointing Christ operating within you experientially all the time
Eventually, you will have a transformation in life and not just some correction or adjustment in your behavior
Your whole being with your very nature, element, essence, and substance will be transformed by Christ in a living and real way
If we want to apply Christ as life to our experience in our daily life, we need to know what kind of Christ He is
At the end of the first chapter, we pointed out that in Ezekiel 1 there is a big wheel moving all the time on the earth
If you consider this matter in the light of the whole Scripture, you will realize that this wheel is the move of God in the universe
If we want to practice the church life, the Body life, we need to know the church and where the church is in God's economy
The Jewish people believe the only God, who is the Mighty God, but they do not believe that this Mighty God became a child
Now let us read this portion carefully: 'Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us
Andrew Murray once said that the best prayer is the Christ who dwells in us praying to the Christ who is in heaven
In John 14:8-11 the Lord told us clearly that He and the Father are one and that He is in the Father and the Father is in Him
By this we realize that the very 'He' who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17 is the very 'I' who is the Lord Himself in verse 18
Love, which is in the heart, is the source; grace is the expression of love; and fellowship is the transmission of grace
In our hymnal, we have this line: 'What mystery, the Father, Son, and Spirit, / In person three, in substance all are one'
We must never have the thought that the Son is separate from the Father and that the Son is separate from the Spirit
Some teach that the Holy Spirit is separate from Christ or that the Holy Spirit is a kind of power given to us by Christ
If you want to know Him, you have to know the Spirit, because the Father is in the Son and the Son is the Spirit
It is the greatest mystery in the whole universe that God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit are one, and no human mind can fathom it
The Jews and the Muslims believe God as the Creator, but they do not believe that God has ever been incarnated as a man
All sound proper and genuine Christians believe that this Triune God is a man a Godman a Triune Godman the Triune God mingled with man
All the fullness of the Father is in the Son, all that the Son has is in the Spirit, and all that the Spirit has is in the man
Besides being the Creator and a creature, He passed through human living on this earth for thirty-three and a half years
Although death is an awful thing, the death of Christ is a great blessing, a great deliverance, and a great release to us
The death brought in by Adam was a real trouble to us, but the death accomplished and passed through by Christ is a real deliverance to us
Today in some doses of medicine there is an element that kills the germs in your body and an element that nourishes your body
Light is related to life, the Spirit is related to life, fellowship is related to life, and joy is related to life
The burden in my heart in these days is to help the Lord's children know the proper way to experience Christ as life
Although we have a physical life, a natural life, a human life by birth, God's intention is that we take Christ as our life
Many Christians do not know that there is the need of a change of life, not a change of their behavior or conduct
The natural thought or concept is always to improve, correct, or even repair the natural life just like repairing a poor, old car
The problem is that we are so used to the poor car and have developed some affection for it, so we are not willing to put it aside
They knew how to be good and how not to be evil, but regretfully, they did not know how to take Christ as their life
These two spirits, the divine Spirit and our human spirit, cooperate together, work together, and mingle together as one spirit
If you have this life within you, which is Christ Himself and also the Spirit of life, you have the fellowship of life
The Holy Spirit is the fellowship the transmission transmitting all the riches of Christ all the fullness of the Godhead in Christ into us
You have something within flowing in you; just take care of that flowing, follow that flowing, and go along with that flowing
If you follow and go along with the inner flowing, this means that you are on the right track to experience Christ as life day by day
You try to be good and do good in order to make yourself Christ-like, but you would not go along with the flowing to take Christ as life
A Christian must be a person who is always joyful, but you cannot be joyful unless you go along with the inner flowing
If you sense darkness within you, you should realize that you are not taking Christ as life; you are out of the experience of Christ as life
If you take Christ as life, you must have the shining within you because the life is the light, and Christ Himself is the light of life
If you are one who takes Christ all the time as life, you will not joke, because the life of Christ is not a joking life
It is not according to the regulations of the so-called church or according to doctrinal teachings, but according to the inner regulating
In the Old Testament times, an Israelite could do a lot of good things, and he could even sacrifice himself and all that he had for others
In spite of all the good things that he had done, if he did something against the law, he still had a problem before God
One time a brother was going to do a certain work for the Lord, yet he realized that the inner regulating was demanding him to stop the work
He argued with the Lord, saying, 'Lord, that work is so good and so helpful to others, and it is also profitable for You
Today we maintain a proper relationship with God not by doing good things but by going along with the inner regulating
You should not argue with the Lord that this is something good, something for Him, or something for His people
When you are taking Christ as life, when you are in the light, in the flow, and under the regulating, you have the wonderful, perfect peace
We are in Christ, taking Christ as life, living by Him, and consequently, having the image of Christ expressed in our daily walk
You are in Christ taking Him as life only when you have the inner flowing, shining, and regulating with joy and peace
Through His resurrection the very glory of God which had been concealed, veiled, covered, in His flesh was manifested
It was after the Lord's glorification, that is, after His resurrection, that the Spirit entered into His disciples
After the Lord resurrected, He came in the evening to the disciples and breathed into them, saying, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
Now let us read Acts 16:7: 'And when they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, yet the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them'
Verse 6 says And they passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia
The title the Holy Spirit was used first in connection with the preparation for the Lord's coming through incarnation
The more you have the Spirit moving within you, the more you have the sense that you are not on this earth but in the heavenlies
At other times when the Spirit is moving within you, you will have a sense that you have to be so humble and lowly
If you are properly experiencing the Spirit of Jesus, you will be very human in a pure way according to a high standard
When you have the Spirit moving within you, you will sense there is the strength, the ability, the capacity, to endure sufferings
The greater the depression suppression or even oppression the greater will be the energizing the standing up and the rising up within you
It may be a good book about electricity with many instructions and formulas, but it is not the electricity itself
All the riches, all the reality, all the fullness of what Christ is, what Christ does, and what Christ has, are in this very Spirit
You should not have the thought that since you are so spiritual, you will be delivered from many troublesome matters
He is the reality of Christ's human living, death, resurrection, glorification, ascension, enthronement, kingdom, and authority
Let us pay our full attention to the Spirit who is the reality of every positive thing in the universe and who is now in us
We have previously pointed out that the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ in this one verse are not two Spirits
You may work for God today, preach the gospel, do a lot of things to build up the churches, and even give what you have to help others
He is concerned about only one thing, that is, whether or not you are right with Him according to the inner law of life
According to your actions, your expressions, your doings, and your speaking, you are altogether outside of the Spirit
We may know how to be religious but we do not know adequately how to take Christ as our life that Christ Himself may be lived out through us
We may know the forms and the teachings but do we know the real church life which is Christ Himself lived out through us in a corporate way
If we learn to forget about all the outward things and simply take care of the inner regulating, we will have a wonderful church life
At that time he did not live by Christ, walk in the Spirit, and take Christ as life, strength, and power for his service to God
What the Lord wants is that we take Him as our life and walk in oneness with Him by fellowshipping with Him all day long
Without the cross on the negative side and the living Christ on the positive side, we will have many problems whenever we come together
They do not realize that the Spirit of God today is the all-inclusive and bountiful Spirit of Jesus Christ within us
The cotton ball, having been completely saturated and permeated by the red ink, is transformed into the red ink with the red ink
At the time you received Christ, this wonderful Spirit came into you, into your spirit and heart, the center of your being
In the Body there is no Greek no Jew no Chinese no Japanese no American no Frenchman no Englishman no German no Mexican and no Puerto Rican
If the Chinese brother remains Chinese and the American brother remains American, they are not members of Christ in actuality
They may have a little 'red ink,' a small measure of Christ, in their heart, but they have not yet been saturated by Christ
You need to follow this wonderful Spirit and cooperate with Him, go along with Him, and take Him as everything for yourself
If you do not learn the lesson of remaining on the cross all the time, there will be a lot of trouble in your practice of the church life
Rather, the way to practice the church life is to put everyone and everything on the cross and to have everyone take Christ as life
We have to see that God desires to transform our whole being, that is, to permeate our whole person with Christ
The term inward parts is also mentioned in Psalm 51:6, which says, 'Behold, You delight in truth in the inward parts'
We have the mind to think, the emotion to love, and the will to make decisions; all these parts need to be saturated with Christ
Within our spirit we have the wonderful all-inclusive Spirit, but without we have something awfully troublesome
We have this wonderful One within us, but we still have the old man, the old nature, the flesh, and the soulish life
In the garden of Eden there were three items: the tree of life, the tree of knowledge, and a man standing before the two trees
Also, by being transformed we will realize that the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God is the Body life revealed in Romans 12
Romans 12 shows that by our being transformed, we realize the good will of God, which is to have the Body life
The church life is a life of transformation, a life in which Christ as the Spirit is transforming us all the time
When one who is naturally quick and one who is naturally meticulous come together to serve the Lord, they will have problems with each other
At the time we were saved, the Lord Jesus as the Spirit of life came into us as the one law regulating our inward parts
When the Spirit as the one law permeates our mind, He becomes the law of the mind, regulating our thoughts and our way of thinking
When He permeates our emotion, He becomes the law of the emotion, regulating and ruling over what we like or dislike
He is the law of life within us, living, moving, working, shining, illuminating, regulating, ruling, and governing within us
It is not that formerly we had hatred but now we try to cultivate love because we are taught that hatred is not good
The human way, the religious way, the way of Christianity, is to improve man in his outward conduct and behavior
Because of the maturity and the growth of the inner life, all the troublesome, outward things will spontaneously be dropped
You have the deep inner feeling that what the Lord is, what the Lord has, and what the Lord has done are realized in you
When we are fully transformed and are full of Christ, we will become the living, real, practical members of Christ
The church is not formed by organization and discussion and by electing a chairman, a secretary, and a treasurer
In order to have the church life, we need to go to the cross and take care of Christ, who is the wonderful Spirit within us
You have to be transformed from within to become a living member of the Body; then you will realize the genuine church life
Those taken captive refers to the redeemed saints, who were taken captive by Satan before being saved by Christ's death and resurrection
In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan's captivity and took them to Himself
He pointed out seven things that form the base of our oneness: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God
Just as our blood supplies the members of our body according to their size, grace also is given to each member according to its size
These 'gifts' are not the abilities or capacities for various services, but the gifted persons mentioned in verse 11
Verse 11 says, 'And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers'
The gifts mentioned in Ephesians 4:8 are the gifted persons apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
On the day of Pentecost, the ascended Christ as the wonderful Spirit came down from the heavens to qualify, to equip, him as an apostle
Why does the Lord receive gifts for His Body in man as man on the standing of man with the nature of man and with the qualification of man
If we desire to be famous in the religious world in the Christian world this means that we do not give ground to Christ in His human living
He who suffers the most will have Christ the most and will become the biggest part, the biggest member, of Christ
Brothers and sisters, if you are willing to give more ground to Christ and the cross, you will have Christ with all His accomplishments
Many think that if they are going to serve the Lord, they need to go to a seminary or a Bible institute and study all the things about God
In verse 14 the apostle mentioned the wind of teaching, and in the previous verse he mentioned the oneness of the faith
If you are asked this kind of question, you have to learn to say, 'Brother, anyhow, one day He will come to take us
The faith consists of the seven 'ones' in Ephesians 4: one Lord, one God, one Spirit, one Body, with one faith, one baptism, and one hope
Of all, we want to consider several passages in the Bible that link together the growth in life and the building of the church
These few verses show us mainly two things: one is the growth in life and the other is the building up of a spiritual house
Now let us read 1 Corinthians 3:7-9: 'So then neither is he who plants anything nor he who waters, but God who causes the growth
Verses 16 and 17 go on to say, 'Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
All the believers are the unique temple of God in the universe, which has its expression in many localities on the earth
In brief, this passage shows us that the building up of the Body, the church, depends on the growth of life in Christ
Maybe you have offered yourself already, but you need to offer yourself once again for the purpose of realizing God's eternal goal
Day by day you will experience something living, working, acting, moving, enlightening, regulating, and anointing within you all the time
You will know how to go along with Christ, not an objective Christ in the heavens but a subjective Christ in your spirit and heart
Because you are so saturated and permeated with Christ, all things other than Christ will gradually be dropped by you
You will grow to such an extent that it will become easy for you to be joined together and knit together with all those who love the Lord
Today what we, the Lord's people, need is the living Christ constituted and wrought into us for us to be made parts of Christ
Within you the anointing tells you to pray for a certain thing, yet you do not pray according to the anointing
The building up of the church does not depend on anything else but the growth in life by constantly taking care of the inner anointing
In these three passages we have three terms: the church of God, the churches of Christ, and the churches of the saints
We are also told that the believers were all the more being added to the Lord and that they multiplied greatly
The first thing is that there were seven churches in seven cities, indicating one church for one city, one city with only one church
Now we have to see the proper way, the right way, the best way, for us to come together to practice this wonderful church life
If we want to be in the proper way to practice the church, we must first remember that the church in the whole universe is one
There should not be many different churches in one locality, that is, many different expressions of the Body of Christ in one city
Now in Los Angeles there is something of the apostle Paul and there is something else of the Lord's servant Apollos
You have to realize that as long as you keep the results of your work in your hands, you have a sect, a division, in your hands
According to church history, it is clear that soon after the time of the early apostles, the church deviated from the right track
While one group insisted on not having a piano or organ, the other group insisted on having some kind of instrument for the music
Because of this, the original group was split into two one group without any piano or organ and another group with a musical instrument
In a corner, some knelt down and were crying and weeping, some were dancing, and some were even rolling on the floor
He replied, 'You cannot find any kind of regulation or any kind of form from the Scriptures concerning how we Christians should meet'
Whenever we come together as the church, we do not and should not represent anything but the all-inclusive Christ
Brothers and sisters, we must maintain the proper attitude not to make anything special in the practice of the church
In conclusion, first, we have to realize that the church is one in the universe, so the expression of the church in any place must be one
Perhaps the saints in the church in Los Angeles meet in one way, and the saints in other localities meet in other ways
Wherever they went, they just gathered together to worship the Lord according to the leading of the Holy Spirit within them
Peter and some brothers worked in Jerusalem, in Judea, and Paul and others worked in the different places of the Gentile world
Of course, we realize that Peter had a group of co-workers with him, and Paul had another group of co-workers with him
Paul received the supply from the Lord for his own living, and his co-workers received the supply from the Lord for their own living
Another brother goes there and works in the same way, and a third brother goes there and works in the same way
By the Lord's guidance at the present time, we have to stay here to work together and go on together, but this is not an organization
All the results of the work are in the hands of the local saints meeting together as the local expression of the Lord's Body
These meetings are for the local churches, but they are not local church meetings and are not in the hands of the local churches
According to the pattern set up in the book of Acts, there are three ways for the servants of the Lord to work and minister to the saints
Another way is that you can be in a place where there is a local church, yet at the same time you can rent a place for your ministry
He stayed in Jerusalem for a long time, so he automatically served the Lord in the church in Jerusalem as a local member
The history of the church shows that the more workers were raised up by the Lord, the more divisions were created
We hope that the Lord would grant us not only a gift but also a ministry and that we could be used by the Lord
Otherwise, perhaps after fifteen years there will be as many sects as the number of full-time co-workers we have here today
We brothers who are workers of the Lord need to be clear that if we are not careful we will be the sect creators
Anything of one's ministry that is profitable and helpful, you should receive; whatever is complicating and perplexing, you should reject
We are sent by the Lord to preach Christ either as the Savior to the sinners or as the all-inclusive Christ to the saints
In the first journey of his ministry, wherever Paul went, he preached the gospel, and a number of believers were raised up
If you look into history, there are many real stories indicating that a great many of the Lord's workers did not follow Paul's example
It is easy for us to keep the results of our work in our hands with the good excuse, even the best excuse, that we are protecting the saints
If all the results of my work go to the church here, then the local church here has its own jurisdiction and its own liberty
They knew that the situation was due mostly to the work among us, so some of them had some contact with Brother Watchman Nee
He told them, 'You brothers have sacrificed your country, your family, and a lot of other things to come to China to work for the Lord
Brother Nee told them, 'If your coming and staying here is to build up your CIM Church, this is a big difficulty
If you would be willing to keep your hands off your work and let the believers be the local churches, everything would be all right'
Brother Nee said, 'It is good that you are just a mission, but the mission has to keep its hands off the churches
Also, as a worker, as a servant of the Lord, wherever you go you should not impose anything on the saints and on the local churches
Perhaps in the first two weeks you do not say anything about it, but probably in the third week the 'fox tail' will come out
Some brothers would openly deny that they speak in tongues, but secretly try to push people into speaking in tongues
In church history, many people who were spiritual and loved the Lord never touched the matter of speaking in tongues
The people here never talk about speaking in tongues, but a great number of sinners have been saved through them
All we care for is that people preach Christ as the living Savior and that they love Him live by Him exalt Him express Him and worship Him
Wherever we go, we have to be careful not to make anything a factor to create divisions, troubles, and problems among the saints
If you, as a servant sent out by the Lord, have the intention to convince others to stand with you, that is very shameful
If they keep the days, they keep them to the Lord; if they do not keep the days, they do not keep them to the Lord
If you are asked to work with certain co-workers, you just come together by the Lord's guidance and go on to work together
Our intention is just to help people to know Christ and to be built up and strengthened as a local expression of His Body
The church in Los Angeles may use one cup for the Lord's table, and the church in San Francisco may use many cups
The brothers in one locality may practice immersion, and the brothers in another locality may practice sprinkling
You have to realize that you are not for any ministry, but you are for the church, for the expression of the Body of Christ
Simply stand for the local expression of the church because the local church, not the ministry, is the lampstand for Christ
The ministry is just a means, an instrument, for the Lord to build up the local church for the building up of the Body of Christ
God brought the children of Israel out of Egypt and transferred them into the land of Canaan to worship and serve Him
After we experience Christ as the redeeming Lamb, we enjoy Him day by day as the daily manna and the living rock
Today we enjoy and experience Christ in the different aspects typified by the tabernacle and its different furniture
After the children of Israel entered into Canaan, the manna stopped, and they had to eat the produce of the land
When the children of Israel entered into Canaan, everything they needed for their living was taken from the land
The good land is the all-inclusive type of Christ, that is, Christ as everything to us in an all-inclusive way
There were two ways for the children of Israel to enjoy the produce of the good land the personal way and the corporate way
On the one hand, the children of Israel had the full liberty to enjoy the produce in a personal way at any time and in any place
In these verses which we quoted from Deuteronomy, the phrase the place which Jehovah will choose occurs repeatedly
Since we are in Christ and Christ is our portion, we have to cooperate with God by laboring on Christ, just as the children of Israel did
They, however, had to cooperate with God by working on the land that they might have something produced from the land
It is clear that for us to enjoy Christ personally is one thing, and for us to enjoy Christ with others as a worship to God is another thing
Even when the nation was divided into two, they were not allowed to have two places to worship God; they had only one place
In the thousands of years of Israel's history throughout the generations, there have never been two temples built up for them to worship God
There has always been only one temple because there is only one place for the people to legitimately build the temple
Let us build the same thing with the same pattern, the same style, and the same materials, but in a different place'
Suppose that after the children of Israel entered into the land of Canaan, there was not such a regulation about their worship to God
If they had had the freedom to choose any place for their worship to God, they would have been divided into many groups within a short time
The people of the tribe of Benjamin would have said, 'We don't like to have the people from the tribe of Judah'
Another Hebrew will hear about what we are doing, and he will decide to gather some of his neighbors to do the same thing
Eventually, the people of Israel will be automatically and spontaneously divided, and there will be no end to their divisions
They were regulated strictly by God in their worship to Him; three times a year they had to go to worship God in the place which God chose
When you go to any city, you do not have the freedom to set up any meeting you like for the worship or service of God
When we talk about our personal enjoyment of Christ, everything is so nice because we are absolutely free to enjoy Him wherever we are
You and I, however, need to consider that if we do this, we just bring in more divisions and thereby damage the oneness of God's children
Do we really know the right ground for the children of God to worship God with Christ in the fellowship with one another?
There is only one proper ground for the Lord's children to share Christ with one another in fellowship as a worship to the Father
If you start another meeting according to what you prefer, you simply break the regulation, the rule, of the oneness of the Lord's people
If we give up the ground of the oneness of the Body of Christ, there is no need for us to talk about the church life
If we mean business to practice the church life, we have to make a definite decision concerning the proper ground of oneness
Whenever we come together to worship God in sharing Christ in fellowship with one another, we have to come with something of Christ
We have the proper ground of oneness for the worship of God, and we also have the reality of the riches of Christ for the worship of God
On the one hand, there are divisions upon divisions, and on the other hand, there are empty hands upon empty hands
If we labor on Christ if we experience Him day by day fellowship with Him and pray to Him we will come together with the surplus of Christ
We will also be able to share what we have experienced of Christ with others, and others will also do the same
The real worship today is that when we come together, we come with something of Christ to offer to the Father and to share with others
Without offering Christ to the Father and without sharing Christ with others, our worship to God cannot be well pleasing to Him
The angels prostrate themselves or bow down before God to worship God, but there is no need for us Christians to do that
In our spirit we realize that the proper worship for us Christians today is to bring Christ to offer to God the Father
The two main things concerning the living of God's people in the good land can be simply stated with two words: oneness and Christ
If any division exists, there is no possibility to have a proper worship that is acceptable and well pleasing to God
In the Old Testament we see that throughout the generations the worship rendered by the children of Israel to God was never divided
In the beginning it is wonderful, but perhaps after three weeks, one of them may feel unhappy about the others
He may seek out another three or five to pray with him, and eventually they may decide to meet as another meeting
Regardless of whether you feel happy about others or whether they are spiritual or not, you have to keep the oneness with them
They say that they are really free from the denominational system, but the divisions created by the free groups are endless
Do you think there is a proper reason for you to separate yourself from other Christians meeting in the Lords name on the ground of oneness
When the people of Israel came together to worship God, they just brought the produce of the good land of Canaan to offer to God
The life of Christ on the one hand is the redeeming life to redeem us and on the other hand is the generating life to generate much fruit
The life of Christ is a powerful life that strengthens and energizes us that through us something may be produced
When the early Christians came together, do you believe they came with predestination, with Calvinism, or with Arminianism?
Everyone of us has to experience Christ daily so that whenever we come to the meeting we come with something of Christ
If you keep coming together with your hands empty, with nothing to bring to God as the offerings, nothing will be built up
If we keep coming to meet again and again without something of Christ to contribute to others, there cannot be any building
It is only by the increase of Christ within us for our growth in Christ that the Body of Christ can be built up
Eventually, nobody has anything to share, and the meeting becomes an empty meeting because we do not labor on Christ
We have to realize that there is the need of oneness and second we have to realize that there is the need to have many experiences of Christ
We will also have something of Christ to offer to God to satisfy God as a burnt offering and as a heave offering
Besides this, there is no other way to practice the proper church life and to build up the church as the living expression of Christ
There is the urgent need for us to experience Christ, to minister Christ to others, and to help others to know Christ
These are songs chanted by the children of Israel while they were coming together and going up to Mount Zion to worship God
They did this three times a year at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles
One thing is the oneness as the ground of the church life, and the other is Christ as the reality of the church life
The proper church life is a life of a proper ground, which is the oneness, and of the reality, which is Christ
They appreciated the Lord's presence and the reality, but they did not want to speak about the ground of the church
Whenever we come together, we must have the all-inclusive Christ as the Spirit moving and working through us and among us
If all the attendants of the meeting are in such a condition the Spirit cannot get through and there is no flow no anointing in the meeting
It does not depend merely on a few responsible brothers, but on the whole congregation, on every brother and sister
If you come to the meeting and bring the doctrine of predestination without ministering Christ to others, this is wrong
We should always keep in mind that the church meetings are not for anything else but for the exhibition of Christ
We should not expect that whenever we meet together, the Spirit will come down from the heavens and be poured upon us
Spontaneously, we have something to share with the saints, something to offer to God to satisfy Him, and something to minister to others
We mentioned before that the city and the temple in Jerusalem came into existence through the offerings brought by the children of Israel
If they had had nothing to offer, there would have been no material for the building of the city and the temple
Eventually, something of Christ will be built up together as a real building to be a practical, living expression of Christ
Let us pray much about this matter so that we may realize the life and the way for the practice of the church life
Let us pray that a real building of the church may be realized in our area and even in the entire United States
