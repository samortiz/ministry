   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOAL OF OUR WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to follow the early apostles in making up the lack of Christ s afflictions for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We also need to share in the fellowship of Christ s sufferings for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The goal of our Christian work must be the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, if we care only for such activities as preaching the gospel or teaching the Bible, we may be welcomed and appreciated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if the goal of our preaching and teaching is the building up of the church, we shall be opposed by the religious ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is our goal in preaching the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not simply to save sinners from hell.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is to obtain material for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I was in religion, I heard many messages encouraging us to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We were always asked to consider God s love and sympathy for pitiful sinners, and we were told to have the same feeling toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sometimes preachers would say, Thousands are going to hell every day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Is your heart untouched by this?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some would be inspired by this preaching and with tears respond to the altar call to become ministers of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The term soul winning is very common in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But what is the purpose of soul winning?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Have you ever heard that soul winning is for Body building?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, Paul s goal in preaching the gospel was the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why he was persecuted and why he suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Surely the Jews were the people of God during the time of the Lord Jesus on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Did they not daily offer up sacrifices to God?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Did they not have the temple which was built according to God s revelation and instruction?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The answer to these questions is yes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But one day Jesus came.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He did not care for the temple in the way the Jewish religionists did.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When His disciples were admiring the buildings of the temple, He said, A stone shall by no means be left upon a stone which shall not be thrown down Matt 24:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Who could have dared to say this?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you had been there and had spoken these words, the Jews would have killed you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was the reason they persecuted the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the book of Acts we see that those in the Jewish synagogues accused the Apostle Paul of being a pestilent fellow Acts 24:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Wherever Paul went, he caused trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, he was opposed by the religious people, by the so-called people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we preach the gospel only for the sake of soul winning and rescuing people from hell, we probably shall not suffer very much.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In fact, we may find ourselves welcomed in many places.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, if we take the building of the Body as the goal of gospel preaching, we must be prepared to suffer, even to be opposed and persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Religion does not agree with the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some Christians have even lied about us, classifying us with those in cults and evil, blasphemous movements.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 2 Corinthians 6:8 Paul said that he had experienced both evil report and good report.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If, as you serve the Lord, others give only good reports concerning you, I would question your faithfulness to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you are faithful to the Lord, today s religion will criticize you and spread evil reports about you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Apparently, religion is for God; actually, it is against God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nothing is more subtle and damaging to God s economy than religion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Winning souls does not affect religion; rather, it helps it a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But whenever you talk about the building up of the Body, religion is threatened.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Consider what Paul did when he was Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was a leader in his religion, and he did everything possible to derive benefit from that religion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, on the way to Damascus, he was caught by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After his conversion, whatever he did amounted to a tearing down of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul was bold.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Jesus annulled the Sabbath day, but Paul annulled something even more important to Judaism Paul annulled circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Jews condemned Paul for teaching others to discontinue the practice of circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If Paul had been concerned only with soul winning, he would not have offended people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul did not say, I must keep all the doors open.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, I shouldn t say a word about circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I must not say anything contrary to the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For the sake of soul winning, I must maintain a good relationship with the religious people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If Paul s concern was merely the saving of souls, this could have been his practice.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But since he was for the building up of the Body, there was no way for him to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For the sake of the producing and building up of the Body of Christ, Paul shared in the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Often people have told me that they appreciated my ministry with the exception of my ministry concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some have even pleaded with me not to speak of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One instance of this took place in Texas in 1964.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I had been invited to Dallas to speak to a certain group of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One evening after the meeting, my host said to me, Brother Lee, we appreciate your ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, we wish to make it clear that this audience cannot accept any word about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In your messages, please don t say anything about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I replied, It is important for you to realize that the more I minister on Christ as life, the more the saints will hunger for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>During the last meeting, I had the Lord s leading to speak on the Body from Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I knew that if I did not speak regarding the church, I would not be faithful to the Lord or honest to the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Although I knew my host and others would be offended, I proceeded to speak a strong word about the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Unhappy with my speaking, my host did not even rise up to see us off when we departed early the next morning.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Nevertheless, one brother was greatly helped by that message on the church and, as a result, was encouraged to turn to the way of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For the sake of the Body of Christ, the church, we need to fill up what is lacking of the afflictions of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I can testify that I have been attacked and opposed simply because of my stand for the recovery of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you choose to stand for the church, be prepared for attack, misunderstanding, and rumors.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Many evil things will be spoken concerning you.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The reason for this is that the matter of the church stirs up the authority of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Therefore, those who stand for the church must be prepared for the attack of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Lord Jesus said, On this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This word indicates that the gates of Hades, the power of darkness, will do everything possible to frustrate the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Praise the Lord that He has promised that the gates of Hades will not prevail!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we are faithful and honest with respect to the Lord s ministry and the stewardship of God for the building up of the church, we shall suffer attack, opposition, and evil speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In view of this, we need to look to the Lord that we may be covered by His prevailing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We also need to pray that the Lord may hide us in Himself as our high tower.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>As we hide in the Lord during times of suffering and affliction, we share in the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In this way we fill up what is lacking of the afflictions of Christ for the sake of the church.</S>
