   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE EXPERIENCE OF THE OUTER COURT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapter it has been made clear to us that the tabernacle as God's dwelling place is the center of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With a bird's-eye view we realize that three kinds of cities are in opposition to this tabernacle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In contrast to God's building we have seen Satan's counterfeits.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He intervened firstly to build the city of Enoch, and later attempted to erect the city of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Out of the realm of Babel, the realm of idolatry, God called Abraham, the first forefather of the builders of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When Abraham was separated from the realm of Babel, he was in a position to attain the goal of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was also kept from the sinful city of Sodom, though his nephew Lot drifted into that city.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By living in a tent, Abraham took the position of looking forward to the city which has foundations, the New Jerusalem, which is the very tabernacle God will eventually build up in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Abraham's position of separation from Satan's cities was not a doctrinal standing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was an intensely practical stand for the real, future building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Neither Abraham, his son Isaac, nor his grandson Jacob would build a city or live in a house; they were all satisfied to dwell in tents.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They looked for that city with foundations, the New Jerusalem, God's tabernacle that was to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They expected to move from their tents into that eternal tabernacle, of which their tents were but a very small shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, their descendants, the children of Israel, fell in another direction.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They went to Egypt to satisfy their appetites.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They were enslaved by Pharaoh and forced to build two cities of worldliness, treasure, and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But God mercifully redeemed them through the passover and saved them by the deliverance of the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's redemption and salvation brought these fallen people out of the cities of worldliness and back into a proper position for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By God's deliverance from the bondage of Egypt, the children of Israel were finally free from all of Satan's counterfeits.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God brought them into His presence at Mount Sinai in the wilderness, where they saw His glory and heard His voice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the first record in Scripture of any group of persons abiding so deeply in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Man could enjoy God's presence because he was separated from all the satanic cities.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Israelites were not only freed from bondage, they were also spoiled for anything other than God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They were no longer good for Babel, Sodom, or the treasure cities of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They no longer had anything to do with them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Day by day they dealt with the tabernacle of God; they beheld the glorious cloud and listened to the voice.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In one sense they were jobless they had no stores, factories, or farms.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They had nothing but the glory of God and the voice of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Continually, from morning to evening, they dealt only with God and His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Day and night they talked only about God and His tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was real freedom; a freedom from all Satan's counterfeits of idolatry, sins, and worldliness; a release unto the presence of God and His building.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our first need today is to be separated from idols.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Secondly, we must be preserved from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And thirdly, we must be delivered out of worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we are in the position of being available for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The tabernacle is the first full picture of God's building in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Concerning the tabernacle there are three main parts: the outer court, the holy place, and the holiest of all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever a person enters the tabernacle, he must pass through the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Within the outer court there are two things: the altar and the laver Exo 40:29-30 .</S>
