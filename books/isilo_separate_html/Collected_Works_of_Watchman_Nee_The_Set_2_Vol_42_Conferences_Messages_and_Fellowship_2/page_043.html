But in 1 Samuel 15, when the Israelites killed the Amalekites, they spared Agag the king of the Amalekites. They also spared the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and all that was good; they did not utterly destroy them. In dealing with the Amalekites, the people of God exercised their discernment; they killed some and spared some. God charged them to kill everything, but they wanted to spare the best ones. Among the oxen, sheep, camels, and donkeys of the Amalekites, there may have been a distinction between the strong and the weak or the great and the small. But in God's eyes there was no difference. He ordered all of them to be killed and nothing to be spared. This means that the Amalekites along with all they had were rejected. However, the Israelites seemed to have a better discernment than God. They divided the sheep and oxen of the Amalekites into those which were good and those which were weak. They spared the best of the sheep, oxen, fatlings, lambs, and good things; they killed only the weak and worthless ones.</p><p>Man often thinks that he is smarter than God and that he has more wisdom than God. He thinks that it is even possible for God to be wrong, and that He is not always economical. "Why should I set aside all that I have learned throughout the years, including my eloquence, wisdom, and ability?" Man is concerned with profit, economy, value, and result. But God does not care for these things. There is only one thing that He takes pleasure in&mdash;His own will. Other than His will, God has no pleasure in anything.</p><p>We think that it would have been a waste to kill the oxen, sheep, and Agag. Real submission is always a waste to the fleshly man. Have others ever considered that you have been wasted? Have you ever felt that you wasted yourself? Perhaps you have never felt a sense of waste. This is because you are too full. You will have a sense of waste only after you have set your flesh aside. If your self is fully utilized, and if you are full of natural elements, you will not have a sense of waste. If the oxen and sheep are saved, where is the waste? There is the sense of waste only when all the oxen and sheep have been killed. When the oxen and the sheep are spared and the flesh has not suffered any loss, there is no room to speak of waste. There is the sense of waste only when the flesh is set aside and rejected by God. When the flesh can do something, but is nevertheless stripped of the opportunity of exhibiting itself, there is the sense of waste. When an opportunity for exhibition is present, it is impossible to talk of waste! The day before yesterday we mentioned that a worker must have God's view before he can work for God. If a person's view is earthly and he serves by the flesh, he may be very competent in what he can do, yet the nature of his work is wrong and far from being noble in God's eyes.</p><p>The Israelites spared Agag and the best of the sheep and oxen because they could not find a justification for killing them. They thought that the sheep, oxen, and Agag were useful. It was too much of a waste to kill all of these good things. The problem with the Israelites was that they did not see God's will. They considered these things according to their natural concept and had pity on them. They were not willing to blot the Amalekites and everything they had out of their memory according to God's word.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> </body></html>
