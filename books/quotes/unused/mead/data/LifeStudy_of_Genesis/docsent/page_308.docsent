   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE FIFTY LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>COMMUNION WITH GOD ON THE HUMAN LEVEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to Genesis 18, which contains an intimate record of Abraham's experience with God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we take an overall view of Abraham's experience with God as found in chapter eleven through chapter twenty-four, we shall see that his experience is in four major sections.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Firstly, while he was living in the demonic land of Chaldea, he was called by God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suddenly, much to his surprise, the God of glory appeared to him Acts 7:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That was the beginning of his experience with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Secondly, in chapters twelve through fourteen, Abraham experienced living by faith in God for his existence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He had been called by God for the fulfillment of God's divine purpose, but, as a human being, he still had to have food, protection, and all that was necessary to maintain his existence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was a stranger in a new land, having no property of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, God trained him to exercise the very faith which God had infused into him to trust in God for his existence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Following that, in chapters fifteen through seventeen, the third section, God trained him to know grace for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here Abraham learned not to do anything by himself or on his own but to do everything by and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although God needed him, God did not need anything of him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All that Abraham had, was, and could do was absolutely repudiated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God spent at least fifteen years to train Abraham in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For thirteen years, God disappeared from him because he did not behave himself properly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Abraham was trained, disciplined, and very much in God's favor, but he did not walk in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, he walked in the presence of his wife, the one who proposed that he exercise his flesh to produce a seed for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Abraham expected that Ishmael, his seed, could fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nevertheless, God seemed to say, "No, I don't approve of Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is the issue of your effort, the produce of your doing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I reject him and you must not keep him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Abram, you must learn that nothing that you can do means anything to Me. I only need you, not your ability and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I don't need your Lot, Eliezer, Hagar, or anything of you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You must walk before Me, not doing anything by yourself or on your own.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You must be nourished and supplied by the sufficiency of My divine udder.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then you will be able to produce something not only for Me but also of Me. I only accept and approve what is out of Myself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I shall not produce an Isaac without you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I shall produce an Isaac through you, but not out of you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You are My channel, not the source.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever you consider yourself to be the source, you insult Me. I am the unique, all-sufficient source.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You have known Me as the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now you must know Me as El-Shaddai, as the all-sufficient Mighty One with an udder.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Stay under My udder and be supplied and nourished constantly by My all-sufficiency.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the way to walk before Me."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As Abraham learned to know grace for the fulfillment of God's purpose, God changed him in both name and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God changed Abraham's constitution by having him circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Abram was terminated and Abraham came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the third major section of Abraham's experience of God.</S>
