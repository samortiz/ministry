   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CARING FOR THE NEW BELIEVERS AS OUR OWN CHILDREN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In raising up the new believers as children, it is best if you have your own children.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, if you do not have your own children by birth, you can adopt other children.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Adoption of spiritual children takes place when you do not have children of your own.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When you adopt these children, the best attitude is to consider them as your very own children.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>FOUR STEPS NEEDED TO PRACTICE THE LORD'S NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One brother related his past experience of being successful in preaching the gospel and baptizing a good number of people, but not having remaining fruit due to his own immaturity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Recently, he has gained one of his schoolmates at college, but he is reluctant to stir up his friend to preach the gospel because of his friend's lack of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This brother is also reluctant to have too many spiritual children for fear of not having one who remains.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To bring people to the Lord is relatively easy, but to raise them up is not very easy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In our study over the past few years, we have discovered that we need at least four steps to raise up the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first step is to visit people by knocking on their doors in order to gain them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second, after gaining them by saving and baptizing them, there is the need to nourish and cherish the new ones in home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Third, there is the need of group meetings to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Fourth, we must learn to practice having our meetings in mutuality with the universal prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Walking according to these steps is to practice the Lord's new way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must learn how to visit people as the New Testament priests of the gospel to get them saved Rom 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we should take care of them as our little children to cherish them and nourish them that we may raise them up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This step requires a great deal of time, but we should not expect to have remaining fruit without exercising the proper care in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After bearing fruit, we must take good care of the fruit; otherwise, the fruit will not remain.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once we have fruit, we should try our best to take care of it even though we may still be young and lack the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Often, the children in a family are raised not only by the parents, but also by the elder brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is the same today in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must realize that the older brothers and sisters in the Lord's recovery can help us to raise our spiritual children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>DEALING WITH THE EXPECTATIONS OF PEOPLE REGARDING CHURCH MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christianity has built up something in a wrong way and has given people the wrong impression concerning the meeting life among the Lord's people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of this wrong impression, most people today have a certain expectation whenever they attend a so-called church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When they attend a Christian meeting, they often say that they are "going to church."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the reason that we must have the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the home meetings, the new ones are not distracted by the form of the church, and they can receive the nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>While we are feeding them in their homes, we should gradually let them know what the biblical way of gaining people for the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then, as they are helped to realize the biblical way to meet and to serve, they will not pay that much attention to the form of the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In their homes we nourish and cherish them to raise them up and to educate them so that they can realize what the real things are.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In many cases, when the saints have done a good job of educating the new ones in the home meetings, the new ones are very happy to attend the small group meetings because their taste has been changed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With this change of taste, these new ones no longer have a taste for the formality of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE RICHES OF CHRIST AS THE ATTRACTING ELEMENT IN ALL KINDS OF MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to practice the New Testament way, we must have the riches of Christ as our content.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our meetings must have the riches of Christ as their content; otherwise, the new ones will be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When they compare the attractive facade of Christianity to our way of meeting and practice, they will not be impressed with our way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we must have the rich content in the home meetings, small group meetings, and larger church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All of these meetings must be full of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As people taste these riches, they will lose their taste for the facade of Christianity.</S>
