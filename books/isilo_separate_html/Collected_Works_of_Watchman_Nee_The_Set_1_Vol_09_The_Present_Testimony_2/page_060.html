If we study this portion carefully, we will see that it contains three promises: (1) The law will be imparted into the mind and inscribed on the heart, to the effect that God will become God to us, and we will become God's people. (2) The result of the law within our heart is that we will know God. We will not only know God's will and God's commandment, but know God. (3) Not only will God be propitious to our unrighteousnesses, but will forgive our sins. The items that we listed [in the fifth message on the new covenant] reverses this order. We had cleansing as the first item, knowledge the second, and life and power the third. This was according to our spiritual experience. We are first cleansed and forgiven, then made to enjoy God's life and power, and finally know God.</P><P>The thought in Hebrews 8:10 continues through the end of verse 11. Verse 12 is another beginning. At the beginning of verse 12 there is the word "for." This means that forgiveness has been accomplished. God is propitious to our sins and forgives our unrighteousness, then He puts the law into us and inscribes it upon our hearts, with the result being that we know God. This knowledge of God will fill the earth as the water, and no one will teach his neighbor or brothers to know God. Therefore, the order of our spiritual experience is: (1) cleansing, (2) life and power, and (3) knowledge.</P><P>In Philippians 3, Paul told us his experience. First he received God's righteousness --he was justified apart from his own righteousness. Then he considered all things as loss in order that he might gain Christ and know the Lord. The knowledge of God came after forgiveness. Forgiveness is once for all, but the knowledge of God goes deeper and deeper. Day by day we know God more and more. However, I will not speak about knowledge today but about the second aspect of our spiritual experience, which is life and power. We will not cover life and power completely; we will only speak on the part about life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW TO HAVE LIFE AND POWER</H2><P>Hebrews 8:7 says, "For if that first covenant had been faultless, no place would have been sought for a second." In God's eyes, the first covenant had faults and was weak; it did not have the power and way for us to keep God's commandments. As far as the first covenant is concerned, Paul also said in the book of Romans that the law was holy but was not able to do many things (7:12). As far as the power of the first covenant is concerned, it also had faults. This is why there is the need for the second covenant.</P><P>Why did the first covenant have faults? Let us read 8:8-9, "For finding fault with them He says, `Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah, not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.'" The Lord said that when He took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, they did not continue in the Lord's covenant. This means that they should have continued to be faithful. However, they were not able to be faithful day after day. Even though they made up their minds to follow the Lord, they could not faithfully follow Him every day. Even though they were revived once, they could not be revived every day. They might have promised to read the Bible every day, but they could not. This was the problem with the old covenant.</P><P>Exodus 19:5 says, "Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine." This is God's word to the Israelites. Verse 8 says, "And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do." Immediately they said that they would keep the words. Let us read again Exodus 24:8, "And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the Lord hath made with you concerning all these words." Everything recorded from chapter nineteen to 24:8 are the words of God's covenant. Moses said that this was the blood of the covenant, and the people answered saying, "All the words which the Lord hath said will we do" (24:3). Brothers and sisters, in Exodus 19 through 24, God's law says that we cannot have other gods and worship idols. Please remember that the contents of Exodus 19 through 24 are the whole covenant. But by chapter thirty-two, before Moses delivered the tablets of the covenant from Mount Sinai, the Israelites had made a golden calf and started to worship the idol. The tablets of the covenant were still up in the mountain, and the Israelites had already betrayed the covenant! They were worshipping the golden calf at the bottom of the mountain. This shows that they could not keep God's law. This is the shortage of the old covenant.</P><P>Therefore, the old covenant means that we can temporarily make up our minds and be excited; we can shout to God that we will do His will. But even if we keep the law for a few days, this will not last. We can find out the teachings in the Bible, but cannot keep its commandments. We can behold God's glory on Mount Sinai, but sin at the bottom of the mountain. We can rise up early to read the Bible and pray, but we forget about God in the office, hospital, school, or at home. This means that even though there may be good beginnings, there are no good endings. This is the old covenant. However, God has given us the new covenant which is within us. Second Corinthians 3 says that the law was previously written on tablets of stone; now it is written on the tablet of our heart. Today the new covenant is the best gospel. The new covenant is entirely different from the old covenant. In the new covenant, the One who gives the command is God, and the One who is responsible to keep the command is also God. In the old covenant, the One who gave the commandment and the law was God, but we were the ones who kept them. In the new covenant, the One who made the law is God, and the One who keeps the law is also God.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> </body></html>
