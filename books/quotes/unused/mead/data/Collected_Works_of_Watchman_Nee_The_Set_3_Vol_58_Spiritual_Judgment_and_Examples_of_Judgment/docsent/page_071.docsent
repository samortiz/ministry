   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 51 Date:September 2, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER B. H.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a non-Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I was young I went with an elderly brother to a church to listen to sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The more I listened, the more I became interested.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eventually, I believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I did not know that much about the gospel, yet I knew that something came into me that would never go away.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1934 I came to the local church and sensed an atmosphere that was full of joy and mutual love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I thought that if this is how it was on earth, it would be even greater when we are in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I attended a meeting by Brother Witness Lee and learned more about my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I began to have a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I loved to read books published by the Shanghai Gospel Book Room, and I built up for myself a firm foundation in the truth this way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later, I began to doubt my own work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I could not see any worth to my work, and it became a burden to me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although I spent much time searching through the Bible and reference books, it was hard for me to find material for my Sunday morning sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I felt dry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I saw that others had the utterance but I did not, I felt that God had abandoned me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Based on these experiences, it is God's mercy that I could attend this training.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From your speaking I can tell that you are a clever, logical, and articulate person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, you have to realize that in the spiritual pathway, we do not receive a word for the sake of meeting the need of the audience, but for meeting our own need.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A man can receive general help from God, or he can receive specific help from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A doctor can prescribe medicine to you that will add to your nutrition and energy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is ordinary help.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, if you have a tumor on your finger, you need a specific cure.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is something special.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From your testimony I can see that you have received some general help, but little specific help.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A man can have a great deal of spiritual appreciation, but little spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If he only appreciates, he has probably only touched something in his understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You must be enlightened by God to deal with specific issues.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If God's light is strong enough, it will kill your problems.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only after your problems have been identified in a specific way, will you find a specific treatment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Romans 7 Paul did not refer to all ten commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, he pointed to the tenth commandment only, the commandment against covetousness, and he dealt with it specifically.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jacob's naughtiness and Peter's boldness were their specific problems.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Superficially you do not seem to have any problem before God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the spiritual pathway, however, we have to ask the Lord to show us our specific problems, and we have to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everyone has a peculiar problem, and it is not enough for a person to just continue in his appreciation while never allowing his problems to be touched.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once God works on us and exposes our basic problem, we will be open to His dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These dealings will bring in deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many have said that they appreciate this and that by coming to Kuling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But none of that will do us any good if our particular problem is not identified and dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suppose a man is a robber.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can say that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose another person is a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can say that he is a sinner as well.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But these descriptions are too general.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a man is a robber, we should say that he is a robber.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a man is a liar, we should say that he is a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This points out what kind of person he is in a specific way; it does not just describe him as a sinner in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have to name specific sins before I can deal with them in a specific way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>While your mind is not very strong, it is still quite strong.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You are not that earnest in your seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is more of an element of appreciation in you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once your need becomes more apparent, you will need specific dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>General dealings are like window-shopping; your stomach is still hungry after such a trip.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You still have to go and find food.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since you feel dry, you should prostrate yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once you realize that you are incapable, you should set your eyes on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You should not stop at the point of merely appreciating spiritual things with your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You cannot fill your hunger by drawing bread on a piece of paper; you still have to eat real bread.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Man will gain something only when God's word is formed in him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you do not have specific problems to deal with, you will not have specific supplies.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No matter how beautiful a painter paints an apple, it will never prompt you to eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is wrong to come to the mountain just to appreciate what you hear.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If this is the case, you are only a spectator; you are a third party.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need a strong desire to find God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Once we have such light, we will be delivered from our problems; we will be brought into His grace, and everything will be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once you experience specific dealings, your pathway will become straight, and the Lord will use you.</S>
