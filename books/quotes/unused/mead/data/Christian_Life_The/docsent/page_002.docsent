   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE DEFINITION Scripture Reading: Phil 1:20b-21a; John 14:10-20, 6a; 3:36; Heb 7:16b; 2 Tim 1:10b; Col 3:4a; John 11:25; Rom 8:2a, 9b; Gal 2:20; Rom 12:5; Eph 1:23; 3:19; Matt 5:13-16; Eph 3:8-11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this series of messages, we want to fellowship concerning the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Such a topic may seem common to us, but I must honestly tell you that to my impression it is very hard to find one believer that knows what the Christian life is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible is a very complicated book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some fundamentalists say that the Bible does not contradict itself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the more we study the Bible, the more contradictions we find in it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to realize that in the whole universe if there is no contradiction, nothing can remain, nothing can exist.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All things exist by contradiction.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do we always laugh?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We laugh and we also weep.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Someone may say, "I am a happy person."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But this is not completely true because this person is also full of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To know the Christian life is not an easy thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you believe that the apostle Paul was always victorious?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today among us we have a saying "Revived every morning; overcoming every day."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you believe you can be revived every morning and overcoming every day?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If within a day you do not have any defeat to match your victory, you actually do not have a good day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Can anyone among us say that we had one day in our entire life which was full of victory with no defeat?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today we are in the "kitchen" of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>While a meal is being cooked in a kitchen, everything is a mess there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today our experience is in the kitchen, not on the dining table.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In our Christian life, when everything is cooked and put on the dining table, that will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In our present experience, however, the New Jerusalem seems mostly like a "bird in the air."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have spoken much about the New Jerusalem, but this New Jerusalem "bird" has never been fully in my hand even though it is always in my expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Christian life is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I cannot tell you that I know what the Christian life is in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some may ask, "Since you don't know, why do you speak about it?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am still endeavoring to know.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, I say that I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the other hand, I can say that I do know what the Christian life is to some extent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to see what the Christian life is from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, I hope that what I have seen and experienced in the Christian life can be a help to you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this message, I want to cover two main points.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first point is that the Christian life is the life in which the believers of Christ live Christ and magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The second point is that the Christian life is the life in which the Christians live Christ and magnify Him corporately in their locality as a local church to be a local expression of Christ as a part of the universal Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Christian life is and should always be in these two aspects the individual aspect and the corporate aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to live an individual Christian life for a corporate Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The corporate Christian life is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This refers specifically to the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we do not have a local church life, we cannot experience anything of the universal Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now I would like to point out why I said that the Bible is contradicting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is because the truths of the Bible are not written and presented in an orderly sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead these truths are here and there, scattered, throughout the Bible cf.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Isa 28:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible is like a great jigsaw puzzle with many small parts, but all of these parts are scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible does not arrange the truths in a certain sequence, putting the parts together to present a full and perfect picture.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to gather the many parts of a truth to see it in a complete way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In your study you may have picked up ten parts, but none of these parts are connected to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every part stands by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You need to spend time to collect more parts of the puzzle and put them together gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have been studying the Bible for over sixty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have found that it is very difficult to put the parts of the Bible together.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not just hold one part and think that this is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to be patient and go on to pick up more and more parts until we have a complete view.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the past thirty years, there were times when I thought that I had put all the parts of the Bible together.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I thought I had a completed jigsaw puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But eventually there was still something more.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Through the help of others' understanding of the Bible, I have put many parts of the Bible together, but I cannot tell you that I have finished.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I have spoken much throughout the years concerning the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is because the parts in the Bible concerning the Divine Trinity are scattered from the first chapter of Genesis to the last chapter of the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this series of messages, we want to put together the parts of the Word concerning the Christian life so that we can see what the Christian life is.</S>
