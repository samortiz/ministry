   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4 To Be the Pledge</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>within Them of the Divine Inheritance</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit received by the believers is also the pledge within them of the divine inheritance Eph 1:14; 2 Cor 1:22; 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The pledge of the Spirit, which is actually the Spirit Himself as the pledge, is a guarantee that God is our inheritance or heritage belonging to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, the Spirit within us is the pledge of God being our portion in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word for pledge in Ephesians 1:14 and in 2 Corinthians 1:22 and 5:5 also means foretaste, guarantee, a part payment that guarantees the full payment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because God is our inheritance, the Holy Spirit is the pledge of this inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God gives the Spirit to us not only as a pledge of our inheritance but also a foretaste of what we shall inherit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the day we were saved, God began to pledge Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The pledge of the Spirit involves movement within us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that the Spirit is not only a pledge guaranteeing our inheritance but that He is now pledging within us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This pledging continues day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, the pledging of the Spirit, which is given to us for our enjoyment and encouragement involves the dispensing of the Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the pledging of the Spirit is actually the dispensing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This dispensing makes us a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>5 To Dwell in Them</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit has come into the believers to dwell in them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Romans 8:9 Paul speaks of the Spirit of God dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For the Spirit to dwell in us means that He makes His home in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit of God in Romans 8:9 is not the same as the Spirit of God in Genesis 1:2, where He was brooding upon the face of the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit of God in Romans 8:9 now dwells in the tripartite man and is now the Spirit of Christ, who possesses humanity as well as divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Genesis 1 the Spirit of God had not yet gone through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit of God in Romans 8, however, is the Spirit of life who in Christ has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All these elements have been compounded with the Spirit of God, who has come into us to dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through the indwelling of the Spirit we have been made a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the Spirit indwells us, He is not idle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, He is active to impart life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to Romans 8, the Spirit gives life to our spirit v. 10 , our soul, represented by the mind v. 6 , and our body v. 11 . Therefore, the indwelling Spirit is imparting the divine life into our tripartite being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, the purpose of the Spirit s indwelling is to dispense life, which is God Himself, into the three parts of our being, into our spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Another verse that refers to the Spirit dwelling in the believers is 1 Corinthians 6:19: Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because the Holy Spirit is in our spirit Rom 8:16 and our spirit is within our body, our body has become a temple, a dwelling place, of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As the Spirit indwells us, He dispenses the Triune God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>6 To Be the Reality of Christ within Them</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit has come into the believers to be the reality of Christ within them John 14:17, 20; 15:26; 16:12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed Triune God, is fully realized as the Spirit who dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The indwelling Spirit is the reality, the very realization, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In John 14:17; 15:26; and 16:13 the Spirit is called the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The reason the Spirit is called the Spirit of reality is that whatever the Father in the Son is and whatever the Son is, is realized in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, reality had not yet entered man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The reality was present, for Christ Himself is reality John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But this reality was only among the disciples; it had not yet come into them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, the Lord told them that it was expedient for them that He go away John 16:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The purpose of His going was for Him to have a change in form, a change from the form of the flesh to the form of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As soon as this change had been accomplished, His reality would become the reality of the Spirit, and the Spirit would become the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then this Spirit of reality would come to abide in the disciples to be in them the reality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because the Spirit of reality has come into us, the reality of Christ now abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Spirit of reality is the full realization of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After the Spirit has brought us to salvation and has regenerated us, He will become in us the very reality of the Son Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whatever the Son is, has, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained will all be fully wrought into us through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the Spirit becomes the realization of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is the reality of all that the Son is and has.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>John 16:13 says, When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Spirit of reality does not guide the believers into the doctrine concerning Christ; the Spirit guides them into reality.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This reality is nothing less than Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, the Spirit of reality will bring us into all the reality of Christ.</S>
