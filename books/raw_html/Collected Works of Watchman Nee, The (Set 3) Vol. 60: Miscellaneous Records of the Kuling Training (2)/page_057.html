<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">DEALING WITH TEMPER</h1><h2 class="head1">SALVATION EFFECTING A CHANGE<br />IN DISPOSITION AND CONDUCT</h2><p>After a man is saved, he should experience a definite change in his disposition as well as in his conduct. Salvation changes us in life, in disposition, and in conduct. The most important change in a believer's disposition and conduct is a change in his temper. The greatest problem many people have before they are saved is their temper. If a man has been a Christian for many years and yet has not experienced any change in his temper, he will lose his testimony before the Gentiles and the church. Under normal circumstances, a man should experience a change in his temper as soon as he is saved.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROPER MARKS OF A BELIEVER</h2><p>At the time a person is saved, we should tell him that he should have a few marks or signs. The first mark is loving one another. Loving one another is the Lord's charge to His disciples (John 13:34). It should be the strongest mark of a believer. The second mark is meekness. The Lord says that the meek are blessed (Matt. 5:5). He entered Jerusalem on a little colt. This is a mark of His meekness (21:5) and a pattern for us to follow. The third mark is self denial. The Lord said, "If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself" (16:24). A Christian should not try to build up himself. Instead, he should deny himself. The fourth mark is patience. A believer has to learn patience under all kinds of circumstances (1 Cor. 13:7). The fifth mark is to rejoice always. A saved person should not be short in his joy under any circumstance. "Rejoice in the Lord always" (Phil. 4:4). This is a commandment of the Lord. The sixth mark is peace. We have the peace of God, and this peace guards our hearts and thoughts (Phil. 4:7). The seventh mark is lowliness. The Lord says, "I am meek and lowly in heart" (Matt. 11:29). We have to take His yoke and learn from Him. Christ does not remain lofty on high but stoops in lowliness. A worker should tell new believers these seven things and remind them that these are normal expressions of a Christian. Then he should point out that anger and temper are incompatible with the disposition of a Christian.</p><h2 class="head1">TEMPER BEING INCOMPATIBLE<br />WITH A CHRISTIAN CHARACTER</h2><p>Temper is incompatible with the proper Christian expression. It is incompatible with a believer's very disposition. We should realize that where love flourishes, temper cannot remain. The Lord charges us to love everyone, no matter who he is, even if he is our enemy (Matt. 5:44). If we love a person, we will not be angry with him. We cannot love a person and be angry with him at the same time. Temper is contrary to the very nature of love. Our whole Christian life should consist of nothing but love for others; we should not be angry at anyone.</p><p>The Lord also charges us to be meek. He is meek in Himself. The Bible says He is meek and lowly in heart. He renders comfort to others all the time. If a man is meek and his meekness is lived out in his attitude and walk, he will not lose his temper. A man with a temper is a coarse person. Temper is the coarsest of all human sentiments, while love is the finest of all sentiments. Love is expressed in meekness. If a man is meek before God, he surely will not have a quick temper.</p><p>Third, we have to show the new believers that the Lord wants us to deny ourselves. Specifically, denying ourselves means rejecting the self. Denying one's self is not speaking for one's right and learning to endure in all things. No matter how others treat us, we will not be angry. God's children should reject their self and be free from the self. When they are free from the self, temper will be gone. Temper is a mark of those who refuse to deny the self.</p><p>Fourth, we have to show the new ones that one strong Christian characteristic is patience. Patience endures all things. Temper is contrary to patience. It is true that some people treat us unreasonably, but we should always love, and love is not easily provoked. The Lord has arranged various circumstances around us. We should be patient and should not lose our temper easily.</p><p>Fifth, a Christian should rejoice. God has given us a life that rejoices always. It is possible for us to be without a temper. Temper has no place in a Christian's life. Our Christian life should be filled with joy from the very start. This is because the life we have is a joyful life.</p><p>Sixth, a Christian not only has joy but peace as well. Like joy, peace is a part of the life a Christian possesses. Nothing can disturb the peace we have within us. We have to pray that the Lord would guard our hearts and thoughts from any attack. This will keep us from losing our temper.</p><p>Seventh, a Christian is lowly. A child of God should be the most lowly person in the world. Temper and lowliness are incompatible with one another. An angry man is never a lowly man; there is no humility at all within him. God's children should follow the lowly Lord and take the lowly path. They should learn to not lose their temper in anything. We have to say to new ones, "Matthew 5:22 says that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment. Anger and temper are incompatible with a believer's walk." The greatest and most frequent problem a believer faces is his temper. Temper is linked to anger. A new believer should deal with this matter at the beginning of his Christian life. This is the most basic dealing he should experience. Some may ask, "Why is it so crucial to deal with our temper? Why must we solve this problem?" We must deal with this clearly before we can help others. We must settle this issue thoroughly before we can present a straight pathway to the new believers.</p>
