   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When new believers learn to pray, they should pray in two stages.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the first stage they should pray until they receive a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They should pray until they receive God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All prayers begin by asking God for something.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such prayers can continue for a period of time, sometimes lasting for three to five years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One needs to keep asking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some prayers are answered quickly, while other prayers continue to go unanswered for years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the period of time when one needs to continue to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The second stage begins from the time one receives a promise and extends to the time the promise is realized.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It begins from the time one receives God's word and extends to the time His word is fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This stage is not for praying, but for praising.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the first stage one prays, but in the second stage one praises.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the first stage he prays until he receives a word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the second stage he praises the Lord continuously until the word is fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the secret to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some people only know two points about prayer: First, they pray on their knees for what they do not have, and second, they have it; God has given it to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose I ask for a watch from the Lord, and after a few days the Lord gives me a watch.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are only two events: being without something and having something.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some do not realize that there is another event in between these two the event of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose I pray for a watch and one day say, "Thank God, He has already heard my prayer."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although my hands are still empty, I am clear within that I already have the watch.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Indeed, after a few days the watch arrives.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot be concerned with just two events: not having and then having.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must be concerned with a third event an additional event between not having and having, in which God gives us a promise, and then we believe and rejoice over it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps we have to wait three days before we actually receive the watch.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But in our spirit, we received it three days ago already.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A Christian should experience this kind of receiving in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a person never experiences this kind of receiving in the spirit, he does not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We hope that new believers will know what faith is, and we hope that they will learn to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Perhaps, you have prayed continually for three or five days, a month, or even a year, and still your hands are empty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But deep in your heart, you have a little assurance that the matter will eventually be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At that time you should begin to praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You should continue praising Him until you have received the thing in your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Simply put, the first stage is to pray from nothing to having faith, and the second stage is to praise from having faith to actually receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why should we divide our prayers into these two stages?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose a person prays from having nothing to having faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If he continues to pray, he may lose his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once a person has acquired faith, he should begin praising.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If he continues to pray, he may pray away his faith and not receive anything in the end. "You will have it" is an actual having in the hands, while "you have received it" is a having in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the faith is already there, but the things have not materialized, one has to remind God with praise; he should not try to remind Him with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If God has said that He will give us something, what else do we need to say?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we have the inward assurance that "we have received it," what more do we need to pray for?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many Christians have the experience that as soon as their prayer strikes faith, they can no longer continue to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They can only say, "Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I praise You."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They have to keep their faith and praise, "Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You have heard my prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I praise You because You answered my prayer a month ago."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you do this, you will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Unfortunately, some people do not have the knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God has already promised them something, yet they still pray.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the end their prayer drives away their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The word in Mark 11:24 is too precious.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the whole New Testament, we cannot find another passage that explains faith as clearly as this one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a person sees this, he will know what prayer really is, and prayer will be a powerful tool in his hands.</S>
