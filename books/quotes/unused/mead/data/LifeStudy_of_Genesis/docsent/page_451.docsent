   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a Making a Thorough Clearance 1 Putting Away</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Their Foreign Gods Idols</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Firstly, Jacob told his household and all that were with him to put away the foreign gods that were among them 35:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Jacob and his household were fleeing from Laban, Rachel took the household images 31:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Prior to chapter thirty-five, Jacob never charged Rachel to put them away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But after God had told him to go up to Bethel, everyone had to abandon their foreign gods, their idols.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a shadow, a type, that is developed throughout the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to both the Old Testament and the New Testament, the first thing we must eliminate for the sake of God's dwelling place is our idols.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many may claim that they have never had anything to do with idols.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Materially speaking, it may be true to say that you have no idols.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But we must know, spiritually speaking, what an idol is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>An idol is anything that replaces God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Your education, your ambition, your position, your name, your desire, and your intention may replace God in your life and thus become idols.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you view the matter in this light, then you will have to admit that you have had many foreign gods.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If your relative or friend replaces God in your life, then he is an idol to you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our parents, spouses, and children may all become our idols.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you know why people worship idols?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Undoubtedly, they worship them because of Satan's seduction.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But there is a reason on the human side why people do this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>People worship idols for the sake of gaining long life and happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Satan threatens people, telling them that if they do not worship idols, they will not have long life and happiness, but that if they worship idols, then they will have long life and happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Happiness includes many things: money, position, ambition, fame, a name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many have idols due to their desire to be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why do you have something that replaces God?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Simply because that thing may make you happy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Unlike Rachel, Jacob had no literal idols, but in his supplanting he had some idols.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In fact, his supplanting was an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why did Jacob supplant others?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because of his desire for happiness and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today, man has lost God and, pursuing foreign gods, seeks his happiness in idols.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But God is our long life and happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When God spoke to Jacob regarding Bethel, Jacob received the revelation concerning his life and realized that his life on earth was not for his own happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His life was for Bethel, for God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, Bethel became his goal, the destination of his human life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Formerly, his goal was his own happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now, his goal and destination were replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No longer was his goal something for himself but something absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Shechem, Jacob had everything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But due to the trouble caused by his sons, he lost his safety and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that juncture, God seemed to say, "Jacob, go up to My house.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here in Shechem you don't have safety and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Safety and peace are at Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You must go up there."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, Bethel became Jacob's goal and destination.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Jacob realized that the goal of God's house was holy; it was not a common thing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No one could enter into the house of God with idols, pollution, and old, filthy garments.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, Jacob charged his household and everyone with him to put away all the foreign gods.</S>
