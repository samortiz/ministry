   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEANING OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to know the genuine meaning of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yes, the cross is a matter of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Crucifixion was the method used by the Roman government to execute criminals.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No doubt, to the criminal, the cross was a suffering because he did not choose to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the contrary, he was forced to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The crucifixion of the Lord Jesus, however, was altogether different.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was not forced to suffer crucifixion; He chose it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was His own preference.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was not compelled to go to the cross; He was willing to do so because His cross was God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, His crucifixion was for the fulfillment of God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord was willing to take up the cross and be crucified for the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, Christ was not forced to die like a criminal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, He was willing to be crucified that through death His life might be released to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No doubt, the cross was a great suffering to the Lord, but He had no thought of reducing the suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, when He was offered the wine mingled with gall, He rejected it Matt 27:34; Mark 15:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord did not care for the suffering; He cared for the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When He was on the cross, the Lord suffered greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But that suffering was not forced upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He took it willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Matthew 26:39 the Lord prayed to the Father, Not as I will, but as You will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that same time He also prayed, Your will be done.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord was willing to take up the cross, to go to the cross, and to remain on the cross until God s will had been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the significance of the first mention of the cross in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>NOT CRIMINALS,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>BUT WILLING BEARERS OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to this principle of first mention, all the other crosses must be the same as the first cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that we are not forced to bear the cross, but that we willingly take it up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Notice, the Lord Jesus did not say, Let him deny himself and be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No, He said, Let him take up his cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are not to be crucified, but we are to pick up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, certain brothers have said, I have been crucified by my dear wife many times.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such brothers are not cross-bearers; they are criminals executed by their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you say that your children are crucifying you, you are not a cross-bearer, but an executed criminal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today most Christians are criminals being executed; very few are cross-bearers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let me ask you this question: Are you a criminal or a cross-bearer?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all need to say, Praise the Lord, I am not a criminal.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am one who is willing to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have not been crucified by others; rather, I take up the cross and bear it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>OUR TURN TO TAKE UP THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have seen that the Lord did not suffer as a criminal, but that He willingly took up His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was a willing and happy cross-bearer for the purpose of fulfilling God s will to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Through His death, His divine life was released to us, making us the members of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today the problem is not with Him; it is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although we have the divine life within us and have become members of the church, the problem is whether or not we shall be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all have the divine life in us for the church, but we have not yet been built together.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Throughout the centuries, Christians have had the divine life in them for the church, but there has not been the building.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead, there has been dissension, division, and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Where is the building?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ has done His best.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now it is our turn to take up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE CROSS BEING GOD S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To take up the cross simply means to take up God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The cross is actually God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Anything that is not God s will is not a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The cross experienced by Christ definitely was God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If God s will had been that Christ should not die on the cross, yet Christ still went there and died, He would have been acting contrary to God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In such a case, that would not have been a cross, but the execution of a criminal.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, the cross through which the Lord Jesus passed was not a criminal execution, but the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>According to God s ordination in the Bible, there is one husband for one wife.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Consider how Abraham obtained a wife for his son Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Before Abraham s servant brought Rebekah to Isaac, Isaac had never seen her.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But when she was brought to him, he took her as his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This indicates that marriage, by whatever means it takes place, is sovereignly under the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once you have married a certain one, she is your wife, and there is nothing more you can do about it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>According to God s ordination, there must be no divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One husband for one wife is God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you divorce your wife, you divorce yourself from God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But if you accept her, you accept God s will, because she represents God s will and even is His will.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God s will is always a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, if you suffer your wife as a cross, you are a criminal.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But if you willingly take her by the Lord s grace, you are a cross-bearer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You willingly take up the cross; you are not executed.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You recognize that your wife is God s will and ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Suppose a brother s wife causes him to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Since no divorce is permitted, he has two choices regarding her.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He may either suffer with her like a criminal being executed on the cross, or he may take her as God s will and as his lot and portion.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He may say, God has allotted her to me.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It was not I that married her; it was God who gave her to me.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is God s will, God s ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Hallelujah, I am willing and happy to bear the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I am not a criminal, but a happy cross-bearer.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we do this, the presence of the Lord will be with us, and we shall enjoy the riches of life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Furthermore, we shall have a strong testimony of being built into one.</S>
