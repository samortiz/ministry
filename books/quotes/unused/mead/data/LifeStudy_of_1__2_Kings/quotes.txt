[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: 1 Kings 1:1; 2:10-11; 2 Kings 25:1-7
[2]  With this message we begin the life-study of 1 and 2 Kings.
[3]  1 David committed the greatest gross sin against God, and God forgave him after his repentance and gave him a son as God's beloved, although God still disciplined him for the sake of His righteousness.
[4]  2 Solomon insulted God with many idols through his many pagan wives and concubines, and because of this God cut away ten tribes from his kingdom but still left one tribe with him for David to have a lamp in Jerusalem.
[5]  3 The children of Israel forsook God and went after idols, so God dispersed them into all the nations yet, in His eternal love, would bring them back to their fathers' land in the last days.
[6]  4 God's being so gracious to David, Solomon, and Israel was to keep the lineage of Christ's genealogy that Christ might come into humanity and to keep a people to possess the land of Emmanuel that Christ may come to establish His kingdom on the earth.
[7]  OF THE BOOKS OF HISTORY IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
[8]  The eternal economy of God is altogether concerning Christ and for Christ, mainly in the person of Christ and the kingdom of Christ.
[9]  Regarding the kingdom of Christ, the Old Testament history keeps a line on the kingdom of God for Christ to establish His divine kingdom on the earth.
[10]  The main striking point of these historical books concerning Israel is to show us in detail, in the way of typology, how to experience Christ as the good land given to us by God as our portion Col 1:12 .
[11]  The entire Bible, although written by more than forty authors in sixty-six books, unveils to us only the unique economy of God, which He made for the accomplishment of His heart's desire, that is, to have Himself expressed and enlarged through Christ in His Divine Trinity.
[12]  The central thought of the books of Kings is God's governmental dealing, in God's economy, with the devastation and ruin of the divine kingship on the earth by the kings and the tragic issue of the just dealing of God, that is, the loss of the holy land, which was the base of God's kingdom on the earth, and the capture of the holy people who maintained the lineage of Christ's genealogy.
[13]  God desired to have a people for the bringing of Christ into humanity, and God needed a land for Christ to set up God's kingdom.
[14]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS MESSAGE TWO THE OLD AGE AND DECEASE OF DAVID Scripture Reading: 1 Kings 1:1 2:11
[15]  to Be the Successor to the Throne of David
[16]  He was buried in the city of David v. 10 , after reigning over Israel for forty years: seven years in Hebron over Judah and thirty-three years in Jerusalem over the entire people of Israel v. 11 .
[17]  My burden in these messages on 1 and 2 Kings is concerned not with the historical facts but with the intrinsic revelation in these books.
[18]  Solomon's second name, Jedediah, given by God, means "beloved of Jehovah" v. 25 . On the one hand, God is righteous in His governmental dealing.
[19]  One very positive point concerning Solomon was his seeking for God 1 Kings 3:2-4 .
[20]  However, because he took many pagan women and worshipped their idols and built places for the people to worship idols, he lost his God-given wisdom and his God-given understanding.
[21]  Solomon's dominion extended from the great river Euphrates to the land of the Philistines at the seashore of the Mediterranean and to the border of Egypt as the fulfillment of the promise of God to His elect Israel Gen 15:18; Exo 23:31; Deut 11:24 , and all the nations brought tribute to him 1 Kings 4:21, 24 .
[22]  Paul's wisdom was a spiritual wisdom concerning Christ making His home in our hearts Eph 3:17 , our walking and having our being according to the spirit Rom 8:4 , and the two spirits the divine Spirit and the human spirit v. 16 . Today, God the Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit, the compound Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, the indwelling Spirit, the anointing Spirit, the revealing Spirit, and the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God.
[23]  First Kings 5:1-18 tells us that Solomon received aid from a Gentile king, Hiram of Tyre, through an alliance according to a treaty.
[24]  In chapters six through eight we have an account of Solomon's building the temple of God with his own palaces.
[25]  The building of the temple, the house of Jehovah, began in the four hundred eightieth year after Israel came out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign, 1012 B.C. 6:1 . How patient our God is! He brought a people out of Egypt with the intention to build up His kingdom and His home, the temple.
[26]  Solomon built the temple according to his father King David's charge 1 Chron 22:6-11 .
[27]  The side chambers signify the unsearchable riches of Christ becoming His extension as His fullness 1 Kings 6:5c .
[28]  As believers in Christ, we are the temple and we are also the side chambers, the extension of Christ as His fullness.
[29]  The bronze sea with ten bronze lavers signifies the convicting, judging, and renewing Spirit of God washing away, based on the death of Christ, all the negative things from those participating in the dwelling of God on earth 7:23-40; John 16:8; Titus 3:5 .
[30]  Chapter eight is concerned with the dedication of the temple.
[31]  Solomon supplicated God to hear from His dwelling place in the heavens the prayers offered to Him by His people toward this dwelling place of His on the earth that Solomon had prepared for God.
[32]  Concerning the seeking Gentile stranger, Solomon prayed that God would act according to all that the foreigner would call upon Him for vv.
[33]  He prayed that in the captivity of His people Jehovah would hear His people's prayer and maintain their cause when they would return to Him with all their heart and with all their soul and pray to Him toward the land that He had given to their fathers, toward the city that He had chosen, and toward the house that Solomon had built for His name, that they could be separated from all the peoples of the earth to be His inheritance.
[34]  In the last of the seven conditions concerning God's listening to the prayers of His elect, three things are stressed v. 48 : the holy land, typifying Christ as God's allotted portion to the believers Col 1:12 ; the holy city, signifying the kingdom of God in Christ; and the holy temple, signifying God's house, the church, on the earth.
[35]  Solomon's blessing to the people was that God would not forsake them nor abandon them but rather maintain the cause of His people as each day required, and that the people would have a perfect heart with Jehovah, to walk in His statutes and keep His commandments as on that day 1 Kings 8:54-61 .
[36]  In verse 59 Solomon said, "Let these words of mine, with which I made supplication to Jehovah, be near to Jehovah our God day and night to maintain the cause of His servant and the cause of His people Israel as each day requires."
[37]  Throughout the centuries God has maintained the cause of His people Israel, exercising His justice for them.
[38]  Solomon typifies Christ Matt 12:42 in speaking God's word of wisdom 13:35 and in building the church as the temple of God 16:18; 1 Cor 3:16; Eph 2:21-22 , and the temple typifies Christ Matt 12:6 and the church as the unique building of God in the universe.
[39]  Since Solomon and the temple built by him play the strongest roles in the history of Israel and occupy a wide realm in such a history, they are the strong evidence that the history of Israel concerns very much the fulfillment of God's eternal economy in the Old Testament in the way of typology.
[40]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS MESSAGE SEVEN THE REIGN OF SOLOMON 5 Scripture Reading: 1 Kings 9 11
[41]  We, the believers in Christ, are the greatest people in the universe.
[42]  We have received God into us, and He is continuously working Himself into our constitution to make us God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead .
[43]  D. Solomon under the Light of the Spiritual Life
[44]  Under the light of the spiritual life, we can see that Solomon was a wise man but not a spiritual one; a man of capability, not one of life; a man whose wisdom was a gift, not a measure of life.
[45]  The careers he accomplished were evidences of his capacity from the God-given gift of wisdom, not manifestations of the ability of the maturity of life.
[46]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS MESSAGE EIGHT THE DIVISION OF THE KINGDOM OF ISRAEL
[47]  In 12:25-33 and 13:33-34 we have an account of the apostasy of Jeroboam.
[48]  Instead of giving good news, Ahijah the prophet, in a prophecy from God, told the wife of Jeroboam that because of Jeroboam's evils in his apostasy, God would destroy Jeroboam and his whole family as a man sweeps dung until it is all gone vv.
[49]  I. THE REIGN OF ABIJAM OVER JUDAH A. Born of the Daughter of Abishalom
[50]  Abijam was born of the daughter of Abishalom 15:2b .
[51]  The prophet Jehu came to rebuke Baasha and told him that God would sweep up after Baasha and after his house, making his house like the house of Jeroboam because of his walking in the way of Jeroboam, causing God's people to sin and provoking God to anger, and because he had killed all the house of Jeroboam 16:1-7 .
[52]  Elah was crowned to reign over Israel in the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah and reigned for two years vv.
[53]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS MESSAGE TEN THE REIGN OF AHAB OVER ISRAEL 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Kings 17 19 D. God's Dealing with Ahab through
[54]  As we continue to consider the reign of Ahab over Israel, we come now to the matter of God's dealing with Ahab through Elijah the prophet 17:1 19:9a .
[55]  We have the Triune God wrought into us, constituting Himself into us every day, indwelling us, and building His home in us.
[56]  When all the people saw what happened, they fell on their faces and said, "Jehovah He is God!
[57]  Elijah answered, saying, "I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, thrown down Your altars, and slain Your prophets with the sword; and I alone am left, and they seek to take my life" v. 10 .
[58]  Elijah had told God that the children of Israel had forsaken His covenant, thrown down His altars, and slain His prophets and that he alone was left v. 14 . God told Elijah that He had left Himself seven thousand faithful ones in Israel who had not bowed down their knees to Baal and had not kissed him with their mouth v. 18 . These faithful ones, the overcomers, were still standing on God's side.
[59]  THE RAPTURE OF ELIJAH Scripture Reading: 1 Kings 22:40b, 51-53; 2 Kings 1:1 2:18
[60]  Elijah charged Elisha to ask him what he should do for him before he was taken from him, and Elisha asked, "Let a double portion of your spirit be upon me" 2 Kings 2:9 .
[61]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS MESSAGE THIRTEEN ELISHA'S MINISTRY OF GRACE Scripture Reading: 2 Kings 2:19-25; 4:1 6:7
[62]  In this message we will consider what is revealed in 2 Kings concerning Elisha's ministry of grace.
[63]  First, Elisha healed the bad water of Jericho 2 Kings 2:19-22 .
[64]  When the men of the city told Elisha that the water was bad and that the land was barren, he went out to the source of the water and threw salt there, saying, "Thus says Jehovah, I have healed this water; there will not be any more death or barrenness from there" v. 21 . Jericho signifies Satan, and with Satan everything is death, including the water.
[65]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE REIGN OF JEHORAM OVER ISRAEL Scripture Reading: 2 Kings 1:17b; 3:1-27; 6:8 8:15
[66]  In 6:8-23 we are told that Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, waged war against Israel.
[67]  Second Kings 6:24 7:20 tells us that Ben-hadad king of Syria besieged Samaria.
[68]  Elisha told the woman whose son he had restored to life to go with her household and dwell wherever she could, because a seven-year famine ordered by God was to come.
[69]  In his ministry Elisha the prophet, as the man of God, behaved himself as God's representative, as the acting God, on the earth.
[70]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE REIGNS OF JEHORAM AND AHAZIAH OVER JUDAH
[71]  Jehu was used by God as an executioner to carry out His judgment on the whole house of Ahab.
[72]  The young man did as Elisha had said, anointing Jehu and declaring that God had made him king over the people of Jehovah, over Israel.
[73]  Then the son of the prophets told Jehu that he had been charged by God to strike the house of Ahab his master for God's avenging of the blood of His servants the prophets and the blood of all His servants at the hand of Jezebel.
[74]  Jehu also slaughtered the seventy sons of Ahab 2 Kings 10:1-11 .
[75]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS MESSAGE SIXTEEN THE REIGNS OF ATHALIAH AND JOASH OVER JUDAH Scripture Reading: 2 Kings 11 12
[76]  Although Joash was a good king, he was murdered by his servants.
[77]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS MESSAGE SEVENTEEN THE REIGNS OF JEHOAHAZ, JEHOASH,
[78]  THE REIGN OF JEHOASH JOASH OVER ISRAEL A. Reigning in Samaria for Sixteen Years
[79]  Amaziah, the son of Joash king of Judah, began to reign in the second year of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz king of Israel, at the age of twenty-five and reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem 14:1-2 .
[80]  Jeroboam did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah and did not turn away from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, by which he caused Israel to sin v. 24 .
[81]  This all-inclusive Jesus Christ is the life-giving Spirit who regenerated us, who is God within us, and who is not only dwelling in us and living in us but also building Himself into our being to form a house for Himself within us.
[82]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE REIGNS OF AZARIAH, JOTHAM,
[83]  V. THE REIGN OF PEKAHIAH OVER ISRAEL A. Reigning for Two Years
[84]  Pekahiah began to reign over Israel in Samaria from the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah and reigned for two years v. 23 .
[85]  At the age of twenty, Ahaz began to reign in Jerusalem in the seventeenth year of Pekah king of Israel and reigned for sixteen years 16:1-2a .
[86]  Ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David.
[87]  Although God gave up Israel, He kept the principle, found in both the Old Testament and the New Testament, of gaining some overcomers so that He could still have a lineage of people on earth to maintain His economy and carry it out.
[88]  God redeemed man for the purpose of making the redeemed man God in life and in nature so that God can have a consummation of His economy in the Body of Christ as the enlargement of Christ.
[89]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS MESSAGE NINETEEN THE REIGN OF HOSHEA OVER ISRAEL Scripture Reading: 2 Kings 17
[90]  In this message we will first consider the reign of Hoshea over Judah and then give a word related to the fulfillment of God's economy as typified in the books of history in the Old Testament.
[91]  In His love God sent the prophets to the people of Israel to testify to them against their evils, sins, and wickednesses and to help them come back to God, but they would not return.
[92]  The best reign of all the kings was that of Hezekiah over Judah.
[93]  In this message we will first consider the reign of Hezekiah and then speak further concerning the intrinsic connection between the books of history in the Old Testament and their fulfillment in the New Testament.
[94]  In the fourth year of Hezekiah, the seventh year of Hoshea king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it v. 9 . At the end of three years, in the sixth year of Hezekiah and the ninth year of Hoshea, Shalmaneser took Samaria and carried Israel away captive vv.
[95]  Through Isaiah the prophet Jehovah told Hezekiah that He would heal him, add to his life fifteen years, and deliver him and Jerusalem from the king of Assyria for His own sake and for the sake of David His servant vv.
[96]  Through His incarnation Christ became the God-man, a person both divine and human, having His divinity mingled with His humanity.
[97]  Christ, the unique God-man, is the model, the prototype, used by God to have a "mass production" of millions of God-men.
[98]  As God-men we should have a God-man's living, continually rejecting our natural man and living by the very God who is life in us.
[99]  In his fourteen Epistles Paul did a wonderful job of unveiling how Christ as the ascended One in the heavens ministers Himself as the life-giving Spirit, as the pneumatic Christ, as the embodiment of the processed Triune God in His resurrection, to transform us from clay into something precious, making us the same as He, not in the Godhead but in His essence, in His element, in His nature, in His life, and in His appearance.
[100]  AMON, AND JOSIAH OVER JUDAH Scripture Reading: 2 Kings 21:1 23:30
[101]  In this message we will first consider the reigns of Manasseh, Amon, and Josiah over Judah and then say a word concerning the essence of the typology in the books of history in the Old Testament.
[102]  When Josiah heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes and commanded the high priest and his servants to inquire of Jehovah for him, for the people, and for all of Judah concerning the words of the law vv.
[103]  When Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates, Josiah frustrated Pharaoh Neco's expedition and was killed by him v. 29 .
[104]  Rather, God wanted to build David a house v. 11b . Through a prophecy in typology, God told David that eventually the house that He would build for him would have a seed and that this seed would be God's Son.
[105]  Verses 22 through 26 are a record of the governing of Gedaliah.
[106]  Nebuchadnezzar appointed Gedaliah over the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had left in the land of Judah v. 22 . When all the captains of the forces heard about this, they came to Gedaliah, and Gedaliah swore to them and said to them, "Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans; dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you" vv.
[107]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE A CONCLUDING WORD OF THE LIFE-STUDY
[108]  In Saul's behavior, his performed humility in pretense, his self-interest seeking, and his ambition for the kingship not only for himself but also for his descendants were all exposed and showed that he was not building the kingdom of God but a monarchy for himself and his descendants.
[109]  Solomon, on the one hand, was very good in expressing the wisdom of God and in building the temple for God, but, on the other hand, he was evil in the indulgence of lust, taking seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, most of whom were heathen, and in idolatry in building high places with temples of idol worship for many heathen idols.
[110]  Actually, however, they still were self-seeking and self-glorying, somewhat considering the kingdom of God among them something of their monarchies, not knowing God according to the way ordained by God, not denying themselves, their natural man, to live a life and carry out a career absolutely by the Spirit of God.
[111]  Twenty-nine kings, among whom Jeroboam, Ahab, and Manasseh were the worst, were totally evil in such matters as rebelling, murdering, usurping the throne, and shedding the blood of the innocent for the building of their monarchies without any care for the kingdom of God on the earth.
[112]  The way in which these forty-one kings had their being, how they behaved, lived, moved, and acted in their daily living, activities, and careers, paints a full picture of how the elect of God could partake of the God-promised and God-given good land and enjoy all its rights that they could become God's kingdom on the earth usurped by His enemy Satan.
[113]  This typifies and signifies how we can partake of the all- inclusive Christ as the portion ordained by God for us and enjoy all the rights in Christ assigned to us by God that we, the people chosen and redeemed by God, can become God's kingdom in Christ and with Christ on the earth usurped by the evil one, God's enemy Satan.
[114]  Their evils offended their God to such an extent that He would not turn His anger from them but cast them off, first into the hands of the Assyrians and then into the hands of the Babylonians, who destroyed and burned the holy temple and the holy city, carried away into captivity the holy people to a pagan land of idol worship, and desolated the holy land for seventy years.
[115]  The tragic result of such a pitiful history of the kings among God's chosen and blessed elect should be a serious warning to us, God's elect in the New Testament age, and should indicate to us how sober we should be to take heed to the particular points of each case.
[116]  Just to be one who is according to God's heart, like David, and just to be partly right and good in the eyes of God, like some honest Christians, do not qualify us to partake of Christ in full and to enjoy all the rights in Him that we may become adequately the church as the Body of Christ and as the kingdom of God and of Christ.
[117]  Conformity to Christ's death by the power of His resurrection is required of us, the New Testament overcomers, that we may die to ourselves, our natural man, and live to God in resurrection.
[118]  A life of living Christ, magnifying Christ, and moving and acting with Christ by the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, doing everything in and according to the Spirit, is indispensable for us, God's New Testament seekers, to be winners in the racecourse of the divine life that we may fully enjoy Christ as the God-given good land in the church age and be gloriously rewarded to partake of Christ, in the fullest sense, in the kingdom age.
[119]  Every king should have had a thorough realization that they should be kings who did not rule a nation for their own interest and prosperity but ruled for God's eternal economy that God could have a nation on the earth to keep the land of Immanuel Isa 8:8 for Christ's reign and a people for a lineage of the genealogy to bring Christ to the earth.
[120]  The deputy authority of God on the earth is composed of God's oracle, the speaking of God, and God's authority, the ruling of God.
