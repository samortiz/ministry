   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OPPOSITION AND REBELLION STIRRED UP BY THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As soon as I mentioned the new way in Taipei, it stirred up an opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The opposition actually began in 1984 but was not manifested until 1987.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From 1984, several people began to spread the rumor that Brother Lee's ministry was off and that they would not follow any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It seems that those few brothers volunteered themselves to be the heroes in the Lord's recovery with the intention to restore the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, they began to contact others to join them in overthrowing Brother Lee's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They maintained the attitude that they were the heroes to oppose Brother Lee and restore the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, it was not an accidental rebellion or a temporary dissension; rather, there was a long period of fermentation and an overall plan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the beginning when I faced that situation, I remained quiet before the Lord, because I was very clear within.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I have been walking on this way with Brother Nee, and in these scores of years Brother Nee had laid the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From 1922 to 1952 the Lord's recovery in mainland China was under the leadership of Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later, when the move of the Lord's recovery was restricted on the mainland, I was brought overseas by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Spontaneously, the leadership came upon my shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everything that I did was absolutely in the same steps with Brother Nee, not only in the light of the truth but also in the aspect of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I never departed from whatever Brother Nee did.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Gradually, the Lord showed us something deeper and higher.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1987 when that kind of situation was exposed, I did not say anything because within me I was very clear that no one could change the Lord's recovery which is built upon truth as well as life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I was very clear concerning what Brother Nee spoke; I also knew very well what I spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1951 I began to release a publication in Chinese entitled The Ministry of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From that time until 1987 I released a great number of messages.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At least three thousand messages were given in America and printed into books.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When those people began to oppose me, I checked with myself concerning whether I had erred in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, however, I could not find any mistake in my leadership of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The opposers alleged, first, that since 1984 I had changed and departed from the way led by Brother Nee, and second, that I exercised control.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Concerning the second point, they strongly condemned me and said some very ugly things about me, such as Brother Lee being a king and a pope.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I heard all these things, I did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I realized that every step concerning the foundation laid by this recovery on the earth and the building in these sixty to seventy years was accurate; no one can touch or change anything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE LORD'S VINDICATION</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It has been seven years since the turmoil of 1987.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe that in these seven years the Lord has clearly vindicated His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was evidenced in the recent conference in Hong Kong, which was altogether the Lord's own doing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The highest attendance in the conference was over 880, including 263 who were from abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That conference in Hong Kong was altogether the Lord's vindication; it was something carried out by the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who could have nearly nine hundred people attending the meetings within such a period of time under such a difficult situation?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was the Lord's vindication.</S>
