   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT OUR BEING OBEDIENT TO THE BIBLICAL TEACHINGS, BUT THE LORD LIVING HIMSELF OUT THROUGH US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do not think that it is easy for us to be obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To obey the teachings of the Bible is seemingly an easy task, but to obey the One within us is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A person can be zealous according to the Bible by himself, but he absolutely cannot obey the Lord by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What the Lord wants is not that we would love others after reading about it in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, what the Lord wants is to live out His love and to love others through us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>BOTH LOVE AND HATRED BEING THE EXPRESSION OF OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Perhaps we have had an experience similar to the following.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After reading from the Bible about loving others, it so happens that someone we like is right beside us, so we begin to display our love for that one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Apparently we really love him, and many people may even publicize the fact that we love others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, this love is one hundred percent out of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When it is we who love others, the Holy Spirit will give us a feeling that this love is out of our natural man and is actually ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just as our hatred is the expression of ourselves, so our love is also the expression of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether I am wearing a Western suit or a Chinese long gown, I am still myself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even if I put on the best garment in the whole world, I am still myself and have not changed a bit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the same way, I may wear a "garment" of love or a "garment" of hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although outwardly there is a difference, I am still the same.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am the one who hates, and I am also the one who loves I am the one doing both.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE EXPERIENCE OF THE CROSS TERMINATING OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The experience of the cross is not merely a suffering but a termination.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whether we love or hate people, we need to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Unless we are put to an end, Christ will not be able to come out of us; He will have no way out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we love others by ourselves, people will be able to touch our love and ourselves, but they will not be able to touch Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is because the cross has not worked in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In other words, the cross has not yet put an end to our love; the cross has not yet put us to death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>DENYING THE SELF, TAKING UP THE CROSS, AND FOLLOWING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus said that if anyone wants to follow Him, he must take up his cross Matt 16:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Prior to this word, the Lord mentioned that man must deny himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to see that the cross is an adversary of the self and that what the cross deals with is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord spoke such a word with a certain background.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That day the Lord had solemnly spoken to the disciples that He would go to Jerusalem to suffer death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, "God be merciful to You, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This shall by no means happen to You!"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But the Lord turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What Peter expressed was not hatred but sympathy, love, and concern.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet this love was of the self, and Satan is hidden in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May God open our eyes one day to show us that Satan is hidden in and mingled with our self.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Not only is our hatred Satan, but even our love for others has Satan hidden in it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sadly, hardly anyone today knows this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even Peter did not realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do you think he hated the Lord or loved the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Of course, he loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No one would ever say that Peter hated the Lord, yet the Lord called him "Satan."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many times our thoughts of loving the Lord, of doing good, and of pleasing God all come out of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As the Lord said, "You are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever we are in ourselves, setting our mind on the things of men, we are Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If someone were to tell us that we were full of Satan, we surely would be upset.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, this is a portrait of man, not a statement to be used for scolding people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we really knew our self, we would see that what is in you and me, the descendants of Adam, is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The bad element is Satan, and the good element also is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, there is good as well as evil.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Everything that comes out of us is unclean because it has been mingled with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord Jesus said, "If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me" v. 24 . If a person is willing to give up himself and deny himself, Satan will have no ground in him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Satan is mingled with man's intention, but the cross, which is on God's side, does away with man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Everything that is of man comes out of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we hate God by our self, we definitely cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, even if we love God by our self, we still cannot please God because Satan is in our self.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hence, in a way God does not pay attention to what is being expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Rather, God pays attentions to whose expression it is Christ's or ours.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If it is ours, then we need not only repentance but also the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The cross requires those of us who follow the Lord to forsake ourself and deny ourself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we want to follow Christ, we need to deny ourself, take up the cross, and follow Him.</S>
