   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the Dispensation of Grace</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Teachings of demons...abstaining from foods, which God has created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who believe and have full knowledge of the truth 1 Tim 4:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the dispensation of grace we can eat meat and vegetables.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Abstaining from meat is a teaching of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Everything created by God is good and can be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who believe and have full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we partake with thanksgiving, nothing need be refused, because it is sanctified through the Word of God and intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sanctified in 1 Timothy 4:5 means that something is separated to be holy to God for His use.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everything that God originally created lost its position of belonging to God and being for His use because of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Word of God, however, tells us that these things have been recovered in God s eyes through the redemption of Christ and that He has given them to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since we believe and understand the Word of God, we can receive these things with thanksgiving and petitions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, they are sanctified through the Word of God by our thanksgiving and intercession, and they have been brought back to God for His use.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He uses them to feed those who belong to Him and who live to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since we are sanctified and live to God, these things are also sanctified and brought back to God for His use.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, bread in the bakery is common.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we take it and give thanks for it according to God s Word, it is sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This sanctification is not natural; it occurs through the Word of God and intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through the fall of man, the rightful position of things for God s use was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through the redemption of Christ, however, they can be sanctified and recovered for God s use through the Word, which speaks of this recovery and of His promises to give us these things, and intercession, which is petition based on the Word that we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These things can be sanctified for God s use because of Christ s redemption and recovery of them, because of God s promises related to them, and because of our prayer and intercession for them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, we can eat and enjoy them unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The ordinances in Leviticus 11 being abolished in the New Testament Acts 10:9-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The ordinances in Leviticus 11 are related to the law of the old covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They were for the Israelites under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They were abolished in the dispensation of grace of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christians under grace today do not need to keep these ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even though spiritually, according to law, we do not need to keep those ordinances, physically, for the sake of health, there is some benefit in limiting our eating of foods that are considered unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Abstain from...what is strangled and blood Acts 15:20, see also v. 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the dispensation of grace we still cannot eat blood.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since the blood of a strangled animal has not flowed out, it remains within the animal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Consequently, it is forbidden.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God does not allow us to eat blood in the dispensation of grace so that we can manifest to the universe that only the blood of the Lord Jesus can take away our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Spiritually speaking, we should eat only His blood, which is symbolized by not eating things which are strangled and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to become those who have fellowship with demons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You cannot drink the Lord s cup and the demons cup; you cannot partake of the Lord s table and of the demons table 1 Cor 10:20-21; see also Acts 15:20, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Idol sacrifices touch demons, and as those who belong to God, we should not eat food sacrificed to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot drink the Lord s cup and eat the Lord s table, breaking bread and fellowshipping with the Lord, and at the same time drink the demons cup and eat the demons table, eating idol sacrifices and fellowshipping with demons.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not that which enters into the mouth that defiles the man Matt 15:11; see also Rom 14:2, 14, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In God s eyes nothing is unclean; therefore, what enters a person s mouth cannot defile him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everything can be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If some are weak in the faith and think that something is unclean, it is unclean to them, and they should not eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If one has doubts and eats without faith, he will be condemned because everything not done in faith is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, if we are strong and have faith, we can eat anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nothing will be unclean to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Food will not commend us to God; neither if we do not eat are we lacking, nor if we eat do we abound 1 Cor 8:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the dispensation of grace food is not a requirement for being commended to God; therefore, eating or not eating a certain item is not important.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit Rom 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not be too particular in our eating, because the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those who live in the kingdom of God today should not emphasize the matter of eating but should emphasize the matter of spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whether you eat or drink...do all to the glory of God 1 Cor 10:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although there is no law today concerning what we can eat, our eating and drinking should be to the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our eating and drinking should glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If it does not glorify God, our eating and drinking can cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do not break down the work of God for the sake of food.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All things indeed are clean, but it is evil for a man to eat while stumbling others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is good not to eat meat nor drink wine nor to do anything by which your brother stumbles Rom 14:20-21, see also v. 15; 1 Cor 8:9-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our eating and drinking must not wound others or cause God s work to be hindered or destroyed.</S>
