<h2 class="head1">USING THE HOMES FOR THE INCREASE<br />
AND SPREAD OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We have spent much time since October of 1984 to study the matter of the increase and spread of the church. Until that time the increase and spread in the churches was somewhat disappointing. There had been very little increase or spread for years. In 1962, Taipei had twenty-two thousand members. By 1984 the number had decreased by fifty percent. Many new ones had been saved, but the total number had not increased. At the same time we had about a hundred churches in the United States and Canada, yet the number of the saints was very small, not over ten thousand.</p>
<p>Since that time, I began to consider the proper way to have the increase and spread, and the Lord began to show me the way of the homes. In the New Testament, when the Lord Jesus ministered for three and a half years, He used people&rsquo;s homes (Matt. 10:11-13; 26:6). Even the more, on the day of Pentecost three thousand were added and right away began to meet in their homes, from home to home (Acts 2:46). This was a new beginning; the meetings in the Old Testament were not carried out in this way (Deut. 12:5-14). According to history, the Christian groups which have met in the homes were profited.</p>
<p>Because of this, throughout all these months my burden has not been on anything besides the homes. I consider the homes all day. I love the homes. I do not think that in the Lord&rsquo;s new move the big meetings are much needed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOING OUT TO GAIN HOMES</h2>
<p>Every brother or sister who would go out to knock on doors for the gospel could establish a home meeting every four weeks. You do not need to be a job-dropping full-timer to do this. Take care of your job, but every week spend two to three hours going out. The best time is on Saturday or the Lord&rsquo;s day. If you went out for two or three hours every week for four weeks, you could gain one home. If not within four weeks, then at least within eight weeks you could get a home. This means you will get six homes a year. There are about one hundred twenty thousand saints in all the churches around the globe. If only one fourth of these saints would mean business to go out to knock on doors, we would gain one hundred eighty thousand homes after one year. This will increase us not merely by a small percentage, but by one-and-a-half-fold. Quite possibly each home will bring in two persons; even if each home only has one person, we will still gain one hundred eighty thousand persons. Yearly we will have a one-and-a-half-fold increase. Even if we only gain half this number, we will still have ninety thousand. Everybody will be very happy to see this happen. This would be a seventy-five percent increase.</p>
<p>If within the coming year you would have a seventy-five percent increase in your locality, would you not be happy? Will you be one of the four going out? Even to speak of a one-and-a-half-fold increase is very conservative. We have a wonderful way to nourish people but if nobody would do it, then what is the use of the way? It all depends upon our doing. We are coordinating and cooperating with the Lord. The Lord is ready. He has been ready for years, simply waiting for our response. The increase is in the homes, but you must go to knock on doors.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER WAY TO HAVE THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>To have the home meetings is not to ask others to come to our meetings. Do not ask people to come to you. To have the home meetings is to take the meeting to them. First, take the gospel to them, and then take the meetings to them. Our former practice of inviting people to our love feasts has not worked. We should rather have &ldquo;food-to-go.&rdquo; We should not invite people to our feast; we should bring our food to their home and put it on their dining table. In the Gospels, God did not merely take the way of inviting. Rather, God came in the flesh to this earth to seek and to save the lost (Luke 19:10). He went to the home of Zaccheus (19:1-10), and in John 4:1-42 He went to the Samaritan woman. He sent and He gave. Now we must learn of the Lord. Do not remain so high. Lower yourselves down (Phil. 2:5-7). Come down to reach people where they are (Luke 10:33-34). From now on we would not invite people to come to our meeting. We will send the meeting to their homes as food-to-go!</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
