Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life?" Why take the trouble to gain the whole world, that is, the wealth and glory of the world, yet lose the glory of the kingdom of the heavens? What can we give in exchange for our soul? In the Lord's eyes those who save their soul today are the most foolish.</P><P>Verse 27:"For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings." From here on the Lord called Himself mainly the "Son of Man," signifying sufferings. "Then" proves that what is mentioned earlier in this passage will take place in the future. "Doings" refers to saving the self today or losing the self for the Lord. The doings are the basis for the reward and have nothing to do with the eternal life. (We should take note that this portion is concerned with our doings, not with our faith.) Therefore, at the Lord's coming, this is what will happen:</P><div align="center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/CWvol15ch16.gif" width="400" height="100" border="0" alt="The Lord's Coming"></div><P>Here we see two entirely opposite outcomes. Therefore, in order to find out whether or not we will receive a reward in the future, we do not need to wait until we come before the judgment seat. Rather, we just need to examine our doings. If we lose our soul today, we can be assured that we will gain it in the future; if we gain our soul today, we can also be assured that we will lose it in the future.</P><P>Verse 28:"Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom." This verse is connected to chapter seventeen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MISCELLANEOUS NOTES ON CHAPTER 16</H2><P>(1) God is most patient. When the world says that He is not there, He is not anxious but continues to hide Himself.</P><P>(2) Today's preachers are like actors; they act and advertise, only with the intention of making a performance.</P><P>(3) Foolishness and unbelief are twins.</P><P>(4) We are all "missionaries" here, because we are not citizens of this earth.</P><P>(5) The Lord's trial before the high priest was indeed very unjust; he asked the Lord if He was the Christ. When the Lord answered yes, he should have gone on to investigate if such a claim was true or not before making a verdict. But when the high priest heard the Lord's answer, he rent his garments and proclaimed that He had blasphemed, and they pronounced a death sentence upon Him.</P><P>(6) When we read the Bible, we should not seek merely for spiritual knowledge. The most important thing is that we are God's servants and should know His requirements.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_061.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_063.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 15: Study on Matthew &nbsp; pg 62</div><br></body></html>
