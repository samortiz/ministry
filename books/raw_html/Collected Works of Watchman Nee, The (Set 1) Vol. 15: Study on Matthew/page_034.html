<H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER ELEVEN</H1><P>Verse 1:"And when Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He departed from there to teach and to preach in their cities." This verse should be placed at the end of chapter ten. What the Lord charged His disciples to do was what He Himself did.</P><P>Verse 2:"Now when John heard in the prison of the works of the Christ, he sent word through his disciples." Verses 2-3 show us John's failure. It seems that John should not have asked in this way because he clearly knew from the beginning what kind of person the Lord was. Then why did John ask in this way? It is obvious from the Lord's reply that John was stumbled. The reason he was stumbled was that he was imprisoned by Herod for many days, and it seemed that the Lord did not care for him. Because the Lord did not work out a way for him, he became weakened in his suffering.</P><P>Some say that John's being stumbled was due to his doubting the Lord. However, if a person has known a certain matter, even though he may forget it, he certainly will not return to the former state of ignorance. John did not doubt the Lord because He had already known the Lord. He was stumbled because he was offended that the Lord ignored him. The Lord did not say that John was doubting. In verse 6, " he who is not stumbled because of Me" should be rendered "he who does not take offense at Me." John took offense at the Lord because he did not get what he expected. Hence, he sent his disciples to provoke the Lord. Therefore, in verse 3 John was not in doubt concerning the Lord, but he took offense at the Lord.</P><P>Verse 4:"And Jesus answered and said to them, Go, report to John the things that you hear and see." The Lord knew that John was offended by Him, so He told John's disciples to report to John two things: (1) the things that they heard and (2) the things that they saw. The things that they heard were the Lord's teachings (doctrines). These were the Lord's words—the doctrinal aspect. The things that they saw were the miracles performed by the Lord. These were the Lord's works—the moral aspect. The things that were heard were mentioned before the things that were seen. From this we see that the teachings of Christ, the so-called theology, are more important than His miracles. To see God perform ten miracles is not as profitable as to hear Him speak ten words, because God's word can work in us for a longer period of time.</P><P>Verse 5:"The blind receive their sight and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; and the dead are raised and the poor have the gospel announced to them." The Lord mentioned first the blind receiving sight, because this was something that had never happened in the Old Testament. The Lord wanted John to see that no one could have done such things except the Messiah. The blind receiving sight signifies the opening of our spiritual eyes; the lame walking signifies that we are enabled to walk in God's way; the lepers being cleansed signifies that the charges of sins against us are removed; the deaf hearing signifies that we are enabled to know God's will; the dead being raised signifies that we have passed out of death into life; and the poor having the gospel announced to them signifies that we all who have nothing to do with God have the gospel preached to us.</P><P>Verse 6:"And blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me." Because John saw that the Lord did not act according to his desire, he took offense at the Lord. Blessed is he who does not take offense at the Lord for the way He has ordained for him. Not being happy with God's will is a cause of stumbling. John did not doubt the Lord, but he took offense at the Lord. The reason for his stumbling was that he was not satisfied with the way God had arranged for him. In His reply the Lord gave John a hint so that he might know his mistake. However, He still testified for John before men. The Lord's answer included what John had heard and seen before, except that the Lord added this word: "Blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me."</P><P>Verse 7:"And as these went away, Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John, What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?" In the wilderness there are plenty of reeds. In other words, at that time John was somewhat like a reed shaken by the wind.</P><P>Verse 8: "But what did you go out to see? A man arrayed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings." John previously lived in the wilderness for the sake of the Lord. But now because of the long imprisonment, he became weakened. People thought that he might want to wear soft clothing, but the Lord said that John was not like that.</P><P>Verse 9:"Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet." The Lord said that John was greater than all the prophets. Men usually divide the prophets into the major prophets and the minor prophets according to the length of the books they have written.</P><P>Verse 10:"This is he concerning whom it is written, `Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.'" This verse should be put in parentheses.</P><P>Verse 11:"Truly I say to you, Among those born of women there has not arisen one greater than John the Baptist, yet he who is least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he." "Least" should be translated "less," in contrast with "greater." John was greater than all the prophets. This does not mean, however, that he was greater than all the prophets in faith, morality, the Holy Spirit, fame, work, or position. In saying that John was greater, the Lord was referring to something specific.</P><P>Verse 12:"But from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence, and violent men seize it." The Pharisees were violently frustrating people from entering the kingdom of the heavens. Hence, those who desired to enter had to do so by violence.</P>
