These basic lessons on service were given by Brother Witness Lee from February through December 1979 in Anaheim, California
We need to teach people that when we use the term service we are not referring to the so-called Sunday morning service in the denominations
Not only has Christianity spoiled the word service, but even among us this word has been spoiled to some extent
As long as we minister Christ according to the apostles' teaching , the teaching of God's New Testament economy , we are in the one ministry
The one ministry is the ministry of Christ to people for the producing and the building up of the church, the Body of Christ
When we see this we can realize that the interpretation or the application among Christians today of the word ministry is not accurate
We have to come back to the pure meaning of this New Testament word to see a clear vision of the New Testament ministry
We worship God and we serve God in our meetings, and in our meetings we offer our praises and our thanks to God
Immediately after we are saved, we come to worship God in our meetings to render God's gift, Christ, to the Father
Now we have to serve God, to come to the meetings to offer Christ to God as the unique gift which God the Father has given to us
The Bible uses the word ekklesia to indicate the church because it really corresponds with the meaning of the church
When the Lord Jesus mentioned the church the second time in Matthew 18:17, it was in the local sense and it indicated the matter of meeting
When the Lord Jesus mentioned the matter of the church in a local sense, He pointed out the need of the gathering, the meeting
Because of this, we do not have the sense that it is absolutely a deficiency to come to a meeting without ministering Christ to others
Also, if the priest in the Old Testament did not offer something on the altar, he could never get into the tabernacle
We need to spend a longer time in our sharing to stress this one thing: that every saint has to build up the church
If all the saints would exercise to build the meeting, surely we would have a strong meeting, a rich meeting, and a high meeting
Suppose not even one saint would function in the meeting, and everyone came to the meeting to sit there dumbly
The more we all exercise to speak Christ in the meetings, the richer, the higher, and the more living the meetings will be
We need to notice that according to the Greek text, it is not to be gathered in the Lord's name but into His name
How much content the meeting has and how high the meeting is altogether depend upon how much we have experienced Christ
We must come to the meeting not with the objective, doctrinal Christ but with the subjective, experiential Christ
Something will be accumulated in our being and we will have something of Christ to minister and impart to others
You will become a divine waiter or waitress, waiting on many attendants and serving them with something of Christ
Corinthians 14 says that when we come together, we all can prophesy one by one and that prophesying builds up the church
When Moses would speak to his brother Aaron to put some words into his mouth, God would be with Moses' mouth and with Aaron's mouth
We need to use 1 Corinthians 14:31 to impress the saints that in the church meetings we all can prophesy one by one
Paul told the Corinthians that they were meeting not for profit but for a loss because they met with divisions
The children of Israel appeared before the Lord three times a year in the place chosen by God to be gathered together into one
Before we fellowship about the Lord's table meeting, we need to see the two categories of meetings in the Bible
The meetings for the work are for three basic purposes preaching the gospel giving a report of Gods work and reading the apostles writing
When we come together to listen to the ministry of the Word, that is not a church meeting but a ministry meeting
Acts 2 tells us that the early believers had the Lord's table, the breaking of bread, every day in their homes
Later in Acts 20:6b-7a, we can see that the saints had a habit of having the Lord's table on the Lord's Day, the first day of the week
Today the whole world takes Sunday not mainly for worship but for pleasures, for sports, and for all kinds of entertainment
Many Christians not only refer to the Lord's Day as Sunday, but also consider Sunday as a day of pleasure and entertainment
We remember the Lord not by thinking about, memorizing, or reckoning what the Lord did, but by breaking the bread
We break the bread in the meeting to signify that the Lord's physical body was broken on the cross for us and for our sins
We will fellowship concerning displaying the Lord's death, expressing our desire of the Lord's coming back, and worshipping the Father
In John 6:35a the Lord told us that He is the bread of life, so to eat the bread is to enjoy the Lord as our life supply
The next crucial point concerning our remembrance of the Lord is our eating the bread to enjoy the fellowship in Christ's mystical Body
The same bread, the same loaf on the table, signifies the physical body of Christ and the mystical Body of Christ
The Lord's physical body was broken on the cross for our redemption, and the Lord's mystical Body, the Body of Christ, is for our fellowship
We need to see that the remembrance of the Lord at His table implies His redemption, His Body, and His entire New Testament economy
To remember the Lord is to break the bread, to eat the bread, and to drink the cup in the reality of all their deep significances
Because we all are redeemed by this one blood, we have the one communion, and through this we receive the unique blessing
Corinthians 11:26 says, 'For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord's death until He comes'
On the Lord's table, His death is displayed, because the cup is separate from the bread, that is, the blood is separate from the body
We eat the bread and we drink the cup to display the Lord's death, because whenever the blood is separate from the body, that is death
It would be good to ask the saints to read these stanzas so that they can be impressed with the significance of worshipping the Father
We have to discern whether the bread on the table signifies the unique Body of Christ or a sect, a division, a denomination
We cannot partake of the so-called communion in other places because that bread on the table does not signify the Body but a division
If you are in division and you still eat the bread and drink the cup, that means you are eating and drinking unworthily
Corinthians 11:17-18 shows that if we take the Lord's table with divisions, our coming together is not for the better but for the worse
The Lord's judgment upon those in Corinth who participated unworthily in the Lord's table was to cause them to become weak physically
Sometimes when a believer is sick, he may need to call for the elders of the church and ask them to pray over him
To have proper table manners at His table means that we exercise our spirit and release our praise to Him in the right way
We do not want to explain what it means to remember the Lord but to say something about the practice of remembering the Lord
We have to impress the saints that it is altogether not fitting to pray to the Lord at the Lord's table when we are remembering Him
We have to try the best to point out the different items of the Lord's person so that the saints can be helped in their praising
In the section of remembering the Lord, all our praises should be addressed directly to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God
To address our praises directly to the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, we need to realize the economy of the Divine Trinity
In order to call the appropriate hymns in the table meeting, we need to learn to know the hymns first in their categories
When you know the hymns in these four aspects in their categories, contents, focus, and sensation and taste you know the hymns thoroughly
Certain hymns are good for certain times in the meeting, so we have to know the hymns first and then apply them at the proper time
After a section of the meeting has been started, we may need another hymn to strengthen and enrich the started section
The focus of this message is expressed in the following statement: the proper remembrance of the Lord depends upon our proper practice
Matthew 26:30 says that after the breaking of the bread and the drinking of the cup, the Lord and the disciples sang a hymn
John 4:23-24 says that the Father today seeks after those who will worship Him in their human spirit and in truthfulness
Ephesians 1 reveals the Father choosing and predestinating us, the Son redeeming us, and the Spirit sealing us
We also have to call hymns according to the Father's attributes, such as His love, His kindness, and His glory
To share this with the saints, we need to be clear about the type of the peace offering in the book of Leviticus
In offering the peace offering, some bread and flesh of the offering was assigned to the priests for their food
The Spirit of life was given on the day of resurrection, but the Spirit of power was poured out after His ascension
The section in the Lord's table of worshipping the Father is a section to praise the Father and enjoy His Son with Him
The focus of this lesson can be expressed in the following statement: the worshipping of the Father should be with the Son and in the Spirit
All of the Israelites had to come to the unique place with the rich produce, the rich offerings, of the good land
If we help the saints get on the track of life, all the details of our practice will be spontaneously regulated by life
In the previous lessons, we fellowshipped about the practice of remembering the Lord and worshipping the Father
Ephesians 3 says that the Father strengthens us through His Spirit into the inner man so that Christ the Son can make His home in our hearts
To worship the Father with the Son and in the Spirit is the true worship in the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity
Even when the Lord Jesus was talking to her the age had changed so the Lord used the term Father saying that we need to worship the Father
In John 4 the worship to the Father, the worship in the dispensing of God, is related to drinking the living water
To contact God the Spirit with our spirit is to drink of the living water, and to drink of the living water is to render real worship to God
If we do not drink the living water, we do not drink of the Spirit , we have no experience of God, and God is not dispensed into us
In order to have the worship in the dispensing of God, we need to drink of the Spirit so that God may dispense Himself into our being
Our worship, however, is not merely to the Creator but to the Father, who has regenerated us and who has put Himself into our being
We must remember Ephesians 2:18, which reveals that our worship is through the Son, in the Spirit, and to the Father
They had the concept concerning God as their Creator, but they did not have any concept about God being their begetting Father
Before the Lord's resurrection, they did not have the concept that they were to be the children of God with God's life and nature
When we say, 'Abba, Father' , we have a sweet inward sensation in an intimate enjoyment of the Father's presence
By becoming the Father's children, by knowing the Father's name, and by enjoying the Father's presence, we worship the Father
If we are not born of the Father, do not know His person, and do not have His presence, we cannot worship Him subjectively
The Jews said this based upon Deuteronomy 12, which refers to Jerusalem as the unique place ordained by God for His people's worship
We have to refer the saints back to Deuteronomy 12 and tell them that the very worship ordained by God was with two regulations
It had to be in the unique, central place chosen by God, and second, it was with all the rich surplus of the produce of the good land
All these offerings were the surplus of the produce of the good land as types of Christ who is the real surplus, the real offerings
We worship the Father in the Son as the reality by enjoying the riches of the Son as the rich produce of the good land
In this presentation there are four main parties: God, the offerer, the serving priest, and the congregation of cleansed people
Without this worship of the Father in the Lord's table meeting, the presentation of the peace offering to God cannot be fulfilled
From God's side, you have the burnt offering and the meal offering for the satisfaction both to God and to man
On our side, there is the need of the trespass offering and the sin offering to take care of our trespasses and our sin
When we offer the required peace offering for our thanksgiving we need to add these cakes and wafers which signify our experiences of Christ
Leviticus 23 speaks of the Feast of Pentecost, in which two loaves of fine flour baked with leaven are offered to God
In Christ Himself there is no leaven, but because we initiate this kind of thanksgiving offering, we bring in something unclean
Even in offering the peace offering for our thanksgiving toward God the Father, we are not clean because we are still in the flesh
On our side the problem of our trespass and sin should be solved by Christ as our trespass offering and as our sin offering
All this fat and these tender parts within the cattle must be burned to God as His food to satisfy Him and to please Him
It emphatically mentions the kidneys and the liver when speaking of the portions of the peace offering which are God's portion
The softest, sweetest, and most tender part in the cattle is the fat, which becomes food to God through burning
The Jews in the Old Testament knew God according to the Scriptures, so they offered the right thing to the right person, that is, God
When the children of Israel offered a peace offering according to God's requirements, they did not need to offer any cakes
If the offerer was thankful to God and offered it for a thanksgiving, he had to add something to the required peace offering
According to Leviticus 7:14, out of the many cakes offered, one had to be set apart and heaved unto God as a heave offering
Every time the serving priest offered a peace offering for thanksgiving, he had to take out one cake for a heave offering
The right thigh of the peace offering was also given to the priest for a heave offering out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings
The breast as a wave offering was a portion of the peace offering to all the priests, including Aaron and all his sons
The church must go on from the stage of love to the stage of strength, that is, from the breast stage to the thigh stage
A number of saints may consecrate themselves to Christ and the church, but five years later they may leave the church
The offering for thanksgiving is emotional and superficial, but the offering for a vow is determined and deeper
These cakes were to be offered with the sacrifice of thanksgiving, which is something we add to what God requires
When we are so grateful for what we have enjoyed of Christ, we have something to give to God for our thanksgiving
When we are grateful to God, we bring something of Christ in the aspect of His human living as our gratitude to God
Leviticus 7:13 says, 'With the thanksgiving sacrifice of his peace offering, he shall offer his offering with cakes of leavened bread'
Whenever we offer Christ at the Lord's table, we need to be reminded that we are still unclean, still leavened
Today we must be all four parties: the offerers, the conducting priests, the general priests, and the congregation
Corinthians 5 tells us what kinds of persons are unclean and should be excluded from the fellowship of the Lord's Body
His righteous requirements will not allow Him to have fellowship with His chosen people as long as they have sins
The blood is needed to satisfy God's righteousness, and it is also needed to maintain God's holiness, God's holy position
The four Gospels show us what was within the Lord Jesus while He was living, walking, and working on this earth
By reading the biography of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels, we can realize that within Him were the rich and tender inward parts
In the Lord's table meeting, after the remembrance of the Lord, we should offer the Lord as the peace offering to the Father
If we are outward like those in Pentecostalism, we will not have the inwards when we come to offer the peace offering
If we do not have the rich experiences of life, we cannot have the small, tender, and precious things within us toward God the Father
With the life of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels, there were the riches, the abundance in quantity, but there was no greatness in size
If we are great, spiritual giants according to the way of today's Christianity, we will not be able to offer the fat with the two kidneys
If we read the four Gospels to see the life of Jesus, we can see His inward being as typified by the inward parts of the peace offering
We can see that His inward being was rich in life with something tender and small, yet so precious to God the Father
The net above the liver , not the liver itself, was offered to God as the additional inward riches and the covering of this inward part
Within us we may have some experiences of the inward being of Christ, but we may not have that much of the riches of life
If we want to do a great work, make a great name, or have a great success right away, there can be no inwards in our offering to God
According to the whole Bible, the relationship we have with God must be based upon or built on these three divine attributes
The first section of Romans is concerning justification, and justification is according to God's righteousness
The second section of Romans covers the matter of sanctification, and sanctification is by the holiness of God
Romans is constructed with Gods righteousness holiness and glory because it is a book that shows us the real relationship between God and us
When these three things of God are taken care of in a good way, then there is no problem in our relationship with God
The fat signifies Christ's inward riches for God's satisfaction according to His glory and up to the standard of His glory
The fat is the inward riches of the cattle offered as a sacrifice, and this signifies the riches of the inward life of Christ
Also, this life has the abundance of riches which preserves the inward functions, typified by the liver and the kidneys
We can see that by the blood and the fat of the peace offering, God's requirements are taken care of and God's desire is satisfied
The four Gospels show us that Christ was easy to be contacted and received, as typified by the thinness of the unleavened cakes
The Lord in His human life on this earth was very hollow, which means that He was poor in spirit; He was humble
In verse 18 the Lord quoted from the book of Isaiah: 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me
The anointing is without, the mingling is within, and the saturating is the soaking and penetrating of the oil into the fine flour
Leviticus 7:13 says, 'With the thanksgiving sacrifice of his peace offering, he shall offer his offering with cakes of leavened bread'
The leavened bread here according to typology is a reminder that both the offerer and the conducting priest are still sinful
On the day of Pentecost in His ascension, He poured out the Spirit of power, which was symbolized by the mighty wind
The day of resurrection was a day of breath, a day of life, but the day of Pentecost was a day of wind, a day of power
It means the priestly service, the priestly ministry, and also the priestly body, the corporate body of priests
The priesthood's portion, the portion for the whole body of priests, was the breast as a wave offering before Jehovah
The breast as a wave offering before Jehovah signifies the love of Christ in resurrection for nourishment to all the priests
The meat of the cattle of the peace offering for a vow or a voluntary offering is good for eating for two days
The peace offering for thanksgiving is something emotional, whereas the one for a vow is something of the will and is stronger and deeper
The condition for the entire congregation to enjoy, to participate in, the peace offering is that they must be clean
The joints of supply refer to the particular gifted ones mentioned in verse 11 the apostles prophets evangelists and shepherds and teachers
The Body builds itself up not only through the joints of supply but also through each one part, each member of the Body
In Catholicism there is the hierarchy of the pope, the cardinals, the archbishops, the bishops, and the priests
There is a natural tendency to have a hierarchy, just like there is a natural tendency for water to flow down from a mountaintop
Those among us who have the ability to function must be on the alert not to take others' opportunity to function
Peter 4:10 says, 'Each one, as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God'
Since we all have received a gift, we need to minister this gift to one another as good stewards of the varied grace of God
If a brother does not know where a barber shop is and you help him, this is the practical service and this is brotherly love
Paul said that he was a faithful minister of Christ on behalf of the saints and one who was always struggling on their behalf in his prayers
In Colossians 4:7 and Ephesians 6:21 Paul spoke of Tychicus as a beloved brother, faithful minister, and fellow slave in the Lord
It took them a long time to go to a certain place and return, so surely they were serving the saints and the churches full-time
We should point out that there was such a unique and special characteristic of the church life in the ancient days
Because some of the dear saints loved the Lord, loved the church, and loved the saints, they served others at the cost of their lives
In 2 Corinthians 12:9 the Lord told Paul, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness'
We need to read these two verses to the saints repeatedly in order to impress them that all of them have been given grace
Of course, we expect that all of the brothers and sisters would function by opening their mouths to speak in the meetings
We do not like to force the saints to do this, because some do not have the particular portion of grace to be speakers
We can say that we realize that some of the saints do not have a speaking portion, so we would not force them to speak
Some of the saints may be bothered about not speaking to such an extent that they dare not come to the meeting
We need to dwell upon this point to impress all the saints that all of them are stewards entrusted with some aspect of God's grace
You do not have the aspect of grace that Paul had or the aspect of grace that some of the elders have but you surely have an aspect of grace
If all the saints come to take care of this janitorial work in the meeting hall with much prayer, this makes a big difference
The hall becomes like the palanquin mentioned in the Song of Songs, built and prepared through the love of the virgins
When we come into our meeting hall, which has been prepared, vacuumed, and cleaned by so many virgins, the sense is different
We should not think that vacuuming the floor of the hall or cleaning even one window of the hall is a small thing
One young man who was passing by the meeting hall on his bicycle read the verse which was posted on the outside of the hall
One sister, who became a deaconess among us, was burdened to pray for the salvation of her husband, who was a good businessman in Shanghai
A brother among us was a friend of his, and he invited him to come to our gospel- preaching meeting on the second day of the new year
Because of his friendship with this brother and because of his wife, he felt that he could not reject this invitation
While the gospel meetings were going on, some small rooms in the meeting hall were full of saints who were praying
We should stress that in order for us to experience Christ as grace, God always gives us certain kinds of circumstances
Under certain God-ordained circumstances, we experience grace and accumulate grace to have a storage of grace in our Christian life
They do not use their gifts, and they do not realize that this is a serious mistake which will cause a great loss to them
We have to convince every saint among us that they cannot say that they do not have any gift and cannot do anything
Matthew 24 speaks of the evil slave who 'says in his heart, My master delays, and begins to beat his fellow slaves
When we mistreat a fellow believer by criticizing, opposing, or despising him, that is to beat him in the eyes of the Lord
The outer darkness is the darkness outside the Lord's coming glory in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
If we do not use this gift faithfully, we cannot be in the place that the apostle Paul will be at the Lord's return
If we are living and walking in darkness today, how can we expect to participate in the Lord's bright glory in the next age?
Leviticus 16:12 tells us that the incense should be burned before the Lord with the fire from the altar of burnt offering
We have to stress and develop what it means for us to be dealt with by the cross in our enthusiasm so that we can serve the Lord
Maybe the two sons of Aaron did this with a good heart, with a good intention, but still they were burned to death
We may have a good heart and a good intention in offering something to God, but if we offer the wrong thing, this can cause death to us
The priests should control their natural affection, not sympathizing with the victim condemned by God's holiness
In our priestly service not only should the natural enthusiasm be rejected but also the natural affection should be controlled
In Leviticus 10 we can see two natural things: the natural hotness, the natural enthusiasm, and the natural affection, the natural sympathy
We should not bring in natural hotness, nor should we exercise our natural affection to sympathize with any natural ones
Every logical reader would consider that probably the two sons of Aaron offered strange fire to Jehovah because they were drunk
Drinking wine, in the Bible, signifies the overenjoyment of the worldly, natural, or physical, material things
When we lose our discernment because we are drunk we are not being regulated so we surely cannot teach others so that they can be regulated
Today in the church our priestly function also comprises these two things: offering something to God to serve God, and teaching others
If we are drunk and lose our discernment, we are unable to teach others, and we altogether lose our function of our priesthood
There is much charitable work in Christianity which is good, but it is not built upon Christ as the unique foundation
We may appreciate certain brothers' capabilities for doing things, but in the church life the main thing is not to accomplish things
The main thing is to build with the Triune God upon the foundation already laid, that is, upon the all-inclusive Christ
We need to serve with the Father's nature, in the Son's redeeming way with the cross, and by the transforming Spirit
The church is altogether a composition of gold, silver, and precious stone the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Verse 15 says, 'If anyone's work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire'
We may be very sufficient in other things, but we do not have any sufficiency, competence, or power in the things of God
Our heart is incurable, our mind is full of vanity with a darkened understanding, and our will is hard, stubborn
Romans 87 and 8 say Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God for neither can it be
We should not think that we are so good that if we are not in the spirit, we are in the soul, not in the flesh
After reading the above eight points, we should realize that we cannot have any trust in our natural being in the things of God
When we come to the meeting, we may act as one person, but at home and in our daily life we may be another person
We should not have a double personality, being one person in the meetings and another person outside the meetings
We must live the inner man, that is, we must let our spirit do everything, and reject everything of our natural being
God does not want us to remain in the realm, in the field, of good and evil by using our soul to do good and to reject evil
One day he and some of his followers went to a park which required them to purchase tickets in order to be admitted
Some of them entered the park with the tickets, and then one of them came out with the tickets and gave them to the others for them to enter
We should never accept a teaching which says that we have become so spiritual that it is impossible for us to sin
Enmities, strife, jealousy, and outbursts of anger are of one group, concerning evil moods and fleshly feelings
Paul classified jealousy with the first group of evil moods, but he classified envy with the second group of parties
The children according to the flesh, like Ishmael, persecuted the children according to the Spirit, like Isaac
The flesh is enmity against God, the flesh is not subject to God's law, and the flesh is not able to subject itself to God's law
Paul was very strong to say that we should not expect that our flesh can keep the law or can subject itself to the law
The religious ones may worship and serve God while always boasting and having confidence in the flesh, but we should not be like this
To sow unto ones own flesh is to sow for ones own flesh with the desire and purpose of the flesh in view to fulfill what the flesh covets
Galatians 5:24 says, 'But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts'
In the church service, we must help all the saints to see that our motive and intention must be pure, without any element of the flesh
If we know the flesh and do nothing according to the flesh, there will be no jealousy, envy, or ambition among us
When we are living and acting in the flesh, we are through with the compound Spirit, the all-inclusive, consummated, life-giving Spirit
We can see that self-confidence, self-righteousness, self-justification, self-vindication, and self-exaltation are all aspects of the flesh
When we have these aspects of the self, we are absolutely fleshly, and the Spirit, the holy anointing oil, has nothing to do with us
If we are so self-confident, self-righteous, self-justifying, self-vindicating, and self-exalting, we lose the Spirit
The four Gospels tell us a number of times that the disciples of the Lord Jesus were trying to find out the reason for certain things
An idle word is a nonworking word an inoperative word a word that has no positive function and is useless unprofitable unfruitful and barren
Exodus 17:8-13 speaks of Amalek fighting against the children of Israel while they were journeying to attain to God's goal
Moses and Joshua are two aspects of Christ: the ascended Christ interceding and the indwelling Christ fighting
In the fight against Amalek, Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi, which means 'Jehovah my banner'
Fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, bouts of drunkenness, and carousings are related to the lust of the corrupted body
In order to deal with the flesh, we have to deal with the lustful body, the corrupted soul, and the deadened spirit
There is a difference between the self and the flesh, but most Christians do not realize this or care for this
In Matthew 16:26 the Lord said, 'What shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life'?
In Romans 7:18-21 Paul shows how the flesh dominates the self and how the self tries unsuccessfully to overcome the flesh
When the flesh, which is full of lusts and passions, dominates the self, the self becomes an evil person doing evil things
If our shepherding or fellowship with the saints does not work so well in life, we have to realize that the self is there
In Matthew 16:24 the Lord said, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me'
We need to share this lesson with the saints with the ministry of life to give them a deep impression of our need to deny the self
Anyone in the Lord's recovery who is not clear concerning all these negative points cannot render a proper service to the Lord
We may do a lot of things, and we may help the local saints to do a lot of things, but nothing may be profitable in life
The Lord condemns Christianity because it has become a religion carried out by man's natural strength and man's natural ability
We must learn this as a basic lesson, and we also must impress every saint who partakes of the church service with this point
Whatever He did, whatever He said, and whatever He worked was altogether with the Father as the divine element
We have to learn the lesson of rejecting our natural strength and ability, and we have to help all the saints to learn this lesson
When he slew an Egyptian to protect his fellow Hebrew, he did this on his own and not according to the Lord's will
The sad situation in today's Christianity is that people work for the Lord mostly on their own by their natural strength and ability
When we work in our natural strength and ability, the goal is to seek our own glory and the motive is to satisfy our own desire
In the Lord's work, we should not have our own desire, and we should not have our own goal for our glory, for our boast
To overcome our natural strength and ability is a great, subjective lesson; it is more subjective than dealing with sin
Some brothers speak in their natural eloquence, but other brothers speak with an eloquence dealt with by the cross
Some who are short of experience may ask what the difference is between the natural eloquence and the eloquence in resurrection
If you have never been dealt with by the cross in your eloquence, that is the natural eloquence with nothing divine
If your eloquence has been dealt with, that kind of eloquence is in resurrection and is full of the divine element
Acts 7:22 tells us that Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in words and in works
After chapter three, God was in Moses and whatever Moses did in his acts and move was full of God, having the divine element
If our natural strength and ability are not dealt with, we will minister something natural to people by our church service
