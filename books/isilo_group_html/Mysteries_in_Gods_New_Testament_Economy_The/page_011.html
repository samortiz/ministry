When the Lord Jesus was living on earth, outwardly He was a man, a carpenter at home. Actually, it was God working in His humanity. This kind of realization has much to do with our living. Our living on earth today should be as that of the Lord Jesus, a living of divinity through humanity. We are not just human beings. We are God-men. We are those with God within us. When we live by Him, it makes us different. If we realize this matter, it will become more useful to us than if we understand many messages. Once the son of a king realizes his own status, he will become more dignified and will be different from others in his speech and conduct. Today, many Christians do not live like God-men, because they are not clear about their status. Permit me to say that it is very difficult for me to lose my temper today because I cannot sell my status. I can never forget that I am a God-man. If I remember my status, I will never lose my temper or criticize others easily, thus losing my own status. The Lord Jesus never sold Himself this way when He was on the earth. All the time He was living a life with the dignified status of a God-man.</P><P>Moreover, while the Lord was on earth, He experienced for us all the sufferings of human life. He was tried in all respects, that He might be able to sympathize with our weaknesses and help and rescue us (Heb. 2:17-18; 4:15). At the same time, He expressed the divine virtues in His humanity by the mysterious attributes of God (Luke 7:13-14). Today, we should live the same way on earth. We are no longer sinners. Rather, we are God-men. We should express the divine virtues in our humanity by God's mysterious attributes, such as love, light, holiness, righteousness, and power. This is the life of the Lord Jesus on earth. It is also the life that we should live today. What is expressed in our living should not merely be our virtuous acts but should be the divine virtues of God expressed in our humanity. Our living should be filled with the mysterious attributes of God that express the divine virtues.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>This Mysterious God-man Being Crucified<br>to Accomplish His All-inclusive Death</H2><P>Fourth, this mysterious God-man was crucified in His humanity with His mysterious divinity, dying an all-inclusive, mysterious death, thus accomplishing the eternal redemption of God (Heb. 9:12). When Christ the God-man was on the cross, He accomplished His all-inclusive death in seven statuses. First, as the mysterious Lamb, He took away the sin of man (John 1:29). Not only did He deal with the outward sins of man, but He also dealt with the nature of sin in man. Second, as a mysterious man of flesh, He condemned sin in the likeness of the flesh of sin, that is, in the form of fallen man, and dealt with the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3). Through the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in the flesh, God judged sin together with the flesh in which sin dwells. Third, as the mysterious last Adam, He terminated the man of the old creation (Rom. 6:6). The first Adam was the beginning of the human race. The last Adam is the termination of the human race. When Christ as the last Adam was crucified on the cross, the old man, who was created by God and who became fallen because of sin, was terminated. Fourth, as the mysterious Firstborn of all creation in the old creation, He terminated the entire old creation and reconciled all the creation to God (Col. 1:15, 20). Christ as the Firstborn of all creation takes preeminence in all creation. When this Christ was crucified on the cross, the whole old creation was terminated so that all the creation of God could be reconciled to Him. Fifth, as the mysterious brass serpent, He bruised the ancient serpent and destroyed Satan and his world (Gen. 3:15; Heb. 2:14; John 12:31). Sixth, as the mysterious Peacemaker, He abolished all the separating ordinances in the law (including all the different kinds of living, customs, and habits that cause divisions among mankind) through His mysterious death, thus making peace for all His Jewish and Gentile believers (Eph. 2:14-16). Seventh, as a mysterious grain of wheat, He released the divine life in Him through His death, thus making us many grains of wheat of life, like Him (John 12:24). This is the eternal redemption that Christ, the mysterious God-man, has accomplished through His allinclusive death.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Mysteries in God's New Testament Economy &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
