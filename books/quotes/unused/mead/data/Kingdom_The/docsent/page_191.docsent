   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY THE LORD'S DEALING WITH THE BELIEVERS AT HIS COMING BACK Scripture Reading: Matt 24:39b-44; 1 Thes 4:15-17; 1 Cor 15:50-54; 2 Thes 2:1-4, 8; 1:5-10; Phil 3:20-21; 1 John 3:2; Rev 2:25; 3:3; 16:15; 19:11-16; 22:7, 12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All these Scriptures reveal how the Lord will deal with the believers at His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The way will be by judgment, by rapture, and by choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The rapture of the believers is likened to harvesting of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to this picture, the rapture is not something which can be accomplished all at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In ancient times the harvest of the wheat was done in three stages: the firstfruits were gathered, the general harvest was gathered, and then the gleanings were gathered.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to this illustration, we can also see that the rapture is not something which will occur as an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, it comes as the result of the maturity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we are not mature in the Lord Jesus, surely we will not be reaped.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the Lord's crop of wheat on the earth, we need to be ripe, to be mature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why has the Lord delayed His coming for such a long time?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is because of the lack of adequate maturity among His saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our progress and maturity determines the speed of His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we mature faster, surely His coming will be sooner.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In a sense, we are not waiting for His coming; rather, He is waiting for us to be fully matured.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need the maturity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How can we be transferred from the reality of the kingdom into the manifestation of the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is only by the growth of life and maturity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To use our illustration once more, the crop can be transferred into the barn only by growing and becoming ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once the crop is ripe, it will be transferred into the barn.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all need the maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The proper maturity will issue in the transfer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE GLORIFICATION OF OUR BODY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the time of the transfer, there will also be the need of a kind of work by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Philippians 3:20-21 tells us that at His coming back He will transfigure our body, "conforming it to the body of His glory."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have been regenerated in our spirit, and we are under the process of transformation in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the transformation has been completed, we will have the maturity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that we will be ready to be reaped by the Lord Jesus, and He will come to change our body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the point which must be worked out by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Suppose that you are a mature saint, regenerated in your spirit and transformed in your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You have been fully saturated and possessed by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What more do you need?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You need to have your body transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may use the Apostle Paul for an example.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a saint who died in the Lord, he is sleeping until the time of his resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While he was living on the earth his spirit was fully occupied by the Lord, and his soul was fully saturated and occupied by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But today he is under the earth waiting for the transfiguration of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His body is still something old, something of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although his spirit was regenerated and his soul was transformed, his dead body remains in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will change the bodies of both the living saints and dead saints.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Both the living ones and dead ones will be transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord will do a work of transfiguration upon our bodies.</S>
