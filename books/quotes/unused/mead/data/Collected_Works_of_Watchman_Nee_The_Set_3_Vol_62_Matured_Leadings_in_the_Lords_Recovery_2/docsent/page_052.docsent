   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FUNCTION OF THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some may ask about the function of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I am not saying that the mind is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The function of the mind is very much related to the function of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God communicates with us in our spirit, but He also communicates through our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is the relationship between the function of the mind and the function of the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The mind is the organ by which we understand the feeling of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before the Lord we must first have an open spirit to establish a living communication with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After we understand the leading of the Holy Spirit, we need to exercise our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After a blind man's eyes are opened, he does not discard his ears and hands from that point onward.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, he has to learn to adjust his eyes so that they will coordinate properly with his other faculties.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before a man is saved, he lives by his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After he is saved, it does not mean that he no longer will need to live by his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, he has to learn to coordinate his mind with his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A man whose eyes are opened needs to learn to adjust the other faculties of his body to his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When he needs to use his eyes, he should use his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He should no longer be the same as before, touching with his hand and listening with his ears instead of seeing with his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should deal with spiritual things the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After we are saved, we should not deal with spiritual things only with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should instead coordinate our faculties with our spirit, feel with our spirit, and then understand and express these feelings with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is what Paul meant when he said that he prayed and sang with his spirit and he also prayed and sang with his mind 1 Cor 14:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are two functions related to the exercise of our mind:</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Translating the Thoughts of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First John 3:24, Romans 8:9, and 1 Corinthians 2:12 all speak of the Holy Spirit of God dwelling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the "divine output" of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Holy Spirit in our spirit joins us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, the Holy Spirit is in God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the other hand, He is also in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can say that this Holy Spirit is our spirit because He dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But we can also say that He is God's Spirit because the Holy Spirit is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the reason that the original text in the Epistles often does not clearly point to the Holy Spirit or to our spirit when the word spirit is used.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In reality, it is hard to differentiate between the human spirit and God's Holy Spirit because His Holy Spirit is now living in man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, when the Holy Spirit of God moves within our spirit, the latter feels it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But even though our spirit feels it, our outer man does not know about it, and we have to interpret it with our mind so that we can understand the meaning of this move of God's Holy Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose we are doing something, and there is a prompting within our spirit to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our spirit has been touched, but we have to interpret it with our mind before we know that it is wrong and that we should stop immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the function of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The same is true with our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose we ask a certain person if he wants to go to another place with us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Spirit may touch us to not ask this question, but our mind has to interpret it before we realize that He does not want us to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we should shut up.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The function of the mind is to enable us to know the feeling of the Holy Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can call this function a kind of interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It interprets the will of the Spirit to our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Fulfilling the Ministry of the Word</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The second function of the mind is to help us in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The move of the Holy Spirit in our spirit is like sending Morse code.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to understand this code, we need a code book to interpret it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our mind must have this interpreting ability before others can understand what God has revealed in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order for the mind to have such a capacity, it must be trained and it must learn.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose there is a kind of prompting in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We feel that God wants us to say something about consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yet in our prayer and study of God's Word, we do not feel any breakthrough; there does not seem to be the utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Afterwards we feel that we should speak about faith instead.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once we make this decision, we feel released, and the utterance flows out of us; our spirit begins to respond, and everything falls into place.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we come to the meeting, we speak according to the feeling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Perhaps the Holy Spirit will help us to continue with the speaking, or the feeling in the spirit may stop, which means that we should stop as well.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is how we exercise the faculty of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At the beginning we select one topic out of many topics.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Afterwards we refine the search and pick out the words that God wants us to say.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Finally, we speak the very things that God wants us to speak.</S>
