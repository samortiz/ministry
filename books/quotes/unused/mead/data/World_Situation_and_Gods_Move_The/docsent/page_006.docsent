   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RISE OF BRITAIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There was still the need for the gospel to be spread to Africa and to Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There was also the need for the spread of the light seen by the Brethren to every part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How was this spreading to come about?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After the defeat of the Spanish Armada, Spain's power declined while that of Britain rose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Gradually she became an empire, with colonies all around the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was called the empire without a sunset.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For more than two centuries the colonies were farms, providing her with the goods she needed and making her wealthy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During the days of Britain's preeminence, the Protestant influence reached to every continent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Most missionaries in the past were British.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The money used for the spread of the gospel was largely in pounds sterling, not United States dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was in England that many spiritual giants were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Great teachers among the Brethren wrote hundreds of books for the release of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Light was released by the speakers at the Keswick Convention.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now, however, especially since World War II, Great Britain has lost her colonies, the source of her wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead of her islands being gardens, they have had to become farms.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Britain was not faithful to God or to man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In World War I she promised the Jews to make Palestine their homeland if they would help in the fight against Germany.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the same time she secretly promised the Jordanians, who were Arabs, that Palestine would become theirs if they would join in fighting against the Turks.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the war was over, the Jews and Jordanians were both offended at this duplicity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE UNITED STATES AS A WORLD POWER</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The United States followed Britain as a world power.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before the discovery of America, the connecting center for the whole world was the Holy Land.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Though it is located in the western part of Asia, it joins Asia, Europe, and Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God sovereignly made the Holy Land the focus of the ancient populated world, so that the gospel could be formed and spread from there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since World War II, the United States has been the heart of the populated world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Its climate is temperate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It lies between two great oceans, which are like the wings of an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whatever the United States does, the entire world follows.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is true financially, industrially, scientifically, politically, militarily, religiously, scripturally, and spiritually!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even in language, it is American English, not British, which prevails.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why has God ordained this?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is for His move on earth to carry out His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Roman Empire was for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Germany was for the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Britain was for the spreading of the gospel and of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now the United States has become the center for the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From here it can spread to all the continents in a world-wide language.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Wherever we are from, we must appreciate America.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God will use America to spread His recovery so that the Lord may return.</S>
