   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>K. Emmanuel, the Name Called by People 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jesus as Emmanuel Experienced by Us</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to the second name, Emmanuel 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The angels did not speak to Joseph or Mary of this name.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, Emmanuel is the name called by people who have had a certain amount of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever you have some experience of Jesus, you will be able to say that He is God with you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jesus is nothing less than God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God told us that His name is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But as we receive Him and experience Him, we say that Jesus is God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Often we turn to our mind and ask the question, "Is this Jesus the very God?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may be confident that He is the Son of God, but we may not yet be assured that He is actually God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I was young, I was taught by some fundamental Christian teachers to be careful of saying directly that Jesus was God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I was taught that the Son of God was different from God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, I was told not to say directly that Jesus was God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was told that I must pray through Jesus to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I received a teaching that suited the human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, after much practice, the more I prayed, the more I realized that this Jesus was simply God with me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To argue by theory is one thing; to experience the fact is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Quite often, Christians do not agree with their experience; instead, they agree with their concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I believe that all Christians have this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Deep within, do you not have the sense that, according to your experience, Jesus is God?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You do, but you dare not say this in doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, you should not consider Jesus as someone other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jesus is nothing less than God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is not only the Son of God, but also God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some good writers have said that apart from Jesus we can never find God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is with Jesus, and God is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was not only with God, but the Word was God John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This Word became flesh and was called Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we experience Jesus, He is Emmanuel, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have heard that Jesus is our comfort, our rest, our peace, and our life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jesus is so much to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we would experience Him, we would immediately say, "This is God!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not God far away from me, or God in the heavens, but God with me."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever we experience Jesus in a certain way, we realize that Jesus is God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jesus is our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After we experience this salvation, we say, "This is God with us to be our salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Jesus is our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when we experience Him as our patience, we say, "This patience is God with me."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jesus is the way and the truth, but when we experience Him as the way and the truth we say, "This way and this truth are just God with me."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hallelujah, Jesus is God with us!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In our experience, He is Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With Us in Our Gatherings</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whenever we are gathered together into the name of Jesus, He is with us Matt 18:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once again, this is Emmanuel, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The presence of Jesus in our meetings is actually God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With Us All the Days</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Jesus is with us all the days, even until the completion of the age 28:20, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>. "All the days" includes today.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not forget about today.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many Christians think that Jesus is present all the days, except today.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But Jesus is with us now, today!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>With Us in Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Jesus is not only among us; He is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This Jesus who is with our spirit is Emmanuel, God with us.</S>
