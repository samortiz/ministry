<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Contents of the New Man</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the contents of the new man. Colossians 3:10 and 11 tell us that in the new man "Christ is all and in all." In the new man there is room only for Christ. He is all the members of the new man and in all the members. He is everything in the new man. Actually, He is the new man, His Body (1 Cor. 12:12). In the new man He is the centrality and universality. He is the constituent of the new man, and He is all in all in the new man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. To Be Built Up</H2><P>The Body of Christ needs to be built up by the perfected saints in all the local churches (Eph. 4:11-12). Ephesians 4:11 speaks of the gifted persons&#151;apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. These gifted persons have only one ministry, that is, to minister Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ, the church. Whatever the gifted persons do must be for the building up of the Body of Christ. However, this building up is not accomplished directly by the gifted ones but by the saints who have been perfected by them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Not Divided</H2><P>The Body of Christ is not divided and is not divisible. This is indicated clearly by Paul's word in 1 Corinthians 1:10-13.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. To Consummate the New Jerusalem</H2><P>The building up of the Body of Christ consummates the New Jerusalem. Today we are building up the Body of Christ for the building up of the New Jerusalem. We are building up something in this age&#151;the Body of Christ&#151;that is for something in the next age&#151;the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. TO KNOW THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION&#151;<br>THE NEW JERUSALEM</H2><P>We need to advance from knowing the Body of Christ to knowing the ultimate consummation&#151;the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Mystical Constitution</H2><P>The New Jerusalem is a mystical constitution constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God with His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, built-up, conformed, and glorified people.</P>
