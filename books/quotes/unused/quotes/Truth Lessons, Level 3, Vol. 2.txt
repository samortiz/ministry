As the offerings, He also becomes food to God and to those who belong to and serve God so that both God and man may be satisfied
There are five basic offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering
All these offerings are types of Christ, revealing that the riches of Christ in His various aspects meet the need of God and man
The basic offerings are the basis of all the offerings; all the subordinate offerings are based on the basic offerings
It primarily signifies Christ in His living for God and for God's satisfaction, not in His redeeming man from sin
He did God's will and became obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross , on which He offered Himself to God once for all
We need to lay our hands on Him to be identified with Him, to be one with Him, and to live the life He lived on earth
By passing through all these processes we will have something to offer to God as our burnt offeringthe very Christ whom we have experienced
The meal offering is for God as food for His satisfaction, and it is also for His serving ones as food for their satisfaction
The main element of the meal offering is fine flour which signifies that Christs humanity is fine perfect balanced and right in every way
These processes signify the varied sufferings of Christ in His human living, which made Him 'a man of sorrows'
The meal offering is mingled with oil, signifying that Christ's humanity has been mingled with the Holy Spirit
He is a man in humanity, yet He expressed His divine attributes as human virtues, thus expressing God in His humanity
During the course of His human life, Christ suffered a great deal, but the aroma of His resurrection was manifested through His sufferings
He continually lived and walked in these three things, that is, in His humanity mingled with His divinity and expressing His resurrection
No matter what the circumstances were, the Lord Jesus lived a life of suffering but expressed the fragrance of resurrection
In every place and at every time, Christ lived a life of humanity mingled with divinity, expressing His resurrection
In the meal offering, all the frankincense with part of the fine flour and part of the oil were burned on the altar
We must first give God's portion to Him for His satisfaction, and then the remainder will be our portion for our satisfaction
The peace offering as the center of the five basic offerings is based on God's satisfaction in the burnt offering
Christ's being the burnt offering to God for His satisfaction qualifies Him to deal with our sin, that is, the sin in our nature
When we eat the breast of Christ, we have His loving ability to love others and to be concerned for them in love
The burnt offering is followed by the meal offering, which shows that we should take Christ as our life supply and live by Him daily
Even though we have peace, we still have certain problems that need to be dealt with-sin within and sins without
Christ became flesh for our sin, but He was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin and did not have the sin of the flesh
On the cross He judged Satan, who is related to the flesh, and the world, which hung on Him , and He destroyed Satan
At the same time, through Christ's crucifixion in the flesh, God condemned sin, which was brought by Satan into man's flesh
Some of the blood of the sin offering was brought into the Tent of Meeting and sprinkled seven times toward the veil of the Holy of Holies
The more we love the Lord and enjoy Him, the more we will know our evil nature and know our great need for Christ as our sin offering
The trespass offering not only includes the sin offering and the burnt offering, but it is even related to the humanity of Jesus
The humanity of Jesus is an all-inclusive dose to kill our germs, to heal our diseases, and to supply our need
Leviticus 7:29-31 shows that the offerer of the peace offering was to bring parts of his offering for the offerings of Jehovah by fire
The fat was to be burned to God by fire on the altar with the breast waved as a wave offering before Jehovah for Aaron and his sons
Since the breast signifies love, the breast of the wave offering signifies the loving part of Christ in resurrection
Leviticus 7:32-33 says, 'The right thigh you shall give to the priest for a heave offering out of the sacrifices of your peace offerings
The one among the sons of Aaron who presents the blood of the peace offerings and the fat shall have the right thigh as his portion'
The peace offering is of different kinds, indicating that the offerers' enjoyment of Christ is in different conditions
If, as an exercise of our free will, we spontaneously choose to be absolute for God, this is a freewill offering becoming a burnt offering
All these offerings are types of Christ, revealing how the riches of Christ in His various aspects meet the need of God and man
The trespass offering not only includes the sin offering and the burnt offering, but it is also related to the humanity of Jesus
In the preceding lessons we saw how the tabernacle typifies Christ and the church and how the altar typifies the cross of Christ
Now we come to see how the priesthood of Aaron and his sons typifies Christ and His believers as the New Testament priesthood
Melchizedek, as the one having neither beginning of days nor end of life , was sent from God to be a priest according to God's eternal order
In the Old Testament age God saved the children of Israel out of Egypt, saying, 'I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to Myself
Eventually, only the house of Aaron became the priests, with the tribe of Levi helping them in doing various duties
The New Testament believers are priests of God not singly, individually, but corporately; they are a body of priests, a priesthood
We all need the corporate service in the spiritual house in order to fulfill God's purpose and satisfy God's desire
The book of Revelation also stresses that the Lord has redeemed us with His blood to make us priests to His God and Father
In the New Jerusalem in eternity, one of the blessings to be received by the redeemed ones is to be priests serving God
In the Scriptures the turning of the priestly ministry from the Old Testament to the New Testament occurred with John the Baptist
There was a turn from the old way to the new way, and there was a change from the Old Testament priests to the New Testament priests
Every believer should personally preach the gospel by visiting people to save sinners and offer them to God as sacrifices
They can be appointed to go forth and preach the gospel by visiting people, to nourish and take care of new believers, and to teach them
They can prophesy for the Lord to minister Christ and build up the church for the carrying out of God's New Testament economy
Hebrews 1315 says Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God that is the fruit of lips confessing His name
Hebrews 13:16 goes on to tell us about doing good and sharing with others, that is, having fellowship in the needs of the saints
The sons of Aaron typify the believers in Christ being priests to God with Christ to become a priesthood serving God
In the New Jerusalem in eternity, one of the blessings to be received by the redeemed ones is to be priests serving God
As a part of the garments of the high priest, the ephod was used for fastening, girding, securing, or connecting
Two shoulder plates and one breastplate were fastened to the ephod; hence, they were also fastened, linked, girded, to the high priest
The gold becoming thread and woven together with the linen portrays the process of Christ in all His sufferings
The weaving together of the gold and linen in the ephod typifies the divinity and humanity of Christ being mingled and woven together
In His living we see His heavenliness, kingliness, and redemption; we also see His divine glory and human beauty
Christ has the power to hold us and the strength to fasten us to Himself because He includes all these elements
Verse 12 says, 'You shall put the two stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as stones of remembrance for the sons of Israel
Two onyx stones were put upon the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, and the names of the twelve sons of Israel were engraved on the stones
After regeneration, believers begin to possess the element of precious stones and enter into the process of transformation
Whatever has its source in man's fall will be removed, and whatever comes from God's creation will be transformed
Eventually, in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth, all the believers in Christ will be precious stones
The Hebrew words rendered 'settings of gold' also mean 'plaited work of gold, plaited settings of gold, filigree settings of gold'
Whatever is of the flesh, the self, the old man, and the world must be judged so that we may know God's leading
When the Urim and the Thummim were added to the breastplate, they caused it to become the breastplate of judgment
Even though we are on earth, we have been born from above, from heaven, and have a heavenly life with a heavenly nature
As the garment was being made, the pomegranates came before the bells, but in function, the bells come before the pomegranates
The pomegranates were made of linen, signifying humanity, and the bells were made of gold, signifying divinity
Bells sound out warnings, and the golden bells signify that the speaking of the church must come out of divinity
The fullness of life is expressed in the church's humanity, but the voice of warning is expressed in the church's divinity
As a part of the garments of the high priest, the ephod was used for fastening, girding, securing, or connecting
It was made primarily by gold thread woven together with fine linen and by blue, purple, and scarlet strands woven into fine linen
Two onyx stones were put on the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, and the names of the twelve sons of Israel were engraved on the stones
The fullness of life is expressed in the church's humanity, but the voice of warning is expressed in the church's divinity
If we, as God's people, intend to live a holy life as required by our holy God, we need to be careful about our contact with people
All the creeping things are unclean, but in the other four categories some animals are clean, and others are unclean
Let us consider the four categories of living creatures that are clean with respect to diet, signifying persons whom we may contact
Chewing the cud signifies receiving the word of God with much consideration and reconsideration, like a cow chewing its cud
We need to have a walk that is full of discernment, and we also need to chew the cud, eating the word of God by chewing it again and again
Aquatic animals that have fins and scales signify persons who can move and act freely in the world but resist its influence
People who live in the sea of the world should have fins and scales in order to act freely in the world and resist its influence
We should live and move in a life that is away from and above the world, and we should take the things of life as our supply
Believers in the Lord should be those who can jump and fly, unfettered by the world and unentangled by the earth
Similarly, our contact with certain kinds of people can cause us to be reconstituted and make us a different kind of person
Only Christ and all that is out of Christ, those who have been transformed by the life of Christ, are clean for our food supply
When He was on earth, He lived and moved in a life that was above the world, and He kept Himself from the world
All the clean living creatures that walk on the earth, live in the water, and fly in the air are types of Christ
The animals that are good for eating, signifying the persons whom God's people may contact, are divided into four categories
Aquatic animals that have fins and scales signify persons who can move and act freely in the world but resist its influence
Based on the significance of the different categories of animals that are clean for eating, only Christ matches the conditions
Only Christ and all that is out of Christ, all those who have been transformed by the life of Christ, are those whom we may contact
The uncleanness of the human birth coming out of the woman signifies that the source of all mankind is unclean
The uncleanness of the male's birth is for seven days, but the uncleanness of the female's birth is for fourteen days
The female, being weaker than the male by birth, is doubly unclean in her weakness, as signified by the fourteen days
Leprosy is a disease that is not easily cured and often results in death because it is mingled with man's constitution
Having entered into us, this sin, this leprosy, comes forth from within us as sins, offenses, and transgressions
Although sin comes from Satan, who is outside of man, it entered into man's flesh and became mingled with man's fallen nature
The function of Christ as the burnt offering is to be our life so that we may live a life that is absolute for God
The uncleanness of the human birth coming out of the woman signifies that the source of all mankind is unclean
Leprosy is the outcome of man's rebellion against God's authority, God's deputy authority, God's regulation, and God's economy
Having sympathy in love for the leper, the Lord Jesus came near to him and touched him in order that he might be cleansed
Cedar wood in verse 4 signifies the honorable and uplifted humanity of the Lord , which enables Him to be our Savior
Verse 5 says, 'The priest shall command that one of the birds be slaughtered in an earthen vessel over running water'
The Hebrew expression for running water literally means 'living water,' signifying the eternal, living Spirit of God
When He was dying on the cross, He offered Himself to God through the living water-the eternal, living Spirit of God-that filled Him
In Leviticus 146 four thingsthe other bird the cedar wood the scarlet strands and the hyssopwere dipped in the blood of the killed bird
These items have all been accomplished for us by Christ, and we need to experience and enjoy them in order to be cleansed
The one who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes and shave off all his hair and bathe in water, and he shall be clean'
The hair of the head signifies man's glory, an area in which one boasts, glorifies himself, and makes a display before others
The beard signifies man's self-assumed honor, which causes people to have a feeling that they are superior to others
Bathing oneself in water, which is to have our entire being buried in water, signifies dealing with one's entire being
He shall slaughter the male lamb in the place where they slaughter the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the sanctuary'
The blood is applied to the lobe of the right ear, to the thumb of the right hand, and to the big toe of the right foot
The rest of the oil that is in the palm of the priest's hand he shall put on the head of the one who is to be cleansed
The priest shall offer the sin offering and make expiation for the one who is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness'
Becoming a malignant leprosy signifies that the sin which is spreading within a person by eating up his flesh is becoming worse and worse
You shall burn it in the fire; it is a leprous decay, whether the bareness is on the inside or on the outside'
Verse 57 speaks of the infection reappearing in the garment after the infected spot has been torn out of the garment
Which you shall wash, if the infection has departed from them, shall be washed a second time and shall be clean'
Man is always living in three layers of coverings: first, his body; second, his clothing; and third, his house
Leprosy in a house is leprosy that invades the church life, that is, the sins and evils that occur in the church life
Leviticus 14:49-51 reveals that the leprosy in a house is cleansed in the same way as the cleansing of the leprosy in a man
In order for a church to be cleansed, the church needs to experience the processes through which the Lord Jesus passed
In typology the blood of the bird signifies the blood of Christ water signifies the cleansing Spirit and oil signifies the anointing Spirit
When the church enjoys Christ's resurrection and ascension, the church is above the earth, enjoying freedom in the heavens
These chapters show a threefold dealing with sin, not only sin in our being and in our conduct but also sin in our dwelling
Day by day we need to repent of our failures, confess our sins, and deal with our failures and sins, seeking even to eliminate them
Day by day we need to repent of our failures, confess our sins, and deal with and eliminate our failures and sins by the cross of Christ
Leviticus 11 through 15 portray that mans contact with people mans source mans manifestation and mans discharge are altogether unclean
In the Old Testament the taking away of sins through the redemption of Christ, which God foreordained, was not yet accomplished
After revealing the different aspects of human uncleanness in chapters 11 through 15, chapter 16 presents the expiation prepared by God
Expiation in the Old Testament was not the taking away of sins but the covering of sins so that they were not seen
The repetition of the offering was an indication that the taking away of sins for the accomplishment of redemption had not yet taken place
The lid of the Ark, which was within the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle in the Old Testament, was the place where God met with His people
Inside the Ark were the two tablets of the Testimony, the two tablets of the law, on which the Ten Commandments were written
With the type of the expiation in the Old Testament age, we know how Christ accomplished the taking away of sins in the New Testament age
The first step for the accomplishing of expiation was to slaughter the goat of the sin offering for the people
We were born sinners, having a sinful nature inwardly and sinful deeds outwardly, and the wages of sin is death
For this reason, in the accomplishing of expiation, man was required to take the goat of the sin offering as his substitute
He did not know sin, but He was made sin on our behalf to be judged by God and thereby condemned sin in the flesh
By the lid of the Ark, with the expiating blood sprinkled on it, the entire situation of the sinner was fully covered
Since the problem between man and God was appeased, God could forgive and show mercy to man and thereby give grace to man
The priest was to bring the blood of the goat inside the veil and sprinkle it on and before the expiation cover
In the Old Testament man's sins were not taken away; they were merely covered by the blood of the sacrifices, which were types of Christ
Christ as the Lamb of God took away the sin of the world by offering Himself once for all on the cross as the sacrifice for sins
The blood of the bull and the goat was not only put on and around the horns of the altar but also sprinkled on the altar seven times
When we, as sinners, look at the blood sprinkled on the altar, we know that our sin and sins have been dealt with
The blood sprinkled on the altar was for the peace of the sinner, but the blood sprinkled on the expiation cover was for God's satisfaction
Leviticus 16:19b tells us that Aaron was to cleanse the altar and 'sanctify it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel'
Uncleannesses here refers to our sin, to our leprosy, to our rebellion, and even to the satanic nature within us
Because the people of God were in this uncleanness, even the altar used by God for the redemption of His people was contaminated
In the Old Testament the taking away of sins through the redemption of Christ, which God foreordained, was not yet accomplished
In the Old Testament the two tablets of the Testimony, the two tablets of the law, were placed in the Ark within the Holy of Holies
On this lid the expiating blood of the bulls and goats accomplished the covering of sins, not the actual taking away of sins
With the type of expiation we can see how Christ accomplished for the sinners the taking away of sins in the New Testament age
The Sabbath as the weekly season or feast signifies rest for God's redeemed people to enjoy with God and with one another
The principal denotation of all the annual seasons is for God's people to enjoy rest with God and with one another
It was not something light or common but something quite holy, sacred, and important for God's enjoyment and His people's enjoyment
A holy convocation signifies a corporate enjoyment of rest, not by individual believers separately but by the church corporately
According to their dispensational fulfillment, the first four have taken place already, and the last three will take place in the future
It signifies that the judging God has passed over us sinners who are in our sins so that we may enjoy Him as our feast for rest and for joy
The Feast of Unleavened Bread signifies Christ, who is without sin, for our enjoyment as a feast in a life apart from sin
In the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the main thing we enjoy is Christ as the unleavened bread, as our life supply without sin
You shall eat no bread or parched grain or fresh ears until that same day, until you have brought the offering of your God'
There is the sin of Ananias and Sapphira in chapter 5 and the murmuring over the distribution of food in chapter 6, for example
These loaves are the increase, the expansion, of the fine flour that came out of the firstfruits on the day of resurrection
Now we may enjoy the Pentecost Triune God, the Pentecost Christ, and the Pentecost all-inclusive Spirit as our portion
We, the Gentiles, are able to participate in the grace of Christ at the Feast of Pentecost, which was accomplished for the church
Although the second half of God's redemption will be applied to Israel, it will still be related to the church
During the twenty-six hundred years since the carrying away to Babylon, the Jews have been a people without rest
When the trumpet sounds, God will call His scattered people, who have so long been without rest, back to the land of their fathers
The sixth feast is the Feast of Expiation, the Day of Expiation, closely following Israel's repentance unto God
The Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets was on the first day of the seventh month; the Feast of Expiation was on the tenth day of that month
After the Lord Jesus descends from the air to the earth, the Jews will repent, mourn, and return to God, receiving Christ as their Savior
Spiritually this feast has been applied to the New Testament believers, and it will be applied literally to the Jews
These seven days signify that the Feast of Tabernacles is for a complete course of days, which will be a thousand years
On the fifteenth day of the seventh month when you have gathered in the produce of the land you shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days
The first is the dispensation of the fathers; the second is the dispensation of the law; and the third is the dispensation of the church
In the millennium God's redeemed people-including both the church and the kingdom of Israel-will enjoy this feast
Christ is not only full of fruit but also full of leaves, which in a particular way show the beauty of His humanity
In the millennium all the overcomers will live out the evergreen, nourishing, beautiful, and rich scenery of the humanity of Christ
We need to enjoy Him not only as our Sabbath day but also as our Sabbath year, that is, not only as our rest in part but as our rest in full
The aftergrowth of your harvest you shall not reap, and the grapes of your unpruned vine you shall not gather'
For this purpose, God commanded His blessing on the people in the sixth year so that the land would yield a sufficient crop for three years
God brought His redeemed people out of Egypt, through the wandering in the wilderness, and eventually into Canaan, the good land
God charged them saying that the land which they possessed belonged to God and was not to be sold in perpetuity
When an Israelite became poor and sold some of his possession, his nearest relative was to be his redeemer and redeem what he had sold
If he did not have someone to redeem his possession but acquired the means for its redemption, he could redeem it by himself
If a man did not have sufficient means to redeem his possession, it remained until the year of jubilee, at which time it was released to him
No one needed to spend any money to redeem his possession; everyone freely regained his possession and liberty
In the fiftieth year no one was without a piece of land and no one was in slavery; everyone had his own possession and liberty
On the Sabbath day in the synagogue at Nazareth, He read from the book of Isaiah and proclaimed the acceptable year of the Lord
The divine inheritance here is the Triune God Himself with all that He has, all that He has done, and all that He will do
The second blessing of the jubilee is that those who have sold themselves as slaves are freed from their slavery
After the fall of Adam, the whole creation was made subject to vanity and was enslaved under the law of decay and corruption
Although we have the divine Spirit as the firstfruits in our spirit, our body has not yet been saturated with the divine life
The Feast of Unleavened Bread signifies Christ, who is without sin for our enjoyment, as a feast in a life apart from sin
After the Lord Jesus descends from the air to the earth the Israelites will repent mourn and return to God receiving Christ as their Savior
In the year of jubilee, those who lost their possession returned to it, and those who were in slavery were released
Lastly, they were built up and formed into a priestly army to journey on under the leading of God and to fight for Him
The time they spent in going from Kadesh-barnea until they crossed over the brook Zered was thirty-eight years
Because of their evil deeds and unbelief, most of the children of Israel became those with whom God was not well pleased
The all-inclusive Christ, typified by the good land, is the greatest blessing which God intends to give to His elect
To inherit the promised good land, a person should love God, fear God, care for God's intention, and live in God's presence
God rejected the old generation of the children of Israel, but He promised to lead their children into the good land of Canaan
With a view toward the future, he expected that the people would know the love and government of God and their real condition
After the new generation, the second generation, of the children of Israel received this renewed training, everything was ready
They were qualified to go forward with Him to cross over the Jordan River and take the good land which typifies the rich allinclusive Christ
To take possess and enjoy the land of Canaan after entering into it the children of Israel had to fight the enemies who had usurped the land
Beginning with the city of Jericho, they fought battle after battle, city after city, until eventually they took the whole land of Canaan
Because they forsook God and His word, they turned away to burn incense to other gods and worship the works of their own hands
Of taking this as a warning to repent to God, the kingdom of Judah also did things that were evil in the sight of Jehovah
Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Chaldea, to be taken as captives to Babylon
The first return was under the leadership of Zerubbabel, a descendant of David, of the royal family; he was appointed the governor
In principle, the various things experienced by the race of Israel in its history are repeated in the church in the New Testament
In the centuries before the Reformation, there were some feeble revivals that could be considered as undercurrents of the Lord's recovery
God swore in His wrath that none of the unbelieving generation would see the good land which He had sworn to give to their fathers
They had to fight with the enemies who had usurped the land to take, possess, and enjoy the land of Canaan after entering into it
In principle, the various things experienced by the race of Israel in its history are repeated in the church in the New Testament
There are five kinds of people with special statuses in the Old Testament-priests, Nazarites, kings, prophets, and shepherds
Since a priest serves God, his main function is not to work but to draw near to God and to wait and remain in His presence
He becomes food to God and to those who are separated unto God for His service so that both God and man may be satisfied
In order to participate in the priesthood, believers must experience Christ as the offerings and offer Christ to God
Because of the rebellion of the children of Israel and their fall by worshipping the golden calf, they lost the priesthood
Not even the whole tribe of Levi was chosen by God; only those of the house of Aaron were chosen to be priests
Christ was appointed High Priest not according to the powerless letters of the law but according to the power of an indestructible life
In the New Testament Christ is the High Priest of God, and the believers are a royal priesthood engaged in serving God
Rather, they offer spiritual sacrifices, including Christ as the reality of the types of the Old Testament sacrifices
They also offer sinners who are saved by gospel preaching ; that is, they save sinners to offer them to God as sacrifices
He was always carrying out God's work, doing God's will, speaking God's word, seeking God's glory, and expressing God
He is absolutely holy in Himself; however, He still sanctified Himself in His living to set an example of sanctification for us
Through redemption and regeneration, the New Testament believers have been chosen and ordained by God to be the priests who serve Him
We still need to be a Nazarite in consecrating ourselves to God for the fulfillment of the service of the holy priesthood
As Nazarites serving God, we must deal with the rebellion in our nature and live under the Lord's headship, submitting ourselves to God
In His ascension He was made Christ , God's Anointed, to carry out God's economy and accomplish God's commission
The overcomers will be priests, drawing near to God and Christ, and kings, reigning over the nations with Christ in the millennium
Today, in a normal situation, proper believers bring others and their need before God and also minister God to others
Our God, who is a speaking God, spoke in the Old Testament to the people in many portions and in many ways through the prophets
Prophets receive God's revelation directly and are borne by the Spirit of God to speak for God and speak forth God
After the captivity of Israel because of the kings' failures, those in captivity returned through the prayer of Daniel as a prophet
When He was on earth speaking for God and teaching people, His teaching was not His own but was according to what the Father had taught Him
When we practice prophesying, ministering God and Christ to people, we build up people and give them encouragement and consolation
Among all the gifts, prophesying is the highest and most excellent because it is for the building up of the Body of Christ
Shepherds are commissioned by God to feed God's flock so that they may receive the supply of life with full enjoyment and satisfaction
He leads us to feed, look after, teach, and guide the flock of God according to God's intention and to become patterns of the flock
The believers are not only shepherded corporately in the church; they also need to be looked after individually
They will be approved by God to receive the unfading crown of glory at the manifestation of the Chief Shepherd
Nazarites are those who have voluntarily consecrated themselves who are separated from worldliness and who have submitted themselves to God
Today the proper believers also minister with Christ to bring God to men that they may have enjoyment and satisfaction
Their ministry is to speak for God, to speak forth God, to prophesy for God, and to assist the kings in establishing God's kingdom
There are three things in the book of Numbers which are rich in spiritual meaning, functioning as types and symbols
A cord of blue signifies that God wants His people to have a heavenly binding and a heavenly expression in their conduct
One day a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years came to touch the fringe of His garment with faith
Both God's ordinance and the Lord's conduct indicate that we should walk under the heavenly binding as children of God
You shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and someone shall bring it outside the camp and slaughter it in his presence'
Eventually Christ accomplished Gods redemption by being crucified outside the camp on Calvary a small mount outside the city of Jerusalem
The priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet strands, and cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer'
The running water, that is, the living water, put in the vessel, signifies the Holy Spirit in the resurrection of Christ
In the water for impurity, there is the efficacy of Christ's redemption with the washing power of the Spirit of His resurrection
The six cities were the same distance from each other for the convenience of fleeing there by anyone who killed a person unintentionally
In those days the cities of refuge were not only for the children of Israel but also for the stranger and sojourner among them
The rescued killer was to remain in the city of refuge and live in it until the death of the anointed high priest
The fringes, the water for impurity, and the cities of refuge are rich in spiritual meaning, functioning as types and symbols
The water for impurity is the water which was used to get rid of the filthiness of death with which the children of Israel were affected
The cities of refuge were for a manslayer, someone who killed a person unintentionally, to flee there to escape death
God sent fiery serpents among the people, and the people were bitten by the fiery serpents so that many of them died
It was qualified to suffer God's judgment as a replacement for the people of Israel, who had the serpentine nature
In John 3:14 the Lord said, 'As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up'
Through this God condemned sin in the flesh judged sin for us and dealt with the sin in our nature and the sinful nature to which it belongs
Our sins have been taken away, our serpentine nature has been dealt with, and Satan has been destroyed in us; thus, we have the life of God
In the same chapter Moses said that a person who committed a crime worthy of death and was hanged on a tree was accursed of God
When Christ suffered the curse of death on the cross for us sinners, who deserve death, He redeemed us out of the curse of the law
Ephesians 5:22-33 shows that the husband and the wife are a type of Christ and the church as the great mystery
With such a Christ in resurrection, we cannot but be burning in our heart and cry out, 'He is altogether desirable'!
Now we need to live with Christ and live to Christ , taking Him as our person that we may grow and become His satisfaction
At the end of this age, Christ will come to marry His bride and enjoy a married life together with His bride for eternity
When the children of Israel were bitten by the fiery serpents they became serpents in the eyes of God and deserved Gods judgment unto death
The one hanging on a tree is a type of Christ, who was hanged on the tree as the replacement for us, who have sinned and deserve death
The life of Christ in resurrection is fresh, active, lively, and powerful, and He is able to walk steadily in high places
Ephesians 5:22-33 shows that the husband and the wife are a type of Christ and the church as the great mystery
The Jordan River typifies the death and resurrection of Christ, and the crossing of the Jordan River typifies the believers' baptism
The Ark of God and the priests who bore it took the lead to go into the waters of the Jordan and stood in the waters
According to the meaning in typology, the Jordan River denotes the death of Christ into which the believers have been baptized
Romans 6:3 says, 'Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death'?
The believers' baptism into the death of Christ, as the crossing of the Jordan River, leads the believers into the resurrection of Christ
Our old man was crucified in Christ's crucifixion and buried with Him in baptism, signified by the crossing of the Jordan
When they passed through the death of the Jordan and came up out of the death river, they entered into resurrection to become a new people
Ruth 1:1-4 presents a record of Elimelech, a man from Bethlehem in Judah who went down to Moab to escape famine
Ruth became a part of Israel because she married one of Elimelech's sons and partook of her husband's inheritance
She followed her widowed mother-in-law to the land of Judah to be a citizen of Israel and to receive the God of Israel as her God
Ruth chose the goal of God and His kingdom in order to participate with God's elect in the enjoyment of Christ
If they forgot a sheaf in the field, they were not to turn back to gather it; it was for the sojourner, the orphan, and the widow
According to her motherinlaws charge and based upon the Godordained way Ruth approached Boaz who was a kinsman of her deceased husband
The crucifixion of Christ has redeemed the natural part and destroyed the fallen part, clearing away the sin of the fallen part
Ruths being united to Boaz typifies the Gentile sinners being attached to Christ so that they may partake of the inheritance of Gods promise
Ruth 2:1 says, 'Naomi had a relative of her husband's, a man of great wealth, from Elimelech's family; and his name was Boaz'
He was a relative, even a kinsman, of Ruth's father-in-law, Elimelech, and was qualified to redeem Elimelech's property
As a man rich in wealth and generous in giving, Boaz typifies the Savior Christ, who is rich in the grace of God
Eventually, she gained a redeeming husband, and she conceived and brought forth a son to bring in the royal house of David
The tabernacle as God's dwelling place on earth typifies the church; the Ark as God's testimony on earth typifies Christ
During Saul's time, the tabernacle was in Nob , and later, during the time of King David and King Solomon, it was in Gibeon
In the desolation and decline of the church, Christ has left the formal church and has been separated from it as if He has been captured
Revelation 2 and 3 show that the church became so desolate that she forsook her original condition and deviated further and further
If Christ is in a certain place today, the church must be there, and if the church is in a certain place, Christ must be there
When the church degraded and became a worldly organization, the presence of Christ was no longer in the church
At the same time, the Reformation was utilized by many earthly governments to serve their political intentions
Both the state and private churches had a name that they were living, but they were dead in the eyes of the Lord
In the beginning they had the Lord's blessing, but they were not completely delivered out of the Roman Catholic Church
Rather, they adopted the organizational way of the Roman Catholic Church to maintain the blessings which they received
After the Ark was removed from the tabernacle, it was placed in the house of Abinadab and then in the house of Obed-edom
In contrast, the presence of Christ can be touched in the homes of the saints who love the Lord with a pure heart
After the completion of the building of the temple by Solomon, the Ark was brought into the Holy of Holies in the holy temple
God revealed the pattern of the temple to David through His Spirit , just as God revealed the pattern concerning the tabernacle to Moses
Solomon built the temple according to the pattern that his father saw, and the Ark was carried into the Holy of Holies in the holy temple
The tabernacle as God's dwelling place on earth typifies the church; the Ark as God's testimony on earth typifies Christ
The Ark being separated from the tabernacle typifies that Christ has left the formal church and is separated from the church
In the beginning they had the Lord's blessing, but they were not completely delivered out of the Roman Catholic Church
Rather, they adopted the organizational way of the Roman Catholic Church in order to maintain the blessings they had received
After a time it was moved from the house of Abinadab to the house of Obed-edom, and then from the house of Obed-edom to the tent of David
After the completion of the building of the temple by Solomon, the Ark was brought into the Holy of Holies in the holy temple
His dwelling place was first the tabernacle, which was movable and temporary, and then the temple, which was fixed and permanent
The movable and temporary tabernacle followed the children of Israel into the good land and was placed in Shiloh
He was born as the youngest among his brothers and as a young boy he was assigned to tend the sheep thus he was trained by God in humility
He suffered many afflictions and was nearly driven from the good land so that he would not have any share in Jehovah's inheritance
Gods intention was for the children of Israel to take the good land and build the temple in the place where He had chosen to set up His name
God had no way to build the temple because the enemies still occupied the land and were not yet completely subdued
David bought the threshing floor of Ornan the threshing floor of Araunah from Ornan the Jebusite as the site for the building of the temple
According to the pattern shown to his father David, Solomon built the temple, which was according to God's desire for His dwelling
The building of the holy temple was for God to have a dwelling place on the earth likewise this is the purpose of the building of the church
The holy temple typifies Christ and the church because the church and Christ are one-Christ is the Head and the church is the Body
The Jews destroyed, that is, crucified on the cross, the body of Christ, which was the temple of God, but Christ raised it up in three days
Three days signifies resurrection, indicating that Christ builds up His body in resurrection to be God's dwelling place for God to dwell in
His dwelling place was first the tabernacle, which was movable and temporary, and then the temple, which was fixed and permanent
David defeated the enemies, gained the good land, and also bought the threshing floor of Ornan as the site for the building of the temple
Solomon typifies the resurrected Christ, who builds the dwelling place of God in the peace of His resurrection
The body of Christ was destroyed on the cross, and in His resurrection Christ built up this body to be God's dwelling place
The Shoot of Jehovah typifies not only Christs divinity but the sprouting and development of Christs divinity through the incarnation of God
In the development of the divinity in Christ, its sprouting is the beginning of the growth of the divinity in Christ
By passing through ascension Christ was made Lord and Christ seated on the right hand of the throne of God and crowned with glory and honor
He passed through incarnation and arrived at His resurrection out of death to enter into the glory of His divinity
In resurrection He ascended to heaven and was exalted, and through His ascension He entered into the state of reigning in the kingdom
From this stump came forth a sprout, Christ , at the time of Mary and her husband, Joseph, both of whom were descendants of David
A sprout in Hebrew denotes a small branch as a stick or a twig; hence, in Proverbs 14:3 the same word is rendered rod
In the Scriptures Christ is first likened to a tree, such as the tree of life , the true vine , and the apple tree
When Christ was born as Jesus both His mother Mary and Marys husband Joseph were people of a lowly family living in Nazareth a despised city
The root, the source, of Jesse, was God; the branch of Jesse, that is, that which was born of Jesse, was a man
Isaiah 11:10 says, 'In that day the root of Jesse, / Who stands as a banner to the peoples- / Him will the nations seek'
In Isaiah 4:2 it is used to denote Christ's humanity, and in Revelation 22:2 it is used to denote the fruit of the tree of life
He is the fruit of Mary and of David; He is God becoming man to bring God into man that we may eat of Him as the tree of life
He is ever-unchanging and ever-unfailing toward His people; He is always new and never grows old, and He never fades away
The Holy Scriptures use various plants, trees, and flowers to signify God, Christ, the church, the saints, and the world
The Shoot of Jehovah typifies Christ's divinity and the sprouting of Christ's divinity through the incarnation of God
Eventually, it will attain to the condition of the consummate glory in full in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth
Although He was born of a poor family, eventually He became the Christ, the Messiah, of God to be the King of God's elect for eternity
The two olive trees are also called the two sons of oil , and in Revelation 11 they are also called the two witnesses and the two prophets
The two olive trees symbolize Moses and Elijah, the two persons most used by God in the Old Testament to speak and testify for Him
The law of the Old Testament, which spoke and testified for God, was preached through Moses, who represents the law
Throughout the generations the law represented by Moses and the prophets represented by Elijah have been the testimony of God on the earth
Revelation 1156 speaks of two witnesses saying If anyone desires to harm them fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies
They become the storehouses of the olive oil, the sons of oil, to supply the lampstands with the oil needed for their shining
They are also called the lampstands; in the last three and a half years they will replace the churches as the lampstands for God's testimony
At that time the two witnesses will come to minister to the believers who will pass through the great tribulation
Zechariah 4:2 likens God's people, the Israelites, to the golden lampstand, which testifies for God on the earth
There is an olive tree on both the right and the left side of the lampstand to produce olive oil to supply the need of the lampstand
Moses and Elijah as representatives of the Old Testament law and prophets appeared before the Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration
As regenerated persons brought forth by the word, we are plants that have been planted and watered by gospel preachers
By enjoying Christ as our life supply and through growth and transformation, we become materials for God's building
The purpose of Christ's being the living stone is for the building up of the spiritual house of God, which is the church
These living stones are not separated or scattered and not merely piled together; rather, they are built with one another
The most important function of Christ as the rock is to be the foundation stone of God's divine building in the universe
Only such a foundation stone can enable God's building to suffer any kind of attack or opposition and not fall
The gates of Hades, Satan's power of darkness, cannot prevail against the church which is built upon this rock as the firm foundation
God's universal building is His church, the constituents of which are of different sides, including the Jews and the Gentiles
The most important function of Christ as the cornerstone of God's building is to join together the different sides of God's building
Isaiah 8:14 and 15 say that Christ will become 'a stone to strike against / And a rock of stumbling / To both houses of Israel
Before He becomes the stone to smite God's enemy for the kingdom, He first became the seed of God's kingdom to grow God's kingdom
He is also the cornerstone for joining the different sides, the different sections, of God's building, making it one Body as God's fullness
With Christ's joining, the walls of God's building become a strong support for the top covering of God's building
Christ as the topstone is for covering God's entire building to resist the forces from outside and to protect the contents of God's building
The Old Testament uses the sun, the moon, and the stars to signify the whole house of Jacob, which was chosen and redeemed by God
According to man's view, they were evil and defiled, but according to God's view, they were bright and heavenly
Among them Jacob was like the sun, his wife Rachel was like the moon, and his twelve sons were like twelve stars
God looks at them according to His eternal view and the purpose of His economy, not according to what they are and do
In this view, they are clean and bright, like the God-created heavenly luminaries, the three lights, which serve as symbols of them
Since Christ has come, the New Testament believers are living in the day, and since they are a part of Christ, they are part of the sun
The church, which is composed of all the New Testament believers, shines corporately in the day to show forth the glory of God
The woman, who is clothed with the sun, indicates also that the New Testament believers constitute the major part of God's people
The stars signify the patriarchs Gods people before the law was given shining individually in the dark night with the divine heavenly light
These individual stars are the crown on the universal woman's head, indicating that the glory of God's grace and economy should be exalted
The patriarchs were under the principle of grace, not under the law; hence, they were a crown exalted on the head of the woman
At His second coming to the earth to those who fear the Lords name Christ will appear as the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings
The magi saw His star at its rising and when they arrived in the land of Judah the star appeared to them again and led them to worship Him
The New Testament reveals that Christ, who is signified by the heavenly luminaries, the three lights, is the bright morning star
Concerning the types of Christ, the entire Bible begins with Him as the light and ends with Him as the morning star, a luminary
As the Sun of righteousness after the dawning of the day, He will appear publicly to all the people on the earth
When Peter wrote his second Epistle, the church was already in desolation and had entered into the gloom of the dark night of apostasy
Since God's redeemed people have received His perfect redemption, they belong to Christ and are of the same kind as Christ
The Lord Jesus also said that we are the light of the world, and He charged us to let our light shine over people
The Old Testament uses the sun, the moon, and the stars to signify the whole house of Jacob, which was chosen and redeemed by God
Among the redeemed, Jacob was like the sun, his wife Rachel was like the moon, and his twelve sons were like twelve stars
The New Testament uses the sun, the moon, and the stars to signify the totality of the saints of the Old Testament and the New Testament
The New Testament believers are typified as the sun, the Old Testament saints as the moon, and Old Testament patriarchs as twelve stars
The star portrays how Christ shines over the earth, which is permeated by darkness, in the age of the dark night
Since God's redeemed people have received His perfect redemption, they belong to Christ and are of the same kind as Christ
