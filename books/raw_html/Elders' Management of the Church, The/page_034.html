<P>Frequently, problems in the church come from the panicking of elders who are unstable in character. Things may not have been so serious at the beginning, but an unstable character makes things worse and rumors multiply. On the other hand, if one is stable and silent, he will see that the rumors will gradually subside. Even when a brother falls, you must not be anxious. Do not tell others right away, saying, "Brother So-and-so, who is responsible in a district, has gone to see a movie." Perhaps he just went once to see a movie, but you tell others a hundred times. This will cause a storm. There is no need for you to shout this way. You must learn to be stable, and to wait and see. When you are stable in this way, you will be led by the Lord to know how to help him. All accurate leadings, feelings, and burdens are obtained by those who are stable before God.</P><P>One of the things Satan likes the most is to see us being unstable. He likes to stir up a storm. The more you argue, the happier he is. The more you panic, the happier he becomes. The more rumors you spread, the happier he is. When one elder finds out that a brother is going to a movie, he hurries to tell another elder. This second elder reacts immediately, "Oh, how terrible! This is too bad!" The visit to the movie may not have been so bad at the beginning; what really makes it bad is a few elders helping Satan to throw in the stones. In the end, there is no more peace. Therefore, we must learn how to deal with Satan's disturbance here. No matter how many stones are thrown into this lake of mine, my lake still remains calm. No matter how much trouble you stir up, I am still stable. A thousand words cannot move me one bit. To be hardened at heart is wrong, and to be stiff-necked is also wrong, but you should learn to be stable. Without such a character, you have no backbone. When the east wind blows, you go to the west. When the west wind blows, you fall to the east. A person who does not have a backbone cannot manage the church.</P><P>I want to reaffirm to you brothers and sisters that everything can be solved if we are willing to wait a little. Time is often the salvation sent by God. Let us consider again the matter of preaching. If due to laziness we do not want to preach, that is a great loss. However, if due to our cautiousness we wait again and again before we preach, this is a great profit. It is one thing to put off preaching because of laziness; it is another thing to wait for the sake of caution. Even in visitation we cannot be too hasty. We must also wait to see if the feeling to visit changes or not. Experience tells us that if you visit in such a stable way, often you will see that such a visitation comes at the right time and has the Lord's presence within it. Therefore, we must learn not to panic or to be upset and hasty. Unless we are very sure of a matter, we must not make quick judgments. All this is part of a stable character.</P>
