<p>Concerning our focus and the direction that we should take in the future, I have a heavy feeling within that we should not spend too much time and energy on the saints in the denominations. Rather, we should spend our time and energy on the Gentiles, that is, the unbelievers and those who are not clear about salvation. There are three benefits to doing so: First, if we bring one person to salvation, there will be one more citizen in the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom. This is an increase in His kingdom and the propagation of the work of His salvation. Second, it is easier to bring an unbeliever to salvation than it is to change a Christian. Third, our purpose in coming to the United States is to maintain the Lord&rsquo;s testimony by standing on the proper ground. If we want believers to deny the ground on which they meet, we might come into conflict with other groups.</p>
<p>It is not easy to change a Christian. This can be compared to remodeling a house instead of rebuilding it. This was our experience when we began the work in Taiwan. Because of the change in the political situation in China, many Christians went to Taiwan. These Christians had no choice but to come to our meetings, because they could not find their former denominations. On the one hand, they appreciated the spiritual help that we rendered, but on the other hand, they could not change their old practices. Every day we prayed for these Christians, hoping that they would change, but they did not change. They usually argued when we spoke with them. The new ones whom we gained, however, made much progress in one year. To lead Christians yields little result with twice the effort, but to lead new believers yields much result with half the effort. Therefore, it is more prudent for us to spend our time gaining new ones.</p>
<p>The Lord called us to come to the United States for the testimony of the ground. When a Christian comes in and sees that we have no other grounds, there might be conflict. There is always this danger when we bring someone in. If his eyes are not opened, he will argue with us about the work because he has different views, and such debates do not have clear conclusions. Our desire to lead him onward will be to no avail, and our effort will be of no effect. Instead, we should focus on preaching the gospel. Of course, we will not reject the Christians who come to us. Fishing involves taking the hook. We have the testimony of the church, so whoever wants to come may come. In relation to the unbelievers, we cannot hope that those who want to come will come; rather, we need to spend time to gain and lead new ones. The more new ones we save, the stronger our testimony will be. This constant addition of new ones will prove to the Christians that our practice of the ground is right. Eventually, the Christians will have a good impression of the ground of the church. Facts speak louder than words. By such a practice, we will double the result with half the effort. Therefore, we should focus our energy on actively gaining new believers, especially the local people.</p>
<p>The United States needs the gospel. If we cannot each bring one person to salvation every year, then we at least need to bring one person to salvation every three to four years. It is not acceptable for us not to bring someone to salvation in three to four years. Our neighbors, relatives, and friends are before our eyes; they are schools of fish. The students can make friends with their classmates and invite them to listen to the gospel. Some of us have been living in the United States for many years, but we have not brought anyone to salvation. There must be something wrong. If we would bring one person to salvation every four years, we could double our number every four years. The number of saints in the United States has increased over the past few years, but this increase has been primarily among Asians instead of among the local people.</p>
<p>If we do not preach the gospel, no one will be saved. If we do not increase, within a decade there will only be old people in the church. If no children are born in a family, that family has no hope, because it is without a next generation. Furthermore, if the members in a family are all fifty or sixty years old, everyone will be grumpy and peculiar. The atmosphere will be lifeless, and there will be no appetite or interest in anything. Our salvation is to receive the Lord&rsquo;s burden to preach the gospel and save souls. When we strive together with one mind to preach the gospel and save people, praying for people and taking care of new ones, those who did not have this mind will be of one mind, and those who were dead will be living. When we spend our time and energy to preach the gospel, the church will be of one mind.</p>
<p>This is Paul&rsquo;s word in Philippians regarding the blessed situation that the church should have in the furtherance of the gospel. Paul says, &ldquo;I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you, always in my every petition on behalf of you all, making my petition with joy, for your fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun in you a good work will complete it until the day of Christ Jesus&rdquo; (1:3-6). And in verse 27 Paul says, &ldquo;Only, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether coming and seeing you or being absent, I may hear of the things concerning you, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together along with the faith of the gospel.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
