The holy anointing ointment contained not only one element; it was compounded with a number of elements. Exodus 30 says that the olive oil and the four kinds of spices added to it were mingled together and compounded to become the holy anointing ointment for the anointing of the tabernacle and all its furniture so that the tabernacle with all its furniture might become most holy, fit to be God&#8217;s dwelling place.<p>In the Bible, olive oil typifies the Spirit of God, God Himself. The four kinds of spices signify humanity in God&#8217;s creation, and oil signifies divinity in the Godhead. Four kinds of spices being mingled with the olive oil to become the holy anointing ointment indicates that the Spirit of God does not merely possess divinity but has been mingled with certain elements. Concerning this, in John 7:37-38 the Lord cried out, &#8220;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&#8221; Then verse 39 explains, &#8220;But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&#8221; At the baptism of the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit was already present (1:32), but when the Lord cried out to the people, the Spirit was not yet. In the type, the olive oil was already there, but the holy anointing ointment was not yet. It was not until the Lord Jesus was glorified in His resurrection (Luke 24:26) that the Holy Spirit became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and life-giving Jesus Christ, having both the divine element and the human element, including Christ&#8217;s divinity and humanity with all the essences and realities of His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. All these items were compounded in this Spirit. Hence, this Spirit is now the flowing, living water for us to receive.<p>Today the Spirit is the reality of all spiritual things. The reality of God is the Spirit; without the Spirit, we do not have God. The reality of resurrection is also the Spirit; without the Spirit, we do not have the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ. The Spirit was ultimately consummated by Christ through His processes. As God in eternity with divinity, Christ became a man with humanity and lived the human life on earth for thirty-three and a half years. Then He entered into death, came out of death in resurrection, and ascended to the heavens. These are the processes that He passed through. By passing through all these processes, He became the consummated life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). We may illustrate the compound Spirit with a beverage that is a compound of water with honey, lemon, tea, and salt. When we drink this beverage, we take in not only the water but also the honey, lemon, tea, and salt. Likewise, today the Spirit is the compound Spirit, compounded with the Holy Spirit of God and Christ&#8217;s two natures-the divine nature and the human nature-with His death and resurrection to be the compound, life-giving, indwelling (Rom. 8:11), sanctifying (15:16b), and transforming (2 Cor. 3:18) Spirit. Such a Spirit has the bountiful supply and even is the bountiful supply for our experience and enjoyment (Phil. 1:19). Eventually, this compound Spirit has even become the seven Spirits of God to supply us in a sevenfold intensified way that we may accomplish God&#8217;s divine economy concerning the church in this age of degradation (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6). Today the Triune God is in the church as a person, and Christ is in the believers as a person. The Triune God as a person in the church and Christ as a person in the believers are nothing less than the Spirit. Hallelujah, we have such an all-inclusive Spirit!<h2 class=head1>LIFE-THE EMPHASIS BEING THAT GOD IN CHRIST AS THE SPIRIT OF REALITY IS THE BELIEVERS&#8217; LIFE THAT THEY MAY LIVE HIM OUT AS THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>The fourth crucial element revealed in the Bible is life. Life is the Spirit, of whom we have spoken previously and who is the Triune God Himself. Furthermore, this life is also Christ. God in Christ passed through His various processes and was consummated as the Spirit. Now as the Spirit of reality (John 14:17) He is life to the believers that they may live Him out as the processed Triune God. When we believe in the Lord, this Lord in whom we believe immediately comes into us to be our life and person and to live and move with us. Once we believe in the Lord and receive Him, He also expects us to hand ourselves over to Him. Hence, as the Lord and we receive one another, He and we are mingled with one another. Before we were saved, we were alone in ourselves, but after being saved we are no longer merely ourselves but are united and mingled with the Lord as one. This may be likened to a married life. Before a person is married, he is alone, but after he is married, he is no longer one person living alone but two persons living together. However, a couple living together is an outward matter; the Lord Jesus and we live together by being united and mingled as one. Hence, this is a great mystery (Eph. 5:31-32).<h2 class=head1>LIVING, WALKING, AND BUILDING BY THE SPIRIT</h2><p>We all must clearly see these four crucial elements-the church, Christ, the Spirit, and life. The church is a group of people with the Triune God, having His life. Christ is our Savior and Redeemer, who has come into us to be our life and to be united and mingled with us. The Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God comes into us to be our reality. When we have Him, we have Christ&#8217;s divine nature and human nature, and we also have Christ&#8217;s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Such a One is now in us as our life.<p>Therefore, concerning our living today, we should be able to say as Paul said, &#8220;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God&#8221; (Gal. 2:20). The life we live today is not a life we live by our natural old man. Instead, it is a life we live by faith, a life we live by believing that the invisible Triune God is in us as our person and our life so that we may become members of the church as the Body of Christ, coordinating with all the saints on the ground of oneness as the testimony of the oneness of the Body of Christ.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
