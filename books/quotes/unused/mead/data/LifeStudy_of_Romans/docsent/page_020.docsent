   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FIVE JUSTIFICATION IN GOD S WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the section on justification, a most significant doctrine 3:21-5:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Martin Luther was raised up by God to wage a fierce battle over justification because it is such a great doctrine in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although Luther contended for the truth of justification, we have to understand how justification relates to propitiation, redemption, and reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message, we shall cover all these terms and seek to make them clear.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, we first need to consider the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I. THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD A. God in Justice and Rightness</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is the righteousness of God?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may say that the righteousness of God is what God is with respect to justice and rightness Rom 3:21-22; 1:17; 10:3; Phil 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is just and right.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whatever God is in His justice and rightness constitutes His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, all that God is in His justice and rightness is actually Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the righteousness of God is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The righteousness of God is a Person, not merely a divine attribute.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. Christ as the Righteousness of God</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>to the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many Christians say incorrectly that they have the righteousness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our righteousness is not the righteousness of Christ; it is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ Himself as a Person, not His attribute of righteousness, has been made the righteousness of God to us 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not say that the righteousness of Christ has become your righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead you should say, Christ is my righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My righteousness before God is the living Person of Christ, not an attribute.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The righteous Christ is mine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God has made Christ, who is the very embodiment of God Himself, our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>C. The Believers Made the Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>of God in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second Corinthians 5:21 says that the believers are made the righteousness of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul does not say that the believers are made righteous; he says that they are made righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have been made the righteousness of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a deep matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How can we become the righteousness of God?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By having Christ wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have seen that Christ is the embodiment of God, and that God, as a living Person, is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, righteousness, God, and Christ are one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The righteousness of God is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since this God is embodied in Christ, Christ is the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ has been wrought into us, and we have been put into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have been mingled together with Christ as one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, we become the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul declares, For to me to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As Christ has been wrought into us, we can say with Paul, For to me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose we have a glass of water.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once tea has been blended with it, it no longer is plain water; it is tea.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Likewise, once Christ has been wrought into us, we become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The righteousness of God is not only God Himself in His justice and rightness, and it is not only the living Person of Christ; it is also we who have been made one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The living Person of Christ as God s righteousness has been wrought into us, and we have been put into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, we have been made the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must proclaim, I am the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have been justified.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God is righteousness, and I am too.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am the righteousness of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I m fully justified.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God and I have been identified.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I approve God, and He approves me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We mutually approve each other.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some may think we should not say that we approve God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Nevertheless, we all must approve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God likes to be judged and approved by us Rom 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thus, we can say to God, You approve us, and we approve You.</S>
