   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Coming of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Watchman Nee acquired a clear and thorough view concerning the coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He saw that the Lord's coming Gk., parousia has a secret aspect and an open aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To the watchful ones, who have been seeking Him and awaiting His return, He will come secretly as a thief Matt 24:43; Rev 3:3 from the heavens to the air before the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But to those engrossed in the world, He will come as a flash of lightning Matt 24:27, 30 from the air to the earth after the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In His secret coming, believers will be raptured to the air; whereas, His open coming will bring judgment to the world on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>23.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Indwelling of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ is now indwelling the spirits of His people as the Spirit of life, making Christ real to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indwelling Spirit of Christ is both the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The main function of the divine Spirit is to impart the divine life into God's people, regenerating them, anointing them, sanctifying and transforming them by saturating them with the very element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Watchman Nee ministered on this matter extensively.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>24.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Teaching of the Anointing</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Along with the revelation he received concerning the Holy Spirit, Watchman Nee also received light concerning the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The anointing is the moving and working of the Holy Spirit within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The anointing teaches us everything from within 1 John 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The law of life replaces the Old Testament law, and the teaching of the anointing replaces the Old Testament prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is by the teaching of the anointing that we abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>25.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Outpouring of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Watchman Nee saw two aspects regarding the Holy Spirit: the indwelling of the Holy Spirit for life and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit for power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the day the Lord rose from the dead, He breathed into the disciples the Holy Spirit John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that time the Holy Spirit entered into the disciples and indwelt them for the purpose of imparting life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the disciples Acts 2:4, 33 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This pouring out of the Spirit was for the purpose of distributing power to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This second experience of the Spirit is what the Bible calls the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Most Christians do not see the difference between these two aspects of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Watchman Nee, however, received a clear revelation concerning this distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although he never spoke in tongues, he received repeated experiences of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
