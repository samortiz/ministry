IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS<br />
FOR THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:31, 24-25, 14-16, 32, 23a, 26, 19, 1, 39, 12, 33; 1 Pet. 4:11; John 21:15; 2 Cor. 5:14-15; 4:16; 1 John 1:7, 9; Rev. 2:7; 1 Thes. 5:17; 1 John 1:2-3, 6; Gal. 5:16; Phil. 1:19-21; Eph. 5:18; Acts 4:31; 1 Tim. 2:4; Col. 3:16; Phil. 3:8-10; Col. 1:28-29; 1 Cor. 14:26</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd" start="21">
<li>Prophesying is divine speaking, God&rsquo;s oracle:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>One who prophesies or one who is a prophet (1 Cor. 14:31, 29-30, 37) is one who receives revelations of the mysteries concerning Christ and the church (Eph. 3:5) and then speaks for God, speaks forth God, and even speaks God, dispenses God, into others, having God&rsquo;s oracle (1 Pet. 4:11).</li>
	<li>In both the Old Testament and the New Testament prophesying denotes the divine speaking, the divine oracle.</li>
	<li>Prophesying is not ordinary words spoken in a natural way but rather a speaking in the element of God&rsquo;s divinity:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To prophesy we must speak with the divine element.</li>
		<li>Without the divine element, our speaking is not prophesying; instead it is only empty talk without God&rsquo;s speaking, without reality, and without any divine revelation or ministry of Christ.</li>
		<li>The more of the divine element there is in our speaking, the more our speaking is prophesying.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To have God&rsquo;s oracle we must possess the element, essence, and substance of the Triune God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We must be filled with the Spirit.</li>
		<li>We must be soaked with the Word.</li>
		<li>We must experience the divine life.</li>
		<li>We must pray ourselves into the Spirit all the time.</li>
		<li>We must walk in the Spirit.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>All can have the oracle of God&mdash;1 Cor. 14:31; 1 Pet. 4:11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Prophesying is speaking with God&rsquo;s oracle, God&rsquo;s divine speaking.</li>
		<li>Each one must be in the Spirit, having an exercised and released spirit (1 Cor. 14:14-16, 32) &mdash;where God&rsquo;s oracle is&mdash;to afford a way for God to speak.</li>
		<li>Each one must have a clear, sober, mind (1 Cor. 14:15, 19)&mdash;to understand and remember the things revealed to us by God&mdash;to render the human cooperation to the divine oracle.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When all prophesy, having God&rsquo;s oracle, a new one in the meeting is convicted by all and judged by all, the secrets of his heart become manifest, and he worships God, reporting that God is really among the saints&mdash;1 Cor. 14:24-25.</li>
	<li>We must speak in a divine way with the divine element by the divine life.</li>
	<li>In our prophesying, the divine speaking, we minister Christ into others; we dispense the very Christ we have received, experienced, and enjoyed to others.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To prophesy in the meetings of the church, we must care for our whole being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>A presented body&mdash;to come together&mdash;1 Cor. 14:23a, 26.</li>
	<li>A sober, clear mind&mdash;to pray, sing, and speak&mdash; 1 Cor. 14:15, 19.</li>
	<li>An emotion&mdash;that desires earnestly to prophesy (1 Cor. 14:1, 39) and that is zealous to prophesy (1 Cor. 14:12).</li>
	<li>A will&mdash;that chooses to prophesy in a timely way&mdash; when to begin and when to cease&mdash;1 Cor. 14:32-33.</li>
	<li>An exercised spirit&mdash;to pray, sing, bless, and prophesy&mdash;1 Cor. 14:14-16, 31-32.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To prophesy in the meetings of the church, we must live a proper, normal Christian life:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Loving the Lord&mdash;John 21:15, 17; Rev. 2:4; Eph. 6:24.</li>
	<li>Devoting ourselves to the Lord in His love&mdash;2 Cor. 5:14-15.</li>
	<li>Being revived every morning by enjoying the Lord in the Word to have a new start each day&mdash;2 Cor. 4:16; Lam. 3:22-23; Prov. 4:18; Jer. 15:16; Psa 119:147-148.</li>
	<li>Being enlightened and thoroughly dealing with our sins by confessing&mdash;1 John 1:7, 9.</li>
	<li>Living a victorious, overcoming life daily&mdash;Rev. 2:7; Rom. 10:12b.</li>
	<li>Praying unceasingly by calling on the Lord continually&mdash;1 Thes. 5:17; 2 Tim. 2:22.</li>
	<li>Abiding in fellowship with the Lord to partake of the divine life and to walk in the divine light&mdash; 1 Cor. 1:9; 1 John 1:2-3, 6-7.</li>
	<li>Walking by and according to our spirit mingled with the Spirit&mdash;Gal. 5:16; Rom. 8:4.</li>
	<li>Living Christ for His magnification by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&mdash;Phil. 1:19-21; Gal. 2:20.</li>
	<li>Being filled with the Spirit inwardly and outwardly&mdash;Acts 13:52; Eph. 5:18; Acts 4:31, 8; 13:9.</li>
	<li>Learning and gaining a full knowledge of the truth and letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly, thus keeping a rich storage of the Lord&rsquo;s word&mdash;1 Tim. 2:4; Col. 3:16; John 15:7; 1 John 2:14.</li>
	<li>Accumulating the experiences of Christ&mdash;Phil. 3:8-10, 12-14.</li>
	<li>Speaking Christ to all kinds of people at all times&mdash;Col. 1:28-29; 2 Tim. 4:2.</li>
	<li>Functioning in all kinds of meetings in mutuality:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By praying&mdash;1 Cor. 14:14-15; Acts 2:42; 12:5, 12, 17.</li>
		<li>By speaking and singing the hymns&mdash;Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:16; 1 Cor. 14:15, 26.</li>
		<li>By teaching&mdash;1 Cor. 14:26, 6; Acts 5:42.</li>
		<li>By revelation&mdash;1 Cor. 14:26, 6.</li>
		<li>By prophesying&mdash;1 Cor. 14:5, 24, 31, 6.</li>
		<li>By knowledge&mdash;1 Cor 14:6.</li>
		<li>By exhorting&mdash;Heb. 10:25.</li>
		<li>By testifying&mdash;Acts 15:12.</li>
		<li>By preaching the gospel&mdash;Acts 5:42.</li>
		</ol></li>
