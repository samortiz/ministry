<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Example of the Rechabites</H2><P>Chapter thirty-five gives the example of the Rechabites. In the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, Jehovah asked Jeremiah to invite the house of the Rechabites to the house of Jehovah to drink wine. However, they would not drink it, because their father Jonadab the son of Rechab had commanded them not to drink wine nor to build a house, nor to sow seed, nor to plant a vineyard, but to dwell in tents all their days.</P><P>Then Jehovah sent Jeremiah to tell the inhabitants of Jerusalem that the Rechabites obeyed the command of their father, but the inhabitants of Jerusalem had not listened to Him. Therefore, Jehovah, the God of Israel, was bringing on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil which He had spoken against them. However, Jeremiah said to the Rechabites, "Because you have listened to the commandment of Jonadab your father and have kept all his commandments and have done according to all that he commanded you; therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Jonadab the son of Rechab will never lack a man to stand before Me forever" (vv. 18-19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Jehoiakim's Stubbornness<br>in Burning Jeremiah's Book of Prophecy,<br>and Jehovah's Punishment</H2><P>Chapter thirty-six continues with Jehoiakim's stubbornness in burning Jeremiah's book of prophecy, and Jehovah's punishment. In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, Jehovah asked Jeremiah to write on a scroll book all the words which He had spoken to Jeremiah concerning Israel, concerning Judah, and concerning all the nations from the day He spoke to him, from the days of Josiah even to that day. Then Jeremiah asked Baruch the son of Neriah to write from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah, which He had spoken to him, on a scroll book (vv. 1-4).</P><P>The word of Jehovah came to Baruch through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "You said, Woe is me! For Jehovah has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning and have not found rest" (45:3). Then Jehovah said further, "Behold, what I have built I am about to tear down; and what I have planted I am about to pluck up, even this whole land. And are you seeking great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for behold, I am bringing evil upon all flesh, declares Jehovah, but I will give your own life to you as spoil in all places where you may go" (vv. 4-5). Then Jeremiah commanded Baruch to read the scroll to the people in the house of Jehovah on the day of fasting and to all the people of Judah who came from their cities. Baruch did accordingly (36:6-8).</P>
