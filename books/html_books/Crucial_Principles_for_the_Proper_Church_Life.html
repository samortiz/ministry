<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages spoken by Brother Witness Lee in Washington, D. C., from August 29 through September 1, 1978. From July through September 1978 Brother Lee visited many localities in the United States and Canada, giving a series of conferences to meet a timely need in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. His two main burdens in these conferences were the believers&rsquo; personal contact with the Lord as branches abiding in the vine, and the vision and practice of the proper church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CONTACTING THE LORD THROUGH THE WORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 15:7-8; 17:17; 6:63; 2 Tim. 3:16-17; Eph. 5:26</h1>
<h2 class="head1">ABIDING IN THE VINE</h2>
<p>In John 15 the Lord says that He is the true vine and that we believers are the branches. He goes on to say that we need to abide in Him that He may abide in us (vv. 1-5). As branches in the vine, we live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ. This is the Christian life. Therefore, we need to see the way to abide in the Lord. The word <em>abide</em> may seem to be an ordinary word, but it indicates something crucial for our Christian life. If a branch is separated from the vine, the branch is finished. A branch must never leave the vine. The crucial point of our Christian life is to abide in the vine. To abide in the vine means to be one with the vine. The vine and the branches are one, yet there is always the possibility, the danger, that a branch would be detached from the vine. For this reason the Lord stresses that we need to abide in Him.</p>
<p>Abiding in the vine is easy to understand logically, but learning how to practically experience this abiding has always been a problem to Christians. This is still a problem to us today. The picture of a vine and its branches is simple for us to comprehend, but we may not understand what it actually and practically means in our daily life for Christ to be the vine to us and for us to be His branches. We may know in doctrine that He is the vine and that we are the branches, but we may not be able to say that we have the real experience of being a branch in the vine in our daily life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Need for Personal, Private, Direct Contact<br />
with the Lord</h2>
<p>If I were to ask the saints whether they experience being a branch in the vine, I am concerned that many would answer, &ldquo;No, I do not experience being a branch in the vine; I do not experience being one with the Lord. I know this doctrine, but in practice I rarely experience this.&rdquo; Therefore, I am very burdened for all the saints. We have come into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and we come together to meet as the church quite often. Besides this, we have other times in which we come together in small groups to fellowship, pray, or have morning watch. However, I have become concerned that many saints do not have a practical daily experience of Christ. In other words, many do not have enough personal contact with the Lord. What we experience on the corporate side is probably sufficient, but on the private side we are lacking. We do not have adequate personal, private contact with the Lord.</p>
<p>We each need to consider whether we spend even ten or fifteen minutes each day to be with the Lord privately. Many of us do not spend even a short time with the Lord. Recently, I have discovered that many saints only come to the meetings and have fellowship with other saints but do not have a personal, private, direct contact with the Lord. This is a great lack. If this is our case, it is truly difficult for us to practically abide in the Lord. Coming to the meetings surely helps us with some things, but according to my experience, coming to the meetings does not help us to contact the Lord directly that we may actually abide in the Lord. To abide in the Lord in a practical way requires a personal, private, direct contact with the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Abiding in the Vine Being to Be<br />
One Spirit with the Lord</h2>
<p>The Lord is mysterious and abstract. When I was a young boy, I was told that the Lord was the vine and that I was one of His branches. Since my home was near a vineyard, I knew what a vine was, but because I could not physically see or touch the Lord, I wondered how He could be a vine and I, His branch. Christ is the vine, and we are the branches. However, because we cannot see Him or touch Him, this is an altogether mysterious spiritual fact.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:17 says that the Lord is the Spirit, and 1 Corinthians 15:45b reveals that He is the life-giving Spirit. Moreover, we have a human spirit that has been regenerated by the Holy Spirit and is indwelt by Christ, the life-giving Spirit (John 3:5-6; Rom. 8:9-11, 16; 2 Tim. 4:22). Therefore, our union with the Lord as branches in the vine is altogether a matter in our spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; The spirit mentioned in this verse is simply the vine with all the branches mentioned in John 15. The Lord, who is the vine, is the life-giving Spirit, and we, who are His branches, have a human spirit. Thus, we are joined to the Lord to be one spirit with Him. The union of the branches with the vine is in the mingled spirit. The vine is a composition of spirits&mdash;the divine Spirit and the human spirit composing one spirit. The spirit mentioned in 1 Corinthians 6:17 is not a small, private, individual spirit; it is a great spirit that is composed of the Lord Jesus and all His believers. Christ and the believers are therefore not a physical vine that can be seen and touched but a spiritual vine. The vine and the branches are one spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">The Problem of Being Close to<br />
but Not Contacting the Lord</h2>
<p>Although 1 Corinthians 6:17 says that we are one spirit with the Lord, in our daily experience we are often not one with the Lord. Rather, the Lord is the Lord, and we are we. Therefore, we need to contact the Lord. In order to contact the Lord, we need to eliminate any kind of insulation. Electricity is a good illustration of the Lord Jesus. As the life-giving Spirit, He is real, living, and powerful. Although electricity is powerful, if we do not contact electricity, we will have no sensation that it is powerful. Electricity is not visible in a wire, yet it is real and powerful. However, to separate something from electricity does not require a large amount of insulation. Only a little insulation will stop the flow of electricity. Similarly, the power of the church, Christ as the life-giving Spirit, is always available within our spirit, but most believers are detached from this divine electricity. We do not need to be miles away from the Lord to be detached from Him. Many believers are very close to the Lord yet are not attached to Him. We may say, &ldquo;I am not far away from the Lord; I am quite close to Him. Five years ago I was far away, but the Lord has gradually brought me back. Now I am very close to Him.&rdquo; Regardless of how close to or far from the Lord we are, if we are not contacting Him, it is essentially the same.</p>
<p>A few saints may be very far from the Lord, but most are not far from Him. We may come to all the meetings and be very close to the Lord yet still be detached. However, we should not be discouraged. Some may hear this word and say, &ldquo;If this is the case, I do not need to come to the meetings. Even if I come to the meetings, I am still detached.&rdquo; Actually, being close to the Lord by being in the meetings does make some difference. It is very difficult for those who are far away from the Lord to contact Him. However, if we are close to the Lord by being in a meeting, perhaps we will contact Him after hearing only a few words in the meeting. Hence, to be close is much better than to be far away. Nevertheless, we need to be not merely close to the Lord but actually attached to Him. We need to have a direct contact with the Lord, just as an electrical appliance must have direct contact with electricity. There may be a strong current of electricity in a wire, but if there is no contact, no attachment, the appliance will never receive the supply of electricity.</p>
<p>Our contact with and attachment to the Lord is the abiding of the branches in the vine mentioned in John 15. The Lord said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you&rdquo; (v. 4). This indicates that if we abide in the Lord, He will abide in us. Our abiding in Him is a term, a condition, of His abiding in us. Once again, we can use the illustration of electricity. If an appliance is attached to an electrical outlet, the electricity will come into it and supply it with the power it needs to function properly. If the appliance abides in the electricity, the electricity abides in it. Likewise, if we abide in the Lord, the Lord abides in us and supplies us so that we may function spiritually.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO ABIDE IN THE LORD</h2>
<p>We still need to see the way to abide in the Lord. The Lord is real and living, yet He is mysterious, abstract, invisible, and untouchable in a physical sense. For many years I wondered how we can abide in such a mysterious, abstract, invisible, and untouchable One. It is easy to abide in a house. We only need to walk into a house and remain there in order to abide in it. Because the house is physical, we can easily see it, touch it, enter into it, and abide in it. The Lord, however, is not like a physical house. How can we abide in such a One?</p>
<h2 class="head2">Abiding in the Lord through the Word</h2>
<p>According to our experience and the experience of many others, in order to abide in the Lord, we must rely on the word of the Bible. In John 15:7 the Lord said, &ldquo;If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will.&rdquo; Comparing this verse with verses 4 and 5 reveals that the Lord&rsquo;s words are equivalent to the Lord Himself. Our words represent us. If people reject our words, they reject us. Others accept us by receiving our words. When we say that someone has rejected us, we often mean that someone has rejected our words (cf. John 12:48; 2 Tim. 1:15). This shows that our words are us. The Lord&rsquo;s words are the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that Christ is the embodiment of God. Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; God is mysterious, yet all His fullness is embodied in Christ. Christ also is mysterious, but the mysterious Christ is embodied in the word (John 6:63; 1 Cor. 15:45b). The word is not mysterious or abstract. The word, which is solid and concrete, is the embodiment of the mysterious and abstract Christ. Through the word Christ has been made solid and tangible. We Christians should daily handle the word as the solid embodiment of the abstract Christ. Our contacting the Lord in order to abide in Him depends upon our handling of His word.</p><h2 class="head2">Learning How to Handle the Word<br />
in a Proper Way</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s living and solid word is contained in the Bible as the written word of God. We all need to learn how to handle this written word. We should not read the Bible as we would read a newspaper. The Bible is not merely a piece of literature; it is the word of God, which is the very embodiment of the mysterious and abstract Christ. Hence, the Bible is altogether different from other written materials.</p>
<p>That the Bible is a unique book is proven by the fact that anytime we come to the Bible with a seeking heart, we immediately have the sensation that we are in the presence of God. Perhaps before we even open the Bible or read from it, as soon as we pick it up, we have the sensation that we have come into the presence of God. We cannot experience the same thing by picking up a secular magazine, even if we say, &ldquo;Lord, I am coming into Your presence.&rdquo; The sensation we have of the Lord&rsquo;s presence when we come to the Bible is not a psychological matter or something superstitious. When we come to the Bible, our psychology is involved in receiving the sensation that we are in the presence of the Lord, but this sensation is based on the fact that we are indeed in His presence. When we read a magazine, however, even if we exercise our psychology to try to produce the same sensation, we will not be able to do it. Actually, the more we try this, the less we will have God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Bible Being God&rsquo;s Breathing</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 3:16a says, &ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed.&rdquo; The word of the Bible is God&rsquo;s breath and even God&rsquo;s breathing. This is a great matter. Whenever we come to the Bible, we come under God&rsquo;s breathing. Although we may never have realized this, we have probably experienced it many times. When we come to the Bible, we often receive inspiration. This inspiration is God&rsquo;s breathing. If we come to a table or a blackboard, we could never receive inspiration through these objects. However, when we come to the Bible, we are filled with inspiration. We receive inspiration when we come to the Bible because the Bible contains God&rsquo;s breath.</p>
<p>I have been coming to the Bible for over fifty years. Since the day I was saved, this book has never left me. Whenever I come to the Bible, I am immediately under God&rsquo;s inspiration. This inspiration always enlightens me and supplies me. It often rebukes me, corrects me, adjusts me, and shows me all my wrongdoings. The word of the Bible is living. Many of us can testify that when we come to the Bible, even before we open it, we are inwardly rebuked. We may suddenly realize, &ldquo;Last night I was too strong with my wife. I insisted that I was right and that she was wrong. I told her that even with the help of a group of angels she could never subdue me. However, this morning I came to the Bible, and after simply picking it up, the light shined within me and exposed my shortcoming. There was no need for a group of angels to come&mdash;merely a little breathing subdued me. O Lord, forgive me for my behavior last night.&rdquo; Many of us have had this kind of experience. This proves that the Bible is not an ordinary, common book but something divine.</p>
<p>We can all testify that the Bible is truly God&rsquo;s breathing. It is not only the breath of God objectively; it is actually God&rsquo;s breathing subjectively. Whenever we come to the Bible, we receive the breath of God. If we do not come to the Bible during the week and only pick it up on Lord&rsquo;s Day morning before we come to the meeting, there will be no way for us to abide in the Lord. To pick up the Bible is one thing, but to come to the Bible is another thing.</p>
<p>In order to abide in the Lord, we need to come to the Word time after time, day after day. This is not a superstition; it is a spiritual fact. The Bible is the word of God, and the word of God is God&rsquo;s breathing. The way to contact the Lord is through His word. Someone may ask, &ldquo;Where is God today that I may touch Him?&rdquo; We should answer, &ldquo;He is embodied in the words of the Bible, and the Bible is His breathing. In order to contact God, simply come to the Bible.&rdquo; According to my experience of many years, there is no better way to contact the Lord.</p>
<p>Some Christians say that we should be silent in the morning. They say that being silent is the best way to contact the Lord. I was taught this as a young believer, and I tried to practice this. However, I found it difficult to be silent. Moreover, when I was silent, many evil thoughts came into my mind. Others told me, &ldquo;You need to learn to calm yourself down and reject all the evil thoughts.&rdquo; I tried many times, but I never succeeded. Being silent is not the way. The way is to come to the Word. When we come to the Bible and read it, the word of God repels all the evil thoughts and chases away all the demons. This is a fact that we can all testify of. We do not need to exercise to be silent. Rather, we simply need to come to the Word. When we touch the Lord&rsquo;s word, we contact the Lord Himself. When we take in the Lord&rsquo;s word, the word abides in us, and this abiding word is the Lord Himself.</p><h2 class="head2">The Word Without and the Spirit Within</h2>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (John 6:63). In our experience the word and the Spirit are not two but one. The written word is outside of us, but when the word is spoken into us by the Lord, it immediately becomes the Spirit within us. When the Spirit is spoken out from within us, He once again becomes the word. When we read the words of the Bible, they are words on a printed page, but when we take them in, they become spirit. We may rise early in the morning to pray-read a few verses. Before we pray-read the verses, they are words, but when we take them in, the rest of the day they are in us as the Spirit. It is in this way that we can abide in the Lord and He can abide in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPENDING TIME IN THE WORD<br />
BEING A NECESSITY OF LIFE</h2>
<p>I am burdened to encourage all the saints to spend time in the Word every day. Many saints may say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, all that you say is right, but we just cannot find time to spend in the Word every day. Even once a week is not easy. We must either go to work early or stay home to take care of the children. We have so many other things to do. It is too difficult to spend time in the Word every day.&rdquo; On one hand, I agree that our busy schedules make it difficult to spend time in the Word daily; on the other hand, I do not sympathize with those who have this complaint. Actually, it is not difficult if we have the proper realization. I have never heard of someone who could not find time to eat every day. No one has ever told me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I have been so busy that I could not eat once this week.&rdquo; Even the busiest people still keep one practice&mdash;eating every day. I do not believe that in the entire history of mankind there has ever been one person who could not find the time to eat. Everyone finds time to eat because he realizes that eating is a necessity of life. In a sense, we are threatened to eat, for we know that if we do not eat, we will die. In like manner, finding time to spend in the Word depends on our realization of its importance.</p>
<p>Many saints today are spiritually sick and dying because they do not spend adequate time in the Word each day to contact the Lord. If we realize that touching the Word of God is a necessity of life, our concept will be changed. Many young people today are late risers and do not have time for a good breakfast. They have time only for a cup of coffee and half a donut. This kind of breakfast is not good for their health, but it is better than nothing. Despite having little time, they still eat something in the morning. It is different with me. Breakfast is the most important meal to me. I always eat a large, rich, nourishing breakfast, which is why I am still strong and energetic at my age. Of course, it is the Lord&rsquo;s mercy that I am healthy. However, even if the Lord has great mercy upon us, if we do not eat, we are rejecting the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and committing gradual suicide.</p>
<p>We all need to spend at least ten minutes in the Word every morning. Everyone can do this. We can all spare ten minutes, regardless of how busy or tired we are. Setting aside ten minutes will make no difference in how busy or tired we are, but spending ten minutes in the Word will make a great difference in our spiritual life. To find this time, we need only to rise ten minutes earlier in the morning. We need to practice to build up this healthy habit. We should consecrate ourselves to spend ten minutes in the Word before leaving for work or beginning the day&rsquo;s activities. If possible, we should set aside another five minutes to pray, to mingle what we have read in the Word with prayer. We need to build up a habit of pray-reading. We should read only a few verses. Recently, because of the time constraints of traveling and visiting the churches, I have not had a long time in the mornings to spend in the Word. Nevertheless, I have always had time to read and pray-read at least two or three verses. If every morning we spend ten minutes reading the Word and five minutes pray-reading to contact the Lord in the Word, we will see a difference in our spiritual life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Spending Time in the Word Being<br />
to Honor the Lord and Bringing Us Blessing</h2>
<p>Spending time in the Word in the morning is the greatest honor we can give to the Lord. Every day before doing anything else, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, I come to You. I give You the honor.&rdquo; In this way we respect Him. If we are faithful to practice this, we will surely receive much blessing, not only blessing on our physical life but also blessing in our spiritual life. Spending time in the Word in the morning will also bring blessing to our environment. If we contact the Lord in His word before we go to work, our attitude will change, which will change our environment. Thus, the blessing will come even to our environment. Suppose we do not contact the Lord before we go to the office; rather, we simply go by ourselves in a poor way. When we arrive at the office, we may quickly become angry with someone. To be angry in business is a great loss; it ruins the environment, and because we become angry, we may eventually damage our health. However, if we spend ten minutes with the Lord before going to the office, we will not easily become angry. Something within us will sustain us, keeping us in the joy of the Lord.</p>
<p>Being angry in anything always causes a loss, and being happy always brings in a great blessing. We need to learn this secret. In ourselves we cannot be happy all the time, but it is easy for us to be angry. Without the Lord&rsquo;s presence we may be angry with everyone. Our dishes and eating utensils have never offended us, but when we lose our temper, we may throw them against the wall. Furthermore, our anger may cause us to become foolish. However, when we have the joy of the Lord, we will be the wisest persons. When we have the joy of the Lord, everything is lovable. We can thus see the positive effect of spending time in the Word every morning before doing anything else. We need to build up this good habit.</p><h2 class="head2">Spending Time in the Word<br />
Not Being a Legality</h2>
<p>Some may say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, this is too legal. Spending time in the Word every day is a legality.&rdquo; It seems that the word <em>legal</em> is not good and that legalities should be terminated. However, in a certain sense, if there is no legality, there can be no life. If we consider carefully, we will see that four legalities are needed for our physical life&mdash;eating, drinking, breathing, and sleeping. These legalities are actually necessities of life. If we do not eat, drink, breathe, and sleep, we will not live long. No one would say, &ldquo;Eating, drinking, breathing, and sleeping are too legal. I want to be liberated from the bondage of these legalities.&rdquo; If we are liberated from the &ldquo;legality&rdquo; of breathing for only five minutes, we will die. We should not be liberated from these legalities. We need to keep these legalities.</p>
<p>We need to change our concepts regarding spending time with the Lord in the Word every morning. First, we need to see that it is possible for everyone to set aside the time in the morning to come to the Word. Where there is a will, there is a way. Second, we should not consider this a legality. Reading the Bible is not a legality; it is a necessity of life. However, in a sense, it may be good to apply the word <em>legality</em> to this matter. We need to be bound by the practice of daily spending time in the Word. We should take this bondage as a necessity. Apart from the Word there is no way for us to receive life, light, strength, or power from the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Spending Time in the Word Being<br />
Likened to Meeting Our Physical Needs</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Breathing</h2>
<p>To spend time in the Word is to enter into God&rsquo;s breathing. More than anything else, we surely need God&rsquo;s breathing. Whether or not we fully understand the words of the Bible, as long as we read them with a sincere heart and an open spirit, we will enjoy God&rsquo;s breathing. Many people walk outside in the morning to be in the fresh air. We do not need to understand the air in order to breathe it in and be refreshed by it. Likewise, we all need to be refreshed each morning by enjoying God&rsquo;s breathing.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Washing</h2>
<p>Many of us do not have a good memory. We may forget the first verse we read while we are reading the second. Then if we read a third verse, the second may be gone. Many saints are faithful to try to memorize the verses as they read them, but we do not need to do this. Trying to remember every verse will prevent us from having the proper Bible reading. When we come to the Word, we should not worry about memorizing. If we can remember what we read, this is good. If we cannot remember what we read, this is all right also. Forcing ourselves to memorize as we read will deaden our Bible reading.</p>
<p>Forty years ago in Shanghai, a sister inquired of Brother Watchman Nee, &ldquo;Brother Nee, I have a poor memory. I immediately forget whatever I read from the Bible. It seems to me that I do not need to read the Bible, because the words of the Bible just come and go. Is it not a waste of time for me to read the Bible?&rdquo; Brother Nee gave this sister a very good answer. He described how the women in southern China wash their rice by placing it in a basket made of willow branches, which serves as a strainer. They repeatedly dip the basket into the water and pull it out, and the water immediately flows out. Thus, the water comes and goes, but no water remains in the basket. No one would say that this method does not work because no water remains. Actually, because all the water comes and goes, all the dirt is washed away. Not only is the rice washed, but the basket is cleansed as well. Brother Nee shared that we are like these baskets, and the word of God is like the water. We cannot retain every verse in our memory, but we nevertheless receive a great benefit from reading the Word and being cleansed by the water in the word (Eph. 5:26).</p>
<p>This fellowship from Brother Nee has been a great help to me, and I can testify from my experience that it is true. If we do not come to the Word of God for one week, our thinking, our will, and our emotion will be very dirty spiritually. However, if we read the Bible day by day, even if we have no intention to be cleansed, the word will spontaneously pass through our mind, our emotion, and our will to cleanse all our inward parts. As the water of the word comes and goes, we will be cleansed. We can never exhaust the benefits we receive from reading the Word.</p><h2 class="head3">Eating</h2>
<p>Reading the Word of God is a necessity of life. We have two lives, the physical life and the spiritual life, and we must take care of both. If we do not take care of the physical life, we will be weak and dying physically. In the same principle, if we do not care for our spiritual life, we will be weak and dying spiritually. We need to realize that reading the Bible is not something religious or legal; rather, it is a necessity of life. In order for us to maintain these two lives, we must eat both kinds of food&mdash;physical and spiritual. We also must breathe both physically and spiritually. Furthermore, we need both physical and spiritual washing. We all wash physically at least once a day, but some people wash three or four times a day. Likewise, every day we need to wash ourselves spiritually in the morning by contacting the living word. This is a life necessity.</p>
<p>Healthy people eat not only breakfast but also lunch and dinner. Some, like the British, also take afternoon tea, and others, such as the Cantonese, take a night snack. This makes them healthy. If we eat properly, we will be healthy. The principle is exactly the same with the spiritual life. We should build up a habit of spending time in the Word at least three times a day. We can take a small New Testament to school or work and spend ten minutes reading one chapter during our lunch break rather than wasting our time gossiping. In the morning we need to come to the Bible to be nourished by pray-reading three or four verses. At lunchtime we may not pray-read but may come to the Bible to read a chapter. We can set aside another time in the evening after work to read a few chapters of the Old Testament. This is easy to do.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Redeeming the Time to Read the Bible</h2>
<p>Spending time in the Word of God is always profitable. It is an excellent habit. This habit keeps us in the Lord&rsquo;s presence and saves us from wasting our time. Some sisters may think that they are too busy taking care of their husbands and children to spend time with the Lord in the Word every day. Although it seems that they have no time to pray or read the Bible, when they are talking on the phone, it seems that they have all the time in the world. Therefore, saying that we do not have time to pray or read the Bible is only an excuse. Many of our phone calls may not be necessary. If we redeem the time by reading the Word, we will grow and be healthy in the spiritual life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Taking Care of the Principles of Life<br />
Rather Than Being Superstitious</h2>
<p>If I do not eat, drink, breathe, sleep, or exercise, yet I believe that the Lord will have mercy on me to cause me to be healthy and live a long life, I am being superstitious. Likewise, if we think that we can neglect spending time in the Word and simply depend on the mercy of the Lord for the church to be healthy, rich, and living, we are being superstitious, because we are not fulfilling the principles of life. We should trust in the Lord, yet we need to fulfill the principles that He has ordained for life. Eating, drinking, breathing, sleeping, and exercising are principles ordained by God. Therefore, in order to be healthy, we surely need to keep these principles. Reading the Word, praying to the Lord, and contacting the Lord to deal with Him are divinely ordained principles that we need to observe. If we do not, we can never be healthy in the spiritual life.</p>
<p>We need to take time to read and pray-read the Word every day. Of course, we can be flexible about the exact times, but it is good to pray-read a few verses in the morning, read a chapter of the New Testament at lunchtime, and read a few chapters from the Old Testament in the evening. If we are faithful to practice this, we will grow spiritually and be fully and thoroughly revived. If all the saints do this, the whole church will be revived, and the meetings will be enriched and enriching. This is not a way of excitement or stirring up; it is the way of life. We should make a vow to the Lord to daily contact Him through His word. If we build up such a habit, it will be a real glory to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: What is the best way to spend time in the Word in the morning?</em></p>
<p>Answer: From our experience we have learned that there are two profitable ways of handling the Bible&mdash;the way of being nourished and the way of reading. The way of being nourished is to spend at least ten minutes to pray-read a few verses. We can first read not more than ten verses and then pray every word of each verse to digest them. We will be enlightened and can pray according to the enlightenment we receive. This is to mingle our reading of the Word with our praying, and it is truly nourishing. If possible, it is better to do this in the morning before doing anything else. Of course, we can be flexible about this. For instance, it may be difficult for someone who works a night shift to do this. In any case, the principle is to begin our day by being nourished through pray-reading the Word. To come to the Bible in the way of reading is to read a few chapters. If we have set aside thirty minutes to come to the Word in the morning, we can spend the first ten to fifteen minutes to be nourished and then spend the remaining time to read a few chapters. We could also divide our time into two or three sections in which we first pray-read and then read. The principle is first to be nourished and then to read.</p>
<p>To come to the Word for nourishment, we should not randomly select verses to pray-read. After selecting a book of the Bible through the Lord&rsquo;s leading, we should pray-read from the first verse to the last consecutively. Our reading should also be consecutive. We need to read one chapter in the New Testament each day beginning from Matthew 1 until we finish the last chapter of Revelation. Then we should begin again from Matthew 1. Likewise, in the Old Testament we should begin reading from Genesis 1 until we finish the last chapter of Malachi. Consecutive reading is the most balanced and safest way to read the Bible.</p>
<p><em>Question: Is there another way to come to the Bible besides the way of being nourished and the way of reading?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Everyone needs to read and pray over at least a few verses every morning and then read a few chapters later in the day. Our time in the Word in the morning should be in the way of being nourished, and our time later in the day should be in the way of reading. These are the common ways of reading the Bible, which all believers should practice. Besides these two ways, some saints should also take a third way, the way of studying. This way is to study a particular book of the Bible. In order to study the Bible, we first need to ask the Lord what book we should study. If the Lord tells us that we need to study Romans, we should study Romans in a thorough way. We should first study every word according to the Greek text with the help of concordances and lexicons. After we study Romans in this way, we should expound each verse. By expounding each verse we will get into the depths of the Bible. After we finish studying a book by finding the meanings of each word and expounding each verse, we should study the entire book according to some of its main topics. For instance, sin and sins are two topics that we could study in Romans. Then we could study righteousness and justification. Other topics include being in Christ, being in the spirit, being in the flesh, and our old man. If we study Romans according to forty or fifty topics, it will become transparent to us. We can also use the Life-study messages in our study of the Word.</p>
<p><em>Question: You have previously shared concerning our need to have a time with the Lord in which we are open to be enlightened by the Lord concerning our condition. How is that word related to our contacting the Lord through the Word?</em></p>
<p>Answer: When we contact the Word either to be nourished or to read, we will spontaneously be enlightened. Through our reading of the Word, our condition will be exposed in the light of the Lord. If we only pray for the Lord to shine on us but do not come to the Word, it will be difficult for us to be enlightened concerning our condition. Without the Word there is no instrument, no means, that the Lord can use to enlighten our situation. Many saints are daily enlightened and have their true situation and condition exposed in the light of God through their reading of the Bible.</p>
<p><em>Question: When I feel that I am aware of my condition, I sometimes try to find a portion in the Bible for my reading that relates to my condition. However, you have shared that we should read through the Bible consecutively. As we are reading consecutively, will the Lord shine on our condition regardless of the portion that we are reading?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Sometimes light comes when we are reading, and sometimes light does not come. However, light may come through a portion of the Word days, weeks, or even years after we read it. This is up to the Lord, but we need to be faithful to accumulate, to store up, the Lord&rsquo;s word in our being.</p>
<p><em>Question: Does the time we have with the Lord in reading the Word need to be individual?</em></p>
<p>Answer: To have a corporate time of reading the Word, such as in a corporate morning watch, is beneficial. However, having a private, personal contact with the Lord by reading the Word is more important. Neither one of these two aspects can replace the other. We need both the private aspect and the corporate aspect of contacting the Lord through the Word. According to God&rsquo;s ordained principle, nearly everything has two aspects. This principle is even visible in our physical bodies&mdash;we have two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, two arms, and two legs. We need the corporate contact with the Lord, and we also need the private contact. However, if we cannot have both, it is better to have the private contact.</p>
<p><em>Question: What does it mean that spending time with the Lord in the morning is the greatest honor we can give to Him? Also, because I was recently saved out of the world, I do not know how to pray. What should I do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Going to the Lord first thing every morning is a great honor to Him. We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, before I do anything, I come to contact You.&rdquo; Even to utter only a few sentences of prayer in the morning is very pleasant to Him. We do not need to know a particular way to pray, because we can simply pray-read the Word. It is best to use the same book of the Bible every day until we pray-read from the first verse until the last. Every morning we can come to the Lord by pray-reading three to five consecutive verses. This may be a little awkward at first for new believers, but they will gradually learn by doing. If we honor the Lord in this way, we will surely receive a reward.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PROPER CHURCH LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:12, 15-19, 27; 2:2b, 6-7, 9, 16-17; 3:4, 10-11; 1 Cor. 12:12-13; Phil. 1:21</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING CHRIST</h2>
<p>In this chapter I am burdened that we would see the truth of what the church is. We may know that the church is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23a), the fullness of the One who fills all in all (v. 23b), the mystery of Christ (3:4-6), the household of God (2:19), the one new man (v. 15), the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 1:2), and the kingdom of God (Matt. 16:18-19; Rom. 14:17). These are all wonderful definitions of the church, but we need to see that the basic factor of the church is simply Christ. The church is Christ. If the church were not Christ, the church could not be the Body of Christ. Neither could it be the fullness of the One who fills all in all, the mystery of Christ, the household of God, the new man, the testimony of Jesus, or the kingdom of God. All the items of what the church is depend on one basic factor, that is, that the church is Christ Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Head and the Body Being One Person</h2>
<p>The head and the body of a human being constitute one person. It is illogical to say that a person consists of only his head and not his body. A complete person includes both the head and the body. However, although many Christians know that the church is the Body of Christ, they do not realize that the church is Christ. They hold the illogical concept that the church is the Body of Christ but that it is not Christ. We would never say that our body is not us. It would be ridiculous to point to someone&rsquo;s body and say, &ldquo;This is not So-and-so; this is only his body.&rdquo; Nevertheless, many Christians unconsciously hold this kind of concept concerning the church as the Body of Christ, thinking that the Body is different from Christ Himself. Perhaps even some of us have thought, &ldquo;To say that the church is the Body of Christ is right, but to say that the church is Christ may be heretical.&rdquo; However, this thought is illogical because the fact that the church is the Body of Christ inherently implies that the church is Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Vine and the Branches Being One Vine</h2>
<p>The church is Christ because the church is one with Christ. In the preceding chapter we saw that Christ is the vine and that we are the branches. The vine and the branches are one, for the vine includes the branches. Unlike a pine tree, which has a great trunk that shoots up and relatively short branches, a vine does not shoot up but spreads out, having a small trunk and many long branches. A complete vine includes not only the trunk but also all the branches. To say that the church is not Christ is like saying that the branches are not the vine. Therefore, we should not say, &ldquo;We are merely the branches of the vine, but we are not the vine.&rdquo; Although we may not say this, this erroneous concept may still be deep within us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Being One Spirit with the Lord</h2>
<p>As we pointed out in the preceding chapter, we are one spirit with the Lord. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; The spirit mentioned in this verse is a mingled spirit, a compound spirit, including not only the divine Spirit but also our human spirit. This spirit is not an individual spirit but a corporate spirit, including Christ and all of us. Because we and Christ are one spirit, it is not wrong to say that we are Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Living Christ Indicating That We Are Christ</h2>
<p>The apostle Paul said, &ldquo;For to me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21). If we were to compose this word today, we would probably say, &ldquo;For to me, to live is a branch of Christ.&rdquo; We would compose this very carefully because if we wrote what Paul wrote, we might be condemned for being too bold or even for blaspheming. Paul could say this because he was a branch of Christ, and a branch of a vine is a part of the vine. It is not something other than the vine itself. We too are branches of Christ, the true vine, and as branches of Christ we too are Christ.</p>
<p>Some may argue with me, saying, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you are too frank. You should not say that you are Christ. You must speak more carefully. You should say only that you are a part of Christ.&rdquo; My answer to such persons is that a part of Christ is Christ; thus, anyone who is a part of Christ is Christ. Every part of my physical body is me. If my finger could speak, it would not need to be careful and cautious, saying, &ldquo;I am not Witness Lee; I am only a part of Witness Lee.&rdquo; If my finger and every other part of my body said this, there would be no Witness Lee but only parts of Witness Lee. Even my head would not be me but would be only a part of me. This again shows that we may not accurately know the truth concerning the church. We need to see that the church is simply Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">The Body Being Christ</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 12:12 says, &ldquo;Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&rdquo; According to our concept, after this verse begins by describing the physical body with its many members, we would expect the verse to conclude by saying, &ldquo;So also is the Body of Christ.&rdquo; Instead, it says, &ldquo;So also is the Christ.&rdquo; This is strong proof that the church is Christ. We say that the church is the Body of Christ, but here the Word says that the Body is Christ. Hence, the church being Christ is not my teaching but the clear teaching of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The New &ldquo;I&rdquo; and Every Member<br />
in the New Man Being Christ</h2>
<p>Today we are the church, but before we were regenerated, we were not the church. We became the church after being regenerated because in regeneration Christ came into us, and in baptism our original old man was crucified and buried with Christ. Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; Now we are not the original old &ldquo;I&rdquo; but the present new &ldquo;I.&rdquo; The old &ldquo;I&rdquo; has been buried, and the new &ldquo;I&rdquo; is here. The old &ldquo;I&rdquo; was not Christ because Christ was not in us, but now Christ is in us. Thus, the new &ldquo;I&rdquo; is Christ.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:10-11 says that we &ldquo;have put on the new man...where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; We need to see that in the new man Christ is every member and is in every member. Every time new believers are baptized, we need to repeat this truth to them, telling them that the church is Christ and that their new &ldquo;I&rdquo; is Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Christian, a Man of Christ, Being Christ</h2>
<p>I can testify that I am fully different from what I was before being regenerated; I am another person. Previously, I was a satanic person, but now, I am a Christian. A Christian is a Christ-man, a man of Christ. When we say that a table is a wooden table or a table of wood, we mean that the table is wood. Likewise, to be a Christian, a man of Christ, means that we are Christ. This again shows that the church is Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SATAN&rsquo;S STRATEGY TO FRUSTRATE GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Injecting Judaism and Greek Philosophy</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is simply to gain a church for Christ that has Christ as its life and content, a church that is Christ Himself. This is the church that God intends to obtain in His economy. However, not long after the church life began on the day of Pentecost, Satan injected mainly two foreign elements into the church&mdash;first Judaism and then Greek philosophy. Among the Epistles of the New Testament, Galatians deals mainly with Judaism, and Colossians deals mainly with Greek philosophy. Galatians tells us that Judaism should not be in the church and that the church has nothing to do with Judaism (1:4; 6:14-15). The church is Christ, not Judaism. When Judaism becomes prevailing in the church, the church is void of Christ and is therefore no longer the church. Furthermore, Colossians 2:8 says, &ldquo;Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.&rdquo; According to this verse, philosophy may also become prevailing in the church, causing the church to be void of Christ and to no longer be the church. The church must have Christ as its unique content.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Bringing in Divisive Opinions and Concepts</h2>
<p>Since the time that Judaism and philosophy were injected into the church in the first and second centuries, many different opinions and concepts have also been brought into the church. Although some of these concepts are scriptural, such as baptism by immersion, they have nevertheless crept into the church to replace Christ. This is why there is a denomination called the Baptist Church. Some Baptists even insist that a person be baptized by them. Because they insist on a certain kind of baptism, their content has become this kind of baptism rather than Christ. They are called the Baptist Church because their content is not Christ but baptism.</p>
<p>Through the past twenty centuries many concepts have crept into Christianity. Every denomination today is the issue of a concept. Even the free groups are the issue of concepts. Recently, certain free groups have said that they do not want to have a formal church life. They prefer what they call a &ldquo;home-style&rdquo; church life. They meet only in small groups in homes. When they are halfway through their meetings, a cake is brought out, and everyone enjoys the cake and begins to gossip. This kind of church life is the issue of a concept and is contrary to the truth. The truth concerning the church is that the church is only Christ. We need to see that all the denominations and free groups are the issue of concepts that have replaced Christ.</p>
<p>To say that the church is Christ may be easy, but to put this into practice is not easy. We may know in doctrine that the church is Christ, but when we practice the church life, we may cause the church to become something else because of our concept. Everyone likes to have church meetings according to their own concept. Some among us were born as quiet persons. An audible prayer in a meeting, even in the softest voice, would disturb these quiet ones. They would like the church meetings to be so quiet that one could hear a pin drop. They say, &ldquo;God is a God of order, not of confusion.&rdquo; Some oppose the use of certain musical instruments. However, others were born wild and rough. They like to shout, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! Hallelujah! Jesus! Amen!&rdquo; They consider a quiet meeting to be a dead meeting. They feel that the noisier a meeting is, the better it is. Some even like to jump around in the meetings. We need to see that the church is not silent, and neither is the church noisy. The silence must be killed, and the noise must be buried. We have no ground to exercise our preference, for the church is simply Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING GOVERNED BY THE VISION THAT<br />
THE CHURCH IS CHRIST AND<br />
SEEING AND EXPERIENCING CHRIST<br />
TO HAVE THE PROPER CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>The poor situation in Christianity today is a result of many different concepts coming in to replace Christ. Proverbs 29:18 says, &ldquo;Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint.&rdquo; In Acts 26:19 the apostle Paul said regarding the vision he had received of Christ and the church, &ldquo;I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.&rdquo; We need to be governed by the vision that the church is Christ. If we have this vision, we will not care for noise or for silence in the meetings. We will care only for Christ. We will all come to the meetings with Christ, in Christ, and for Christ. If Christ leads us to shout, we will shout. If Christ leads us to be silent, we will be silent. We are not a certain kind of church; we are only Christ. The church is only Christ.</p>
<p>The reason Christians have different concepts is that they are void of Christ. When we are void of Christ, we will have many preferences, but if we are full of Christ, we will bring only Christ when we come together. When the vessel of our being is filled with Christ to the brim, there will be no room for anything else. When our vessels are empty, void of Christ, all kinds of peculiar things will come in. Therefore, in order for us to have the proper church life, we must have adequate experiences of Christ so that we may be filled with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Revelation of Christ in Colossians</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The God-allotted Portion of the Saints</h2>
<p>Colossians unveils to us who and what Christ is. Although this book has only four chapters, the items of Christ contained in this book are profound. Colossians 1:12 says, &ldquo;Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light.&rdquo; The King James Version renders <em>allotted portion</em> in this verse as &ldquo;inheritance.&rdquo; However, the Greek word here means &ldquo;that which is allotted as a portion.&rdquo; Christ is not only our future inheritance but also our present portion. We are partakers of the portion of the saints. Day by day we are partaking of Christ as our portion by enjoying Him and experiencing Him. Let us go on to see what is included in this portion.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Image of the Invisible God<br />
the Firstborn of All Creation,<br />
and the One in Whom, through Whom,<br />
and unto Whom All Things Were Created</h2>
<p>According to verse 15, this portion is the image of the invisible God. God is invisible, yet He has an image. Christ our portion is the image, the very expression, of the invisible God. Verse 15 goes on to say that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation, and verse 16 says that all things were created in Him, through Him, and unto Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The One in Whom All Things Cohere</h2>
<p>Verse 17 says, &ldquo;All things cohere in Him.&rdquo; This clause may also be translated &ldquo;all things subsist together in Him.&rdquo; To cohere in Christ is to exist by Christ as the holding center, just as the spokes of a wheel are held together by the hub. If the hub is taken away, all the spokes will fall apart. The spokes cohere in the hub. Scientists have discovered that everything in the universe is held together by some mysterious force. Colossians 1 reveals that Christ is the holding center of all things. All things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ, and all things cohere in Him as the hub.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Head of the Body, the Firstborn from the Dead,the One in Whom All the Fullness<br />
Was Pleased to Dwell, and the Mystery of God</h2>
<p>Verse 18 says, &ldquo;He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things.&rdquo; Thus, Christ is not only the first in creation (v. 15) but also the first in resurrection. The new creation was produced in resurrection. As the first in both the old creation and the new creation, Christ has the preeminence in all things. Verse 19 goes on to say, &ldquo;For in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell.&rdquo; Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; Thus, Christ, who has the preeminence in all things, is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead. Verse 2 says that Christ is the mystery of God. This is the Christ whom we are experiencing day by day.</p><h2 class="head3">The Reality of Every Positive Thing<br />
in the Universe</h2>
<p>Colossians 2:16-17 says, &ldquo;Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath, which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ.&rdquo; These verses reveal that Christ is the reality of every positive thing in the universe. There are many positive things in the universe, and all the positive things are shadows of Christ. The day is a shadow of Christ; He is our real day. Every kind of light&mdash;moonlight, sunlight, electrical light, the light of an oil lamp&mdash;is a shadow of Christ; He is the real light. Every kind of food is a shadow; Christ is the real food. Christ is the real water and the real air. Even the feasts, the holidays, are a shadow; Christ is our real holiday. Christ is our real Sabbath and our real new moon. A new moon signifies a new beginning with light in darkness. Christ is the real new beginning with light in darkness. Furthermore, our Christ is our real clothing and our real house, our real dwelling place. This is not my thought; it is revealed in the Bible. Psalm 90:1 says, &ldquo;O Lord, You have been our dwelling place / In all generations.&rdquo; Christ is our eternal dwelling place, our eternal home. Christ is everything.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Our Life and Our Hope of Glory</h2>
<p>Colossians 3:4 says that Christ is our life. Our life is the all-inclusive Christ. What a life! Colossians 1:27 reveals that Christ is in us as our hope of glory. Today the wonderful, all-inclusive Christ is our life. In the future He will be our glory; therefore, He is our hope.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Walking in Christ, Having Been Rooted<br />
and Being Built Up in Him</h2>
<p>Colossians 2:6-7 says, &ldquo;As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him.&rdquo; The revelation in these verses is crucial. We not only have believed in Christ but also have received Him. To receive something is to take, possess, or lay hold of something that is given to us. We have all received Christ in this way. Because we have received Him, we can now walk in Him day by day. Moreover, we have been rooted in Christ, and we are being built up in Him. Our being rooted in Christ is for the growth in life, and our being built up in Him is for the building of God&rsquo;s house. Thus, we need to walk in Christ for our growth in life and for the building of God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Christ is not a concept; He is a person. We can receive this person, walk in Him, be rooted in Him, and be built up in Him. We all need to see this Christ. If we see a vision of Christ, we will have no time or capacity to care for anything else. We will not care for our concept of what a low meeting, a high meeting, a living meeting, a silent meeting, or a loud meeting is. We will have no room in our being to care whether or not guitars or tambourines are used in the meetings. If those who would normally oppose the use of tambourines are filled with Christ, they will say, &ldquo;Whoever would like to play can play. I do not care if one plays or a hundred play. I have no time to talk about that.&rdquo; Moreover, if those who play the tambourines are filled with Christ, they will lay down their tambourines and say, &ldquo;Christ is our real tambourine. We do not want to have the shadow; we want to have the reality.&rdquo; However, if some want to keep the shadow, this is not wrong. Regrettably, because most Christians are void of Christ, they pay attention to many unimportant things. When we are filled with Christ, we have no room for other things.</p>
<p>Although Christ is beyond our understanding, we need to experience Him, for He is our portion. He is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation, the One in whom all things were created, the One in whom all things cohere, the Head of the Body, and the Firstborn from the dead. He is preeminent in both the old creation and the new creation, and God&rsquo;s fullness, that is, God&rsquo;s full expression in both creation and the church, dwells in Him. Christ is also God&rsquo;s mystery and the reality of every positive thing in the universe. For the present, Christ is our life, and for the future, He is our hope of glory. Moreover, since we have received Christ and possess Him, we need to walk in Him, be rooted in Him, and be built up in Him.</p><h2 class="head2">To Walk in Christ Being<br />
to Walk in the Mingled Spirit</h2>
<p>Thus far in this chapter we have seen mainly the truth in doctrine. Now we come to the experience. First, we need to see what the all-inclusive Christ is today; we need to see the nature of this Christ. First Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,&rdquo; and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; Thus, the all-inclusive Christ is now the life-giving Spirit. Next we need to see where this life-giving Spirit is today. Second Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit,&rdquo; and Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.&rdquo; Therefore, today the all-inclusive Christ, who is now the life-giving Spirit, is in our spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; This verse shows that these two spirits, the life-giving Spirit and our human spirit, are mingled together as one spirit. Hence, to walk in Christ is simply to walk in this mingled spirit (Rom. 8:4).</p>
<p>The mingled spirit is the crucial focus that we need to pay our full attention to. To walk in Christ is to walk not according to our opinions or concepts but according to the mingled spirit within us. This mingled spirit is living and working in us. When we walk in the mingled spirit, we experience Christ in everything&mdash;in marriage life, in school life, in office life, and in the church life. The more we walk in the spirit, the more we gain Christ.</p>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;What does it mean to walk in the spirit?&rdquo; We all have a spirit within us. As believers, we have been regenerated in our spirit (John 3:6). Now Christ as the life-giving Spirit dwells in our spirit and is even one with our spirit. If we speak, we should not speak from our emotion, mind, or will. Rather, we should speak from the mingled spirit. This is to walk in the spirit. However, we must admit that we speak and act mostly from our emotion, from our mind, or from our will. Most of what we say and do is from our natural man, not from our spirit. Whenever we go somewhere, we usually go not from our spirit but from our emotion, mind, or will&mdash;from our natural man. The saints who say that they like a silent meeting or a loud meeting speak from their preference, not from their spirit. When they speak in this way, they are not walking in the spirit. If they are walking in the spirit and say something concerning the meetings from the spirit, they will only say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! We care only for Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Caring for Christ Rather Than for Religion</h2>
<p>Recently, in certain local churches a disputation arose as to whether or not the saints should go to sporting events. Some said that those who do not go to sporting events are under a legality and that those who go are liberated. They said that those who do not go to sporting events are religious and that those who go are not religious. After the saints became bothered and confused by this matter, they presented this question to me in a meeting. I answered, &ldquo;You all have one of two religions. One religion is not to go to sporting events, and the other is to go. Regardless of whether or not you think the saints should go, as long as you do not have Christ, whatever you do is a religion. We should not have a religion that says we should not go, nor should we have a religion that says we should go. Rather, we should simply take Christ.&rdquo; Because Christianity is void of Christ, many things other than Christ, such as rules and regulations, have come in. If we are filled with Christ, we will have no rules and regulations. No ground will be given to such useless things.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living Christ in Order to<br />
Bring Christ to the Meetings</h2>
<p>As we have received Christ, we need to walk in Him. Today He is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit, and our spirit is one spirit with Him. Hence, we simply need to live in the mingled spirit, speaking, acting, and moving in the spirit. If we live in this way, we will be full of Christ. Then when we come together, we will come together not only in Christ but also with Christ. Whatever we speak will be out from Christ. Whether our meetings are silent or loud will make no difference. I was with Brother Nee for a number of years in Shanghai. When he was not in the meetings, the saints often felt that something was lacking. However, when he was in the meetings, he would speak or pray in only two or three meetings out of ten; the rest of the time he was silent. Nevertheless, as long as he was there, we all felt that Christ was there. This proves that having a proper meeting is not a matter of shouting or being silent but a matter of bringing Christ to the meeting.</p>
<p>If we walk in Christ and live Christ day by day, we will be saturated with Christ, possess Christ, and be full of Christ. Then when we come to the meetings, we will come with Christ. We may not speak, pray, or shout, but others will sense that we are full of Christ. Otherwise, when we come to the meetings, whatever we do will be a performance. We will make the meeting hall a theater because we lack reality. Suppose a brother quarrels with his wife at home, and then he comes to the meeting and shouts, &ldquo;Praise the Lord!&rdquo; Inwardly, his wife may say, &ldquo;He is a devil praising the Lord.&rdquo; She will not be able to forget her husband&rsquo;s behavior at home. If we do not live Christ in our daily life, but we shout, &ldquo;Praise the Lord!&rdquo; in the meetings, the demons will laugh at us because we will be merely performers, actors. We need to live Christ so that we can come to the meetings with Christ. Then when we speak in the meetings, there will be something weighty, something of life and of reality. What we say in the meetings will be facts in our experience, not a performance.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Proper Church Meetings Being an Exhibition of the Christ Whom We Experience</h2>
<p>We need the real experience of Christ. The church is Christ, and the church meetings are an exhibition of Christ. The church meetings should be a display of what we experience in our daily life. We need to live by Christ and in Christ to be filled with Christ. Then when we come together, we can display the Christ whom we experience for His glory, for others&rsquo; edification, and for the enemy&rsquo;s shame. This is the proper church life.</p>
<p>If we see this vision of the proper church life, we will drop all our different concepts. We will not care for having a certain kind of meeting. Because we are filled with Christ, we will have no capacity, no room, for anything else. Our whole vessel, our whole being, will be filled up to the brim with Christ. If all the saints experience this, there will be no concepts in the local churches; there will be only Christ. Then we will have the genuine oneness and harmony. Because our goal, our understanding, our realization, our daily experience, our living, and our everything are Christ, the church will shine with Christ. There will be no opinions, no concepts, no disputations, and no fighting but only oneness and harmony. The oneness and harmony that we enjoy will simply be Christ Himself. This is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery of the church life. The church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is simply Christ lived out of us as a living testimony.</p><h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: Is walking in Christ related to contacting the Lord through the Word?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Yes, in order to walk in Christ, we surely need to come to the Word daily, even a few times a day, because Christ is embodied in the word of the Bible. I never knew a Christian who walked in Christ without daily contacting the Word.</p>
<p>We need to see this truth for the church life. The proper church life is not a matter of certain concepts or opinions about how and where we should meet. The church is a lampstand (Rev. 1:11-12, 20). The way and the place where we meet make no difference. As long as the lampstand is shining, regardless of where it is placed, it still shines. However, if it is not shining, it is in darkness wherever it is placed. As the Spirit, Christ is the oil within the lamp, and His expression is the light shining out of the lamp. Having the proper church life depends entirely upon how much Christ we have&mdash;how much oil we have and how much light we shine out. Therefore, we must live and walk in Him all the time by contacting Him through the Word.</p>
<p><em>Question: I have a time with the Lord in the Word in the morning, but I lose my contact with the Lord as the day goes on. Is there a way to stay in contact with the Lord for the whole day?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Yes, there is surely a way to remain in contact with the Lord throughout the day. Whenever we lose our contact with the Lord, we need to regain it. We may contact the Lord in the morning and receive something of Him. If after ten minutes we lose our contact with the Lord, we need to immediately pray to contact Him again.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of prayer. One kind is prayer at set times. This kind of prayer is for spiritual drinking. The other kind of prayer is unceasing prayer. First Thessalonians 5:17 says, &ldquo;Unceasingly pray.&rdquo; Unceasing prayer is spiritual breathing. Physically, we need to drink a few times a day, but we must breathe unceasingly. Spiritually, it is the same. In the morning we should have a set time to pray to the Lord for at least ten minutes. We can touch the Lord during this time by drinking prayers, and then we can maintain our contact with Him throughout the day by breathing prayers. This is the way.</p>
<p>Just as man cannot live physically without unceasing breathing, as believers, we cannot live without unceasing prayer. We need to breathe the Lord all day long. We should not think that because we know many things or because we have been in the church life for many years, we are safe and do not need to pray. If we do not pray, we are not breathing and are dying spiritually. Many Christians think that they know everything and therefore do not need to pray. However, regardless of how much we know or how much we have experienced, we still need to pray all the time.</p>
<p><em>Question: Do we need to have a topic or subject to pray about in our breathing prayer?</em></p>
<p>Answer: No. Actually, even in the drinking prayer it is better not to begin with a subject. Coming to pray with any subject frustrates our ability to pray properly. In order to pray properly, we simply need to go to the Lord to contact Him and allow Him to initiate what we pray about.</p>
<p><em>Question: Could you please give an example of unceasing prayer?</em></p>
<p>Answer: As we are doing a task at our job, we can pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, be with me.&rdquo; This kind of prayer rises spontaneously from within us. Although we may be quite busy, and there may be many people around us, we can still contact the Lord. We need to practice this. We need to be ready at any time to say a word to the Lord. If we are typing, we can say, &ldquo;Lord, I need You in my typing.&rdquo; We need to learn to pray in this way in everything. We should not trust in ourselves to do anything apart from the Lord. Even in what we know how to do, we still should not trust in ourselves. Whatever we do, we need to trust in the Lord. This is constant, unceasing prayer.</p>
<p><em>Question: In my set times of prayer, after a few minutes I run out of things to pray for. Do you have any suggestions?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The best thing to do is to pray-read some verses, making the verses our prayer. We will never be short of words to pray, because the Bible is our living prayer book. George M&#252;ller said that he needed the Bible to instigate his prayer. After a few minutes of contacting the Lord by pray-reading, we may enter into the spirit of prayer and receive a burden to pray for certain things. Then we may pray for half an hour or more if we have the time. This is the way we can have a set time of prayer for a longer time. Regularly, we may have only ten minutes of prayer. It is difficult to enter into a real burden in such a short time. It is best not to try to compose anything but rather to simply use the words of the Bible for the words of our prayer.</p>
<p><em>Question: Can we also use the words of the hymns for prayer?</em></p>
<p>Answer: To pray according to the hymns is also a help, but the best way is to pray the verses of the Bible. To pray the words of the Bible is much better than to pray the words of the hymns.</p>
<p><em>Question: Since the proper church meeting is an exhibition of the Christ we experience, if we have failed to live Christ during our daily life, should we still come to the meeting?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Even if we have failed to live Christ, we still need to come to the meeting. In the meeting we can have a good prayer of confession. We may even publicly confess our failure to the Lord and ask Him to cleanse us with His blood. Such a confessing prayer is living and will lead many others into the realization of their wrongdoings. If we take the lead to confess, many others may follow us to make confessions. This is the proper way to come to the meeting. We need to come to the meeting in a genuine way, not performing or pretending. If we are sorrowful after quarreling with a brother or sister, when we come to the meeting, we need to forget about our tears and say, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. I suffered a defeat.&rdquo; This is genuine. If we are defeated, we should not perform by shouting, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! Hallelujah! Amen! Jesus is Victor!&rdquo; Yes, Jesus is Victor, but we are defeated. As a defeated one, we need to be genuine to confess our defeat. This will bring the meeting into life.</p>
<p><em>Question: I have trouble entering into the prayer in the corporate prayer meetings because I find it difficult to follow along with what everyone else is praying. What should I do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We do not need to be legal in trying to follow along with others in corporate prayer meetings. We should simply express whatever is on our heart. A new believer may not know how to cooperate with others&rsquo; prayers. This is not a problem. He will gradually learn how to cooperate as he participates in the corporate prayer. He will learn by doing. In the meantime, he should not be frustrated; he should continue to participate.</p>
<p><em>Question: When I come to the Lord in prayer in an open way without any subject, it seems that my prayer is often weak and directionless. As a result, I fall under condemnation. What should I do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Our feelings are like the weather. It is difficult to know when the weather will be cloudy, when it will be clear, when it will snow, or when it will rain. However, students, businessmen, and housewives do not depend on the weather in doing their work. A housewife may say, &ldquo;Dear weather, if you like to be cloudy, that is your business. My business is to cook food for my children. When you are clear, I will cook. When you are cloudy, I will still cook.&rdquo; If a business manager works only when it is not raining, he is not managing but being managed. Just as these people are not managed by the weather, we should not be managed by our feelings. We are strange people&mdash;in the morning we may be so happy that we feel like we are in the third heaven, but for no apparent reason, ten minutes later we may be so low that we feel like we are in hell. We never know how we will feel. Moreover, our feelings are unreliable. When we feel good, things may actually be bad, and when we feel bad, things may actually be good. We do not know when things are truly good or bad; only the Lord knows. Therefore, we need to learn to forget about our feelings. We should not be affected by a clear sky or by a cloudy sky. We need to learn to contact the Lord regardless of the kind of feelings we have.</p>
<p>This matter is especially difficult for young Christians. When I was young, I also had a difficult time with this. However, now I have neither cloudy weather nor clear weather. Every day is about the same. When the saints are happy in the meeting and receive my message, I am happy, but when they drop their countenance, I am still happy. It makes no difference. In a recent training some negative things were said about my speaking. Some dear saints who heard these things were very concerned for me. They thought that I would surely be affected and that my spirit would not be released in the remaining messages. Eventually, however, they saw that my spirit was fully released. We should not care for the weather, the unreliable, changeable condition of things. We simply need to do our duty to contact the Lord each morning by ten minutes of pray-reading and five minutes of prayer.</p>
<p><em>Question: Do negative feelings within us insulate us from contacting the Lord?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Our feelings never insulate us from the Lord. What may insulate us is something negative, such as a sin that we have not confessed to the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST<br />
AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:22; 1 Cor. 11:3a; 12:28; Matt. 23:8, 10; 1 Pet. 5:3, 5; Acts 2:14; 15:13, 19; Gal. 2:9-14; Heb. 13:17</h1>
<p>This chapter concerns the headship of Christ and the constitution of the church. We need to see what the constitution of the church is, that is, the way in which the church is formed. The constitution of the church is closely related to the headship of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST<br />
BEING DENIED AND INSULTED<br />
IN THE HIERARCHY IN CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>First, I would point out that in Christianity today the headship of Christ is altogether denied. This has occurred because Christianity has become an organization. The formation of any organization brings about a hierarchy, and every hierarchy has a head. Thus, the hierarchy in Christianity insults the headship of Christ.</p>
<p>Most are familiar with the organization of the Catholic Church. First, there are the priests. Above the priests are the bishops, then the archbishops, the cardinals, and finally the pope. This hierarchy forms a pyramid with the pope on the top. The Catholic organization, with the pope as the head, is a great insult to the headship of Christ. This organization claims that the pope represents Christ, but this is actually a subtle way of putting Christ aside and denying the headship of Christ.</p>
<p>Besides the Catholic Church, there are the state churches. The Church of England is the state church of England, with the Queen of England as its head. Because the Anglican and Episcopalian churches derived from the Church of England, the Queen of England could be considered the head of these churches also. Historically, the state churches of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway have had the head of state as their head. Every state church is an organization with a head that replaces Christ and is thus an insult to the headship of Christ.</p>
<p>Besides the state churches there are private churches, such as the Baptist Church, the Methodist Church, and the Presbyterian Church. Every private church also has an organization with a person, such as a chairman or a president, as its head. The titles are different, and the complexity of the organizations differ, but the principle is always the same&mdash;there is always an organization with a head, which insults the headship of Christ. Besides the Catholic Church, the state churches, and the private churches, there are the free groups. Even every free group has an organization. Regardless of how loose their organization is, they still have an organization with a leader as the head. Thus, it is clear that Christianity is entirely a matter of organization, which leads to a hierarchy with a head, and this insults the headship of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST FULFILLING GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL PURPOSE AND BEING MADE HEAD OVER ALL THINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God Needing a Man to Fulfill<br />
His Eternal Purpose in His Economy</h2>
<p>Now we must come to the Bible to see the headship of Christ. Most Christians do not realize that the headship of Christ was not completed in the Old Testament. Christ&rsquo;s headship was not completed in the Old Testament because at that time Christ had not yet become a man. As the Son of God, He was only God, not a man. According to God&rsquo;s eternal purpose in His economy, God needs a man in order to accomplish two things. First, a man is needed because God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to work Himself into man and be mingled with man. Thus, there is the definite need of humanity for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Today the church, which is the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, is altogether human. The church is simply humanity mingled with divinity. Second, a man was needed by God to destroy His enemy, Satan. Because God would not lower Himself in His status as the Creator to deal with His creature Satan, He needed another creature, man, to defeat Satan.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Becoming a Man<br />
to Fulfill God&rsquo;s Eternal Purpose</h2>
<p>God needs a man to fulfill His eternal purpose to mingle with man and to defeat and destroy His enemy. To meet this need, God created the first man, Adam. However, because Adam fell, God needed a second man. The Bible reveals that the second man is Christ (1 Cor. 15:47). Christ came to be the second man. Christ&rsquo;s headship could not be completed until He became a man in His incarnation. Christ became a man and lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. Then when He went to the cross, He went in humanity to accomplish redemption. Without humanity, that is, without blood and flesh, Christ could never have accomplished redemption (Heb. 9:22). He accomplished redemption on the cross in the flesh through the shedding of His blood (1 Pet. 1:18-19; Eph. 1:7). Not only so, the Bible also tells us that on the cross in the flesh Christ destroyed Satan, the one who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14). Through Christ&rsquo;s incarnation He became a man, and by His death on the cross He defeated Satan and destroyed God&rsquo;s enemy.</p>
<p>Christ not only destroyed God&rsquo;s enemy, but He also brought God into man by His incarnation (John 1:1, 14). Christ brought divinity into humanity. Before Christ became a man, God was God and man was man, and God and man were never one. However, by Christ&rsquo;s incarnation God was brought into man. When Christ became a man, there was a man on the earth who was the very mingling of God and man. He was a man without, but He was God within. Jesus was a God-man. On one hand, He was God; on the other hand, He was a man. Thus, by His incarnation He brought God and man together. Now we have seen the importance of Christ being a man in order to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Ascending and<br />
Being Made Head over All Things</h2>
<p>After Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, He ascended to the third heaven. In Christ&rsquo;s ascension God inaugurated Him into the headship of the universe. Acts 2:36 says, &ldquo;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified.&rdquo; This verse indicates that in Christ&rsquo;s ascension God completed the headship of Christ. In the heavens today there is a man, a man of Nazareth, a man by the name of Jesus. This man is not an ordinary man; He is an extraordinary man. He is God who became a man and died on the cross to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and destroy His enemy. He has two natures&mdash;the divine nature and the human nature. He is now in the heavens not only as God but also as man. In His ascension this man Jesus was made Head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:22). The Head of the whole universe today is Jesus. Jesus is not only the Head of the universe, but He is also the Head of each one of us. First Corinthians 11:3 says, &ldquo;Christ is the head of every man.&rdquo; In the universe today the headship belongs uniquely to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE UNIQUE HEAD</h2>
<p>Thus far we have seen that the headship of Christ was not completed in the Old Testament because at that time He was not a man and had not accomplished redemption or defeated God&rsquo;s enemy to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Hence, there was no possibility to have a completed headship set up in the universe. However, after Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, in His ascension He was inaugurated into a complete headship and was made Head over all things in the universe, including every man. Christ is not only the universal Head but also the unique Head.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Ordained Way of Leadership<br />
among His People</h2>
<p>God does not desire that there be any head other than Christ. In the Old Testament God allowed His people to have kings, but only one at a time. When David was king, there was not another king. When Solomon became king, there was not another king. In the Old Testament the king was the head of God&rsquo;s people because the headship of Christ was not yet completed. However, in the New Testament age and in the church today the Head is Christ. In the churches there are elders and apostles, but these are not the head of the church. This is the reason that in the New Testament age God does not have single leaders among His people as He did in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament there was always only one king at a time, but in the New Testament there were twelve apostles at the same time. God did not have twelve kings at the same time in the Old Testament because the king was head during the time when the headship of Christ was not fully established. However, because in the New Testament the headship of Christ was fully established, there could not be only one unique apostle, for this apostle would surely be the head, and this head would be an insult to the headship of Christ. In the New Testament age God has ordained that His people not have any head besides Christ. Christ is the unique Head.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Being Our One Teacher and Leader</h2>
<p>In Matthew 23:8 the Lord said, &ldquo;Do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.&rdquo; Acts 5:31 says, &ldquo;This One God has exalted to His right hand as Leader and Savior.&rdquo; Christ is our one Teacher and Leader. In the New Testament age God would not allow His people to have a single, unique leader among men. There was not one apostle but twelve apostles. Besides the twelve, there were other apostles, such as Paul, Barnabas, and Timothy. Moreover, in each local church there should not be only one unique elder. In every local church the eldership should be plural. The plurality of the eldership is crucial.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Case of Peter Revealing That Leadership in the Church Is Not Official, Permanent, or Organizational but Depends on Spiritual Capacity</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus originally appointed the twelve apostles (Mark 3:14; Luke 6:13). In every record of the names of the twelve apostles in the four Gospels, Peter&rsquo;s name always stands as the first (Matt. 10:2; Mark 3:16; Luke 6:14). Even in Acts 1:13 Peter&rsquo;s name was first. For this reason, the Catholic Church says that Peter is the successor, the representative, of Christ, and they claim that Peter was the first pope. However, the full record in the New Testament reveals that although Peter was first, he was not an official first or a permanent first.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church claims that Peter&rsquo;s name always stands first in the New Testament, but Galatians 2:9 mentions &ldquo;James and Cephas [Peter] and John.&rdquo; Therefore, at least one verse in the New Testament ranks Peter second. In Galatians Peter was no longer first. Peter became second, and James became first. Furthermore, Acts 21:17-18 says, &ldquo;When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us gladly. And on the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.&rdquo; When Paul went to Jerusalem, he did not go to Peter but to James. Although Peter was one of the elders in Jerusalem (1 Pet. 5:1), James was the only elder named in Acts 21:18, and Peter was included in &ldquo;all the elders.&rdquo; This indicates that at that time the leading one was not Peter but James.</p>
<p>In Acts 15 there was a conference among the elders and the apostles. Verses 6 and 7 say, &ldquo;The apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter. And when much discussion had taken place, Peter rose up and said to them...&rdquo; Then verse 12 says, &ldquo;All the multitude became silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.&rdquo; Thus, Peter gave a word, and then Barnabas and Paul gave a word. Verse 13 continues, &ldquo;When they finished speaking, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me.&rdquo; In verse 19 James said, &ldquo;Therefore I judge that we do not harass those from the Gentiles who are turning to God.&rdquo; From these verses we can see that the final word at the end of the conference was given not by Peter but by James. In human terms, James presided over that conference and gave the concluding word because at that time he was taking the lead.</p>
<p>We may wonder why Peter was no longer in the lead in Acts 15. On the day of Pentecost, Peter was like a lion (2:14), but in Galatians 2 he was like a chicken. For the Jews to eat with the Gentiles was a violation of their Mosaic Law, yet Peter was bold to eat with the Gentile believers. However, when some came down from Jerusalem, Peter shrank back and separated himself from the Gentile believers (v. 12). Peter&rsquo;s actions were contrary to the truth of the gospel. The truth of the gospel in the New Testament is that the middle wall of partition has been broken down by the cross of Christ; consequently, there is no separation between the Jews and the Gentiles (Eph. 2:14). Paul said in Galatians 2:11 and 14, &ldquo;When Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he stood condemned...When I saw that they were not walking in a straightforward way in relation to the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like the Jews?&rdquo; From this we can see that although Peter was bold and strong on the day of Pentecost, he later became weak.</p>
<p>When Peter lost his spiritual capacity, James rose up. This reveals that the leadership among God&rsquo;s people in the New Testament age is not official, permanent, or organizational; rather, it depends on the present spiritual capacity. When Peter&rsquo;s spiritual capacity was high, he took the lead. When his spiritual capacity became low, he lost the lead. In the Catholic Church, however, the leadership is official, permanent, and organizational. When a pope dies, another pope is elected. The office of the pope is official, permanent, and organizational. In contrast, on the day of Pentecost Peter&rsquo;s leadership was not official, permanent, or organizational but was dependent on his spiritual capacity. God does not desire to have permanent leaders in the New Testament age, for such leaders are an insult to the headship of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">The Eldership in the Churches<br />
Always Being Plural</h2>
<p>In some local churches there has been a practice of making an arrangement as to who is first among the elders. No verse in the Bible gives any indication that there should be such an arrangement. Rather, the scriptural principle with regard to the eldership is always plurality. God does not want one brother to be the unique elder; He wants a few brothers to be a group of elders. The eldership should always be in plurality. This plurality keeps any elder from being an official leader or a permanent leader. The issue of who will take the lead among the elders is determined by each one&rsquo;s capacity. Because one brother has the highest capacity in certain areas, he may be the leading one in a certain matter. In another matter a different brother may have the highest capacity; therefore, in that matter he will be the leader. Six months later these two brothers may both lose their capacity, and another brother may grow and increase in his spiritual capacity by the Lord&rsquo;s grace and mercy. Thus, this third brother will spontaneously become the leading one among the elders. In the New Testament among God&rsquo;s people there is no unique, definite, official, or permanent leadership. Such a leadership would be an insult to the headship of Christ. Therefore, in each local church today there should be no head other than Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Body Having Only One Head</h2>
<p>There should be no head other than Christ, not only in each local church but also among all the churches. An apostle is not the head of many churches. Our physical body has only one head, but our concept may not match this reality. We may think that the shoulder is the head of the arm, the arm is the head of the hand, the hand is the head of the fingers, and the fingers are the heads of the nails. According to this concept, a body has many heads or subheads. Any member that is larger and higher than another is a head. This may be our concept concerning the church. The church is the Body of Christ. We may think that everyone in the Body of Christ is a head.</p>
<p>In 1976 I realized that there were many heads and subheads in the church in Anaheim. Some brothers even produced a chart of the organization of the church in the form of a pyramid, showing who was above whom and who was under whom. When I saw this chart, I said to the brothers there, &ldquo;Brothers, may we please forget about this pyramid. Tear it down.&rdquo; We have only one Head&mdash;Christ. Regardless of how large our two shoulders are, they are not heads. We do not have any subheads. This principle is fully proven in Matthew 23:8-11, where the Lord said, &ldquo;Do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth your father, for One is your Father, He who is in the heavens. Neither be called instructors, because One is your Instructor, the Christ. And the greatest among you shall be your servant.&rdquo; There should be no leader among us. We should not consider that the apostles or the elders are leaders or subheads. There is not such a thing in the Scriptures. To have leaders or subheads is according to a natural human concept.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Elders Being Not Lords but Patterns</h2>
<p>Peter, who was an elder himself, wrote to the elders, &ldquo;Nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock&rdquo; (1 Pet. 5:3). An elder is not a lord; rather, every elder is a slave. In the church the elders should be examples, not kings issuing orders. If the church needs someone to clean the restroom in the meeting hall, an elder should not issue an order for another brother to clean the restroom. That would be the lording way. The proper way is for the elder to take the lead to clean the restroom himself. Then all the brothers and sisters will follow his pattern. A flock of sheep always follows the first sheep. Whichever way the first one goes, all the others follow. An elder is not a lord but simply the first sheep to take the lead. When an elder takes the lead in some service, all the other saints should follow. This is according to the Bible; it is absolutely different from the human concept of leadership. Among God&rsquo;s people today there should be no head other than Christ. Any head or subhead is an insult to the headship of Christ. God honors the headship of His Son to the uttermost, and He desires that we also honor the headship of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Helps of Deacons Being Ranked<br />
before the Administrations of Elders</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 12:28 says, &ldquo;God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.&rdquo; In this verse <em>helps</em> refers to the services of the deacons, and <em>administrations</em> refers to the functions of the elders. According to our concept, the functions of the elders should come first, but in this verse the apostle Paul purposely lists the helps of the deacons before the elders&rsquo; administrations. This shows that among God&rsquo;s people today there is no human leadership.</p><h2 class="head2">Honoring Christ as the Unique Head<br />
in Our Daily Life</h2>
<p>A young brother who has been saved only a short time may approach some older brothers with a spiritual question he has been unable to resolve on his own. He may want to know whether or not he should go swimming at the beach, participate in sports, go to movies, or drink beer. If the older brothers have learned the lesson to honor the headship of Christ, when a brother opens to them in this way, they will immediately say, &ldquo;Brother, we cannot tell you what to do because we are not the Head. We are not the Lord, and even you are not your lord. Jesus Christ is our Lord; He is the Head. Even if we know the answer to your question, we still cannot answer you because we do not have the position to tell you what to do. We must look to the Lord.&rdquo; To answer in this way is to honor the headship of Christ. However, our practice in the church life is usually not like this. We often tell people what to do and what not to do; we even stir up arguments. This is altogether wrong. Our telling others what to do is an insult to the headship of Christ. We need to practice to honor and respect the headship of Christ.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:22 says, &ldquo;Wives, be subject to your own husbands.&rdquo; A sister who keeps this word by submitting herself to her husband may ask him whether or not they should take their children to a certain place, allowing him to make the decision. Concerning spiritual matters, her husband may turn to the Lord, but concerning such practical matters, he may unconsciously insult the Lord by making decisions on his own. If a brother has learned the lesson, he will tell his wife, &ldquo;Although I am the husband, I am not the Lord. We need to refer this matter to the Lord. We honor Him and respect Him as the Head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Failing to honor Christ as the Head could be the reason that a husband and wife who pray together still may not know the Lord&rsquo;s will. On one hand, they pray to the Lord; on the other hand, they may not give the headship to the Lord, respecting the Lord as their Head. They may still consider themselves as the head. This may be the reason that the Lord has not answered many of our prayers. If this is our case, we need to change our attitude. When a sister asks her husband something, he should not give his feeling or make any decision. Instead, he should say, &ldquo;I am not the Lord. Let us look to Him. We give our honor and our respect to the Head, the Lord Jesus.&rdquo; If this is our attitude, our prayer will probably be answered. This is a great matter. The headship of Christ should not be merely a doctrine; it needs to be a daily practice. We need to honor Christ&rsquo;s headship in our daily practice.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Honoring Christ as the Unique Head<br />
in and among the Churches and the Work</h2>
<p>We need to honor Christ as our Head in the church life also. The elders in a local church should not consider themselves as the head. Neither should the saints in the local church consider the elders as the head. Among all the churches the saints should not consider an apostle as the head. An apostle is not a head. We have only one Head, Christ. This is according to the truth.</p>
<p>Suppose one day a brother comes from another locality and tells us that he is the representative of the church in that locality and has come to make an arrangement with us. We should not accept such a one because, according to the truth, the way he speaks is wrong. We do not have representatives in the churches. Likewise, if a brother travels to another locality claiming to represent another brother, we need to tell him that according to the truth there is not such a thing. According to the New Testament, there is no organization in the churches.</p>
<h2 class="head3">There Being No Rank among the Churches</h2>
<p>In the New Testament all the local churches are on the same level&mdash;not one is higher than any other. However, our human mentality always thinks that certain churches are ranked higher than others. This concept is wrong. In early times many churches considered the church in Jerusalem to be the head church. It was difficult for the Lord to remove this wrong concept. Regrettably, this concept damaged Jerusalem, for it was one reason that God sent Titus and the Roman army to destroy Jerusalem in A.D. 70. God does not allow there to be any head other than Christ; even a head church is not allowed. We should not consider any church today to be the head church. All the churches are on the same level. There are not first generation churches, second generation churches, and third generation churches. All the churches are of one generation. There is no lineage among the churches.</p><h2 class="head3">There Being No Organization among the Churches</h2>
<p>Moreover, the local churches should not all be organized into one unit. If the local churches are organized into one unit, this organization will lead to hierarchy, and hierarchy is an insult to the headship of Christ. No local church is higher than any other local church, and no two local churches should be united. As soon as any two churches are united, there is an organization, which will have a head. I am quite concerned regarding this crucial matter. A clever brother among us may exercise his influence and say, &ldquo;It is foolish for all the churches to be scattered, loose, and unorganized. Let us all come together to organize and form the churches into a strong unit.&rdquo; If we do not know the truth concerning this matter, we will probably say, &ldquo;This is not bad. It is a good idea. The United States of America is strong because the fifty states are organized into a federal government with a president.&rdquo; Some saints may accept this concept. However, if such a thing happens, the headship of Christ will be fully insulted because an organization always leads to a hierarchy, which insults the headship of Christ. God desires that the churches be loosely related to one another in order to keep the headship of Christ. We do not have a federal government among the churches.</p>
<h2 class="head3">There Being No Rank or Organization<br />
among the Different Regions of the Work</h2>
<p>The principle of there being no rank or organization among the churches applies also to the work. In the New Testament Peter&rsquo;s work was among the Jewish believers, and Paul&rsquo;s work was in the Gentile world (Gal. 2:7-9). However, the Bible never tells us which of these two regions was higher, nor does the Bible show that the two regions merged into one. If two regions of the work merge into one, the result will be an organization of the work.</p>
<p>Thus, in the New Testament we can see that the eldership is plural, all the churches are independent, and the regions of the work are on the same level and never merged together. All this shows that there should be no organization among God&rsquo;s people in order that there would be no head other than Christ. The unique headship belongs to Christ. In all things we need to honor His headship. Honoring Christ as the unique Head is crucial.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO KNOW AND PRACTICE THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>In the last few years there has been a trend among us to organize the local churches in a way that will lead to hierarchy. Some have even said, &ldquo;So-and-so is going to be the leader in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.&rdquo; This has happened because we are not clear about the truth and because we do not practice the truth. If we are clear about the truth and practice the truth, when we hear such things, we will immediately say, &ldquo;No, we cannot accept this kind of speaking because in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there is no leader. The only Head is Christ.&rdquo; All the elders are on the same level, all the apostles are on the same level, all the churches are on the same level, and the regions of the work are on the same level. The issue of who is to take the lead at any time is always determined by the spiritual situation at any given time. The elder or church that has the highest spirituality is the one that should take the lead, but this must not be official, permanent, or organizational. It should always depend on the spiritual condition. Practicing in this way keeps God&rsquo;s people away from the kind of leadership that insults the headship of Christ. This is the truth concerning the constitution of the church. The church is formed according to the truth that Christ is the unique Head. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there is no organization because Christ is the unique Head. The church is built according to this truth.</p>
<p>Suppose a certain local church writes a letter to another church telling them what to do. The brothers in the church that receives the letter need to be strong for the truth and immediately return the letter, saying, &ldquo;We cannot accept this letter because this is not according to the truth.&rdquo; We need to make the truth bright. Our practice of the truth needs to be strong. We should not be overly concerned about being polite. The word <em>polite</em> is very similar to the word <em>politics</em>. To be polite is actually to play politics; it is not to speak the truth. If the church in a certain locality tells the brothers in another locality to send them five brothers, the brothers in the second locality should say, &ldquo;We will not do it; this is not according to the truth.&rdquo; However, in order to be polite, they may instead say, &ldquo;Brothers, sorry. We have considered much, but we simply could not find one brother who is willing to go.&rdquo; If they answer in this way, they are not practicing the truth but are instead playing politics. Playing politics befits a politician, but it disqualifies an elder. An elder must always be frank and strict, speaking the truth. All the politics among us should be dropped. We must all learn the truth and practice the truth.</p>
<p>There may be three elders in the church in a certain locality. Perhaps one day a brother in this locality will say, &ldquo;Among the three elders, Brother So-and-so is number one.&rdquo; Right away we should correct such a brother, saying, &ldquo;Brother, do not say this. There is not such a thing. This is not according to the truth. Having a plurality of elders is according to the truth, but deciding which one is first is not according to the truth.&rdquo; It is crucial that we know and practice the truth. The United States of America has become a strong nation because it has a strong Constitution and because all the people respect the Constitution. When President Nixon was forced to resign because of the Watergate scandal, I did not feel good about the president being brought down. However, I admired the spirit of the Constitution, which can put aside even the president if he is wrong. The practice of always applying the Constitution makes the United States a strong country. The church should practice the truth in like manner. Furthermore, just as the citizens of the United States know the basic items of the Constitution, so we who are in the churches should know the truth. If we know and practice the truth, the church will be strong.</p>
<p>Concerning any matter of the truth, we should not say, &ldquo;This is what Brother Lee says.&rdquo; To say this is wrong. We should not rely on what any brother says; rather, we should rely on the truth. The truth is not what a certain brother says; it is what the Bible says. We need to learn the specific verses that are related to certain truths. Then we can open the Bible to those verses and show others, saying, &ldquo;Here the Bible says this.&rdquo; In this way we will not be following any brother; rather, we will be following the truth of the Bible.</p>
<p>Regardless of who comes to us, if he says something different from the truth in the Bible, we need to say, &ldquo;Brother, we cannot take this.&rdquo; Some brothers may be like Peter in Matthew 16. In verses 16 through 19 Peter received a heavenly vision, but in verse 22 he was one with Satan. We should rebuke such ones, just as the Lord Jesus did (v. 23). The Bible, the &ldquo;Constitution&rdquo; of the church, is fully complete. Paul says in Galatians 1:8, &ldquo;If even we or an angel out of heaven should announce to you a gospel beyond that which we have announced to you, let him be accursed.&rdquo; If even the angels or the apostles preach to us another gospel, we should not receive it, because the truth in the Bible has been completed. The truth in the Bible is the &ldquo;Constitution&rdquo; of the church. If we know and practice the truth in the Bible, the church will be strong. We need to learn not to say, &ldquo;Brother So-and-so says...&rdquo; We need to drop this concept and learn to say, &ldquo;The Bible says...&rdquo; We must learn the truth. Then the church will be strong because the church life will not be practiced according to man&rsquo;s opinion or concept but according to the truth.</p><h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: Could you comment further on what a husband should do to honor the headship of Christ if his wife asks him to make a decision?</em></p>
<p>Answer: When a wife comes to her husband regarding anything, the best way and the proper way for the husband to respond is by referring the matter to the Lord by prayer. The same principle applies in the church. Hebrews 13:17 says, &ldquo;Obey the ones leading you and submit to them.&rdquo; The ones leading us are the elders. Nevertheless, when something is referred to the elders, the elders should immediately refer the matter to the Lord by praying to Him in order to respect Him as the Head. This is the proper way. When something is referred to the elders, if they immediately make a decision and give an order, this is an insult to the Head. We all need to honor Christ as the Head by referring all things to Him.</p>
<p><em>Question: What does Paul mean when he says, &ldquo;A husband is head of the wife&rdquo; (Eph. 5:23)? How do we put this into practice?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The husband being the head of the wife is the reason that the wife needs to refer things to the husband, but the husband in turn needs to respect the headship of Christ. The best husband is one who respects the headship of Christ. The more a brother respects the headship of Christ, the more his wife will respect him.</p>
<p><em>Question: Should we go to the Lord first regarding any matter and wait for the Lord to direct us to fellowship with another brother if need be?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is very good to first refer any matter to the Lord. If we become clear concerning the matter simply by going to the Lord, it is wonderful. However, the Lord will often say, &ldquo;Go to your brother; then I will make you clear.&rdquo; In most cases the Lord will direct us to fellowship with another brother, but when we go to the brother, the brother should not replace the Lord by telling us what to do. The brother should say, &ldquo;Let us fellowship and pray to bring this matter to the Lord.&rdquo; The Lord may still not make us clear after we fellowship and pray with another brother. This may be the Lord&rsquo;s way of directing us to go to the elders. If the elders say, &ldquo;We will tell you what to do,&rdquo; they are wrong. The elders also should refer the matter to the Lord in fellowship and prayer. Usually, by this point the Lord will tell the brothers what we need to do. In this way, we are safeguarded, and we respect the headship of Christ. I hope that we may all learn to practice in this way.</p>
<p><em>Question: Churches sometimes come together for a meeting or a conference. Is this wrong?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The churches should come together as often as possible. This is fellowship, and any kind of fellowship is always beneficial. The fellowship between the saints works well, and the fellowship between the churches also is a benefit. This is a good thing.</p>
<p><em>Question: In 2 Corinthians 10:14 Paul speaks of &ldquo;not extending ourselves beyond our bounds.&rdquo; What does this word mean?</em></p>
<p>Answer: What Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:13-15 indicates that the Lord gave a certain boundary to Paul for his work and that Paul never overstepped that boundary. Paul always kept himself within God&rsquo;s limitation.</p>
<p><em>Question: It seems to me that the word in these chapters is like a biology lesson. If a body is weak and collapsing because of a lack of food, we should not rely on something organizational to prop it up. Is this right?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This is absolutely right. The church is an organism, and at a time when it is suffering from lack of nourishment, if we do anything in the way of organizing, it will not help the situation. The best way to help an organism is to feed it with nourishing food. This will keep the organism working in an organic way, in the way of life. We need to see that no problem in the church can be solved by organization. Organization will only damage the church. Because a table is an organization, it is easy for a carpenter to repair or improve a table. However, this cannot be done with an organism. All surgeries depend on the organic function of the body. Surgeons must always decide whether someone&rsquo;s body can sustain a certain surgery. If the organic function of the body is not working well, a good surgeon will not operate. Every surgery depends upon the organic function of the body. Because the church is the Body of Christ, an organism and not an organization, we must not try to arrange or rearrange things in an organizational way. We must deal with the church just as a surgeon deals with the human body&mdash;in an organic way.</p>
<p>For a carpenter to replace the top of a desk takes only a short time, but for a body to fully recover from surgery requires a long time. Therefore, we cannot solve any problem of the church in a quick, organizational way. Any problem in the church must be dealt with in an organic way, which takes time. In the church we must not handle matters in the way that a carpenter works on a desk. We need to be like a surgeon dealing with an organic matter, depending upon the organic ability. In most surgeries there is the need of a blood transfusion to support the organic function of the body. There is much for us to learn regarding the church as an organism. Whatever we do with the church must be organic, depending not on our doing but on the organic function of the Body.</p>
<p><em>Question: We need to realize that we have no head other than Christ, but the tendency among some Christians is to say, &ldquo;The Bible is my only authority. I do not need to fellowship with anyone.&rdquo; Where is the middle ground between hierarchy and anarchy?</em></p>
<p>Answer: On one hand, among the Lord&rsquo;s people today there should be no head; the headship belongs uniquely to Christ. On the other hand, the Bible says, &ldquo;Obey the ones leading you&rdquo; (Heb. 13:17). Although we need to obey our leading ones, the leading ones should not be lords (1 Pet. 5:3). The leading ones should refer all things to the Lord. What the Bible reveals is neither hierarchy nor anarchy but the Body with the Head. Our physical body is a full picture of the Body of Christ. Every part of the body is in a good order, but there is only one head. All the parts respect the head, and the head gives orders directly to each part, not through another member. However, all the members keep a good order. This is very beautiful. We do not follow the way of Christianity or the way of worldly society; we follow only God&rsquo;s economy. We have only one Head, yet we are submissive to the Body. We keep a good order in the church, but the leading ones are not the lords&mdash;they refer all the things to the Lord. This way is absolutely different from human society and from Christianity.</p>
<p><em>Question: If there is not a clear answer from the Lord when we refer something to Him, should we simply choose as best we can?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Usually, the Lord will not immediately make us clear concerning what His will is. Rather, He will force us to contact Him more. We should not expect to be clear concerning the Lord&rsquo;s will right away. We must be prepared to wait on the Lord. It is quite strange that when we want to know the Lord&rsquo;s will right away, the Lord often will not let us know, but when we say, &ldquo;Lord, I want to wait to be clear concerning Your will,&rdquo; the Lord will make us clear right away. In any case, we need to learn to wait until we are clear. However, circumstances sometimes do not allow us to wait. At such times we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I still do not know what Your will is. I simply go forward by faith. If what I do is not Your will, Lord, frustrate it. If You do not frustrate it, I believe that what I am doing is Your will.&rdquo; This is the proper attitude. If, however, there is nothing forcing us to do something right away, it is better to wait until we are clear concerning the Lord&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p><em>Question: In 1 Corinthians 7:25 and 40 Paul&rsquo;s opinion became the word of God, but many times our opinions are natural. How do we know if our opinions are from the Lord or from a natural source?</em></p>
<p>Answer: When Paul gave his opinion, he said, &ldquo;I think that I also have the Spirit of God&rdquo; (v. 40). If we are a person like Paul, filled with the Spirit, whatever we say will surely be of the Spirit. If we are not filled with the Spirit, we are filled with our natural concepts, and whatever we say will not be of the Lord. Thus, the source of our opinions depends on our state, our condition.</p>
<p><em>Question: We are all in some ways part of organizations in the world, such as the companies we work for, and we must function as parts of these organizations. In my experience I have trouble because I try to function in the way of life, as I would in the church. What should I do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: In an organization, trying to do things in an organic way will create trouble. Everything must be after its own kind (Gen. 1:24-25). In the church, which is an organism, we should do things in an organic way. In worldly society, in the companies we work for, we should work in an organizational way. We should not try to apply the way of the church to worldly society. Doing so will damage both. The church and worldly society are two absolutely different things and should not be mixed.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOW TO CONDUCT ONESELF<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 1:3-7; 3:15-16; 4:6-8; 6:3</h1>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR CRUCIAL MATTERS<br />
IN THE EPISTLES TO TIMOTHY</h2>
<p>The two Epistles to Timothy were written while the church was in degradation. These two Epistles stress that we need to know how to conduct ourselves in the house of God. In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul says, &ldquo;If I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God.&rdquo; Timothy needed a word from Paul regarding this matter at a time of the church&rsquo;s degradation. Because there is a situation of confusion and division in the church today, we too need to know how to conduct ourselves in the church.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will focus on four important terms found in these two Epistles. First Timothy 1:4 mentions the first term, <em>God&rsquo;s economy</em>. Then 3:15 uses the expression <em>the pillar and base of the truth. Truth</em> is the second important term in these two Epistles (2:4, 7; 4:3; 6:5; 2 Tim. 2:15, 18, 25; 3:7-8; 4:4). The third important term is <em>godliness.</em> First Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;Great is the mystery of godliness.&rdquo; In these two books the word <em>godliness</em> is used nine times (2:2; 3:16; 4:7-8; 6:3, 5-6, 11; 2 Tim. 3:5), and the word godly is used twice (1 Tim. 2:10; 2 Tim. 3:12). The fourth important term that we will consider is <em>healthy teaching</em> (1 Tim. 1:10; 2 Tim. 4:3) or <em>healthy words</em> (1 Tim. 6:3; 2 Tim. 1:13).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY<br />
VERSUS DIFFERENT TEACHINGS</h2>
<p>First Timothy 1:3-11 reveals that there were different teachings in the church even in the first century while the apostle Paul was still on the earth. Paul and the other apostles who were one with him all taught one thing&mdash;God&rsquo;s economy (v. 4). God&rsquo;s economy was the teaching of the gospel (v. 11). The main teaching that was different from the teaching of God&rsquo;s economy was the teaching of the law. Verse 7 mentions &ldquo;teachers of the law.&rdquo; The teaching of the law was not unscriptural; it was very scriptural, for the law was given by God through Moses and was taught for fifteen centuries by many Old Testament teachers. However, in the New Testament to teach the law is to teach something different from the teaching of the gospel, the teaching of God&rsquo;s economy. Therefore, Paul said to Timothy in verse 3, &ldquo;Even as I exhorted you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">There Being Only One Ministry<br />
in the New Testament</h2>
<p>There is a debate among Christian leaders today concerning the matter of different ministries. Some accuse us of not accepting others&rsquo; ministries. This is not true. We first need to learn what the ministry is according to the Word of God. Ephesians 4:11-12 says, &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; Apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are gifted persons with different functions. However, they do not have different ministries. The different functions are not different ministries, for verse 12 mentions &ldquo;the work of the ministry.&rdquo; These verses indicate that although there are different gifts and functions, there is only one work and one ministry. Thus, according to the New Testament, there is only one ministry; there are not many ministries. It is not scriptural to say, &ldquo;You have your ministry, and I have my ministry.&rdquo; In the early church the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers all had one ministry.</p><h2 class="head3">There Being Many Ministers but One Ministry</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 4:1 says, &ldquo;Therefore having this ministry as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart.&rdquo; In this verse the subject <em>we</em> is plural, but the object <em>ministry</em> is singular. All the apostles, including Peter, John, James, Paul, Barnabas, and Timothy, had one ministry. First Timothy 1:12 says, &ldquo;I give thanks to Him who empowers me, Christ Jesus our Lord, that He has counted me faithful, appointing me to the ministry.&rdquo; The Lord first appointed the twelve apostles to the ministry. Later, the Lord also appointed the apostle Paul to the ministry. Hence, our concept needs to be adjusted. No one should say that we do not accept others&rsquo; ministries. Actually, in the New Testament there is only one ministry. If I am serving the Lord properly, I am serving in the one ministry. Brother Nee also served in the one ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Different Gifts Having Different Functions<br />
but All Constituting<br />
the Unique New Testament Ministry</h2>
<p>There is one ministry, but this does not mean that all the gifted persons speak exactly the same thing. The principle is that there is one ministry with different aspects. This principle is illustrated by the writing of the four Gospels. Although Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John wrote concerning the Lord&rsquo;s life on the earth, they did not repeat one another&rsquo;s writing. The writings of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John were different from one another, but their ministry was one. In this sense, they all spoke the same thing.</p>
<p>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John wrote biographies of the Lord Jesus from different angles. This was like taking photographs of a person from four different sides. Although each photograph shows something different, all of them show aspects of one person. The four Gospels present four aspects of one person, the Lord Jesus. However, the four writers still spoke the same thing. They spoke of Jesus Christ from different angles. Today in the New Testament economy we all need to speak the same thing, but this does not mean that what we speak is all from the same angle.</p>
<p>Acts and the Epistles each present different aspects of God&rsquo;s economy. The Epistles of Paul, Peter, John, and Jude all speak the same thing. With the exception of some portions of James, which retain an Old Testament view and flavor, the Epistles speak of different aspects of one thing.</p>
<p>We need to study the Bible. Our concepts concerning the spiritual things are too natural. When we use the term <em>the ministry,</em> we mean the New Testament ministry, but many saints understand that <em>the ministry</em> means the ministry of Brother Lee. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today there is not only my ministry but also Brother Watchman Nee&rsquo;s ministry. These are not two ministries; they are one ministry and one speaking. In the New Testament age God has raised up many gifted persons with many gifts and functions, but they all belong to the same one ministry. This one ministry ministers Christ for the church. This is <em>the</em> ministry, the unique ministry. When we use the term <em>the ministry,</em> we do not mean a ministry that is only Brother Lee&rsquo;s ministry. Brother Nee, the apostle Paul, and Martin Luther did not each have a different ministry. They all had one ministry. Martin Luther had a gift, Brother Nee had a gift, and I have a gift, just as Paul, Peter, John, and the other apostles all had different gifts. However, all the gifts constitute one ministry. Therefore, when we use the term <em>the ministry,</em> we mean the unique New Testament ministry, which includes all the apostles in the early church and all the servants used by the Lord since then. They all speak one thing. They do not minister the law or their own concepts, ideas, or opinions; rather, they all minister Christ for the church. Thus, when others speak to us of different ministries, we should point out that there is actually only one ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">All God&rsquo;s Speaking in the New Testament<br />
Being in the Son</h2>
<p>Hebrews 1:1-2a says, &ldquo;God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son.&rdquo; In the Old Testament God spoke in many portions and in many ways in the prophets, but in the New Testament He has not spoken to us in many apostles and prophets. In the New Testament God speaks in only one person, not in Paul and not in Watchman Nee but in the Son.</p>
<p>Verse 2 does not say that God spoke in the apostles; rather, it says that He spoke in the Son, for all the apostles are members of the Son. We too are members of the Son. The Son is the Head, and we are the members of His Body. The fact that Christ is one body with many members (1 Cor. 12:12) proves that in the New Testament age there is only one ministry. There is only one ministry because all those who speak are one in the Son (Gal. 3:27-28). When God spoke through Peter, He was actually speaking in His Son, for Peter had become a member of the Son. This is a strong proof that God has only one speaking in the New Testament. This is different from His speaking in the Old Testament. All the Old Testament writers were separate; they were not in the Son. Moses, David, Isaiah, and Jeremiah were not in the Son. However, in the New Testament age the twelve apostles, Paul, Barnabas, Luther, and Brother Nee have all been constituted into the Son. Therefore, today God speaks in the Son. That God speaks only in the Son does not mean that He speaks only in the individual man Jesus Christ. He speaks also in Peter, John, James, Paul, and others, for all these are constituted into the Son. Outwardly, we may see different brothers speaking, but inwardly, it is the Son who is speaking. There are many speakers but one speaking, and there are many gifts with many functions but one ministry.</p><h2 class="head2">Different Teachings Being<br />
Different Categories of Teaching,<br />
Not Different Aspects of One Thing</h2>
<p>To speak differently is not to speak different aspects of the same thing; it is to speak different categories of teaching. Apparently, there are four categories of teaching mentioned in 1 Timothy 1: God&rsquo;s economy, the law, myths, and genealogies (vv. 4, 7). Actually, myths and genealogies are in the same category as the law. Those who taught the law taught it with related myths. The genealogies mentioned in verse 4 surely refer to the genealogies in the Old Testament. Thus, there are actually only two categories of teaching&mdash;one is the Old Testament things concerning the law, and the other is the New Testament gospel, which is Christ as life for the church. The second category is God&rsquo;s economy, but the first is tradition and human opinion. The Old Testament things of the law are not aspects of God&rsquo;s economy and are different from the apostles&rsquo; teaching. There were many different apostles, yet they all spoke one thing&mdash;Christ as life for the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Teaching Things Other Than God&rsquo;s Economy Producing Questionings</h2>
<p>There is a danger today that we would be attracted by someone who teaches different things. For many years I have spoken the same thing&mdash;that all the riches of the Triune God are embodied in Christ, that Christ today has become the life-giving Spirit, and that the life-giving Spirit dwells in our spirit so that the Triune God can dispense Himself into us. Some saints may be bored of hearing this. If an eloquent speaker comes along who can tell interesting stories and speak concerning deep spiritual matters, many saints, especially the young ones, may welcome such a speaker and even idolize him.</p>
<p>To know the truth is not easy. Sometimes we think that we know it when we actually do not. A good Bible teacher may come along who does not teach from the Old Testament but teaches from the New Testament. He may teach foot-washing according to John 13. Foot-washing is not an Old Testament teaching but a New Testament teaching. Such a brother may rebuke all the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, saying, &ldquo;Brothers, God has given me a burden to tell you one thing&mdash;that the local churches have neglected foot-washing. In John 13 the Lord Jesus set an example for us and charged us to wash one another&rsquo;s feet. How poor all the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are, for the saints never wash one another&rsquo;s feet.&rdquo; We need to discern such speaking.</p>
<p>Some things in the New Testament are not part of God&rsquo;s economy. First Timothy 1:4 indicates that teachings other than God&rsquo;s economy produce questionings. Therefore, we know that foot-washing is not part of God&rsquo;s economy, because teaching it will immediately produce questionings. First, the saints will ask how to wash one another&rsquo;s feet. They will wonder if brothers should wash only other brothers&rsquo; feet and sisters other sisters&rsquo; feet. There will be disagreement on this issue. Another question will be where to wash one another&rsquo;s feet&mdash;publicly or privately? Different teachings, such as foot-washing, always produce questionings.</p>
<p>Once questionings come in, confusion and division will quickly follow. Therefore, a person who teaches differently only creates trouble. He may present a New Testament teaching, yet he will open the door for questions. By speaking only once concerning a different teaching, he will open the door for all the saints to begin to talk about the matter. They may forget to pray and contact the Lord and may instead spend their time talking to one another on the phone concerning the teaching of foot-washing. Some may say, &ldquo;Foot-washing is a wonderful teaching. This brother is full of love. Brother Lee does not have much love.&rdquo; Such teachings open the door for many opinions to come in. Some may say, &ldquo;Foot-washing is not necessary.&rdquo; Others may say, &ldquo;Foot-washing is surely good. Everyone should try it at least once. If the sisters wash the other sisters&rsquo; feet just once, they will be humbled and will open themselves to the other sisters. I have tried this&mdash;it is marvelous, full of loving affection. Let us all try it. If we wash one another&rsquo;s feet, our hearts will open to one another.&rdquo; There may be additional questions regarding the way to practice foot-washing. Everyone will have different opinions. This proves that some things even in the New Testament do not belong to God&rsquo;s economy. To refrain from practicing foot-washing does not damage God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Whenever someone presents a particular teaching among us, even one based on the New Testament, we need to ask, &ldquo;Does this belong to God&rsquo;s economy? Does this minister Christ to the saints?&rdquo; We may realize that, rather than ministering Christ, it produces questions and opens the door for different opinions. The ministry in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy speaks only of Christ for the church and ministers Christ as life to the church. We should not discuss anything that produces questions. Discussing whether it is proper to use wine or grape juice at the Lord&rsquo;s table, for example, does not minister life to anyone, but it causes much disputation. We need to learn to avoid bringing up anything that will stir up different opinions. Ministering Christ as life for the church and to the church will never cause any opinions to rise up. Therefore, we must all learn to speak the same thing, that is, Christ as life for the church. We should not speak anything different from God&rsquo;s economy.</p><h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Economy Being His Dispensing<br />
of Himself into His Chosen People<br />
to Be Their Life, Nature, and Being<br />
to Produce the Church, the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>Now we must see what God&rsquo;s economy is. The word <em>economy</em> in 1 Timothy 1:4 denotes an arrangement or an administration for dispensing. God&rsquo;s economy is God&rsquo;s arrangement, God&rsquo;s administration, to dispense Himself into His chosen people. When we drink a certain beverage, it is dispensed into us and eventually becomes a part of our being. This illustrates how God dispenses Himself into all His chosen people so that He may become their very being. This dispensing is what is meant by the word <em>economy.</em> The New Testament ministry, <em>the</em> ministry, always ministers God&rsquo;s economy, which is God dispensing Himself into His believers to be their life, nature, and being to produce the church, the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>We must speak concerning only this one thing. We should avoid speaking about anything that distracts God&rsquo;s people from His economy. For this reason, we need to be careful not to bring in any kind of concept. In recent years there have been many &ldquo;flows&rdquo; among us. A different flow comes from every different concept. Thus, in order to avoid trouble and confusion, we should not use the word <em>flow</em> in this way. These different &ldquo;flows&rdquo; are simply concepts that stir up many opinions. There are many different concepts, but there is only one economy of God. We should speak only of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING<br />
THE PILLAR AND BASE OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul says that the church is the pillar and base of the truth. He does not say that the apostles or the great teachers are the pillar and base of the truth. The church is composed of all the believers in Christ. The problem is that not all the believers know the truth. I am concerned that even in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery not all the saints know the truth. I believe that without reading the previous chapter in this book, most saints would not have a clear vision concerning the headship of Christ. This indicates that they do not know the truth. Because most Christians do not know the truth concerning the headship of Christ, every part of Christianity is an insult to the headship of Christ. Both the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches reject the headship of Christ. In his article &ldquo;The Waning Authority of Christ in the Churches,&rdquo; A. W. Tozer asks, &ldquo;What foreign mission board actually seeks to follow the guidance of the Lord?&rdquo; Tozer concludes that although many are working for Christ, the headship of Christ is entirely set aside and denied in all of Christianity. This regrettable situation exists because Christians do not know the truth.</p>
<p>Because many brothers and sisters in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery do not know the truth, things have happened in recent years that were very much contrary to the truth. Some things that have happened among us violated the truth to the uttermost. For instance, there is an undercurrent to organize all the churches together&mdash;not only the churches in the United States but also all the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery throughout the whole earth. <em>International coordination</em> is a term that has been used in the attempt to bring the elders of all the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery into one coordination. It seems wonderful to have such a oneness, but this kind of coordination will subtly lead to hierarchy. The brother who formed this coordination surely will eventually become a head, insulting the headship of Christ. Moreover, by producing distracting questionings, this kind of coordination robs the saints of their moment-by-moment contact with the Lord in prayer. Such serious consequences reveal why it is crucial that all the saints know the truth.</p>
<p>As we saw in the previous chapter, if a younger brother comes to us for fellowship, we need to be careful not to insult the headship of Christ. If we tell the brother what to do, we become the lord. We may have a good intention and a good heart to help the brother, but our good intention insults the headship of Christ. We need to honor the headship of Christ and respect Christ as the unique Lord by telling the brother, &ldquo;Brother, I dare not tell you what you need to do, even if I know, because I am not your lord. Your Lord, who is my Lord and the Lord of all of us, is the Lord Jesus Christ. I can pray with you and help you to pray, but you need to ask the Lord concerning this matter.&rdquo; There is a great difference between giving an answer and leading someone to seek the Lord. To give an answer is to assume that we have the lordship and the position to tell people what to do. Some brothers may defend themselves in this matter, saying, &ldquo;I do not have the intention to be the lord. My heart is good. I am simply teaching the younger brothers.&rdquo; We should not trust in our good heart. Regardless of whether our heart is good, we insult the headship of Christ if we act in this way. If someone is careless and accidentally injures another person, that person will be held responsible regardless of his or her intention or heart toward the injured person. A &ldquo;good heart&rdquo; does much damage in the church life. The church is not a matter of our good heart; it is a matter of the truth. We all need to know the truth.</p><h2 class="head2">The Difference between Doctrines and the Truth</h2>
<p>We need to see the difference between doctrines and the truth. Regrettably, most Christians consider doctrines to be the truth. However, the truth is the reality, and doctrines are only teachings. In the whole universe nothing is real but God. God is the reality. Anything that is God, of God, by God, or related to God is a reality. Doctrines are mere teachings; they are not the truth.</p>
<p>The Brethren teachers studied many doctrines concerning the Lord&rsquo;s table. They studied how often to have the Lord&rsquo;s table, who is qualified to participate in the Lord&rsquo;s table, and how to serve the bread and the cup. These matters are all doctrines. They are not the truth in the Lord&rsquo;s table. The truth in the Lord&rsquo;s table is the Head and the Body, with the death and resurrection of the Head. When we come to the table, we see the wine separated from the bread, which displays the death of Christ by symbolizing the separation of the blood and the body of Christ in His death. We see also that the bread is a loaf composed of fine flour made from many grains of wheat, which displays Christ&rsquo;s Body in resurrection. At the table we can see the Body (1 Cor. 10:17), and through the Body we can see the Head. Thus, the Head and the Body, with the death and resurrection of the Head, are the truth in the Lord&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>The Brethren also learned many doctrines concerning baptism. They studied who should baptize others, who should be baptized, and when, where, in what kind of water, in what name, and how many times they should be baptized. They also studied whether one should be baptized by immersion or by sprinkling and whether someone should go backward, forward, or straight down into the water. All these matters are surely doctrines. We are not here for doctrines; we are here for the truth. The truth in baptism is the death and resurrection of Christ. Romans 6:3-4 says, &ldquo;Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life.&rdquo; We need to see the truth of the death of Christ and the truth of the resurrection of Christ in baptism.</p>
<p>There are many doctrines in the Bible, especially in the New Testament, but within the doctrines there is the truth, the reality. Those who lack vision and are shallow can see only the doctrines; it is difficult for them to see the truth. We need to know the truth. The need for a church to have a specific number of elders is a doctrine. We need to see the truth concerning why the eldership is plural. The plurality of the eldership indicates that among God&rsquo;s people today there is no official, permanent, or organizational leadership because in the New Testament the headship of Christ has been fully completed. God recognizes only one Head, that is, Christ. This is the truth that we need to know concerning the plurality of the eldership.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Conducting Ourselves in the Church<br />
in a Time of Degradation<br />
by Knowing and Bearing the Truth</h2>
<p>The church is the pillar and base of the truth, not the pillar and base of doctrine. Therefore, in order for the church to be strong and healthy, all the saints must know the truth. The saints, as a corporate Body, must bear the truth, not doctrine. Doctrines confuse people and bring in divisive opinions. Truth never divides people but always builds people together. Hence, the way to conduct ourselves in the church in a time of degradation is to know the truth and to bear the truth.</p>
<p>If we know the truth, we will not care for doctrines such as whether wine or grape juice should be served at the Lord&rsquo;s table. At the Lord&rsquo;s table we should care only for the truth of the death and resurrection of Christ and the Body of Christ. The one loaf shows the one Body, and the truth of the one Body kills all divisive thoughts. If we have seen the truth of the one loaf, which signifies the one Body, we will never dare to make any division. However, if we dispute concerning the doctrine of what kind of bread to use, the more we dispute, the more we will be divided. If we argue about doctrines and neglect the truth, there will be no oneness but only divisions.    </p>
<p>We should not care for the outward form of baptism. Rather, we should care for the reality of the death of Christ. We need to see that we have been baptized into the reality of the death of Christ. We should not care for the kind of water that should be used for baptism. This is merely a doctrine. We should care only for the truth. Doctrines cause confusion and divide, but truth unites and builds up. Whenever we touch the truth, there will be no confusion or division. Whenever we pay attention to doctrines, however, we will surely cause trouble. If we know and bear the truth, we will never be carried about by winds of teaching (Eph. 4:14).</p>
<p>If we know the truth, we will not care for the outward form of baptism. When we baptize new believers, we need to put them into the death of Christ, not merely into a certain kind of water. We should not care for the doctrine of what kind of water should be used; we should care only for the truth. If we care for the doctrines concerning baptism and neglect the truth, there will be no exercise of the spirit, no prayer, and no exercise of faith. We will do things merely according to dead letters (2 Cor. 3:6). This is the doctrinal way to practice baptism. On the other hand, if we care for the truth, we will realize that we need to pray and exercise our spirit when we baptize someone. We will say to the one whom we are baptizing, &ldquo;Brother, I am going to put you into the death of Christ. Therefore, we need to pray.&rdquo; Then we will say to all the saints, &ldquo;This new believer needs to be baptized into the death of Christ, and we need to pray to make this experience real. I need to exercise my faith, and you all need to pray to strengthen my spirit. In this way we can all baptize him into the death of Christ.&rdquo; Speaking in this way makes a difference; it strengthens our faith, stirs up our spirit, helps bring others into life, and never causes any division. However, if we care for doctrines, even in one small matter, we will immediately be divided.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERY OF GODLINESS,<br />
GOD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH,<br />
REFERRING TO BOTH CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>First Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;Great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh, / Justified in the Spirit, / Seen by angels, / Preached among the nations, / Believed on in the world, / Taken up in glory.&rdquo; Most Christian teachers mistakenly think that this verse refers only to Christ. However, Christ&rsquo;s ascension, His being taken up in glory, preceded His being preached among the nations and believed on in the world. Therefore, since &ldquo;taken up in glory&rdquo; is the last item in this verse, it must refer not only to the ascension of Christ but also to the rapture of the church. This is a strong proof that this verse refers not only to Christ but also to the church. Yes, Christ is the manifestation of God in the flesh, but today the church is also the manifestation of God in the flesh. We are still in the flesh, but when we meet together in the spirit, God is manifested among us. The manifestation of God in the flesh is godliness. Godliness is simply God manifested in us.</p>
<p>We must take care of godliness, especially in a time of the church&rsquo;s degradation. Various differing concepts have recently crept into some churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The saints in certain localities argue about attending movies and sporting events. Some of the disputing ones say, &ldquo;If you say, &lsquo;Do not go to movies or sporting events,&rsquo; you are legal. If you say, &lsquo;You must come to the Sunday morning meeting,&rsquo; you are religious.&rdquo; They claim that they are liberated from all legalities and bondage. If the Spirit inspires them, they go to the meeting; if not, they do not go. If we try to argue with them, we will fall into their snare and be clouded because they are skillful in arguing.</p>
<p>I will give a simple illustration that will put those who argue in this way to shame. Suppose on Sunday morning I do not feel inspired by God to go to the meeting, and I decide to play basketball instead. If a brother sees me, he will not see godliness. We should not care for what is right or wrong, legal or illegal, religious or unreligious. We should care only for godliness. By playing basketball only once on a Sunday morning, I would lose any power to speak the word of God. If I come to speak to the saints Sunday evening after playing basketball Sunday morning, my speaking will be without impact. All the saints will wonder, &ldquo;Is this a man of God?&rdquo; I will give another illustration. If the saints see me entering a movie theater, they will not be edified, regardless of the kind of movie it is. Therefore, this is not godliness. We should care not for any opinions or concepts but only for godliness, God manifested in the flesh.</p>
<p>Some saints have said, &ldquo;To drink alcohol is all right. Do not be so legal. You need to be liberated from legalities and drink. We do not drink strong drinks; we drink only beer. Let us all go to a bar and drink beer.&rdquo; Some even say, &ldquo;We enjoy a happy church life by drinking beer together.&rdquo; This illustrates that we must not exercise our mentality to consider whether things are legal, illegal, liberated, or bound. If we exercise our mind, we will become lost in a forest. We simply need to consider whether doing something is godliness, the manifestation of God in the flesh. If we discern matters in this way, we will immediately be clear that we should not go to a bar, play basketball on Sunday morning, or go to a movie theater. It does not matter if we say, &ldquo;I am not going to see evil movies; I am going to see the best educational movies.&rdquo; Using the label of &ldquo;educational&rdquo; does not mean much. As long as we enter a theater, people will have a bad impression of us. We need to avoid even the appearance of evil. Even if we are going to see a movie about Jesus, simply going to a theater has the appearance of evil. We are here for the manifestation of God in the flesh, that is, for godliness. I would not do anything or go to any place that gives people an impression that is not the manifestation of God in the flesh.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HEALTHY WORDS AND HEALTHY TEACHING</h2>
<p>Finally, the Epistles to Timothy mention healthy words and healthy teaching four times (1 Tim. 1:10; 6:3; 2 Tim. 1:13; 4:3). In the church life we must discern whether the speaking is healthy or killing, damaging, or poisoning. If we practice this, we will not be misled by eloquence or by enticing words. Regardless of how eloquent the speaking is or how enticing the words are, if the teaching and the words are not healthy, we must reject them. If the words and teaching are healthy, they will minister life to our being. We may not have much knowledge, but we all have a taste. We know what is sweet and what is bitter. We must take care of the healthy words and healthy teaching. We should not measure or discern any speaking according to eloquence. We may easily be deceived by eloquent words (Rom. 16:18; 1 Cor. 2:4; Col. 2:4). We should care not for eloquence but for healthiness. We must always ask ourselves, &ldquo;Is this word healthy?&rdquo; We should take in only healthy words and healthy teaching.</p>
<p>In summary, the Epistles to Timothy reveal that we need to take care of four major items&mdash;God&rsquo;s economy, the truth, godliness, and healthy words and healthy teaching. We should not care for different teachings, doctrines, disputations, arguments, concepts, or eloquence. If we care for these things, we will be misled. Rather, we need to simply take care of the four basic, solid items of God&rsquo;s economy, the truth, godliness, and healthy words and healthy teaching.</p></body></html>
