   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. But the Indirect Move in His Old Creation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for the Preparation of His Direct Move</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>in His New Creation for His Eternal Economy</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's move with men and among men was just the indirect move in His old creation for the preparation of His direct move in His new creation for His eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why the church is not mentioned in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church was a hidden mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's eternal economy was never directly touched in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's economy in the New Testament is absolutely unique.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Old Testament, you cannot see God's move for His eternal economy directly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God did a lot indirectly to prepare for the day when He could come to do the direct work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The New Testament opens with the genealogy of Jesus Christ in Matthew 1, and His genealogy is of forty-two generations.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Each generation was a preparation for Jesus' coming.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to consider the Old Testament as a preparation for God's move in man in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If God had not created the heavens and the earth with billions of items, how could man exist?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man's existence, and man's existence in the Old Testament was for the generations to bring forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, we may say that the forty-two generations in Matthew 1 represent the entire Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fifty-seven years ago in 1936, I wrote a book entitled Gleanings of the Genealogy of Christ, and much of what I wrote there has been included in the notes of our present Recovery Version of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To write concerning the genealogy of Christ, you need to know the entire Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1 is a brief abstract of the Old Testament, which in itself is the detailed genealogy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To understand the genealogy in Matthew, we need to trace the origin and history of every incident.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must not forget that the Old Testament was a preparation for the direct move of God in man in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>GOD'S MOVE IN HIS INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to see the great significance of God's move in His incarnation John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many of those in Christianity today do not see this significance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When they think of Christ's birth, they may think only of the manger or of the pagan things associated with the celebration of Christmas.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today's Christianity has lost the genuine essence and genuine character of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It has become absolutely an outward, formal religion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to abandon our traditional, unscriptural concepts to see the pure revelation of the incarnated Triune God from the Holy Scriptures.</S>
