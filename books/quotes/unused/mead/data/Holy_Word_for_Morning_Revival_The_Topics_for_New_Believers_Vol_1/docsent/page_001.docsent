   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The moment we believe in the Lord, we should set apart the early morning for fellowshipping with God and for contacting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Song of Songs 7:12 shows us that the early morning is the best time to fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To fellowship means to open up our spirit and our mind to God and allow Him to enlighten us, speak to us, impress us, and touch us Psa 119:105, 147 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>During this time our hearts are drawn near to God, and we allow God to draw near to our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The early morning is the time for us to gather the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1 Manna is a type of Christ John 6:31-35, 48-51, 57-58 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the real manna, Christ was sent by God the Father v. 32 for God's chosen people to live by Christ v. 57 . 2 Just as manna sustained nearly two million people in the wilderness for forty years, so Christ as the real manna sustains the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand, the Lord Jesus is "the bread out of heaven"; on the other hand, He is "the bread of God," the One who came down out of heaven to be our food John 6:32-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>3</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What does it mean to eat the manna?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It means to enjoy Christ, to enjoy God's Word, and to enjoy His truth early in the morning every day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After we eat the manna, we have the strength to journey in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The early morning is the time to gather the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One will not be fed spiritually or be satisfied if he spends his early morning on other things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>4</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Falling Dew Signifying Christ as Grace Reaching Man</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Numbers 11:9 also tells us that manna came with the dew: "And when the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to spiritual experience the dew signifies daily grace, the grace we receive each day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Psalm 133:3 we read of "the dew of Hermon that came down upon the mountains of Zion."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The dew of Hermon signifies grace which descends from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hermon, a high mountain, signifies the heavens, the highest place, from which the dew descends.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The dew signifies the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Dew is different from rain, snow, or frost.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is softer than rain and not as cold as frost.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to Lamentations 3:22 and 23, God's compassions, like the dew, are new every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every morning the Lord's grace is as fresh as the dew.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Grace is God reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When God reaches us in a positive manner, full of mercy and compassion, He becomes grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Manna always comes by means of this grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever we experience the dew in the morning watch, we know that God reaches us and visits us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This visitation of God is the Lord as our grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we have dew as we read the Word in the morning, the Word truly is food to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not have the refreshing dew, we cannot have the manna that comes with the dew.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This picture of the manna and the dew is very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Truly a picture is better than a thousand words!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The dew in the morning is refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without this dew, this grace, we are very dry.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But with the dew we are watered and refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thank the Lord that manna comes not by itself, but with the dew.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every Morning Having a New Beginning</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore , the manna was sent in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Exodus 16:21 says that the children of Israel "gathered it morning by morning."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The fact that manna came in the morning indicates that it gives us a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because the earth revolves on its axis daily, every day we have a new beginning, a new turn.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thank the Lord that He sends the manna daily.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Every morning we can have a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>5</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Revived Every Morning by Experiencing Christ as the Rising Sun</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since we all love the Lord, and we know that the Lord desires to build up His Body by our growth in life, we must have a daily revival.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every morning after we rise up, we have to have a new start with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>6 In the morning when I wake up, I do not speak to man first.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rather, I speak to God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I would not open my mouth to any man before I open my mouth to God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I would say, "O Lord, I love You!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Lord Jesus, I am coming to You!"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every morning, all I do are these two things: calling on the name of the Lord and pray-reading His word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you would exercise yourself in these two things every morning, surely you will be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>7</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I like Paul's expression in 2 Corinthians 4:16 "day by day."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Christian life does not only have one day.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are being renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that day after day we have to be revived by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Yesterday morning we may have had a revival, but this morning we need another one, and tomorrow we need another one.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Every year we need three hundred sixty-five revivals to be renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>8</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Every morning we should experience Christ as the rising sun Luke 1:78 to be revived by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>9 The Christian revival does not occur in the afternoon or at sunset.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Rather, it occurs in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Christian life is not a sunset.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Rather, it is a dawning of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In fact, we ourselves are the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Judges 5:31 says, "May those who love Him be like the sun / When it rises in its might."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Proverbs 4:18 says, "But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, / Which shines brighter and brighter until the full day."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A Christian's life should be one that follows the moving of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When the sun rises, we should rise with it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We keep rising until the perfect full day, which is noon.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Christian life does not have afternoons.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>10 Sometimes, however, we experience a going down from noon.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But when we go to bed, the dawning of the sun is awaiting us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We can have a new start with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Every twenty-four hours there is a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>11 We Christians who are seeking after the Lord should live a life in which we have a new revival, a new sunrise, every day.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Every day Christ has to be our rising sun.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>12</S>
