<h2 class="head1">THE RESULTS OF<br />THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN</h2><p>Let us now consider four results of the breaking of the outer man. These correspond to the four benefits of exercising the spirit which we spoke of earlier.</p><h2 class="head2">Living before God</h2><p>The first benefit of the breaking of the outer man is the ability to live before the Lord all the time. Some people cannot have God's presence all the time because they only live in the realm of the outer man. The outer man is wild and estranged from God. This is the reason it needs to continually turn back to God. A person whose outer man is not broken constantly lives in the outer man. His outer man can deliver a sermon, but as soon as he returns home, he collapses. He has to wait until the next day before he can turn back to God again. The trouble with those who live in their outer man is that they cannot apply themselves to menial tasks, they cannot sweep the floor or clean the window, without being distracted by the works themselves. They live in the outer man. When they try to turn back to God, they have to spend much time making the turn. They cannot put their hands on any work because they quickly get carried away by the work. Only when the outer man is separated from the inner man, that is, when the spirit and the soul are separated, will a man be able to live before God. An unbroken man cannot remain in God for very long because the inner man is constantly distracted by the outer man. If the outer man and the inner man are separated, no outward distraction will interfere with the inner man any longer. The degree of separation determines the extent of the distraction. Those whose soul and spirit are not separated find the distractions threatening to their inner man. But the distractions only touch the outer man for those whose soul and spirit are separated; their inner man is not affected at all.</p><p>James and John accompanied the Lord to Jerusalem. On the way they found the Samaritans rejecting the Lord. The two asked the Lord if He wanted them to send fire from heaven to consume the Samaritans. They were trying to follow the footsteps of Elijah. But the Lord said, "You do not know of what kind of spirit you are" (Luke 9:55). Our spirit must be free from anxiety, anger, or temper. If our spirit is touched by these things, we will not be able to remain in God. This will present a problem to us, and we will know that our inner man and outer man have not been separated. God's children should not remain in this condition.</p><p>Some people go to the extreme of stopping all outward activities in an attempt to preserve God's presence. But this is not the breaking of the outer man. It merely hides the outer man; it is the exercise of a hermit. A man may shy away from society and shut himself up and recoil from all outward activities, but this does not result in the breaking of his outer man; he is still very much intact. Such a person can only live a life behind closed doors.</p><p>Those whose outer man is broken will not find their inner man being drawn away when they speak with others. Even if they are very busy, their inner man will not be disturbed. Even if they have not prayed for twelve hours, they will not need to turn back to God. It does not matter whether or not they retain God in their memory; they do not need to turn back to Him. They are the same whether they are working, reading the Bible, or praying. Their outer man and inner man have been separated one from the other. Outward things only touch their outer man; their inner man remains hidden within. They can keep themselves occupied for twenty-four hours a day and not lose their inward composure. When they work, only the outer man is working; the inner man is not touched. They can rebuke others in a severe way for two hours without needing to turn back to God afterwards. Their inner man is not drawn out; it continually remains in God. It is possible to be angry and not sin. The Lord was angry in the temple; His anger was a measured anger. This anger stayed in the outer realm; it did not touch His inward being. The Bible says that we should not let the sun go down on our indignation. This indignation is a measured indignation. Only those whose soul is separated from their spirit can exercise this kind of measured indignation. It is wrong when both the rebuked and the rebuking one have to make confession afterwards. However, a man has to make confession for doing something as good as preaching the gospel if he does it in the outer man.</p><p>The problem with God's children today is that their inner man is not strong enough and their outer man is not broken. It is useless for a man to deal with outward things without first dealing with the outer man. It is vain to try to separate oneself from the outward things without first separating himself from the outer man. A man must allow his outer man to break. Some people are like sun-baked mud; the more they are exposed to the sun, the harder they become. The more they are disciplined, the more stubborn they become. Such ones are useless. Revival means that God has a way through man. The more some people are touched, the harder and angrier they become. We should be like a wax candle. As soon as the sun shines on us, we should melt. We need to be dealt with. We are not those who seek outward exaltation; we are those who seek breaking. No matter how old or young we are, the more pliable we are, the more fragrance we have. For years God has been working on us with only one purpose in mind&mdash;to break us. We should not think that we can take any shortcut. We cannot be an unbridled Christian. We must accept the dealings, the breaking, before our inner man can be released.</p>
