AFTER GOD'S DEALING AND STRIPPING</H2><P>Psalm 84 comes after a number of psalms on God's dealing and stripping. Book 3 of the Psalms has much to say about God's dealing and stripping. For example, the psalmist in Psalm 73 was puzzled by God's dealing and stripping and did not become clear concerning this until he entered into the sanctuary of God. The situation of the psalmists in such psalms was nearly the same as Job's. The main difference is that whereas the psalmists experienced God's dealing and stripping, Job also experienced God's consuming.</P><P>Psalm 84 uses a special term&#151;"the valley of Baca." "Baca" means "weeping." Hence, the valley of Baca is the valley of weeping. This special term indicates that the psalmist had been dealt with by God and had been stripped by Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. BLESSED BEING THOSE<br>WHO DWELL IN GOD'S HOUSE</H2><P>Verse 4 says that those who dwell in God's house are blessed. Here "house" signifies the church as a totality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Psalmist Longing,<br>Even Fainting, for God's Habitations</H2><P>Verses 1 and 2 say, "How lovely are Your tabernacles,/ O Jehovah of hosts!/My soul longs, indeed even faints,/For the courts of Jehovah;/My heart and my flesh cry out/For the living God." God's tabernacles, God's habitations, signify the local churches. The psalmist was not yet in God's habitations, but he longed to be there. His longing was so great that he even fainted. This indicates to what extent the psalmist loved God's habitations.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_242.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_244.html">Next</a> </body></html>
