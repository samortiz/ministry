   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WATCHMAN NEE'S PERSONAL TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GIVEN AT KULANGSU, FUKIEN PROVINCE,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OCTOBER 18, 19361</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I was born into a Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I was the third child preceded by two sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because I had an aunt who had borne six daughters in succession, my paternal aunt was displeased when my mother bore two girls.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Chinese custom, males are preferred over females.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When my mother gave birth to two girls, people said she would probably be like my aunt, bearing half a dozen girls before bringing forth a boy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Though at that time my mother was not clearly saved, she knew how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So she spoke to the Lord, saying, "If I have a boy, I will present him to You."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord heard her prayer and I was born.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My father told me, "Before you were born, your mother promised to present you to the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I was saved in 1920 at the age of seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before being saved I experienced some mental conflict concerning whether or not to accept the Lord Jesus as my Savior and whether or not to become the Lord's servant.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For most people, the problem at the time of salvation is how to be delivered from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But for me, being saved from sin and my life career were linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I were to accept the Lord Jesus as my Savior, I would simultaneously accept Him as my Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He would deliver me not only from sin but also from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At that time I was afraid of being saved, for I knew that once I was saved I must serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of necessity, therefore, my salvation would be a dual salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was impossible for me to set aside the Lord's calling and to desire only salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I had to choose either to believe in the Lord and have a dual salvation or forfeit both.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For me to accept the Lord would mean that both events would take place simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the evening of April 29, 1920, I was alone in my room.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I had no peace of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whether I sat or reclined, I could find no rest, for within was this problem of whether or not I should believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My first inclination was not to believe in the Lord Jesus and not to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, that made me inwardly uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There was a real struggle within me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then I knelt down to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At first I had no words with which to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But eventually many sins came before me, and I realized that I was a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I had never had such an experience in my life before that time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I saw myself as a sinner and I also saw the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I saw the filthiness of sin and I also saw the efficacy of the Lord's precious blood cleansing me and making me white as snow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I saw the Lord's hands nailed to the cross, and at the same time I saw Him stretching forth His arms to welcome me, saying, "I am here waiting to receive you."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Overwhelmed by such love, I could not possibly reject it, and I decided to accept Him as my Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Previously, I had laughed at those who believed in the Lord, but that evening I could not laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, I wept and confessed my sins, seeking the Lord's forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After making my confession, the burden of sins was discharged, and I felt buoyant and full of inward joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was the first time in my life that I knew I was a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I prayed for the first time and had my first experience of joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There might have been some joy and peace before, but the experience after my salvation was very real.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Alone in my room that evening, I saw the light and lost all consciousness of my surroundings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I said to the Lord, "Lord, You have really been gracious to me."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this audience there are at least three schoolmates of mine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Among them is Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi, who can testify concerning what an ill-behaved student I was, as well as what a wonderful student I was in school.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the evil side, I often violated the school rules.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the good side, I was always first in every examination, because God had bestowed intelligence on me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>My essays were frequently posted on the bulletin board for exhibition.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At that time I was a youth with many grand dreams and many plans for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I considered my judgments sound.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I can humbly say that had I worked hard in the world, it would have been quite possible for me to have had great success.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>My schoolmates can also testify to this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But following my salvation many new things happened to me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All my previous planning became void and was brought to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>My future career was entirely abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For some this step might be easy, but for me, with many ideals, dreams, and plans, it was exceedingly difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>From the evening I was saved, I began to live a new life, for the life of the eternal God had entered into me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>My salvation and calling to serve the Lord took place simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Since that evening, I have never once had any doubts about being called.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>During that hour I decided on my future career once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I realized that, on the one hand, the Lord had saved me for my sake, and at the same time, He did so for His own sake.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He wanted me to obtain His eternal life, and He also wanted me to serve Him and be His co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As a boy I did not understand the nature of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When I was older, I considered it the most trifling and base of occupations.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In those days most preachers were employed by European or American missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They were servile subordinates to the missionaries and earned merely eight or nine dollars per month.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I had no intention of becoming a preacher nor even a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I could never have imagined that I would choose the profession of a preacher, a profession which I despised and considered trifling and base.</S>
