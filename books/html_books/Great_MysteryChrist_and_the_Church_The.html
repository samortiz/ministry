CONSIDERING OUR VISION</h1>
<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">REVELATION ON THE SURFACE<br />
VERSUS THE DEEP MYSTERY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 2:1-2, 6-15</h1>
<p>In the messages given in recent service trainings on the history of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we considered how God&rsquo;s revelation has been confirmed among us. In other words, we viewed God&rsquo;s revelation from the perspective of history. In this section of four chapters we will consider our vision, our revelation. Revelation and vision both refer to the same thing. From God&rsquo;s perspective there is revelation, but from our perspective there is vision. When God&rsquo;s intention is revealed to us, it becomes a vision. Therefore, as we are considering God&rsquo;s revelation from the perspective of history, we are really considering our vision.</p>
<p>Revelation and vision are two sides of the same thing. Everything has two sides: an outer side and an inner side. This is also true with human beings. Human beings appear one way outwardly but are a different way inwardly. For this reason, psychologists distinguish between the metaphysical and the physical aspects of man. The outer aspect is visible, but the inner aspect is invisible. The visible aspect is very simple, but the invisible aspect is mysterious. For example, it is easy to see that a man has ears, eyes, a nose, a mouth, shoulders, arms, hands, and feet. However, even though man is simple on the outside, he is mysterious and wonderful on the inside. The most mysterious thing within man is life. It is also mysterious that man possesses more than one life. Man has a physical life, which is his biological life. Concealed within man&rsquo;s physical life is his psychological life, which the Bible calls the soul-life. This life is deeper than man&rsquo;s biological life.</p>
<p>Believers have another life that is even deeper than their physical life or their psychological life. This is the divine, eternal life that we received when we were regenerated. This life is in our spirit. Every Christian has these three lives. The first life is the biological life, the physical life of our body. The second life is the soul-life, which is our self. The third life is the deepest; it is the eternal life in our spirit. As believers, we are not simple, because we have three kinds of life.</p>
<p>In the same principle, the revelation of the Bible has one appearance on the surface, but in its depths the Bible is a mystery. It is easy to perceive the outward appearance of the Bible, but it is not easy to know the inner content. When we meet someone for the first time, we know his height and outward appearance. But there are mysteries within him. He has a spirit and a soul, and his soul consists of his mind, emotion, and will. He also has a physical heart and a psychological heart. A believer is not simple, for he has three kinds of life. Likewise, the Bible has an outward appearance and an inner content. Its appearance is easy to read. The first sentence of the Bible says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&rdquo; (Gen. 1:1). Even an elementary-school student can read and understand this. However, this is only the surface of the Bible. Before reading the Bible, we did not know the origin of the heavens and the earth. But after reading the Bible, we are clear that God created the heavens and the earth. This is a revelation, but it is revelation on the surface. The superficial revelation is consistent from the beginning to the end of the Bible. We will now consider the main idea of the revelation on the surface of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION ON THE SURFACE OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The Bible clearly says that God is the source of all things. In the beginning God created the heavens, the earth, and man. The heavens, the earth, and man are the most important items in creation. The heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for man. God created a beautiful universe. However, there is a rebel, Satan, the devil, in the universe. Satan rebelled against God and seduced man to sin against God. As a result, the man, whom God created good, became fallen and was spoiled and corrupted to become evil and dark. God, however, did not forsake man. Because God loves and delights in man, He had a plan to save man. Before saving man, however, God gave the law. The law was written according to God in order to expose man&rsquo;s fallen condition. It is through the law that man knows sin and himself, and it is through the law that man also comes under God&rsquo;s compassion to seek God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>At the appointed time, which was about four thousand years after man was created, God sent His only begotten Son to become a man, who is called Jesus. He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years and tasted the sufferings and hardships of human life. After thirty-three and a half years He bore the sins of the world and was judged by God on the cross, where He shed His precious blood to redeem man. On the cross He also destroyed the devil. After His death on the cross He was buried, and on the third day He was raised from the dead. His being raised from the dead proves that He is the Lord of resurrection. He remained on the earth for forty days in order to be among the disciples, after which He ascended. Ten days later the Holy Spirit was poured out, and His disciples went to preach the gospel everywhere, bringing many sinners to repentance and salvation. Because salvation was complete and the Holy Spirit had descended, every sinner could hear the gospel and be moved to repent, believe, and receive salvation. When sinners believe in the Lord Jesus and call upon His name, their sins are immediately forgiven, and they are justified and regenerated by God. These believers remain on the earth to be the church in order to do God&rsquo;s will revealed in the Bible, thus pleasing and glorifying God.</p>
<p>One day the ascended Lord will rapture the overcoming believers to heaven. Then He will return to the earth with them in order to judge this world, terminate all the corruption in the world, and establish His kingdom&mdash;the millennial kingdom&mdash;for a thousand years. After the millennial kingdom of one thousand years God will deal with Satan, the old creation will pass away, and the new heaven and the new earth will be brought in. In the new heaven and the new earth God will be with His redeemed people forever, and man will enjoy eternal blessing. This is the revelation on the surface of the sixty-six books of the Bible. This is what every Christian believes. This is also what every messenger of the gospel has preached for the past two thousand years.</p>
<p>The revelation on the surface of the Bible is taught in seminaries and preached by most preachers. Everything that is taught among Christians is included in this revelation. Hence, most Christians believe that the Bible reveals only this much. However, this is only the surface of the content of the Bible. It is not the deep mystery in the Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">MOST CHRISTIANS UNDERSTANDING<br />
ONLY THE REVELATION<br />
ON THE SURFACE OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 2 says that Paul spoke God&rsquo;s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which none of the rulers of this age have known (vv. 7-8), and which eye has not seen, ear has not heard, and which has not come up in man&rsquo;s heart (v. 9). Paul spoke this word to the wisdom- and philosophy-seeking Greeks, and he seemed to be saying that even the greatest Greek philosopher could not imagine God&rsquo;s mystery. This mystery was hidden in the Bible, but Paul spoke this mystery to the saints. When he preached the gospel to sinners, he spoke the revelation on the surface, but once the sinners were saved, he spoke the deep mystery in the Bible. Today a person who reads the Bible several times may think that he knows the content of the Bible; however, he may not know the mystery in the Bible.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, the Pharisees and the scribes read the Old Testament, spoke on the Old Testament, and even adorned themselves with verses from the Old Testament. They thought that they knew the Bible. One day, however, they asked the Lord Jesus a difficult question, and He told them that they knew neither the Scriptures nor the power of God (Matt. 22:29). The Pharisees and scribes thought that they knew the Scriptures, but the Lord said that they did not know the Scriptures. They knew the letter of the Scriptures, but they did not know the power of God. The power of God is a mystery. The Scriptures contain not only letters but also the power of God. A person who thinks that he knows the Bible may understand only the letter of the Bible. Many seminary professors, missionaries, pastors, and Bible teachers expound the Bible and write commentaries, thinking that they understand the Bible. However, I am afraid that the Lord Jesus might say they do not know the Scriptures. Some among us have read the Bible many times and have even worn out several Bibles, but the Lord Jesus might also tell them, &ldquo;You do not know the Scriptures.&rdquo; It is possible for us to know the things on the surface but not know the deep things in the Bible.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in a Christian family, and all the schools I attended from elementary school to technical college were Christian schools. With such a Christian background I was very familiar with the revelation on the surface of the Bible. When I was young, my mother would tell us the story of Joseph in such a way that we would cry in sympathy for Joseph. My mother also told us stories from the Gospels. I heard these stories again when I attended Sunday school. Later, the pastor told the same stories in the Sunday service. After I was saved, I heard the stories again. However, I did not know the deep mystery in the Bible.</p>
<p>When I was about twenty years old, a nationally renowned preacher spent much of his time in northern China. One day he came to my hometown and gave a message concerning the Lord Jesus&rsquo; coming so that man may have life and may have it abundantly (John 10:10). I had never heard a message on such a topic; it seemed like a new term, a new truth to me. However, after the message I was still baffled concerning what life is and what it means to have life abundantly.</p>
<p>After I was saved, I loved the Lord and the Bible very much. I read and wore out several Bibles. I also sought the truth. One day I went to the strictest sect among the Brethren; they were renowned for their Bible exposition. There I treasured what I heard. The first thing that I heard was concerning the seventy weeks in Daniel 9. The seventy weeks are divided into seven weeks, sixty-two weeks, and the last week (vv. 24-27). The last week can be divided into two parts: the first three and a half years and the last three and a half years. Each three and a half years is forty-two months, which is a thousand two hundred and sixty days. Because I liked what I heard, I was with the Brethren for seven and a half years and heard about both prophecies and types. Concerning prophecies, they spoke of the great human image in Daniel 2 with its head of gold, arms of silver, abdomen of bronze, two legs of iron, two feet partly of iron and partly of clay, and ten toes (vv. 31-45). They also spoke of the four beasts in Daniel 7 and of the fourth beast that grew ten horns on its head (vv. 3-7). They said that the ten toes of the great human image are the ten horns of the fourth beast. Besides prophecies, they also spoke of types. I learned much concerning the various types in the Bible.</p>
<p>However, I did not hear about the Spirit, about life, or about Christ living in me. I did not hear about the church being the Body of Christ or about the Body being the one new man. Even though I was saved in 1925, it was not until 1932 that I began to see the deep mystery in the Bible. By then I was more than twenty-five years old. I was born in a Christian family, educated in Christian schools, and had heard sermons in Christianity from a young age, but I knew only the revelation on the surface of the Bible. I did not know the deep mystery in the Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DEEP MYSTERY IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>In considering our vision, we will not look at the revelation on the surface of the Bible, for many can recite this revelation. Our need is to consider the deep mystery in the Bible.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; Then we are told what God created on the first day. Chapter 1 also speaks of God&rsquo;s restoration and further creation. We can understand what God created when we read these verses. However, there is a mystery in this chapter, for verse 26 begins with &ldquo;God said, Let Us...&rdquo; This &ldquo;Us&rdquo; is a mystery. Is there one God or many Gods? To say that there are many Gods is heresy. But how can God refer to Himself as &ldquo;Us&rdquo;? This is a mystery.</p>
<p>In verse 26 God said, &ldquo;Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.&rdquo; Have we seen God&rsquo;s image or His likeness? Do we know that we were made in God&rsquo;s image, according to His likeness? This is a mystery. The Bible says that no one has seen God and that God is invisible (John 1:18; Col. 1:15; 1 Tim. 1:17). How can the invisible God have an image? If He has an image, can He be seen by men? Furthermore, what is the distinction between image and likeness? Theologians cannot research this matter thoroughly, nor can they give a clear explanation concerning this matter. Hence, Bible expositors cannot expound the word <em>Us</em> in Genesis 1:26, nor can they explain the words <em>image</em> and <em>likeness.</em> This proves that there is a mystery in Genesis 1 that is not easy to utter.</p>
<p>We need to ask, is man in the image of God or in the image of man? Is man according to the likeness of God or according to the likeness of man? It is correct to say that we are men, but man has the image of God and the likeness of God. Some theologians may think that it is a heresy, blasphemy, to say this. How can a small man dare to say that he bears God&rsquo;s image and likeness? But we know that this is not blasphemy; it is the revelation of a mystery in the Bible.</p>
<p>Genesis 1 says that the plants and animals are &ldquo;according to their kind&rdquo; (vv. 11-12, 21, 24-25). Dogs are according to the dog kind, horses are according to the horse kind, and cattle are according to the cattle kind. The same is true of grass, flowers, and trees. Peaches are according to the peach kind, apricots are according to the apricot kind, peonies are according to the peony kind, and chrysanthemums are according to the chrysanthemum kind. Everything is according to its kind. However, according to what kind is man? Is man according to mankind or God&rsquo;s kind? The Bible says that man was made in God&rsquo;s image, according to God&rsquo;s likeness. Therefore, man was created according to God&rsquo;s kind. We have been criticized because we speak according to the Bible and say that man is according to God&rsquo;s kind. People say that we speak heresy. Our critics say that because man is man, not God, how can man be according to God&rsquo;s kind? They say that only God is according to God&rsquo;s kind; therefore, man cannot be according to God&rsquo;s kind. Nevertheless, the Bible says that man was made in God&rsquo;s image, according to God&rsquo;s kind. Man being according to God&rsquo;s kind is a mystery in the Bible.</p>
<p>It is not simple to understand the truth in the Bible. The superficial revelation of the Bible is easy to understand, but the mystery in the Bible is difficult to understand. I have given many messages in the United States concerning the mingling of God and man. Some say that these messages are heresy, because I am saying that man can be God. However, the Bible says that man was made in God&rsquo;s image, according to God&rsquo;s likeness. Let us use a glove as an example. A glove is made in the image of a hand with the purpose of containing the hand. God made man in His image with the purpose of entering into man. Romans 11 reveals that the believers have been grafted into God (vv. 17-24), and chapter 9 says that man is a vessel to contain God (vv. 23-24). We would not put a square object in a round box. A vessel is shaped according to the object it is to contain. The beginning of the Bible speaks of God making man in His own image, according to His own likeness, to indicate that one day God would become one with man.</p>
<p>Some believe that the Bible is concerning God creating man; God sending His Son to save fallen man; man&rsquo;s sins being forgiven; man repenting, believing, and being saved; and man eventually going to heaven. This, however, is the surface of the Bible. The Bible is concerning the deeper revelation. The first chapter of the Bible reveals that one day God would be joined with man, become one with man. God wants to be man&rsquo;s content; therefore, He made man in His image and likeness so that man would be a vessel to contain Him. When God enters into man, He is joined with man, becomes one with man. A cup that contains coffee is a coffee cup. Similarly, a man who contains God is a God-man.</p>
<p>Unless a person contains God, he is empty, being without content. Those who are not saved are without content, and their lives are meaningless. But those who are saved are not empty, meaningless, or without content. We are full of content, and our content is God Himself. This is not being proud; this is a fact. Believing in Jesus is not a matter of being saved to go to heaven; rather, believing in Jesus is a matter of being saved to contain God. When we contain God, we become God-men. Our vessels were formerly a mess, filthy, and defiled. But now that the precious blood of the Lord Jesus has redeemed us, we are washed, we are clean, and the divine life has come into us to be our content. We are God-containing vessels. This is the deep mystery in the Bible.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2 God put man in front of a tree. That tree has a special name; it is called the tree of life (vv. 8-9). In putting man in front of the tree of life, God seemed to be telling man, &ldquo;You have My image and My likeness, but you do not have My life. At best, you are a photograph of Me.&rdquo; The man whom God made was like a photograph of God; he did not have God&rsquo;s life. God wanting man to take the tree of life indicates that He wanted to enter into man in order to be man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>The truth in the Bible is that God wants man to receive Him. The Gospel of John says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,...and the Word was God&rdquo; (1:1). One day the Word became flesh (v. 14). This incarnated Word lived as a man among His disciples and said, &ldquo;I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever&rdquo; (6:51). By linking these verses with Genesis 2, we see that God created man as a vessel with the intention of being received by man. Therefore, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (John 6:57).</p>
<p>Eating the Lord is also a mystery that the majority of Christians do not know. In 1958 I was in Taipei and spoke on John 6:57. From then on we have been speaking of eating, drinking, and enjoying God. One time after a meeting a brother who is a professor said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, your message today was good, but one word was very barbaric. It is barbaric to talk about eating Jesus.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Brother, I am not the one who is barbaric. This is what the Lord Jesus Himself said.&rdquo; This shows that even though we know the Bible on the surface, we do not actually know the Bible. Many Christians do not know the truth of eating Jesus.</p>
<p>Those who study nutrition say, &ldquo;You are what you eat.&rdquo; In other words, we are an aggregate of the food that we eat. The rice, bread, fish, meat, eggs, vegetables, and fruits that we eat become us after they are digested. This mystery is in the Bible: God wants to be the bread of life to man. Only after He is our bread of life can He be our real content.</p>
<p>The beginning of the Bible matches the ending of the Bible. In Revelation 2 the Lord promised, &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God&rdquo; (v. 7). At the end of Revelation the Lord also promised, &ldquo;Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life&rdquo; (22:14). The tree of life is God Himself. To wash one&rsquo;s robes is to keep one&rsquo;s conduct clean through the washing of the blood of the Lamb (7:14; 1 John 1:7). This is how we are qualified to enjoy God. This is a deep mystery in the Bible; it is not the revelation on the surface.</p>
<p>Not only does the beginning of the Bible match its ending; the entire Bible is consistent. In John 15 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him...&rdquo; (v. 5). This is a mystery. This is a picture of grafting. The Lord is the vine, and we are the branches. In our natural birth we are not branches in the Lord; we were grafted into Him when we were regenerated (cf. Rom. 11:17, 24). Grafting unites the life of two trees and mingles them into one in order to bear fruit. Grafting is a simple example, but the reality contained in this example is not simple. This is the way that we abide in the Lord, and He abides in us. We human beings are abiding in God, and the Triune God is abiding in us. This is a mystery.</p>
<p>After the Gospel of John and the book of Acts we come to Paul&rsquo;s Epistles. The first Epistle of Paul is the Epistle to the Romans. Romans 6:5 says, &ldquo;If we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection.&rdquo; This is a mystery within a mystery. The Bible scholar F. L. Godet once said that the words <em>grown together</em> in this verse refer to a union in life. In such a life union we may partake of Christ&rsquo;s life and characteristics and thus grow in life. This is a deep mystery, not superficial revelation.</p>
<p>In chapter 8 Paul speaks of the law of the Spirit of life (v. 2). This is a deeper mystery. There is a law that regulates us from within. This law is the law of the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of life is the Triune God. The Triune God is the Spirit of life, and He has become a law within us. This is exceedingly mysterious. In Paul&rsquo;s Epistles the word <em>mystery</em> is used many times. Paul says that Christ is the mystery of God, that the church is the mystery of Christ, and that Christ and the church are the great mystery (Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4; 5:32). These are matters of the Spirit, for the Triune God has become the life-giving Spirit, who is now dwelling in our spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; Rom. 8:11).</p>
<p>In Revelation John speaks of seven golden lampstands, which are the seven churches (1:20). This is also a mystery. In Revelation the Spirit of God is the seven Spirits (v. 4), and the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the Lamb (5:6). This is much more mysterious. The ultimate manifestation of the Triune God is the life-giving Spirit, who is the seven Spirits, and the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the second person of the Trinity. The church was produced in the New Testament age. The church is a lampstand, and the lampstand is the mystery of the church. Ultimately, the church becomes the New Jerusalem, which is the mystery of mysteries, the totality of all the mysteries. In the New Jerusalem there are the tree of life, the river of water of life, the man-creating God, and the created man. The New Jerusalem is the totality, the aggregate, of all the mysteries. This is the mystery in the Bible.</p>
<p>Are we Christians with merely the revelation on the surface of the Bible, or do we know the deep mystery? Our being Christians is also a mystery. Eventually, we will become the totality of mysteries, the New Jerusalem. Then we will enjoy all the mysteries. This is the deep mystery in the Bible. Paul told the Corinthians that he preached this mystery, which eye has not seen, ear has not heard, and which has not come up in man&rsquo;s heart, yet God has revealed it to us (1 Cor. 2:9-10). This is not the revelation on the surface of the Bible but the mystery hidden in the Bible. This is what the Lord wants to recover in His recovery today.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING GOD AND MAN<br />
AND BEING THE PORTION OF THE SAINTS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD DESIRING TO BE MAN&rsquo;S CONTENT</h2>
<p>We have seen that the Triune God desires that man, as His vessel, would contain Him; He desires to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life and content (Gen. 1:26; 2:8-9; Rom. 9:23-24). This is the deep mystery in the Bible. A person who does not contain God is an empty vessel, having an appearance of a vessel but no genuine content. God&rsquo;s intention is to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life, to live in man, and to be lived out from man. Thus, God and man are not only joined but also mingled. God and man have become one; God is the content, and man is the expression. This is glorious and meaningful.</p>
<p>The human race is corrupt and society is dark because people are empty within and do not know the meaning of their human life. They lack a stabilizing force and a rich content. However, as genuine Christians, we are different because we have God within us. Hence, we can declare, &ldquo;Hallelujah, we have God in us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was saved when I was nineteen years old. Before my salvation I was an empty vessel. When I consider those nineteen years, I can only sigh (Psa. 90:9). Because I was born and raised in a Christian home and educated in Christian schools, I constantly heard Christian doctrine. Once, a few classmates entered a Buddhist temple, and I told my classmates, &ldquo;This god is an idol, a false god. Only the God in whom we Christians believe is true. He is the unique Creator and the source of all things. We need to worship Him.&rdquo; Even though I testified for God in such a way, He had not yet entered into me; I was an empty man. I knew that God is true, but for me He only existed in the heavens; He was not in me. He filled the universe, but He did not fill me. Because I was still empty, I was happy to accompany my classmates or colleagues to Chinese operas, and I found playing cards interesting.</p>
<p>Nineteen years of emptiness is a long time, but it is merely a quarter of my present age. A quarter of my life was empty, without God, without content, and without power, but three-quarters of my life has been filled with glory, sweetness, and joy. Some people say that I am always full of energy and that I do not look like an old man. It is obvious that I am an old man, but while I am outwardly getting older, I am getting younger within. Our God is evergreen. He is from eternity (93:2), but He is not old. He is like a green fir tree (Hosea 14:8). Because such a God has become my content, I am becoming younger even while I am physically getting older. I am full of joy.</p>
<p>The younger saints are blessed because they can be filled with God in their youth. However, in addition to being filled with God, we also need to be saturated with God and allow Him to be expressed through us. One of our hymns says, &ldquo;Thy Spirit will me saturate, / Every part will God permeate&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #501). I hope that the younger saints will be saturated and permeated with God until God can be seen in every part of their being, that is, until God is in their tongue, eyes, shoulders, walk, and words. Then they will be young persons who truly belong to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE EXPLANATION<br />
OF THE MYSTERIOUS GOD</h2>
<p>The God who has entered into us is a mystery. Every intelligent person knows that there must be a Sovereign Being in the universe. This Sovereign Being must not be simple and must possess complete wisdom and the highest virtues. We know this from looking at the man whom God created. The man whom God created is lovely in his appearance and wonderful in his makeup. Why does the nose not point upward? Why do the eyebrows not grow under the eyes? Man would be ugly if the nose pointed upward and the eyebrows grew under the eyes. Not only so, dust would fall into the nostrils, and sweat would flow into the eyes. Just by looking at a mirror we know that man is the most beautiful creature. No one can improve the human face that God designed. Architecture and clothing are always changing and improving, but the structure of the human body cannot be changed or improved. It is not good to have three shoulders or four ears. Who created our hands, which are capable and very beautiful? Our parents gave birth to us, but they did not determine our appearance. Our appearance was designed by God. Just by looking at ourselves, we can prove the existence of God.</p>
<p>God is not simple, but where is He? Some people say that He is in heaven, because the Bible says so (Amos 9:6; Matt. 5:34). However, He is not only in heaven; He is also with and in us (28:20; 2 Tim. 4:22). God is a mystery, and this mystery is Christ. Paul speaks of the &ldquo;full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ&rdquo; (Col. 2:2). This means that everything of God&rsquo;s being is wonderful and mysterious, but this mystery is embodied in Christ (v. 9). As the embodiment of God, Christ explains the mystery of God and expresses the wonderful God (John 1:18). Apart from Christ, no one can see God (14:7-9). God is in Christ (v. 10), and Christ is the practical God, the manifested God, and the explained God.</p>
<p>How is Christ the mystery of God? In the book of Colossians Paul reveals many points concerning Christ. Every point in this book is mysterious and incomprehensible, but we can receive and enjoy these points.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE PORTION OF THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>Christ is a mystery, and He is the &ldquo;portion of the saints&rdquo; (1:12). The word <em>portion</em> is like the family inheritance that is divided among a few brothers. Christ is our portion; our portion before God is Christ Himself.</p>
<p>Verse 13 says that Christ is the Son of God&rsquo;s love. This means that Christ is the treasure of God&rsquo;s heart and His delight. Christ is the treasure of God&rsquo;s heart, the beloved Son of God. God gave His heart&rsquo;s treasure to us to be our portion. Unbelievers often ask what they will gain by believing in Jesus. They do not understand when I say that by believing in Jesus we gain Him as our portion. Not only do unbelievers not understand this statement; even many Christians do not understand it. Our portion is God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s treasure and His greatest delight. As an illustration, an old lady may have treasured a large diamond ring her whole life. Even though she is willing to give up her life, she will not give up her ring, because it is the treasure of her heart. Before she dies, she will leave her heart&rsquo;s treasure, her ring, to the daughter she loves the most so that the ring becomes her daughter&rsquo;s portion. Likewise, God gave us what He loves the most so that His treasure would be our portion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BELOVED SON BEING THE IMAGE OF GOD<br />
AND THE FIRSTBORN OF ALL CREATION</h2>
<p>Verse 15 says that Christ is &ldquo;the image of the invisible God.&rdquo; God is invisible. For this reason, John says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&rdquo; (John 1:18). The beloved Son is the image of the Father, the declaration of the Father. Colossians 1:15 also says that the Son is &ldquo;the Firstborn of all creation.&rdquo; According to Greek grammar, &ldquo;the image of...God&rdquo; in this verse is &ldquo;the Firstborn of all creation.&rdquo; The word <em>Firstborn</em> implies the birth of someone who did not exist. A person who exists does not need to be born. Only a person who does not exist can be born. As the beloved Son of God, Christ exists from eternity. Since Christ exists from eternity, why does He need to be born? In the universe God is self-existing and ever-existing; He is without beginning and without end. The self-existing and ever-existing God does not need to be born. Only a creature needs to be born. Everything created by God comes into being through birth. Being born does not refer to regeneration. Thus, the word <em>Firstborn</em> in this verse means that the self-existing and ever-existing God produced a creature.</p>
<p>This verse poses a problem to theologians. They do not understand how Christ, who is self-existing and ever-existing, could become a creature. Hence, they do not believe that Christ is a creature. It is true that Christ is the self-existing and ever-existing God; He is without beginning and without end, thus having no need to be born. However, one day Christ became a man and put on a body of flesh and blood. The Bible says that He &ldquo;became flesh&rdquo; (John 1:14). Is man a creature? Was the body of flesh and blood a created body? Is Christ a genuine man? Was the body of flesh and blood that He partook of genuine? We must acknowledge that Christ is a genuine man, possessing the flesh of a genuine man. He partook of genuine flesh and blood. Therefore, He is a creature. He possessed a created body of flesh and blood.</p>
<p>If Christ had remained merely as God and had never become a man, He would have been merely the Creator and not have become a creature. However, because He became flesh, partaking of flesh and blood, He is a genuine man, and man is a creature. Therefore, Christ is not only the Creator; He is also a creature. There are two aspects of Christ&rsquo;s person: He is God the Creator, and He is man a creature.</p>
<p>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation. The word <em>Firstborn</em> has been the source of much debate among theologians. They say that although Christ became a man, He was not the first man, because mankind existed for four thousand years before Christ; millions of people precede Christ. According to the genealogy in Matthew 1, beginning with Abraham, there were forty-one generations before Christ. If we include Adam, there were more than seventy generations before Christ. Christ is the descendant of more than seventy generations of people. How can He be the Firstborn? The human mind is unable to understand this. Therefore, theologians, in an attempt to reconcile this truth, say that Christ was a man but that He was not the first man. Hence, it is not right to say that He is the Firstborn. They say it is correct only to say that He came after the seventieth generation of mankind. For this reason the translators of the Chinese Union Version did not dare to translate Colossians 1:15 accurately. They translated this verse as &ldquo;the Firstborn, before all creation.&rdquo; However, in the original text Paul clearly says &ldquo;the Firstborn of all creation.&rdquo; Christ has the first place in all things because He is a creature in God&rsquo;s creation and the Firstborn of all creation.</p>
<p>In January 1934 Brother Watchman Nee held an overcomer conference in Shanghai. For ten days he gave two messages a day on two subjects: Christ as the centrality and universality of God and God&rsquo;s overcomers. Brother Nee asked me to compile the notes of the messages and publish them in Issue No. 34 of <em>The Present Testimony</em> in March and April of 1934 (see <em>The Collected Works of Watchman Nee,</em> vol. 11, pp. 713-781). In these messages Brother Nee spoke concerning Christ in creation. He said that in creation, the Son is the Firstborn of creation: &ldquo;Christ was incarnated to be a man in order to come from the position of the Creator to the position of the creature. He had to take on a created body before He could die for man and for all things. There must first be Bethlehem before there can be Golgotha. There must first be the manger before there can be the cross&rdquo; (p. 740). Forty-seven years ago Brother Nee saw this light and spoke clearly concerning this truth.</p>
<p>The Christ who is our life is not only God but also a man. He is not only the Creator but also a creature. On the one hand, Christ in us is our life today, but on the other hand, He is our hope for the future (Col. 3:4; 1:27). Christ is God and also a man. He is the Creator and also a creature. Christ is mysterious.</p>
<p>Because Christ is the Creator and a creature, when He becomes our life, He gives us His humility as well as His dignity. Christ in us is not simple. Concerning His dignity, He is the Creator; concerning His humility, He is a creature. Because we have His life, we are dignified when dignity is needed, and we are humble when humility is needed. When we are low, He uplifts us, and when we are high, He brings us down. He makes us neither high nor low. We are noble when dignity is required, and we are humble when humility is required. We can be dignified because the indwelling Christ is the Creator who has the element of dignity, and we can be humble because He is also a creature with the element of humility.</p>
<p>Some people say that Christ did not become a man until He was born in Bethlehem two thousand years ago. According to the Gospel of Matthew, it is correct to say this. However, Genesis 18:1-22 speaks of an incident that transpired with Abraham two thousand years before Christ was born. In other words, although Christ did not become a man until two thousand years later, Jehovah appeared to Abraham in the form of a man.</p>
<p>Genesis 18:1-15 says, &ldquo;Jehovah appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre as he was sitting at the entrance of his tent in the heat of the day. And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and there were three men standing opposite him. And when he saw them, he ran from the entrance of the tent to meet them. And he bowed down to the earth and said, My Lord, if I have found favor in Your sight, please do not pass on from Your servant. Please let a little water be fetched, and do wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree. And let me fetch a morsel of bread that you may sustain yourselves. After that you may pass on, since you have come to your servant. So they said, Do as you have said. And Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, Quickly prepare three measures of fine flour, knead it, and make cakes. And Abraham ran to the herd and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to the servant, and he hurried to prepare it. And he took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and set them before them; and he stood by them under the tree while they ate. And they said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? And he said, There, in the tent. And He said, I will certainly return to you according to the time of life, and then Sarah your wife shall have a son. And Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, which was behind Him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and advanced in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah according to the manner of women. And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I have become old, shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? And Jehovah said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I indeed bear a child, when I am old? Is anything too marvelous for Jehovah? At the appointed time I will return to you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. Then Sarah denied it, saying, I did not laugh; for she was afraid. And He said, No, but you did laugh.&rdquo; Verse 1 speaks of the appearing of Jehovah, and verses 2 through 9 speak of three men. But in verses 10 through 15 one of the three men spoke to Abraham just as a man speaks with another man.</p>
<p>Verses 16 through 22 say, &ldquo;And the men rose up from there and looked down upon Sodom. And Abraham walked with them to send them away. And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do, since Abraham will indeed become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him? For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him to keep the way of Jehovah by doing righteousness and justice, that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken concerning him. And Jehovah said, The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah, how great it is; and their sin, how very heavy it is! I shall go down and see whether they have done altogether according to its outcry, which has come to Me; and if not, I will know. And the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, while Abraham remained standing before Jehovah.&rdquo; In the Chinese Union Version verse 16 mentions three men, but verse 22 mentions two men, referring to two of the three men. The two men &ldquo;turned from there and went toward Sodom, while Abraham remained standing before Jehovah.&rdquo; Therefore, the third man was Jehovah. Jehovah appeared to Abraham in the form of a man. Abraham fetched water to wash His feet and prepared a feast for Him, and Jehovah ate. Was Jehovah a man? It seems that He did not become a man until He was born in Bethlehem two thousand years later, but two thousand years before His birth He appeared as a man by the oaks of Mamre; His feet could be washed with water, and He could eat food. How can we explain this? From man&rsquo;s perspective, there is the element of time, but from the perspective of the eternal God, there is no time element. With God there are only facts; there is no time issue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Revelation 13:8 says that Christ is &ldquo;the Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world.&rdquo; From God&rsquo;s perspective, Christ was slain from the foundation of the world. From the human perspective, Christ was slain over one thousand and nine hundred years ago, because the human perspective includes the element of time. However, there is no time element in God&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<p>Hence, in eternity past God determined that His Son would become a man as the Firstborn of creation. From that point onward, Christ was viewed as a creature. In eternity God also determined that His Son would go to the cross to shed His blood for the redemption of man&rsquo;s sins. Therefore, from the human perspective Christ died on the cross over one thousand and nine hundred years ago, but from God&rsquo;s perspective Christ was slain from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>Christ is the all-inclusive Lord: He is both God and man, and He is both the Creator and a creature. Christ is everything to us. This Christ is our life today, and He is also our hope of glory for the future.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST IN US BEING THE HOPE OF GLORY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:12, 15, 18-19, 25-27; 2:2-3, 9-10, 16-17; 3:4, 10-11</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEEP MYSTERY IN COLOSSIANS AND EPHESIANS</h2>
<p>Bible scholars know that in the New Testament there is one book focused on Christ and one book focused on the church. However, most people stop with only this revelation; they do not see the deep mystery in these two books.</p>
<p>Because I was taught at a young age that Colossians is on Christ and Ephesians is on the church, I read these two books from this perspective. Even though I read these books many times and even divided the verses into sections, I saw only the revelation on the surface; I did not touch the deep mystery. In my study I did not mention the word <em>mystery,</em> because I did not see it. Even though I saw many crucial points in these two books, such as the Father&rsquo;s selection and predestination, our being saved by grace, and our putting on the whole armor of God, I did not see the mystery.</p>
<p>Like most people, we have a common problem: when reading a book, we see and quickly comprehend what we already know, but we neither see nor comprehend unfamiliar things. The reason we neither see nor understand the word <em>mystery</em> is that we are unfamiliar with it. In order to speed-read a book, for example, a person must be familiar with the material; otherwise, it is difficult to read even one sentence.</p>
<p>Ephesians is on the church as the mystery of Christ, but people have read this book many times without seeing the church as the mystery of Christ. Instead, they see that husbands need to love their wives and that wives need to be subject to their own husbands (5:25, 22). It is remarkable that sisters do not see &ldquo;wives, be subject to your own husbands&rdquo;; instead, they are impressed with &ldquo;husbands, love your wives.&rdquo; Every sister says Amen when she reads Ephesians 5:25; she would even pray for her husband according to this verse. It is equally remarkable that when the brothers read Ephesians 5, they are impressed with &ldquo;wives, be subject to your own husbands&rdquo; (v. 22). Every brother says Amen to this verse and even prays, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for giving this word. Please enlighten my wife to see that she needs to submit.&rdquo; However, Ephesians 5 concerns a mystery: &ldquo;this mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church&rdquo; (v. 32). Because this word is not in the concepts of the brothers and the sisters, they do not see it.</p>
<p>It is easy to see the revelation on the surface, but it is difficult to touch the deep mystery. If the Lord did not have mercy on us and give us a sincere heart and a willingness to pay the price, we would spend our whole lives as superficial Christians who know only the revelation on the surface. The revelation on the surface cannot accomplish God&rsquo;s intention. His intention is in the deep mystery. Nearly two thousand years ago the Lord said, &ldquo;I come quickly&rdquo; (Rev. 22:20), but He still has not come. This proves that His desire has not yet been fulfilled. Over the past two thousand years, millions have been saved who love the Lord, read the Bible, and know the revelation on the surface. But according to church history, few believers have seen the deep mystery. Therefore, the Lord is still waiting. The Lord no longer wants us to give messages concerning the revelation on the surface; hence, we stopped giving such messages more than forty years ago. I am not being proud to say that I have much to speak concerning prophecies and types, but for forty years I have not had the burden to speak concerning such things. Instead, I have spoken on these two mysteries: the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ. If I am not speaking concerning these two mysteries, I do not have anything to say.</p>
<p>Christians in the West like the book of Psalms; therefore, when the New Testament is printed in the West, Psalms is included at the end. The New Testaments that are printed in China include Psalms and Proverbs. The Chinese love Proverbs more than Psalms, because the Chinese love maxims, and Proverbs is a book of maxims. If I were to print the New Testament, I would not include Psalms or Proverbs. Instead, I would typeset Colossians and Ephesians with a large font type and use a small font type for all the other books. Furthermore, Colossians would be in red, and Ephesians would be in green; red refers to Christ, and green refers to the church. I would also highlight every occurrence of the word <em>mystery</em> in these two books. However, the verses concerning ethics and morality in Ephesians, such as husbands loving their wives and wives being subject to their husbands, would be typeset in an outline font type. We need a Bible in which the beginning, the ending, the emphases, and the minor points are clearly indicated. Most people are confused concerning the beginning, the ending, the emphases, and the minor points in the Bible. For this reason, our concepts need to be corrected.</p>
<p>Some may say that it is wrong for me as a teacher of the Bible not to speak concerning ethics and morality. However, I would say that people have the wrong understanding of morality. Love is the highest expression of morality; it is the first virtue. The Bible says that God is love (1 John 4:8). Therefore, real morality is God. Man has morals because he is made in God&rsquo;s image (Gen. 1:26). God is love, and love is the image of God. In fact, every virtue is God Himself. Without God, every virtue is but a shell without any content. Only God is the reality of morality.</p>
<p>Confucius said that the way of great learning is to develop the bright virtue. This implies that the highest morality is the development of the bright virtue. The bright virtue of Confucius is the God-created conscience within man. To make known and magnify the conscience are to develop the bright virtue; that is, to develop the bright virtue is to magnify the innate knowledge of good and the innate ability to do good. The innate knowledge of good and the innate ability to do good were created within man by God. However, they are merely an image, just as a glove is in the image of a hand. The innate knowledge of good and the innate ability to do good are but a glove, and only God can be the content. God is the &ldquo;hand&rdquo; that must enter into man. Confucius did not know this revelation. He did not know that unless a person is saved, his conscience lacks the real content, is empty, and cannot be developed.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST IN US BEING THE HOPE OF GLORY</h2>
<p>In Colossians 1:25 Paul says, &ldquo;I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God.&rdquo; Paul was entrusted with a stewardship in order to be a steward in God&rsquo;s large household. In ancient times the Greek custom was similar to the Chinese custom. Large and wealthy families had an abundant supply of everything; there was an abundant supply of food, clothing, and daily necessities. Hence, the master of the house would assign a steward to manage and distribute the supplies. Paul said that he received grace to be a steward who distributed the riches. He was a steward of the riches of Christ, which are a mystery. The content of this mystery is the riches of Christ. Paul was entrusted with these riches, and he wrote of these riches to complete the word of God, the revelation of God. This mystery, which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but has now been manifested to us, is Christ in us, the hope of glory (vv. 26-27).</p>
<p>The hidden mystery is Christ in us, the hope of glory. When we meet one another in the morning, we should not say, &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; but rather we should say, &ldquo;Christ in you!&rdquo; A sister should not expect her husband to love her, nor should a brother expect his wife to be subject to him. Rather, a brother should say to his wife, &ldquo;Christ in you!&rdquo; and a sister should say to her husband, &ldquo;Christ in you!&rdquo; Parents are very happy when their children are obedient. However, parents should say to their children, &ldquo;Christ in you!&rdquo; We should talk about Christ until we are foolishly enthralled with Christ. We should say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, praise the Lord! Christ is in us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the Chefoo revival in 1942, when the saints were on their way to the meetings, they would talk only about what they had heard in the meetings. The city of Chefoo was not very big, and it did not have much public transportation. Hence, everyone walked to the meetings, and they walked with their neighbors and family, not alone. While they walked, they would talk about the last message they had heard in the meeting, and while they were on their way home from the meeting, they would talk about the content of the meeting. They did not gossip, nor did they discuss the weather; they spoke only about the Lord&rsquo;s word, which is Christ. We need to ask the Lord to have mercy on us and to change our concept, our feelings, and our tone so that we would no longer speak idle words. We need to speak concerning Christ and concerning Christ in us being the hope of glory. How beautiful and sweet it is to speak concerning this Christ! The true &ldquo;bright virtue&rdquo; is Christ, and the true development of this &ldquo;bright virtue&rdquo; is to live Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST IN THE FIRST THREE CHAPTERS<br />
OF COLOSSIANS</h2>
<p>The first three chapters of Colossians are concerning Christ. However, the revelation concerning Christ in these three chapters is not on the surface, nor is it the revelation of Christ generally spoken of by Christians. Christ in these three chapters is deep and mysterious. Even though I was born in a Christian family and educated in Christian schools, everything I heard was on the surface of the Bible. The pastor regularly taught the Bible and told stories from the four Gospels, but everything he said was concerning the revelation on the surface of the Bible. I never heard about the mystery.</p>
<p>One of the co-workers in America grew up in a Catholic family. When he was a child, he watched the Catholic priest offer incense, and he served the priest. When he was in middle school, this brother heard the gospel and received the Lord Jesus. This brother was so happy that he told his family, &ldquo;I now have the Lord Jesus!&rdquo; His grandmother responded, &ldquo;What is so special about that? We have had a picture of Jesus on the kitchen wall for a long time.&rdquo; This shows the superficial condition in Christianity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Allotted Portion of the Saints,<br />
and the Firstborn of God&rsquo;s Creation<br />
and of God&rsquo;s New Creation</h2>
<p>In Colossians 1:12 this mysterious Christ is the allotted portion of the saints. The Chinese Union Version Bible renders <em>portion</em> as &ldquo;inheritance.&rdquo; Most Christians understand this inheritance to be heaven. They believe that there is a God in heaven who has prepared an unfading, incorruptible, and everlasting inheritance in heaven for us and that one day we will receive this inheritance with the saints in the light. This inheritance has a street of gold, gates of pearl, and walls of precious stones. However, if we enter into the depths of Colossians, we will understand that Christ is the allotted portion of the saints. God determined to give His Son, the all-inclusive Christ, to us. We are the saints, and God has given Christ to us as our blessed portion.</p>
<p>Christ is our portion. This portion is God&rsquo;s beloved Son, who is the image of God, God&rsquo;s expression. Christ is the Firstborn of all creation (v. 15); He leads all things to express God. When all things were affected by the fall, He shed His blood in order to restore and reconcile all things to God. Christ also resurrected from the dead to become the Firstborn from the dead in order to bring all His redeemed people into resurrection. Thus, Christ is the Firstborn of all creation and also the Firstborn from the dead. He has the first place in God&rsquo;s creation and in God&rsquo;s new creation (v. 18).</p>
<p>Christ can be the Firstborn of all creation because He is of the same kind as His creatures, and He is the first among His creatures. If He were of a different kind, He could not be the Firstborn. If He were not a creature, He could not be the Firstborn of all creation. However, He became a man with flesh and blood. Man is a creature, and his body of flesh and blood was created. A person who does not confess that Christ is a creature does not confess that Christ became a man. First John 4:3 says, &ldquo;Every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God; and this is the spirit of the antichrist.&rdquo; We must give heed to this word. Christ became a man, and man is a creature. This means that Christ is of the same kind as creation, and hence, He can be the Firstborn of all creation.</p>
<p>As the Firstborn of all creation, God&rsquo;s creation is an expression of Christ. Romans 1:20 says, &ldquo;The invisible things of Him, both His eternal power and divine characteristics, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, being perceived by the things made, so that they would be without excuse.&rdquo; This refers to Christ leading all creation to express God. However, this expression is on the surface. When Christ resurrected from the dead, He brought in the new creation, which is altogether a matter in spirit. Because we, the redeemed, rose from the dead when Christ rose from the dead, we are of the same kind as Christ. Hence, Christ is the Head of the new creation and is leading the new creation to express God.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of expression here: the expression of the universe and the expression of the church. The universe is the expression of God&rsquo;s creation, and the church is the expression of God&rsquo;s new creation. Christ was born a man in order to be of the same kind as man in God&rsquo;s creation, and Christ resurrected from the dead in order to be of the same kind as the new creation. Christ is the Firstborn of all creation because He is of the same kind as creation, and He is the Firstborn from the dead because He is of the same kind as the new creation. Christ is the Firstborn of two creations. He is the Firstborn in creation, and He is the Firstborn in the new creation. He expresses God in all creation, and He expresses God much more in the new creation. Therefore, &ldquo;in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell&rdquo; (Col. 1:19). The word <em>fullness</em> refers to expression. <em>All the fullness</em> refers to the fullness of God as expressed in the old creation and to the fullness of God in the new creation. In other words, all the expression of God in the old creation and in the new creation was pleased to dwell in Christ. This Christ is our portion. He is God&rsquo;s beloved Son, the image of God, the Firstborn of all creation, and the Firstborn from the dead. He is God&rsquo;s expression, and He has entered into us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Reality of Every Positive Thing</h2>
<p>Colossians 2 says that the mystery of God is Christ and that all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ (vv. 2-3). All the fullness of the Godhead, that is, all that the Godhead expresses, dwells in Christ bodily, and we have been made full in Him (vv. 9-10). This Christ is the body of every positive thing&mdash;including the dietary regulations, the feasts, the new moon, and the Sabbath, all of which are shadows (vv. 16-17). After the new moon is the crescent moon, when the moon begins to shine. This is a new beginning. The Sabbath day is a day of rest. Feasts are for people to be merry, and eating and drinking are for man to be satisfied. However, these are shadows; the body is of Christ. Christ is our real new moon, our real Sabbath, our real feast, and our real food and drink. Christ is everything. He is our food, our clothing, and our breath. He is our peace, rest, joy, and feast. He is our satisfaction and enjoyment. This is the Christ who is in us today.</p>
<p>Opposition rose up when I spoke this in the United States. People condemned me for teaching pantheism because I said that God is our new moon, our Sabbath, our feasts, and our food and that He is the reality of every positive thing. I am not teaching pantheism; I am ministering Christ. I did not say that the new moon becomes God, or that the Sabbath becomes God, or that the feasts become God, or that the food we eat becomes God. I said that every positive thing is a shadow, but the body is of Christ. For this reason, the Lord told His disciples that He is the bread of life that came down out of heaven (John 6:33-35, 51). He also said, &ldquo;Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest&rdquo; (Matt. 11:28). The Sabbath is a shadow, and only Christ is the body. Christ is also light (John 8:12; 1 John 1:5). The sunlight is a shadow, but Christ is our real light. Hence, everything that we enjoy is a picture of Christ being our everything. Many can testify that Christ is everything to them. Such a Christ is our portion; He is in us not only as our future hope (Col. 1:27) but as our life today. Nothing is more important than life. Christ is our life. When He is manifested, we also will be manifested with Him in glory (3:4). Perhaps some already know that Christ is life, but they might not know that Christ is our life according to Colossians 1 and 2. If we see the revelation in Colossians, we will realize that the Christ who is in us as life is mysterious and rich.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being All in the New Man</h2>
<p>Colossians 3 says that we have put on the new man (v. 10), which is the church. Verse 11 says that in the new man there is no Greek or Jew, meaning that there is no race; that there is no circumcision or uncircumcision, meaning that there is no religion; that there is no barbarian or Scythian, meaning that there is no culture; that there is no slave or free man, meaning that there are no social classes. Everything is gone in the new man. There is only Christ. Only Christ is all and in all. The word <em>all</em> refers to all the people in the church, that is, the members who constitute the new man. In the new man there is no Cantonese, no Shandongese, no you, and no I; there is only Christ. Who are you? Christ! What is your name? Christ! Our name is Christ! Christ is all and in all. The mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING ALL IN THE NEW MAN</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to consider Christ as the mystery of God. In the book of Colossians the apostle Paul unveils the mysterious Christ. Paul also reveals how to experience such a Christ. Seeing is the beginning of experience. Hence, after we see the vision of Christ, we need to experience Him. Therefore, Colossians concerns not only revelation and vision but also experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLE BRINGING ALL THINGS TO NAUGHT<br />
AND BEING FOR CHRIST</h2>
<p>Concerning the experience of Christ, there are two sides: the side of the apostle and the side of the saints. The apostle Paul labored and even struggled to remove the veils so that he could present a vision of Christ (1:29). The word <em>labor</em> does not denote light work; it refers to a great deal of effort and hard work. Paul&rsquo;s labor included struggling. The word <em>struggling</em> implies fighting, warfare, and contending. Paul not only labored but also fought and contended, because there were enemies and forces opposing Christ. In his time everything&mdash;including race, politics, religion, and culture&mdash;opposed the Christ whom Paul preached. Judaism and Greek philosophy were obstacles to Paul, and the cultural atmosphere, political conflicts, and nationalistic ideology of the nations surrounding the Mediterranean Sea were also obstacles in Paul&rsquo;s path, hindering him. Therefore, he labored and struggled.</p>
<p>There were many nations surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. On the east were the Jews in the Holy Land, to the west was the Roman Empire, in the north were barbarians, and to the south was Egypt. Paul fought against Greek culture, Jewish religion, Roman politics, and barbaric forces. He wanted to bring the will of God to the earth and impart it into man, but all these peoples were opposing him. Jewish religion, Greek philosophy, Roman politics, nationalistic ideologies, and customs of the nations opposed him. Apparently, they were opposing Paul, but in reality they were opposing Christ. Religion, philosophy, politics, culture, and barbarianism are opposed to Christ. Everything is opposed to Christ. Peter was the pioneer in this struggle and fight, but he later became weak and shrank back into Judaism (Gal. 2:12). When Paul wrote the book of Colossians, he seemed to be the only one struggling and fighting to unveil Christ.</p>
<p> Concerning the new man&mdash;the church as the product of the saints&rsquo; experience of Christ&mdash;Paul says, &ldquo;Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all&rdquo; (3:11). The saints in Hong Kong might dislike me if I were to tell them that there cannot be Cantonese in the church. If I were to tell the saints in Chefoo that there cannot be Shantungese in the church, they might accuse me of forgetting my roots. This, however, is what Paul preached. When he said that there cannot be Greek, the Jews might have clapped their hands and cheered. But when he said that there cannot be Jews, the Jews might have accused him of forgetting his roots. When Paul said that there cannot be circumcision, the Gentiles might have clapped their hands. However, Paul also said that there cannot be uncircumcision. In other words, there can be neither religion nor non-religion, because both religion and non-religion are of no value. Paul put down everything.</p>
<p>Paul also said that there cannot be barbarian or Scythian. Some people think that <em>Scythians</em> refers to people who were very cultured. However, according to the most reliable sources of history, the Scythians were the most barbarous people, and they lived in Europe. Paul negated Greek and Jew, religious and non-religious, cultured and barbarian, and also slave and free man. He negated everyone except Christ, because in the new man there is only Christ.</p>
<p>The purpose of Paul&rsquo;s labor was to minister Christ to people. For this reason, Paul was given a stewardship; God entrusted him with the treasures of His house and the key to His warehouse. Paul opened this warehouse and ministered the riches in the warehouse, that is, ministered Christ, to the Jews, Greeks, Romans, and all the people surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. Christ is opposed to all things. In the new man there cannot be Greek or Jew, religion or non-religion, cultured or barbarian, slave or free man, rich or poor. There cannot be anything other than Christ. Hence, Paul stirred up opposition when he presented Christ. Paul did not try to offend people; as long as he ministered Christ, he was opposed, because Christ was not welcomed. Whether people are cultured or barbarous, rich or poor, religious or non-religious, they are opposed to Christ. Therefore, problems arose whenever Paul presented Christ. This is why Paul labored, fought, and struggled in his work. Christ could be imparted into many because Paul struggled in such a way.</p><h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLE ADMONISHING<br />
AND TEACHING PEOPLE WITH CHRIST</h2>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s apostleship, which was also his stewardship, was to minister Christ to people (Eph. 3:2, 8). Paul announced and preached Christ, and then he admonished and taught people in all wisdom according to Christ (Col. 1:28). Confucius admonished and taught people concerning proper human relationships and morality, and philosophers admonish and teach people with philosophical ideas, but Paul admonished and taught people with Christ. We need to ask ourselves how we admonish and teach people.</p>
<p>Suppose a newly married couple is having problems. How would we admonish them? According to my observation, it is common for a husband and wife to have problems. Some couples have problems before their honeymoon is over. Our God is wonderful; He created males to be completely different from females and makes two different persons a couple. In over fifty years of serving I have observed the same situation everywhere. Both in the East and in the West, regardless of nationality, there are problems between husbands and wives. God usually does not put two quick persons together, nor does He put two slow persons together. Rather, He marvelously matches a slow person with a quick person and a soft person with a harsh person.</p>
<p>In my early years of serving the Lord, I often saw a brother and a sister whom I thought would be a suitable match. Whenever I acted on this sense, I ran into trouble and had to repent. Therefore, I eventually stopped making suggestions because I found that my view was not accurate. I might consider a brother and a sister to be a good match, but they might not think so. We would pray according to the principles in the Bible and consider the social condition, education, and age of the brother and sister. But when we introduced them to one another, they did not like each other. Eventually, they picked their own match and still suffered. There are many stories like this.</p>
<p>We need to admonish and teach the couples who have problems. The brothers who administrate the church and lead the saints need to learn how to admonish and teach. We should learn from Paul as our pattern. Paul says that he announced Christ by &ldquo;admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ; for which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power&rdquo; (vv. 28-29). Paul did not merely write epistles and give messages; he also admonished and taught people with Christ. We know from our experience that when there is discord between a husband and wife, we need to admonish and teach them with Christ, not with doctrines. Such admonishing and teaching require us to have experiences of Christ. If we do not have experiences of Christ, we cannot admonish and teach people with Christ.</p>
<p>The purpose of admonishing people with Christ is not for them to get along but to present each one full-grown in Christ. Proper admonition leads the saints to grow unto maturity. We should not correct the saints; rather, we should minister Christ to them and help them eat, drink, and enjoy Christ. There is a great difference between the practice in Christianity of admonishing and teaching people with doctrines and Paul&rsquo;s ministering Christ to people.</p>
<p>There are problems between husbands and wives because they lack Christ and need the supply of Christ. This principle applies to all the problems among the saints: problems are the result of our lacking Christ and needing the supply of Christ. For example, if an elder has a problem with a deacon, both the elder and the deacon are short of Christ. If two sisters have a problem and cannot serve together, they are both short of Christ. All kinds of problems arise when the saints are short of Christ. The problems in the churches are the result of a lack of supply, a shortage of Christ. I hope that everyone in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery would minister Christ and serve Christ to people.</p>
<p>Paul says that he labored and struggled to minister Christ to people. The purpose of such ministering is not to solve problems but to help people grow unto maturity so that each one might be presented full-grown in Christ to God (v. 28). The word <em>present</em> in verse 28 is the same word as that in Ephesians 5:27: &ldquo;That He might present the church to Himself glorious.&rdquo; The same word is used in the phrase <em>present your bodies a living sacrifice</em> (Rom. 12:1). Paul struggled to present every saint full-grown in Christ. It is a shame if the co-workers serve for many years, but very few saints in their localities are full-grown. We should always minister Christ to the needy ones, not to solve their problems but to help them grow in life unto maturity so that they may be presented to God.</p><h2 class="head1">WALKING IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>Concerning the experience of Christ, the saints should walk in Christ (Col. 2:6). We need to walk in Christ instead of focusing on persuasive speech (v. 4). Christianity focuses on eloquence. If a person is eloquent and learned, he will be successful. However, eloquent words that do not minister Christ to people are called persuasive speech. In the church we do not care for what people say or how they speak; our only concern is that what is spoken ministers Christ and enables us to walk in Christ. Whether we are at home or abroad, we must be in Christ in the great things and the small things. We have been rooted in Him, and we are being built up in Him (v. 7). Hence, my only concern is to be in Christ. If I do something, it must be because Christ is doing it, and if I speak, it must be because Christ is speaking. We must not listen to persuasive speech, nor should we care for philosophy, empty deceit, or the tradition of men; we must be only according to Christ (v. 8). We should do everything according to Christ and in Christ. Our living and walk must be in Christ. This is God&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN<br />
AND PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>In Colossians 3 Paul puts down and brings to naught Greeks, Jews, circumcision, uncircumcision, barbarians, Scythians, slaves, and free men (v. 11). This indicates that in the church we need to put down everything that is not Christ. We need to put off the old man every day (v. 9). A brother from Shantung who still has a Shantung flavor has not put off the old man. To put off the old man includes putting off the Shantung element, the Hong Kong element, and the Japanese element. Some might think that only hatred, jealousy, and wrongdoings are the old man and that to put off the old man is to do good and love one another. However, this is a superficial thought. Regardless of where we were born and where we were raised and regardless of our nationality, we are the old man, which must be put off. If we do not put off the old man, the mystery of God cannot be expressed.</p>
<p>In putting off the old man, we must first put off our person and then put off what is hidden within us. Paul seems to be referring to putting off the Jewish, Greek, Chinese, British, and American elements. However, he is saying that we should put off the old man hidden within us. We need to put off the old man so that we can put on the new man, who is Christ. The Lord has no way on the earth if He has no way in us. There is something hidden within us. This something is our being, our old man, and he occupies the place of the Lord within us. We say that we are consecrated to the Lord and that we will take the Lord&rsquo;s way and allow Him to work. However, the Lord cannot do anything with our old man. If we would put off our old man, it would not be difficult for the Lord to have a way in us.</p>
<p>There are many people who are saved but do not love the Lord. There are also some who love the Lord, but their old man is still intact. These ones have the outward appearance of the new man, but within they are still the old man. As a result, there may be many local churches but not much blessing. We do not have more blessing, because it is hard to put off the old man hidden within the believers. If the old man is not put off, the new man cannot be put on, and the church life will not have much weight.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PEACE OF CHRIST AND THE WORD OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In Colossians 3 Paul also speaks of the peace of Christ and the word of Christ. In verse 15 Paul says, &ldquo;Let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts.&rdquo; We are complicated within, because we always compare and weigh things to see whether they are fitting or right. At such times, we need to let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our being. Instead of listening to the voice outside of us, we should listen to what the peace of Christ says within us. The peace of Christ should be a stabilizing force, a balance, and an arbitrator within our being. We are called in one Body to this peace. There should be peace in the Body of Christ, and this peace comes from the arbitration of Christ.</p>
<p>The word of Christ is the supply. In verse 16 Paul says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.&rdquo; Here the word <em>dwell</em> means &ldquo;make home.&rdquo; To let the word of Christ make home in us is to let the word of Christ have the ground in us and be the Lord in us. Then this word will supply, enlighten, strengthen, establish, and perfect us. The word of Christ will become everything in us. This word is not merely the words that Christ spoke in the Gospels. All the words in the Epistles are part of the word of Christ, because the words in the Epistles are spoken by Christ in the apostles. We should always let these words have ground, settle down, make home, and be the Lord in us. In this way the word supplies, enlightens, strengthens, and perfects us and also builds us up. Then Christ will be lived out from us.</p><h1 class="series">SECTION TWO:<br />
THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST&mdash;<br />
THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH BEING THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:2-11, 16-19</h1>
<p>We are considering six decades of the Lord&rsquo;s history among us so that we may be enlightened to see the Lord&rsquo;s way, His recovery, and so that we may learn lessons from history. We are also considering the vision that God has revealed to us in the Bible so that we can follow and practice it. We are not following our views, opinions, or feelings. For the past six decades our work has been based on this controlling vision in God&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<p>We are considering this vision for the sake of the younger generation. There are now numerous churches not only in Asia but also on five other continents&mdash;North America, South America (including Central America), Europe, Africa, and Australia (including New Zealand). In some churches over eighty percent of the saints are between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five. These saints are either studying in college or working. We want to pass on our history to these saints so that they may see the vision that the Lord has shown us. This vision involves the deep mysteries in the Bible.</p>
<p>There are two mysteries in the Bible. The first mystery is the mystery of God, and the second mystery is the mystery of Christ. The mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church. Our vision is Christ and the church. The Lord has revealed Christ and the church to us; Christ and the church are the greatest mysteries in the Bible. In this chapter we will consider Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF REVELATION IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The Bible is not an ordinary book. Every word in the Bible is God-breathed and is His revelation (2 Tim. 3:16). There are two kinds of revelation in the Bible: revelation on the surface and deep revelation. The deep revelation is a matter of mystery.</p>
<p>When I stand up, others can clearly see that I am an old Chinese man. I have a nose, a mouth, two eyes, and two ears. I am not too tall, nor am I too short. I also have two arms and two legs. However, I have more than outward features; I also have an inner being, which is my mystery. My inner being is my soul&mdash;my mind, emotion, and will&mdash;and my spirit, including my conscience. These inner parts are difficult to understand; they are indescribable. The inner being is the deep mystery within man. This principle also applies to the Bible. There are revelations on the surface, and there are deep mysteries.</p>
<p>The revelation on the surface of the New Testament can be understood by any literate person. According to this revelation, Jesus Christ is the Son of God and was born approximately two thousand years ago in the land of Judea. He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. During that time He preached, taught, cast out demons, healed, did many good deeds, and performed many miracles. Finally, He bore the sins of mankind and was crucified on the cross in order to be judged by God on our behalf and to accomplish redemption. He was buried and resurrected after three days. After His resurrection He was with His disciples for forty days and then ascended to the right hand of the Majesty on high to be made both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36). He is the Lord and the Savior of all men (1 Tim. 4:10). Anyone who is willing to repent, confess his sins, believe in the Lord as the Savior, and accept Him as the Redeemer will be saved&mdash;his sins will be forgiven, and he will be regenerated.</p>
<p>When the fullness of the Gentiles comes in (Rom. 11:25), the Lord will return to judge the world and deal with the devil. Then He will reign on the earth with His overcoming saints for a thousand years (Rev. 20:6). This period of a thousand years is called the millennial kingdom. After a thousand years the Lord Jesus will terminate the entire old creation, renew the heavens and the earth, and bring in the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem God will dwell with man in peace and righteousness, and man will enjoy divine blessings for eternity. This is the revelation on the surface of the New Testament. This is the truth in the Bible, and it is the gospel that many missionaries preach all over the world. We thank the Lord for such a revelation in the Bible.</p>
<p>However, the Bible is not so superficial. There are deep mysteries in the Bible. In Ephesians 3:2-11 the word <em>mystery</em> is used three times. A mystery is something hidden, secret, and unfathomable. Anything that is obvious or easy to understand is not a mystery. Hence, the whole universe is a mystery. The more science develops, the more scientists feel that the universe is a mystery. Who can trace the origin of the heavens, the heavenly hosts, and the earth? Who can explore their meaning? The answer to these questions is hidden and not easy to understand.</p>
<p>In addition to the heavens and the earth, man is a mystery. What is man&rsquo;s origin? Who designed man? Why do our nostrils point downward, not upward? Why are our eyebrows above our eyes, not below them? Architects can improve the design of buildings, engineers can produce newer car models, and fashion designers can change the design of clothing, but the human body cannot be improved. If the nose pointed upward, dust and rain would fall into our nostrils, and we would look very ugly. No one can improve the location of our eyes, ears, nose, or mouth; they are just the right size. Our hands look good with four fingers and a thumb; they are capable of doing many things.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of human life? What is the value of human life on the earth? This is a mystery that people do not understand. Nevertheless, God has revealed this mystery in His Word. He wants man to understand this mystery. He also wants this mystery to become our experience and reality so that this mystery would be our life and we would live out this mystery, the church. Therefore, we need to spend time to consider the mystery of God by looking at the deep mystery in the Bible.</p><h2 class="head2">The Revelation in Colossians Being<br />
Christ as the Mystery of God</h2>
<p>The mystery revealed in the New Testament first concerns the mystery of God, which is Christ. Most people agree that Jesus Christ stands out in the history of mankind and that He is transcendent and unrivaled. Opposers, unbelievers, and believers admit that His human living was outstanding. Some know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who became a man. Others know that He was crucified and resurrected from the dead. However, the New Testament says much more than this. For example, the four short chapters of the book of Colossians give an all-inclusive, deep, and vast description of Christ.</p>
<p>Colossians says that Christ is the mystery of God. God Himself is a mystery. He is real and living, but no one has ever seen Him. The best scientists acknowledge that the laws and principles of the universe speak of the existence of a Creator who rules the universe. Scientists have confirmed that there is a system in the universe, a force, that holds all the galaxies together. This is confirmed by Colossians 1, which says that Christ is the centrality and the universality of all things and that all things cohere in Him (v. 17). All things are held together by the mutual interaction of two opposing forces, centrifugal force and centripetal force. The Bible says that Christ is the centrality and that He is the universality. Centrality refers to centripetal force, and universality refers to centrifugal force. Therefore, Christ upholds and bears all things (Heb. 1:3).</p>
<p>Colossians also speaks of Christ as the mystery of God (2:2). Christ is the embodiment of God. All that God is, all the fullness of the Godhead, dwells in Christ bodily (v. 9). No one can find God apart from Christ (John 14:6). Christ is the true God, the complete God; only He is God (Rom. 9:5).</p>
<p>Christ is infinitely deep and vast; He is all-inclusive. It is remarkable that such a Christ has become our life (Col. 3:4). This is also a mystery. Every Christian can testify to this mystery: Christ is in us. Today He is our life, and one day He will be our glory. Today we live by Him and live in Him, and one day we will be manifested with Him in glory (v. 4). He is our life today and our glory in the future.</p>
<p>According to Colossians 2, Jesus Christ is our food and our drink; He is our feast, our joy; He is our new moon, our bright beginning in times of darkness; and He is our Sabbath, our enjoyment and peace (v. 16). In other words, Christ is the reality of every positive thing (v. 17). He is our all in all. He should be the daily experience of every believer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Revelation in Ephesians Being<br />
the Church as the Mystery of Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians is the sister book to Colossians. Colossians concerns Christ, and Ephesians concerns the church. Colossians has four chapters, and Ephesians has six chapters. Ephesians is two chapters longer than Colossians and contains many items. Both Christians and non-Christians know the word <em>church.</em> However, few people know the true meaning of this word. The most superficial and erroneous understanding is that the church is a Western-style building with a steeple and a bell. The church is not a hall of worship; it is not a chapel.</p>
<p>According to the original Greek, the church is the gathering of God&rsquo;s called people. Therefore, a more accurate rendering of the Greek word would be &ldquo;assembly.&rdquo; The revelation of the church as God&rsquo;s called-out congregation is on the surface of the Bible. Each of the six chapters in Ephesians speaks concerning the church.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 speaks of the church as the Body of Christ (vv. 22-23). The Body is an organism. This is a mystery. Chapter 1 also says that the church is the fullness of Christ (v. 23). The word <em>fullness</em> is not easy to comprehend. A person&rsquo;s body is his fullness. Everyone would be scared if my head were floating in the air by itself. If I were only four feet eleven inches tall, people would say that I do not have a fullness. A brother who is tall and weighs about two hundred pounds has a fullness. His head might not be larger than mine, but he is fuller than I. His fullness is related to his body. The church is the Body of Christ and the fullness of Christ. In the Gospels Christ could be in only one place at one time. He could not be in Bethlehem if He was in Jerusalem, and He could not be in Nazareth if He was in Bethlehem. But today Christ is on six continents; He is everywhere because there are churches everywhere. The church is the fullness of Christ. This is a mystery.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2 speaks of four important matters concerning the church. First, the church is God&rsquo;s masterpiece (v. 10). In the original Greek the word <em>masterpiece</em> means &ldquo;poem.&rdquo; The church being God&rsquo;s masterpiece means that the church is a poem written by God. This poem is full of affection and is expressive and descriptive. The church is a telling forth of God&rsquo;s inner feelings and a description of His intention. Therefore, the church is God&rsquo;s masterpiece. Second, the church is the household of God (v. 19). A person&rsquo;s household is where his desire is fulfilled. The church is the means by which God expresses His love and the place where His desire is fulfilled. Third, the church is the kingdom of God (v. 19), that is, the place where God exercises His authority. Fourth, the church is the dwelling place of God (v. 22), that is, the place where God dwells and makes His home. Chapter 2 reveals four crucial points concerning the church: God&rsquo;s masterpiece, His household, His kingdom, and His dwelling place.</p>
<p>In chapter 3 the second half of verse 19 says, &ldquo;That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; I have studied various authoritative versions of the Bible. Most translators of the Bible do not render this verse accurately, because their understanding and utterance are inadequate. When we let Christ make home in us and let Him work in us, we will be filled with the riches of Christ &ldquo;unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; The fullness of God is the expression of God. A brother has a fullness, and his fullness is his expression. If I did not have a body, I would not have an expression. My body is my fullness, and my fullness is my expression. Others know me because I have a body. Sometimes we can recognize a person just by his silhouette or by his walk. Similarly, God wants to have an expression on the earth today, and this expression is His fullness. In Ephesians 1 the church is the fullness of Christ. In chapter 3 the church is filled unto all the fullness of God. A person who does not have all his limbs does not have a full expression. I am not tall, but when I speak, my face, posture, hands, and feet express me. Even the way I move my arms and blink my eyes are an expression. This is &ldquo;all the fullness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The church is all the fullness, all the expression, of God. This is accomplished by Christ making His home in our hearts, possessing our whole being, and filling and saturating us so that we may be filled with Christ. Man is a vessel to contain Christ. A person who does not have Christ is an empty vessel. However, it is not sufficient to have Christ; we must be filled with Christ. For example, a cup can have water but not be full of water. When the cup is full, the water overflows and is expressed. If we are possessed by the Lord, we will be filled with Him. The more we are filled with the Lord, the more He will overflow and be expressed. Then God will be expressed. The church is the fullness of God, the expression of God.</p>
<p>In chapter 4 the church is the one new man (v. 24). As believers, we have been regenerated by Christ and have become an organism together with all those who have been saved. This organism grows and causes us to love one another and to be joined to one another. As long as we love the Lord Jesus and are filled with Him, we will spontaneously be one when we come together. We will not need to be exhorted.</p>
<p>I went to Seoul, South Korea, not long ago. In ancient times Korea adopted aspects of Chinese culture; hence, Koreans know some Chinese characters. I do not know Korean, but when I was in Seoul, I wrote Chinese characters, and the Koreans understood. Then they wrote with Chinese characters, and I understood. However, we were limited to expressing ourselves with incomplete sentences. Since I could speak some English, and the local brothers could also speak English, we communicated in English. Even though there were language barriers, we were joined as one the moment we met, because Christ is in us. In our meetings in the United States, even though we have people of every color who speak English with all kinds of accents, we are joined as one when we fellowship. The church is the one new man.</p>
<p>In chapter 5 the church as the counterpart of Christ is being sanctified in order to be presented as a glorious bride to Christ (vv. 25-27). In chapter 6 the church is a warrior with the whole armor of God to fight against God&rsquo;s enemy and adversary, the devil (vv. 10-20).</p>
<p>Thus, Ephesians speaks of at least four major aspects of the church, each of which is a mystery. Most Christians know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who died for us and became our Savior and who will return one day. This is true and precious, but there is a mystery in the depths of this truth. This mystery reveals that the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all; the church is God&rsquo;s masterpiece, a poem written by God to express and describe His sentiments; the church is the household of God, His kingdom, and His dwelling place; the church is all the fullness of God and the new man to be Christ&rsquo;s satisfying counterpart and to be God&rsquo;s warrior to fight for God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p><h2 class="head1">CRUCIAL POINTS REVEALED IN EPHESIANS 3</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Church as the Mystery of Christ<br />
Revealed to the Apostles and Prophets</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:2 through 11 and verses 16 through 19 contain three crucial points. The first point is the mystery of Christ. This mystery was hidden in God, who created all things. Why did God create the heavens, the earth, all things, and man? The purpose of creation was a secret that God did not tell the angels or the saints in the Old Testament. God did not tell this secret to Adam, Abel, Abraham, Moses, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, or Malachi. The saints in the Old Testament feared God and were blessed by Him, but the mystery was not revealed to them, and they did not know it. This mystery was hidden in God throughout the ages.</p>
<p>Christ Jesus was born two thousand years ago. While He was on the earth, He called a group of disciples and appointed them as apostles. Then through His Spirit, God revealed His mystery to the apostles and prophets in their spirit. Paul was among those who received this revelation of the mystery. There are a total of twenty-seven books in the New Testament, and fourteen of these books, from Romans to Hebrews, were written by Paul. He wrote over half the books of the New Testament. In these fourteen Epistles Paul elaborated and developed this mystery. He spoke of &ldquo;the stewardship of the grace of God&rdquo; (Eph. 3:2). The word translated &ldquo;stewardship&rdquo; in this verse is the same word in Greek as the word translated &ldquo;economy&rdquo; in 1:10 and 3:9. A person who has a stewardship must be full of God&rsquo;s economy and plan. This economy is the stewardship.</p>
<p>Paul said, &ldquo;If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me for you, that by revelation the mystery was made known to me&rdquo; (vv. 2-3). Paul received a revelation from God. God revealed the mystery, which had been hidden in Himself throughout the ages, to Paul. God did not tell this mystery to the angels or anyone else. It was not until God found Paul that He opened the secret hidden in His heart through revelation. Paul used fourteen Epistles to write concerning this indescribable mystery.</p>
<p>Paul called this mystery &ldquo;the mystery of Christ&rdquo; (v. 4), which is the church. When we say that the mystery of God is Christ, we mean that God is in Christ and that Christ is the embodiment of God. To say that the mystery of Christ is the church means that Christ is in the church and that the church is the embodiment of Christ. A person who wants to find God must find Christ, and a person who wants to find Christ must find the church. Today God is in Christ, and Christ is in the church. This is the mystery of Christ. We may not be fully able to explain this matter, but it is a crucial point in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Announcing the Unsearchable Riches<br />
of Christ to Men</h2>
<p>God revealed the mystery to Paul and gave him a stewardship to announce the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel to the Gentiles (v. 8). This is a very significant word. How much of the riches of Christ do we know? How much have we tasted? His riches are unsearchable and indescribable. In order to describe the riches of a wealthy man, we need to know his assets. A person&rsquo;s assets are his riches. How many riches does Christ possess? The first item of the riches of Christ is that He is the embodiment of God. Christ being the embodiment of God means that He is God. Who is richer than God?</p>
<p>The second item of the riches of Christ is that He is man. In order to know the true God, we must know Christ, and in order to know a true man, we must also know Christ. We should consider whether we are true. There is no one on this earth who has not told a lie; no one is honest. We are not even honest with our parents. How often have we deceived our parents? If we are honest, we will confess that we have deceived our parents, spouse, and children; hence, we are not honest or genuine. No one is true.</p>
<p>In human history there has been only one honest person&mdash;Jesus Christ. When He was seized before His crucifixion, He underwent six trials. Three times He was tried according to the Old Testament law and judged by the Jewish high priests Annas and Caiaphas and by the Sanhedrin (John 18:13; Matt. 26:57; Luke 22:66). He was also tried three times according to Roman law and judged by Herod and by Pilate (23:1-25). Eventually, Pilate said that he found no fault in Him (John 19:4; Luke 23:22). In other words, Pilate found no error or falsehood in the Lord Jesus. Who among men could pass through such examinations? We would not have needed six trials to prove that we are at fault. One trial would have been sufficient. Only Jesus Christ could stand in front of everyone and say, &ldquo;Which of you convicts Me of sin?&rdquo; (John 8:46).</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is the true God and a true man. He is rich. I once made a list of the riches of Christ according to the Bible. Jesus Christ is God, man, life, light, holiness, righteousness, sanctification, love, grace, and so many other items. He is over two hundred and seventy items. He is every positive item. He is the sun, the air, food, water, and the best drink. He is whatever we need. He is our patience, our love, and our obedience. He is God, and He is man. He became a man to be our Redeemer and our Savior. He also became the life-giving Spirit. He is the light of life, and this light is full of the elements of grace, righteousness, and holiness. He is the glory of God and every human virtue. We are false; only Christ is true. Our humility is false; only Christ is real humility. Every human virtue is a shadow; only Christ is the reality. Christ is so rich.</p>
<p>When Paul announced the gospel, he did not announce doctrine; he announced a person. Paul announced the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel. We should do the same today. We should announce Christ everywhere around the world. Christ is living, true, all-inclusive, deep, and vast. He is rich, and He is everything.</p>
<p>It is not easy to be a parent. People want children, but they do not know how difficult it is to be a parent until after they have children. It is easier to deal with other people than with our own children. It is most difficult for parents to deal with their children. Therefore, I would like to inform the parents that you need Christ. When you have Christ, you will know how to deal with your children. Christ is our wisdom in dealing with our children. When we have Him, we have wisdom, because He is wisdom. Furthermore, He is our life and ability so that we not only know how to deal with our children but also have the ability to deal with them. We need Christ. He is everything that we need in our daily living.</p>
<p>Paul announced Christ in such a way. Paul did not talk about doctrines; he announced Christ and also delivered Christ. To tell you how nutritious a drink is and how it can quench your thirst is like announcing doctrines. But if I deliver the drink to you, you can enjoy its nutrients by drinking. Paul delivered the riches of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Strengthened into the Inner Man and Christ Making Home in Our Hearts</h2>
<p>After speaking of the mystery of Christ, Paul bowed his knees unto the Father and prayed for the believers. Paul did not ask the Father to give us peace, prosperity, wealth, or success. He prayed that the Father would grant us, &ldquo;according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home&rdquo; in our hearts through faith (Eph. 3:16-17). When we are strengthened into the inner man, Christ will be able to make His home in our hearts; that is, Christ will have the ground in us and will be the Master of our home. This is a crucial key. In order to see the mystery of Christ and the riches of Christ, we must let Christ make His home in our hearts. If Christ cannot make His home in our hearts, we will have nothing of His riches in our experience.</p>
<p>After a couple gets married, it is inevitable that there will be problems. Everyone likes the word <em>marriage,</em> but no one wants trouble. Once a marriage is &ldquo;tied,&rdquo; however, the couple is bound together; this means that they are trouble-bound as well. Before getting married, a single brother does not have many problems. But after he is married, he will begin to have problems the second day of his marriage. It is not easy to be married. Therefore, we need Christ. However, we should not only have Christ; we must also let Christ make His home in our hearts. If Christ does not make His home in us, our having Christ is in vain. For example, what is the purpose of having a cup with water if we do not drink the water? If we drink the water, it enters into us, and we receive the supply.</p>
<p>A sister may be a good wife, but she can be a problem to her husband. If the brother lives in his emotions, an unpleasant countenance and tone from her will touch his emotions and provoke his anger. If he is a rational person, his mind will be able to control him when his anger flares up. However, over time his anger will eventually overcome his mind, and he will respond when she speaks. This is a typical example of how an argument occurs between a husband and wife. We cannot say that Christ is not in the husband and wife. Christ is in them, but He does not have ground in them; hence, He is confined by them.</p>
<p>Man has many parts. We have emotions, which include our anger. We have a mind, in which is our reasoning. We have a will, which can control our behavior. If our will is not strong, we will not be able to control ourselves, and we will lose our temper. However, we also have an inner man, which is our spirit. When we lose our temper and quarrel with our spouse, we are using our mind, emotion, and will. When we quarrel, our inner man often faintly says, &ldquo;Why are you doing this? What are you quarreling about? Calm down! Pray!&rdquo; Every believer has had this kind of experience. This is Christ in our spirit. We lose our temper and quarrel with our spouse because we are strong in our mind and emotion; we are strong in everything but not in our inner man, where we confine Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>Therefore, Paul prayed that the Father would grant us, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith (vv. 16-17). When our spirit is strong, it prevails over our mind, emotion, and will; our spirit can prevail over our entire soul. Many of us have had the experience of our anger dissipating when we call, &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; Our anger can be compared to a big balloon that is pricked and deflated when we call on the Lord. When we are strengthened into the inner man, Christ has the ground to come out of His confinement. We may confess our sin, saying, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me for not giving You the ground. I was the boss. Lord, forgive me and gain me.&rdquo; When we pray in this way, we give Christ the opportunity to permeate our inward parts and to supply our whole being. Christ can gain ground and make His home in our hearts when we are strengthened into the inner man.</p>
<p>In Greek the word <em>hearts</em> in this portion is not a word without a definite meaning that is used to fill out the sentence; rather, it functions as a noun with a definite meaning that is important to the sentence. The heart here refers to our psychological heart, not our physiological heart. Our heart is composed of our mind, emotion, will, and conscience. For Christ to make His home in our hearts is for Him to possess these four parts. The phrase <em>make home</em> is a verb derived from the noun <em>home</em> in Greek. Hence, it should be rendered &ldquo;make home.&rdquo; When we visit the churches, we may stay in a hospitality room in a meeting hall, and the love and service of the saints may be perfect. However, no matter how perfect everything may be, this room is not our home. We can only be a guest; we cannot make our home there. We must be ready to leave at any moment.</p>
<p>It would be terrible if Christ were merely a guest in us. As Christians, we possess the Lord&rsquo;s life within us. But the question is whether the Lord has made home in our hearts. When He makes home in our hearts, His riches are transmitted into us to supply our needs and quench our thirst. We should never think that this is superstition or that this is merely someone&rsquo;s exposition of the Bible. I can testify that this has been my experience for over fifty years.</p>
<p>Christ is rich; He is God, He is the Spirit, He is life, and He is a man. In resurrection He brought humanity into divinity. Now the human element is in the Spirit and in the divine life. The resurrected Christ is indescribably rich.</p>
<p>The Christ in whom we believe is true. He is a mystery, and He is rich. However, He must make His home in us. For Him to make home in us means that we give everything to Him, and He supplies us within. If we lack wisdom, He is our wisdom. If we lack patience, He is our patience. If we lack humility, He is our humility. He is whatever we lack. He is not an objective religion, nor is He doctrine. He is living inside of us. He is God, man, the Spirit, and life; He is all and in all. His riches are unsearchable and inexhaustible. As long as we open to Him, give Him the ground, and let our inner man prevail over our mind, emotion, and will, Christ will have the ground to make His home in us.</p>
<p>Then we will be filled with the riches of Christ, His rich supply. The result of such filling is that we become the fullness of God, that is, the expression of God. We will express God. This expression is the church. The multifarious wisdom of God is made known to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies through the church. This is what we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery announce and testify in every country and in every place. I hope that the young people, the young adults, the middle-aged, and the elderly among us would see this mystery. This is our vision, and this is our testimony.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH BEING THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:4-6, 13-16, 22-24</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUR BASIC VISION BEING<br />
THE DEEP MYSTERY IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The Lord has shown us a vision. This vision includes not only the revelation on the surface of the Bible but also the deep mystery in the Bible. The revelation on the surface of the Bible can be understood by anyone. In order to understand the mystery in the depth of the Bible, however, we must be enlightened by God, and we need much experience. Without light and experience, it is hard to see the mystery in the Bible.</p>
<p>The deep mystery in the Bible is related to God, because God is a mystery. The universe that He created also is a mystery. Throughout the ages questions related to the meaning of the universe and the purpose of man&rsquo;s existence have been unresolved. The Bible reveals that the Lord Jesus was the most excellent person in human history. No historian can understand the Lord Jesus or describe Him thoroughly. Thus, the Lord Jesus is a mystery. The Bible speaks of an additional matter that is related to the meaning of the universe and to the meaning of human existence. This matter is the church.</p>
<p>The meaning of the word <em>church</em> is the &ldquo;assembly of the called-out ones.&rdquo; There are millions of people in the world, but only a small number believe in the Lord Jesus, have been cleansed by His precious blood, and have been regenerated by the Spirit. These ones have been called and separated by God. When they gather together, they are the assembly of the called ones. Before Christianity came to China, the term <em>called-out assembly</em> was not used in ancient Chinese literature. The word <em>church</em> was translated in Chinese as &ldquo;religious assembly.&rdquo; The word <em>religious</em> is not appropriate. The phrase <em>called-out assembly</em> is much better than <em>religious assembly.</em> We are the called-out assembly. However, the term <em>called-out assembly</em> cannot fully explain the meaning of this mystery. The church is a true mystery.</p>
<p>God is a mystery, the universe is a mystery, Christ is a mystery, and the church is a mystery. Those who want to know these mysteries must read the Bible. Regrettably, people do not see these mysteries even after reading the Bible many times. Those who read the Bible know that God created the heavens and the earth and that man sinned. They also know that God sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to accomplish redemption for man. It is easy to see these things in the Bible, but it is not easy to see the mystery of God, the mystery of the universe, or the mystery of Christ. People see the Christ who is on the surface of the Bible, but they do not see the mystery of Christ; they do not see the church as a mystery. They can see what is on the surface but not the deep things. They can see the revelation on the surface, but they do not have a vision of the mystery. In the past decades God has opened the Bible and given us a vision of this mystery.</p>
<p>The mystery of God is Christ; Christ is the mystery of God. If we want to know God, we must come to Christ. When we find Christ, we find God. When we know Christ, we know God. Who is God? If we want to know God, we must look at Christ, because Christ is the definition, explanation, meaning, and expression of God. All that God is, all that He does, and all that He has dwell in Christ. Everything related to God dwells in Christ. Christ is the embodiment of God; hence, to know Christ is to know God. Christ was born a man, He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, was crucified, and rose from the dead. Now He is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). After passing through such a process, Christ has been manifested as the mystery of God. Now we know how to contact God. All that God is, has, and does are in Christ and expressed through Christ. Christ is the mystery of God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST BEING THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>God is a mystery, and Christ is also a mystery. The Bible reveals that the mystery of God is Christ and that the mystery of Christ is the church (Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4-6). The church is the mystery of Christ. In other words, the church is the image, expression, and explanation of Christ. We should not think that <em>church</em> refers to a chapel. The church is not a chapel. Furthermore, the church as a mystery does not refer merely to a gathering of a group of people who have been saved and called out by God. Even though we may know the outward appearance of a person&rsquo;s physical body, we do not know his thoughts, ideas, emotions, moods, or intents, nor do we know his spiritual constitution. We do not know his inner person, because his real person cannot be fully expressed or represented by the members of his body. Every believer is a part of the church; hence, the believers collectively are the church. However, this is only an outward description of the church. The church has a deeper and more intrinsic aspect. The intrinsic aspect of the church is Christ.</p>
<p>When a brother is saved, others can see that he has believed in Jesus and that he is going to meetings, but they may not know what has happened within him. Even the brother himself may not be able to explain what has happened. Something has happened within him, but he cannot explain it. That he cannot explain it speaks of a mystery. Before he was saved, he easily lost his temper, went to movie theaters, played cards for relaxation, and even cursed or hit people. But one day he believed in the Lord, prayed, and called upon His name. Then something happened within him. When he wanted to lose his temper, a voice within him would say, &ldquo;Do not lose your temper. Stop.&rdquo; Before he was saved, he felt better when he lost his temper. But after his salvation he no longer felt good when he lost his temper, because Someone within him was bothering him. This Someone is the Lord Jesus Christ. Others may not understand, but we know that a living person is in us. This living person is the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is in us. Some people say that we can neither see Him nor feel Him. It is true that we cannot see Him, but it is inaccurate to say that we cannot feel Him. Sometimes we are not aware of Him, but at other times we sense that He is bothering us. Previously, no one could control us when we lost our temper. Now, however, when we lose our temper, He not only regulates us; He may even rebuke us, asking, &ldquo;Why do you lose your temper when you are wrong?&rdquo; Every believer has had such experiences.</p>
<p>Christ is the true and living Lord. He is the Spirit, who indwells us. Christians can be living, strong, and unafraid of persecution and can overcome sin and darkness because of the Lord. Before a person is saved, he might be easily tempted to sin, but after he is saved, he does not so easily waver when he is tempted. He can even overcome temptations, because there is power within him. This living power is Christ. Christ is the life-giving Spirit in us. This is the experience of Christ in us.</p>
<p>Before we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were alone, but now we are no longer alone; there is a person in us. This person is the Lord Jesus. He is so good that we often thank and praise Him. Sometimes, however, He bothers us and does not let us go. A sister may want to buy a dress, but the Lord does not want her to buy it. Therefore, He expresses His feeling and gives her the sense that He does not agree. If the sister insists on buying the dress, He will bother her. While she is talking with the salesperson, He may say, &ldquo;Why are you bargaining with him? Go home. Do not buy it.&rdquo; The sister is talking to the salesperson, but the Lord is talking to her. She may become unhappy or even angry, but the Lord does not get angry. If the sister continues to insist, she will not have peace, because the Lord will continue to tell her that He does not approve of her purchase. He may bother her so much that she is unable to eat well or sleep well for a few days. This is an experience of Christ living in us.</p>
<p>As Christians in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have been captivated by Christ; He has charmed us. We have many meetings every week, and we always go to the meeting hall. We go to the meeting hall after work, and we also go to the meeting hall on holidays. Our relatives and friends do not understand why we are more interested in going to the meeting hall than in traveling or sightseeing. In the meeting hall there are only Bibles, hymnals, and spiritual books. Our relatives and friends may even follow us to the meeting in order to find out what we are doing. In the meeting hall they only see people singing hymns, praying, and listening to the Lord&rsquo;s word. Because they cannot understand what we are doing, the church is a mystery to them.</p>
<p>Even though I was young when I believed in the Lord Jesus, I went to the meetings frequently because I was touched by the Lord. As a result, my mother said to me, &ldquo;I also believe in Jesus, but I only go on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. Why do you go to three meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day? You go to one in the morning, one in the afternoon, and one in the evening. Why do you also go to so many meetings during the week?&rdquo; At that time I was about twenty-one years old. I did not enjoy anything other than going to the meetings. Even if it was pouring rain, I would not be happy unless I went to the meeting. As soon as I stepped into the meeting hall, I was happy. When I sat down, I forgot all my troubles. This is a mystery.</p>
<p>Christ is a mystery, and Christ in us is also a mystery. The Christ in you is not separate from the Christ in me. Christ in us can be likened to electricity. We can be likened to many light bulbs through which the electrical current flows.</p>
<p>Christ is flowing through all of us, and His flowing connects us. We are joined together as one entity because of Christ, through Christ, and in Christ; this one entity is the church. Strictly speaking, you are not the church, and I am not the church; we are not the church. The church is the Christ in you, in me, and in all of us. The church is Christ in His believers. If Christ had not entered into us, He would still be Christ but not the church. When He enters into us, He becomes the church.</p>
<p>The church is not Christ in heaven, nor is it Christ outside of us. Christ must enter into us in order to be the church. The church is a mystery because Christ in us is a mystery. The church is profound and mysterious. The church is not a chapel, nor is it merely a gathering of a group of people who believe in Jesus. The church is Christ in all the saints.</p>
<p>We are God&rsquo;s called ones, and we have Christ in us. If we are full of criticism and arguments when we come together, we are not the church. The church is Christ being expressed through us. When we gather together and exhibit Christ, we are the church. The church is not merely a gathering together of a group of people. The church is Christ in us and Christ being lived out from us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is corporate. We are not the church if we are separated from one another. Therefore, the Bible reveals that the church is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). The Lord Jesus Christ was incarnated to be a man with a physical body. However, the Body of Christ in Ephesians does not refer to a physical body with flesh and blood but to the mystical Body that is composed of millions of believers. The church is the Body of Christ; hence, the church possesses Christ and is the mystery of Christ.</p>
<p>It is impossible for a normal person to have a head without a body. This also applies to Christ. Christ is the Head; He has a Body, and He is the Body. It is difficult for Bible expositors to thoroughly expound this matter, because the Body of Christ is a mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Being the Reality of the Body</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:4 says, &ldquo;One Body and one Spirit.&rdquo; Paul associates one Body with one Spirit, because the Spirit is the reality and essence of the church as the Body of Christ, just as wood is the reality and essence of a wooden table. The church is the Body of Christ, and the church is the Spirit, because the Spirit is the essence of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the Body, because the Spirit is the reality of the Body and the essence of the Body. The indwelling Christ is our life. However, if we live by the self or by the flesh, we are not the Body of Christ, because the Body of Christ is the Spirit. Only when we live by the Spirit can we be the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>If we know that the church is the mystery of Christ and the Body of Christ, we will realize that the church is not simply a gathering together of the believers. Only when we live in the Spirit are we the church. If we do not live in the Spirit, we are not the church. Consider two brothers who love the Lord, read the Bible often, and serve much. Both are captivated by the Lord Jesus, and they do not love the world, nor do they care about their future; they have abandoned everything for Jesus. Nevertheless, this does not make them the church. If they live in the flesh, murmur, criticize, or lose their temper, they are not the church. Brother A may say to Brother B, &ldquo;Why do you always speak from the podium? You should give others a chance.&rdquo; And Brother B may reply, &ldquo;Go ahead and speak!&rdquo; Is this the church? When we are not in the Spirit, we are not the church.</p>
<p>Suppose both brothers live in the mind or in culture. They may be very courteous and polite, but they are actually hypocritical. This is not the church. Because Brother A does not know what to say, he may ask, &ldquo;How have you been the past couple of days? How is your wife? How are the children?&rdquo; Even though Brother B is troubled, he may reply, &ldquo;Very good. Thank you.&rdquo; This is formality. Brother A is hypocritical because his question is a formality, and Brother B is also hypocritical because he is pretending that he is not suffering. Both brothers are not in the Spirit, and thus, they are not the church. If we do not live by the Spirit, we are not the church.</p>
<p>Today the church is weak. It is not advancing, it is not rich, it is not living, it is not high, and it is not released, because we do not live the church. The church is uniquely one, but there are many things that are not the church. We can be many things but not be the church. We can be meek not irritable, genteel not course, and prudent not foolish and still not be the church, because we are not in the Spirit. When we are not in the Spirit, we are not the church.</p>
<p>Being the church is not a simple matter. The church must be in the Spirit, and it must be the Spirit. It is easy for people to not be in the Spirit. For example, there is only one bull&rsquo;s eye on a target, and it is not easy to hit the bull&rsquo;s eye. If we do not hit the bull&rsquo;s eye, we have not hit the target.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>one Body and one Spirit</em> indicates that the Body is the Spirit and that the Spirit is the Body. Some Christians think that it is heresy to say that the church is the Spirit. They say, &ldquo;The Spirit is the Holy Spirit; how can you say that the Spirit is the church?&rdquo; They do not understand, because they lack light and experience. The Bible says, &ldquo;One Body and one Spirit.&rdquo; The Body is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Body. However, there is a distinction: the Spirit outside of us is not the Body; only the Spirit dwelling in us is the Body. According to this principle, we are the Body because the Spirit is in us. When we are in the Spirit, we are the Body, but when we are not in the Spirit, we are not the Body.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:4 continues, &ldquo;Even as also you were called in one hope of your calling.&rdquo; The word <em>hope</em> refers to the transfiguration of our body, that is, to our entering into glory, our hope of glory. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;One Lord, one faith, one baptism.&rdquo; We have a living Lord. Those who believe in Him, receive Him, and are baptized will be raised together with Him. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The church is a living entity, an organism; it is the mingling of the Triune God with man. Verses 4 through 6 speak of the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father. The Father is the first in the Trinity; the Lord, the Son, is the second in the Trinity; and the Spirit is the third in the Trinity. The Triune God is fully mingled with the church.</p><h2 class="head2">The Growth of the Body<br />
Depending on the Increase of God</h2>
<p>The Body is the mingling of the Triune God with the believers. The Body needs to be built up. The building up of the Body of Christ is different from the building of a house. The building of a house consists of attaching one piece of material to another. The building of the Body depends on growth. Verses 13 through 16 say, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may be no longer little children...but holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; This portion speaks of growth several times, because growth is building up. Growth does not depend on preachers; growth depends on every member of the Body, that is, every believer. When the element of God grows in every believer, the Body grows and builds itself up in love. Colossians 2:19 says, &ldquo;Holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God.&rdquo; The growth of the Body is the result of the increase of God in the Body. This increase is growth.</p>
<p>It may sound strange to speak of God increasing in us, but those with experience know that this is a precious and enlightening word. When we were saved, we received God, but we need more of God in us. This means that the element of God must increase in us. Some people may say, &ldquo;I was very spiritual a few months ago. I sang Hallelujahs every day and did not lose my temper, but now I am very low. I cannot rise up; I am no longer buoyant within. Therefore, I dare not say that the element of God has increased within me. Maybe I had more of the element of God a few months ago.&rdquo; We need to see that once God enters a person, He will never leave. God increases, but He does not decrease. A brother may have been overcoming and then feel low a few months later, but the element of God within him has not decreased. Being low is only a matter of feeling; God remains unchanged in us. Once He comes in, He will not leave, and when He increases, He will not decease. With God there is only entering; there is no exiting. There is only increase; there is no decrease.</p>
<p>Christians have the mistaken concept that they have more of the element of God when they are overcoming and high and that God is no longer in them when they are low or lose their temper. A person with such a concept lacks understanding and experience. According to the Bible and Christian experience, God can only enter into man; He does not leave. He will not leave in this age, in the coming age, or in eternity.</p>
<p>We are grateful to God for increasing in us. As a result of His increase, we may grow in life together with other believers. This growing together is the building. The members of our physical body are not joined and knit together in the way that a house is built and constructed. The members of our body grow together in life. If the life in our body dies, the members of our body will also die. All the members of our body are joined together to be one body by our growth in life. This also applies to the building up of the church. The more a person grows in life, the more he will grow together with others.</p>
<p>We can testify that when we were new believers, we were zealous for the Lord, and attending the meetings gave us great joy. However, we were not adequately joined to the saints. Sometimes we do not dare to touch the new believers, because we are fearful that they are fragile like glass and can break. After a few years, however, when they are joined together with others in the church, there is no fear that they will break when they are touched. This shows that the divine life is growing in them. When life grows, we spontaneously grow together and are joined together with all the saints. This is the building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE ONE NEW MAN<br />
WITH CHRIST AS ITS PERSON</h2>
<p>When all the members of the Body are built up together, the Body becomes the one new man. The church is not only the Body of Christ but also the one new man. A body needs life; it is not a body without life. A man, however, needs not only life but also a person. The church is the one Body of Christ and also the one new man. As the Body, the church takes Christ as her life; as the new man, the church takes Christ as her person. The manifestation of the new man depends on the believers taking Christ as their person.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:22-24 says, &ldquo;Put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.&rdquo; The secret to putting off the old man and putting on the new man involves a change of persons. In the past we lived in our old man, but now we must live in the new man. Hence, there is not only growth but also a change of persons. In order to be renewed, we need to allow the element of God to increase in us daily, and we also need a daily change of persons. In the New Testament to be renewed is to be transformed. When we are renewed, we are transformed. This is not the outward adjustment of character but the transformation of our inner being until we are the same image as the Lord within and without.</p>
<p>Verse 22 says that the old man is &ldquo;being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit.&rdquo; In Greek the word <em>deceit</em> is a noun, not a verb. There is something called deceit. The old creation is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit. Verse 24 says that the new man &ldquo;was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.&rdquo; In Greek both <em>deceit</em> and <em>reality</em> are personified. <em>Deceit</em> refers to Satan; <em>reality</em> refers to God. Satan, who is called the deceit, is the person in our old man, and God, who is the reality, is the person in our new man. Satan is the deceit, but God is the reality. Whatever we do when we live in the old man is deceitful, because deceit is our person. But our person has changed. The Lord is our new person, and He is God. He is the reality, in which are righteousness and holiness. Righteousness is to be right with God and man in everything, not having anything unrighteous, unfair, or improper. Holiness is to be the same as God in nature and to be fully separated from everything common, that is, everything other than God. Hence, the church is not only the Body of Christ; the church is also the new man who takes Christ as her person.</p>
<p>There are three crucial points in Ephesians 4. First, the church is one Body mingled with the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Second, the Body is being built up by the growth in life, which depends upon the increase of God within the members. Third, the Body grows, is built up, and lives by another person to become the one new man, having the image of the Lord for His expression.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH BEING<br />
THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTERPART OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:25-32</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL VISION&mdash;CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The Lord has given us a revelation over the last sixty years concerning Christ and the church, and we have published many periodicals and books with messages related to Christ and the church.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that Christ is not only all-inclusive but also deep and vast; He is unfathomably deep and boundlessly vast. Although Ephesians speaks of the church, its revelation of the church is according to Christ. In Ephesians 3:18 Paul refers to Christ using the words <em>breadth, length, height,</em> and <em>depth.</em> Nothing is wider than Christ, nothing is longer than Christ, nothing is higher than Christ, and nothing is deeper than Christ. Christ is the breadth and length and height and depth of the universe. Christ is not only all-inclusive but also all-extensive. Our Christ is truly inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Christ is universally large, and so is the church&mdash;His Body. If my head were bigger than my body, I would be a monster. Regrettably, in Christianity today people speak of Christ, but they do not speak much about the church, the Body. Some even erroneously regard the church as a chapel. The Bible shows that the church is the Body of Christ; it is an inexhaustible mystery. The vision that we have seen for the past sixty years is not simple or superficial. It includes not only the revelation on the surface but also the central vision, the deep mystery in the Bible.</p>
<p>Ephesians 3 presents three crucial points: the mystery of Christ (vv. 4-6), the unsearchable riches of Christ (v. 8), and Christ making His home in our hearts until we become the fullness of God (vv. 17-19). Chapter 4 also presents three crucial points. The first crucial point is that the church is the Body of Christ because it is mingled with the Triune God. The Triune God is mingled with the church&mdash;the Spirit is the essence of the Body, the Son is the course of the Body, and the Father is the source of the Body. The Triune God is spoken of in verses 4 through 6, and in verse 6 alone, which says, &ldquo;One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all,&rdquo; the Triune God is implied: <em>over all</em> refers to God the Father as the source, <em>through all</em> refers to God the Son as the Lord and Head being the Accomplisher, and <em>in all</em> refers to God the Spirit as the life-giving Spirit being the Executor in us. Therefore, in the reference to the Father in verse 6, we can see the aspects of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. He is over all, through all, and in all. <em>Over</em> refers to the source, <em>through</em> refers to the process, and <em>in</em> refers to the result, the issue, which is the Triune God and the Body of Christ being fully mingled as one.</p>
<p>The second crucial point is that the Body needs to be built up, even though it has been mingled as one with the Triune God. The Body is built up through the growth in life, and the growth in life depends on the increase of God&rsquo;s element in us. The more God&rsquo;s element increases in us, the more we grow. Our growing together is the building. We need to grow in life to fulfill our function and build up the Body in love (vv. 13-16).</p>
<p>The third crucial point is that the Body needs to be transformed by putting off the old man and putting on the new man. Transformation produces the new man. The Body is a matter of life, and the new man is a matter of person. We need to put off the old man and put on the new man so that the Body may become the new man (vv. 22-24).</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE COUNTERPART OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>We also need to consider Ephesians 5. On the surface chapter 5 is on ethics and morality, including matters between husbands and wives, such as wives being subject to their husbands and husbands loving their wives (vv. 22, 25). Paul, however, uses this subject to further expound on the deep mystery of Christ and the church. In Ephesians Paul presents many crucial points concerning the church. In chapter 1 he speaks of the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ (vv. 22b-23). In chapter 2 he speaks of the church as God&rsquo;s masterpiece, God&rsquo;s household, God&rsquo;s kingdom, and God&rsquo;s dwelling place (vv. 10, 19-22). In chapter 3 he speaks of the church as God&rsquo;s fullness (v. 19). In chapter 4 he speaks of the church as the new man and of Christ as the person of the new man (v. 24). In chapter 5 he speaks of the church as the counterpart of Christ (v. 25). The church is not only the Body of Christ and the new man but also the counterpart of Christ.</p>
<p>To understand the meaning of being a counterpart, we must look at the first couple in the Bible&mdash;Adam and Eve. Eve came out of Adam. When God created mankind, He created only a man, Adam (Gen. 2:7). Then God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and He took a rib from Adam&rsquo;s opened side and built the rib into a woman (vv. 21-22). Thus, Eve came out of Adam. This means that the two had the same life and same nature. When God gave Eve to Adam, the two became one flesh. A man can be considered as only one half of one person; a woman represents the other half. A couple is two halves becoming one.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5 shows that the church came out of Christ, just as Eve came out of Adam. When Christ was put to &ldquo;sleep,&rdquo; to death, on the cross, His side was pierced, and blood and water came out to produce the church (John 19:34)&mdash;blood for redemption and water for life. Hence, the church has the same life and nature as Christ, and the church is one spirit with Christ (Eph. 4:4).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD MAKING THE CHURCH<br />
HIS HOLY AND GLORIOUS COUNTERPART<br />
WITHOUT BLEMISH</h2>
<p>Chapter 5 further shows how this counterpart becomes a glorious counterpart, a beautiful wife. The Bible uses phrases such as <em>glorious, holy,</em> and <em>without blemish</em> to describe the church (v. 27), indicating that Christ would like to gain a beautiful church. A blemish is not related to filth. A precious stone, such as fine jade or a diamond, can be clean and free of filth but still be blemished if it is slightly spotted, chipped, or mixed in color. We can wash our face to be free of filth but still have spots and wrinkles. Christ wants His church to be glorious and holy, without any spot, wrinkle, or blemish. Today the Lord Jesus is removing the church&rsquo;s spots and wrinkles so that the church may be holy and without blemish.</p>
<p>The Lord can produce such a church because He loves the church and gave Himself up for her (v. 25). The Lord Jesus died on the cross not only to shed His blood to redeem us but also to release the divine life. When He died, blood and water came out of His pierced side (John 19:34). The blood redeemed us from sin, and water signifies God&rsquo;s life. The water that came out of His pierced side is like the water that came out of the smitten rock in the Old Testament (Exo. 17:6). Furthermore, in John 4:13-14 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life,&rdquo; and in 7:38 He said, &ldquo;He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; Revelation 22:1 speaks of a &ldquo;river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.&rdquo; The water in these verses is the water of life, which refers to the flowing life of God. The Lord Jesus died on the cross to release this life.</p>
<p>The Lord is also making the church holy and without blemish through the washing of the water in the word (Eph. 5:26). The water of life is in the word. Christ loves the church and gave Himself up for her to release His life and make her holy. Christ not only cleansed the church from sin by His blood, He also is washing away every spot and wrinkle by His life. This life was released on the cross and is embodied in the words of the Bible. Secular books can give people only knowledge; these books cannot give life, because there is no life in them. But God&rsquo;s life is conveyed through the Bible; it is living and able to supply life. People who read the Bible can all testify that this is the difference between the Bible and other books.</p>
<p>The Bible is the word of God, and in the word of God there is life (John 6:63). Without Jesus&rsquo; death on the cross, which released His life, the Bible would be empty today. However, He died and released God&rsquo;s life. This life is not only in the Holy Spirit but also in God&rsquo;s word. Whenever we read God&rsquo;s word, life flows in the word to supply us. This life supplies us within like a stream and flows throughout our being, washing us with its water.</p>
<p>Our body functions according to a metabolic law. We receive food into our being, and the nutrients in the food circulate throughout our bloodstream. The metabolic function in our body supplies our body with necessary nutrients on the one hand, and it removes waste from our body on the other hand. Such a washing clears away all the waste in our body.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible with prayer and our spirit, the life in the words of the Bible washes away the old things within us and takes away our spots and wrinkles &ldquo;metabolically.&rdquo; We should never read the Bible without prayer. When we read Ephesians 5:25, which says, &ldquo;Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her,&rdquo; we can pray, &ldquo;O Lord, husbands. Oh, husbands. Lord, I need this word. Love your wives. Love; oh, love. Lord, thank You for giving me a life of love, an ability to love, and a desire to love. Even as Christ also loved the church. O Lord, You loved the church. This love is in me so that I can love my wife even as You loved the church.&rdquo; As we pray-read in this way, life will circulate in our being, and in just a few minutes, we will not only be taught in our mind but also supplied in our spirit. This circulating life will stir up a love for our wife within us and wash away every &ldquo;spot&rdquo; of displeasure toward our wife.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Lord is making the church holy and without blemish by nourishing and cherishing her (v. 29). In Greek, <em>to nourish</em> means &ldquo;to nurture, to feed.&rdquo; To cherish is to foster like a mother bird who cares for her chicks by covering them under her wings and warming and caring for their needs. A mother who holds and nurses her child in her bosom is cherishing and nourishing. Through this, the child is supplied with food and is kept warm and comfortable. Such a satisfied child lacks nothing. This is the meaning of cherishing and nourishing.</p>
<p>Christ not only died for us and imparted His life into us so that we might be sanctified; He also put life in His word through the Spirit. When we contact His word by pray-reading, the water in the word circulates within us, taking away the spots, wrinkles, and blemishes in us and causing us to be renewed and transformed. He also cherishes and nourishes us, holding the church in His bosom to give us security, comfort, supply, and everything that we need. As a result, the church becomes glorious, being holy and without blemish. Christ will gain such a holy and glorious church without blemish and will present her to Himself as His beautiful counterpart.</p>
<p>For Christ to accomplish such a work, there is a need for death, resurrection, life, the word, and the Spirit, and there is a need for us to open to Him and be willing to dive into His bosom by pray-reading His Word and living in fellowship with Him. In this way we will enjoy His life and receive the washing of the water in His word. At the same time, we will be cherished and cared for and nourished and fed through His word and the Spirit. When we enjoy Him as everything, we will become holy and glorious, a church that can be presented to Himself having no spots, wrinkles, or blemishes. This is the reason that we cannot merely preach the gospel or teach the Bible according to its surface revelation. We must release the mystery deep in the Bible so that people may become the Body of Christ, be transformed and renewed into the universal new man, and be the beloved and glorious counterpart of Christ, a counterpart that is holy and without blemish.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SPIRIT WITH OUR SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 6:11-18</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You from the depths of our being. We worship You as God, as the Lord, as the Spirit, and as the Word. We worship You because You are the mystery, and You have made us Your mystery. We worship You because You have opened up Your mystery to us, setting us apart from all men. We worship You because You have equipped and filled us with Yourself to make us Your testimony. We worship You because You have the church on the earth, and we are Your church. Lord, we worship You; there are thousands of hearts here, each of which loves You and turns to You. We worship You because You desire to gain and fill us. We offer thanks to You from the depths of our being. May You speak the words on Your heart; speak the words that bind and destroy the enemy. Speak to us again. In such a speaking You are one spirit with us. We praise You as the Spirit and as the Word. Your word is the Spirit, and Your Spirit is the word. We tell You again that we love You. We thank You. We worship You. Amen.</p>
<p>The first five chapters of Ephesians speak extensively of the church being the mystery of Christ, of the building up of the church, and of the church being the Body of Christ, the new man, and the counterpart of Christ. Although Paul knew Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ, he also knew that our old man and our living in the old man, the self, and our natural constitution are against the church. Therefore, in chapters 4 and 5 he speaks of these things in order to deal with them and to show how to put off the old man and put on the new man.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ becoming our content and of Christ making His home in our hearts so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God. Chapter 4 speaks of putting off the old man and putting on the new man by being renewed in the spirit of our mind. Chapter 5 speaks of Christ giving Himself up on the cross in order to release His life, which is embodied in the word of God. In the word of God there is the water of life, which is the life of Christ containing all the riches of Christ. When we contact the word of God in our spirit, we are washed by the water in the word and nourished and cherished by the rich supply in the word. By enjoying this water of life, we become His counterpart.</p>
<p>However, Paul does not forget that the Lord has an enemy, the devil. Therefore, in chapter 6 Paul speaks of this enemy, including the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies. On the one hand, they operate in man&rsquo;s heart to corrupt man and resist man, thus nullifying the Body of Christ; on the other hand, they try to frustrate the will of God from being carried out. Consequently, in chapter 6 Paul tells us how to deal with the power of darkness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE WORD</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6:17 says, &ldquo;Receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.&rdquo; In the Gospels the Lord Jesus said that His words are spirit (John 6:63). In Ephesians 6:17 Paul says that the Spirit is the word of God. Hence, the word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the word. Many Christians know that the Bible is the word of God, but very few Christians know how to receive the word of God. We must understand that the word of God is not merely letters but the Spirit. We cannot separate the word of God from the Spirit of God. The word of God is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the word of God. In other words, the word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the word. When the word enters into us, it becomes the Spirit; when the Spirit comes out of us, He is the word. The word in the Bible is the word; the word entering into our spirit is the Spirit. These two are one.</p>
<p>We should never forget two verses in the New Testament: John 6:63&mdash;&ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit&rdquo;&mdash;and Ephesians 6:17&mdash;&ldquo;Which Spirit is the word of God.&rdquo; The Spirit is within and the word is without. The word entering into our spirit is the Spirit, and the Spirit coming out of our spirit is the word.</p>
<p>All the riches of Christ are in the word, and this word is the Spirit, which can only be contacted by the human spirit. Ephesians 6:18 says, &ldquo;Praying at every time in spirit.&rdquo; Therefore, verses 17 and 18 show us several key items: the Spirit, our human spirit, and prayer. The Spirit is the word, and the word is the Spirit. In order to contact the word and the Spirit, we need to pray at every time in our human spirit, not in our mind or emotion.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERY IN EPHESIANS 6<br />
BEING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Everyone who reads the Bible knows that Ephesians 6 emphasizes the whole armor of God. The church is not only the Body, the new man, and the bride&mdash;the counterpart of Christ; it is also the warrior. The church as the new man is toward Christ, but toward Satan the church is the warrior. In order to fight with Satan, the church must put on the whole armor of God. Putting on this armor involves six items: girding the loins with truth, putting on the breastplate of righteousness, having the feet shod with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace, taking up the shield of faith, receiving the helmet of salvation, and receiving the sword of the Spirit (vv. 14-17). The first five items are for protection; the last item, the sword, is for offense. This sword is called the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.</p>
<p>It is easy for those who read the Bible to see these items. However, the key to chapter 6 is the Spirit, not these items. If the word in chapter 5 does not become the Spirit in chapter 6, we will have no way to enjoy Christ. We, the Bible, and Christ are separate without the Spirit. Without the Spirit neither Christ and the Bible are one, nor are we and the Bible one. Christ, the Bible, and we are not joined together without the Spirit; we are separated. It is the Spirit who joins Christ and the Bible as one, and it is the Spirit who joins the Bible and us as one. We may liken the Spirit to the electrical current in a large building, which connects many appliances. The electrical current is the connection, the joining factor, for all the appliances. Likewise, Christ, the Bible, and the church are not connected without the Spirit. When the Spirit comes, the Spirit is not only in Christ and in the Bible but also in the church. The Spirit joins Christ, the Bible, and the church as one. The Spirit makes the riches of Christ the experience of the church and the content of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>On our side, we have a spirit, which responds to the Spirit. These two spirits&mdash;the Spirit and our human spirit&mdash;are crucial. Regrettably, most Christians neglect both the Spirit and the human spirit. How much time do we spend in our spirit? Most of the time we are in our mind, not in our spirit. In addition to our spirit, we also have a mind, emotion, and will and also our flesh, lust, and temper. When we are not in our spirit, we fall into these other things.</p>
<p>As believers, we have the Lord and we love the Lord. We have heard many truths in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and we understand the Bible. However, most of the time we do not enjoy the Lord. Instead, we live in outward activities because we are not in the spirit. What should we do in such a situation? We should receive the sword of the Spirit by pray-reading. We must pray-read in our spirit, because our spirit is the proper organ to receive the Lord&rsquo;s word. We must use the proper organ to receive the Lord&rsquo;s word, just as we must use our mouth to drink water, not our nose or ears.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO ENJOY THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Lord has accomplished everything. He released His life by passing through death and resurrection. Furthermore, all the riches of His life are available in the Word of God. In order for these riches to become our enjoyment, we must realize that receiving the riches in the Word is not a matter of learning letters but of receiving the Spirit, &ldquo;which Spirit is the word of God&rdquo; (v. 17). We need to use our spirit to contact the Spirit through prayer. We have gradually touched this secret over the past decades.</p>
<p>I was saved more than fifty years ago. After I was saved, I began to pray. I was taught to pray in this way: &ldquo;Dear heavenly Father, thank You for loving me. You sent Your Son to die for me on the cross. He shed His precious blood to cleanse my sins. I believe in Him! Heavenly Father, You have forgiven me and given me the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit helps me every day to love people, to be humble, to do things to please You, and to glorify Your name. I do not know how to pray, but I pray in the name of Jesus, Your Son. Amen.&rdquo; This kind of prayer is not wrong, but it is not effective. It is like a person searching for the switch to turn on a light but being unable to find it.</p>
<p>Later I encountered some difficulties, and being excessively burdened, I had no choice but to change my way of praying. I dropped my scripted prayers and simply came before God, telling Him of the sorrows in my heart. After this, I prayed in a very genuine way out from my spirit, no longer praying in an old way.</p>
<p>Gradually, the Lord showed me that the simplest way to pray in our spirit, rather than our mind, is to call on His name. Whether we call loudly or quietly, audibly or inaudibly, everyone who practices calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name knows that this is the easiest way to pray from the spirit rather than the mind. When we use our spirit in such a way, we touch the Spirit. The Bible and the Spirit become one when we touch the Spirit. When we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name as we are pray-reading the Bible, the words of the Bible spontaneously become our prayer. At this point our prayer is our reading of the Bible, and our reading of the Bible is our prayer. Such a prayer is prayer in the spirit, prayer mingled with the Spirit. In as little as a few minutes, we will become bright, living, fresh, buoyant, satisfied, strengthened, and inwardly supplied. It is amazing that within a few minutes light, living water, the word, strength, and love come to us. The messages in this section are very profound, but they conclude with the practical matter of pray-reading.</p>
<p>God has an eternal purpose, which is to work Himself into man. For this purpose Christ came. He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, died on the cross, and released the divine life from within Him. All the riches of His life are in the Bible. This Bible is the word of God, and the word is Spirit, the Spirit who gives life. When we contact the word, we need to forget about our mind and our problems. We should not pray dead prayers but simply use our spirit to pray in a living way. Through such prayer, we eat the Lord, drink the Lord, and enjoy the Lord. When we call on the Lord in spirit and pray-read the words of the Bible in spirit, the word of God will become the Spirit flowing through and supplying us as the living water and giving us strength, light, truth, and life so that we may have a rich, strong, and flourishing church life. Then God will have a way to carry out His eternal purpose through the church on the earth.</p><h1 class="series">SECTION THREE:<br />
THE MYSTERY OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:2-10, 14-19</h1>
<p>We have seen that the mystery of God is Christ and that the mystery of Christ is the church (Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4-6). Christ and the church are the great mystery (5:32). God is a mystery. Our mysterious God dwells in Christ bodily (Col. 2:9). Everything of God is in Christ. When we see Christ, we see God (John 14:9). When we contact Christ, we contact God. Hence, when we have Christ, we have God. Christ is the embodiment of God. Nevertheless, Christ is also a mystery. The mystery of Christ is the church. Just as God is embodied in Christ, Christ is embodied in the church. Once we contact the church, we contact Christ. When we are in the church, we are in Christ. The church is the mystery of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CHURCH DEPENDING<br />
ON CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider Ephesians 3:17: &ldquo;That Christ may make His home in your hearts.&rdquo; Christ making His home in our hearts is a mystery. This verse does not speak of Christ making His home in our <em>homes</em> but of Christ making His home in our <em>hearts</em>. Most Christians only know that Christ is with them; very few are clear that Christ wants to make His home in their hearts. Hence, many Christians only believe in and experience Christ being with them in a general way. However, Christ wanting to make His home in our hearts is a very specific process. Our heart is the central part of our being, and Christ wants to make His home in the central part of our being. The making of His home in our hearts is not something outward or superficial; it touches the depths of our being for our experience of the reality of the church life. In Christianity today we can barely see any reality or manifestation of the church. The manifestation of the church depends on Christ making His home in our hearts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEVEN MAJOR ITEMS IN EPHESIANS 3</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Mystery of Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3 presents seven crucial items. The first crucial item is the mystery of Christ in verse 4. <em>The mystery of Christ</em> indicates that Christ is a mystery, but this mystery is no longer hidden in the heavens or in God. Christ as the mystery has been revealed to us and in us, and He now dwells in us. Colossians speaks of this mystery when it says, &ldquo;Christ in you&rdquo; (1:27). We have something mysterious in our hearts&mdash;Christ. Today Christ is no longer merely objective; He has reached us and is in us subjectively. Christ is not only outside of us in our surroundings but also in our hearts, in the deepest part of our being. Thus, He is a mystery.</p>
<p>As Christians, we are joyful because Christ is in us, but others do not know the reason why we are so joyful. It almost seems to them that we are in the heavens, not on earth. This is a mystery to them. We can bear what others cannot bear, but the source of our strength and power is a mystery. We can love those who are difficult to love and also be virtuous toward others, but the source of our love and virtue is difficult to understand. We truly are a mystery to others. However, this is not a matter of mystery to us; we know the source of our power and life. Christ within us is our power and our life. The secret to our Christian life is Christ in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Unsearchable Riches of Christ</h2>
<p>The second crucial point of Ephesians 3 is the unsearchable riches of Christ in verse 8. In this verse Paul says, &ldquo;To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel,&rdquo; and in verse 2 he says, &ldquo;If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me for you.&rdquo; Furthermore, in 1 Corinthians 9:17 he says, &ldquo;I am entrusted with a stewardship.&rdquo; <em>Stewardship</em> here involves the dispensing of the unsearchable riches of Christ. It is not merely the riches of Christ but the unsearchable riches of Christ. Paul did not announce teachings or theology; he announced the unsearchable riches of Christ.</p>
<p>What are the unsearchable riches of Christ? The first item of the content of the riches of Christ is God. In Christ people find God. God is precious, but God can be found only in Christ. The second item of the content of the riches of Christ is the divine life. This life is very subjective, and it is very crucial. The divine life is in Christ. If we want to have the divine life, we must have Christ. The third item of the content of the riches of Christ is His perfect humanity. All human beings have defects and blemishes. We may feel good about ourselves at times, but more often than not we are dissatisfied with ourselves, because we know that we are not good. Only Christ is perfect; He has no shortcomings. He is the perfect man. If we want to have a fitting, perfect humanity, we must have Christ. Once we have Christ, we have God, life, and Christ&rsquo;s perfect humanity. We cannot list all of His riches, because they are unsearchable.</p>
<p>Paul announced this unsearchably rich Christ as the gospel. By God&rsquo;s mercy and grace, we must announce Him in this way as well. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we should not announce teachings or theology but the living Christ. We must minister this rich Christ to others; He is full of riches. We need to minister this Christ with His unsearchable riches to others day by day.</p><h2 class="head2">The Economy of the Mystery</h2>
<p>The third crucial item of Ephesians 3 is the economy of the mystery in verse 9. The Greek word for <em>economy</em> implies dispensing. God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense Christ. For example, if I dispense some paper money, my economy involves the dispensing of paper money. Rather than money, however, Paul dispensed the riches of Christ. All genuine Christians can testify that from the day they called on the name of the Lord, something mysterious was dispensed into them. This mysterious thing was Christ.</p>
<p>We have the mystery of Christ, and we have experienced some of the riches of this mysterious Christ that were dispensed into us. We enjoy Him and experience Him, and He has become our life and life supply, our support and strength. The more we experience Him, the more dispensing we receive; this is the dispensing of His riches into us. Such a dispensing is the dispensing of a mystery, which people cannot understand. Although this dispensing is mysterious, it is very sweet, rich, and excellent. Once these riches are dispensed into us, they cause us to be cheerful, full of vigor, and empowered. This is the result of enjoying the riches of Christ.</p>
<p>As believers, Christ is in us all. Sometimes we do not love Him, and we may say to Him, &ldquo;Lord, I do not love You.&rdquo; But from deep within us, He will say, &ldquo;I love you!&rdquo; At other times we may say, &ldquo;Lord, I am not happy with You.&rdquo; But He will say, &ldquo;I like you; I need you.&rdquo; Once we have received Christ, He will not leave no matter how much we try to drive Him away. Sometimes we may even say, &ldquo;Lord, I do not like that You are in me,&rdquo; but He will say, &ldquo;I like being in you.&rdquo; Thus, all we can do is love Him. When we say, &ldquo;Lord, I love You,&rdquo; He will respond, &ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo; This happens again and again, and this is the reason Christians are often beside themselves. We may be Chinese, Japanese, American, or another nationality, yet we are all beside ourselves because of Christ. Outsiders do not understand us when we gather together, and they may even say that we are superstitious, but the more we are captivated by Jesus, the more we are joyful. This is because we have the dispensing of this mystery.</p>
<p>Outwardly, some of us are Japanese, and others are Chinese. Normally, it is difficult for the Japanese and the Chinese to love each other, but whenever I, an old Chinese man, come to Japan, I sense a deep love within me for the Japanese saints. The reason for this is not because we know each other or can communicate in the same language. It is because we have the dispensing of this mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Church</h2>
<p>The fourth crucial item of Ephesians 3 is the church in verse 10. This chapter speaks of the mystery of Christ, the riches of Christ, the dispensing of the mystery, and the church. The church is produced by the dispensing of the mystery. When Christ is dispensed into you, into me, and into all the believers, we all enjoy Christ. The result of this dispensing and enjoyment is the producing of the church. We have been called to enjoy Christ, and this enjoyment of Christ manifests the church. The church is the gathering and rejoicing of people who are beside themselves because of Christ. You can say Hallelujah. I can say Amen. We all can say Praise the Lord. The church is not a building; the church is a living person rejoicing in the experiences of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Making His Home in Our Hearts</h2>
<p>The fifth crucial item of Ephesians 3 is Christ making His home in our hearts in verse 17. Even though we may see the church, Paul felt that this was not enough, so he said, &ldquo;I bow my knees unto the Father&rdquo; (v. 14). Even though we know the church and enjoy Christ, Paul still prayed for us because we do not have enough Christ, and we need more Christ.</p>
<p>We can have more Christ by letting Christ make His home in our hearts. We already have Christ in us. When we called O Lord Jesus, Christ entered into us. This Christ who has entered into us is a mystery; this mystery has been dispensed into us and has entered into the central part of our being. However, we need more experiences of Christ. The room in our being is very large, yet the room that Christ has in us is often very small. We need to gain more Christ. Although we have Christ in the central part of our being, we have not let Him fill our hearts; we need to let Him make home in our hearts.</p>
<p>In verses 16 through 17 Paul prayed that the Father would grant us, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith. Christ is indeed in us, but the problem is that we do not let Him spread in us. When we encounter troubles in our environment, such as losing our job, not getting along with our wife, or having problems in coordination, we turn to our mind and think, &ldquo;How can I solve this problem? How do I find another good job? Why did my wife treat me in such a way? How can I solve the problem in coordination?&rdquo; We ponder these questions over and over again and even do not sleep well. The more we turn to our mind, the more we are troubled, and the more we lose our ability to say Hallelujah. Even if we force ourselves to proclaim a few Hallelujahs, there is no power or vitality in it, because we are in our mind. Knowing this tendency, Paul bowed his knees unto the Father and prayed that the Father would, according to the riches of His glory, grant the saints to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man. To be strengthened into the inner man is to return to our spirit. Only by returning to our spirit can Christ make home in our hearts through faith.</p>
<p>We have all had this experience. When we are in our mind, we are weak, but after several days a brother may come to fellowship and pray with us. When we open our mouth to pray and turn from our mind to our inner man, Christ dispenses more of Himself into us. Christ wants to dispense Himself into us every day and to fill our hearts. His filling of our hearts is His making His home in our hearts. When He fills us, He becomes our content. He wants to fill our mind and thoughts, to occupy our emotions and mood, and even to control our judgments and decisions. Christ wants to fill every part of our being in this way so that He becomes our expression. When we are able to say, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21), our thoughts will be the Lord&rsquo;s thoughts, our love will be the Lord&rsquo;s love, and our decisions will be the Lord&rsquo;s decisions. Christ will become one with us, and we will become one with Him. This is Christ making His home in our hearts.</p>
<p>The Christian life should be a life of daily letting Christ make His home in our hearts. This means that the Christian life should be a life of letting Christ increase in us through a continuous dispensing of Himself into us in order to fill, occupy, and saturate us. Then we will experience the mystery of God, Christ, living in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Breadth and Length and Height and Depth<br />
of Christ</h2>
<p>The sixth crucial item of Ephesians 3 is the breadth and length and height and depth in verse 18. Once Christ makes His home in our hearts, we discover His boundlessness. He is the One who is wide, long, high, and deep. He is the breadth of the universe, the length of the universe, the height of the universe, and the depth of the universe. His breadth, length, height, and depth are immeasurable; this is Christ. The more we experience Him, the more we know His boundlessness; He is inexhaustible. There is a hymn that simply states, &ldquo;Oh, what a Christ have I!&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #510).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fullness of God</h2>
<p>The seventh crucial item of Ephesians 3 is the fullness of God in verse 19. Paul says, &ldquo;That you...may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God&rdquo; (vv. 17-19). When we experience Christ, we will discover that He is immeasurable, and we will be filled unto all the fullness of God. If there is no fullness of water in a cup, it may not be possible to see the water. But if we keep pouring water into the cup, the cup will be filled, and water will eventually overflow. This overflow is the expression of the fullness of the water. When there is only a little water in the cup, there is no fullness, and without a fullness, there is no expression. When we are filled with the riches of Christ according to the breadth and length and height and depth of Christ, we will be the fullness of God, and God will be expressed through us.</p>
<p>Ephesians 3 speaks of seven major items: the mystery of Christ, the unsearchable riches of Christ, the economy of the mystery, the church, Christ making His home in our hearts, the breadth and length and height and depth of Christ, and the fullness of God. God wants to flow through us and be expressed through us. The church is the fullness of God, the flowing out of God; it is a group of people who are filled with God unto all the fullness of God. When others see such a people, they see God&rsquo;s flowing. The church is the fullness of God, the overflowing of Christ. I believe that the churches in every locality will become the fullness of God to express Christ in this way. This is the church as the mystery of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">MINGLING, GROWING, AND RENEWING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:4-6, 11-24</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Ephesians is a book on the church; it reveals the church and presents the way to experience the church, which is to experience Christ. Christ is the mystery of God, and the church is the mystery of Christ. God is a mystery, and Christ is also a mystery. Nothing in the universe is as mysterious as God, and no one in history was as mysterious as Christ. Christ is God, and He became a man; hence, He is both God and man. As a man, He possesses two lives and two natures. He has the divine life and the divine nature as well as the human life and human nature. Our mind cannot comprehend how a person can have two lives and two natures, nor can our mind comprehend how Christ can be both God and man. This does not mean that Christ ceased being God when He became a man. Rather, Christ is both God and man. This mystery has been manifested in the church because the church is the mystery of Christ, just as Christ is the mystery of God (3:4-6; Col. 2:2).</p>
<p>God is a mystery, Christ is a mystery, and the church is a mystery. Many Christians do not know that the church is a mystery. They think that the church is a physical building with a cross on it. However, according to the divine revelation, the church is not a physical building; it is as mysterious as Christ, and Christ is as mysterious as God. God, Christ, and the church are three great mysteries. Those who are in the church are in a mystery. As believers, there is something mysterious in our being, and this mystery is Christ and God. Since we are the church, we have Christ and we have God.</p>
<p>Ephesians 3 says that this mystery includes the unsearchable riches of Christ (vv. 3-8). These riches have been dispensed into us. We have received the dispensing of the riches of Christ. Paul calls this dispensing the economy of the mystery (v. 9). The economy of the mystery is the dispensing of the mystery; God dispenses the mystery that is in Himself into us. Something mysterious has been dispensed into the children of God. Regrettably, many Christians do not know about the dispensing of the mystery, but in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we both know and experience the dispensing of the mystery.</p>
<p>Through the dispensing, the riches of Christ are constantly and mysteriously imparted into us. I can testify that this dispensing is imparting Christ into me moment by moment. Furthermore, I have the assurance that all the saints are experiencing this dispensing. The dispensing of the mystery produces the church; that is, the church is produced out of this dispensing. The producing of the church is mysterious and spiritual, for the church is produced out of the divine life. The dispensing is not physical or fleshly; rather, it is the Triune God dispensing His unsearchable riches into all those who believe in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE FULLNESS OF GOD</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3 says that the church is the fullness of God (v. 19). The fullness of God does not refer to the riches of God but to the overflowing of these riches. Suppose water is poured into a cup until it overflows. The water that overflows is the fullness, the expression, of the water. Likewise, the church is the fullness of God; the church is the overflowing of God, the expression of God. As Christians, we have the privilege of being filled with the Triune God so that He can overflow from within us. This overflow is the fullness of God, the manifestation of God, and the expression of God, which is the church.</p>
<p>The church is the expression of God. We cannot use something physical as an illustration of the church, because the church is mysterious. The church is the flowing within us. When we are filled with God and He overflows from within us, we are the church.</p>
<p>If each of us is not filled with God until He overflows, He will not flow out when we gather together. This is the experience of many Christians; they do not have much Christ in them. Hence, He does not flow out when they sing or pray. We should not be such Christians. Whether we are singing, praying, or praising, we should allow God to flow out. He should flow out in everything that we do. This is the church. The church is the fullness of God, the flowing out of God from within man.</p>
<p>In the previous chapter we said that Ephesians 3 speaks of seven great items: the mystery of Christ; the unsearchable riches of Christ; the economy of the mystery; the church; Christ making His home in our hearts; the breadth and length and height and depth of Christ, which are His immeasurable dimensions; and the fullness of God. Paul wrote chapter 3 according to these seven crucial items. The young people should memorize, understand, and experience these seven items. These seven items tell us what the church is. The church is the mystery of Christ, the unsearchable riches of Christ, and the economy of the mystery of God. The church is Christ making His home in our hearts and our experiencing the immeasurable Christ until we become the fullness of God, the expression of God. This is the church. It is wonderful and glorious.</p><h2 class="head1">MINGLING</h2>
<p>Chapter 3 presents the riches, and chapter 4 presents the depth. The word <em>rich</em> can be used to describe chapter 3, and <em>deep</em> can be used to describe chapter 4. Chapter 4 is deep because it speaks of mingling, growing, and renewing. Some may think that they know the meaning of the words <em>mingling, growing,</em> and <em>renewing,</em> but they may not understand the significance of these words. Who is mingled with whom? It is not sufficient to say that God is mingled with man. The God whom Paul presents in verses 4 through 6 is the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father&mdash;the Triune God. God is one, and He is three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not three Gods. God has the aspect of being one and the aspect of being three. God is one in His trinity&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Paul links the Body with the Spirit: &ldquo;One Body and one Spirit&rdquo; (v. 4). When there is the Body, there is the Spirit, and when there is the Spirit, there is the Body. This is mingling. Furthermore, if we have the Son, we have the Father (John 14:9-10). Hence, we need to consider how the Triune God is mingled with us.</p>
<p>Ephesians 3 presents the church as the fullness of God, the overflow of God. Chapter 4 says that there is one God, who is the Father and who is over all, through all, and in all (v. 6). The words <em>over all</em> refer to the source, God the Father, the first in the Trinity. The Father as the source is over all. <em>Through all</em> refers to God the Son, the second in the Trinity. The Father is the source, and the Son is the course, flowing through every believer. <em>In all</em> refers to the Holy Spirit, the third in the Trinity. The Holy Spirit is in every believer. As believers, we have the Father as the source of all, the Son as the course flowing through all, and the Spirit dwelling in us. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the source, the course, and the indwelling. The Father is over all, the Son is through all, and the Spirit is in all.</p>
<p>The mingling in Ephesians 4 is the mingling of the Triune God with His believers; it is man filled with God. Therefore, according to chapter 4, the church is one with the Triune God, who is over all, through all, and in all. This is mingling. The church is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;being mingled with man. The church is not a building with a steeple. The church is the mingling of the Triune God with His believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GROWING</h2>
<p>A form of the word <em>grow</em> is used three times in verses 11 through 16. Verse 13 has <em>full-grown man,</em> verse 15 has <em>grow up into Him in all things,</em> and verse 16 has <em>causes the growth of the Body.</em> These verses speak of the growth in life. The growth in life is the increase of Christ in us. Christ is complete; in Himself He does not need to grow, but He does need to grow in us. In Himself Christ is full-grown, but in us He can be likened to an infant; hence, He needs to grow. We must continually allow Christ to increase in us. His increase in us is His growth in us and our growth in life.</p>
<p>Verse 15 speaks of growing up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ. Our thoughts, love, hate, decisions, and intentions must grow up into Christ. We also need to grow up into Him in the things of our daily life, such as getting a haircut, shopping, and going to school. We should grow up into Him not only in great things but in everything. Many saints grow up into Christ in a few things but not in everything. We daily need to learn to grow up into Christ in everything. Then Christ will increase in us, and we will grow in life.</p>
<p>As we grow in life, we will spontaneously be built up. The building up of the church, the Body of Christ, is not like the building of a physical structure. A physical structure is built by putting together many building materials. The building up of the church is better compared to grafting, in which two living things are grafted together and grow together. Two stones that are put together will never grow together, but a branch can be grafted into a tree, and in time the two will grow together. Growing is building, and more growth means more building. As members of the Body of Christ, we are branches full of life; we are not lifeless stones. We have been grafted into Christ and are growing together with Christ. The more we grow, the more we are built up together. This growth is for the building.</p>
<p>When we are built into the Body, we can no longer leave the Body or the other members. For example, my arm is growing in my body. If my arm is unhappy with the other members of my body, it will find out that it cannot leave my body. All the members of my body must go where my body goes. As long as I am living, no member can leave my body. Likewise, once we are built into the church, we can no longer leave. It is easy to remove stones that are placed one upon another, but we are not stones; we are living members growing in the Body. A member that leaves the Body will die spiritually. If we do not want to experience spiritual death, we should remain in the Body. As members of the Body, we are not installed like various types of building materials; we are built up into the Body by growing.</p>
<p>When I first came to Tokyo in 1958, I saw the expression of the Body of Christ. I can testify that every time I come to Tokyo, I see Christ growing in the saints. The church in Tokyo is growing, and this growing is the building. Building is not a matter of putting many people together; that is human work, not growth in life. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery involves helping the saints to grow in life.</p>
<p>All mothers know that the way to help their children grow is to feed them. Children grow because they eat. Therefore, the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers should do the same work of feeding the believers. Just as waiters in a restaurant distribute food to people, so we should dispense Christ to people. Genuine ministry is not a matter of teaching but of feeding. Every meeting of the church should feed, nourish, and satisfy the saints. Eating causes a person to grow. Hence, if we want to grow, we need to eat.</p>
<p>Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name and pray-reading His Word are ways for us to &ldquo;eat&rdquo; the Lord. When we read the Bible, we should also pray. This means that we should pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word in order to eat His Word and to breathe His Word. We need to eat, drink, and breathe. Eating, drinking, and breathing make us strong and cause us to grow. We eat and drink by reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word with prayer, and we breathe by calling on His name. Eating, drinking, and breathing are crucial to our growth. When we grow up, we will be built up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RENEWING</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:17-24 concerns the matter of renewing. This portion speaks of the new man and the old man. The new man and the old man can be likened to two trees: one is dying, but the other is growing. The tree that is growing is being renewed day by day. Our growing is our renewing.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 has three key items. The first item is that the Triune God is mingled with man, the second item is that the growth of the Body involves the members growing together with Christ and growing up into Christ, and the third item is that the Body is being renewed. The first item concerns mingling, the second item concerns growing, and the third item concerns renewing. Renewing means that old elements are replaced and discharged by new elements. We have a new life, but in certain things we still express the likeness of the old man. Our thoughts, emotions, decisions, and habits are still old. Our conduct is old, and our methods are old. These old elements must be replaced and discharged. If we do not enjoy the new supply and receive the new element of the divine life, our old element will not be replaced or discharged.</p>
<p>There is a metabolic process occurring in our physical body. The new element in this process comes from eating. The food that we eat becomes the new supply, the new element in us. This new supply replaces and discharges our old element. This is the way our body is renewed day by day. We also need to be renewed spiritually by putting off the old man and putting on the new man. The new man is Christ Himself. When we experience and enjoy Christ, He supplies us so that we may put off the old man and put on the new man. This new man is the church.</p>
<p>To say that the church is the fullness of God means that the church is the expression of God. To say that the church is the Body of Christ means that the church is the organism of Christ, growing together with Him. To say that the church is the one new man means that the church is one with Christ, because the church has Christ as its person. The Body of Christ is related to life; the new man is related to person.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ needs Christ as its life; the new man needs Christ as its person. The church is not only the fullness of God and the Body of Christ but also the one new man. This new man lives out Christ and represents Christ. This new man is Christ Himself. My body is my expression, and my person is me. Similarly, the church is the Body of Christ to express Christ, and the church is also Christ. This is the new man.</p>
<p>We have been mingled with the Triune God, but we still need to grow and be renewed. We become the Body of Christ and the new man through mingling, growing, and renewing. If we are renewed daily by putting off the old man and putting on Christ as our new person, we will become the church as the new man.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WASHING OF THE WATER IN THE WORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:26-27, 29</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE WASHING OF THE WATER IN THE WORD</h2>
<p>In this chapter we come to Ephesians 5. The key to experiencing chapter 5 is the phrase <em>the washing of the water in the word</em> (v. 26). This extraordinary phrase contains three items: washing, water, and the word. The natural human mind cannot understand these items, but they are crucial in the church life. In order to have a proper church life, we must have the washing of the water in the word.</p>
<p>The washing of the water in the word is not the same as the cleansing of the blood of Christ. The blood of Christ cleanses us from our sins. The blood washes away our sinful deeds, our uncleanness, but the washing of the water in the word deals with our spots and wrinkles. Spots are scars from wounds, and wrinkles are signs of aging. In the beginning of the church life in a locality, the church is fresh and young; there are no spots or wrinkles. However, after a period of time wrinkles appear because the church gradually &ldquo;ages,&rdquo; and spots appear because the church has been wounded and has scars.</p>
<p>The blood washes away our sins, but the water in the word washes away our spots and wrinkles. The washing of the water in the word is not outward but inward. If my face is dirty, I just need to wash my face, and it will be clean. However, if there are wrinkles on my face, the wrinkles will remain even if I wash my face with the best soap. The best way to remove wrinkles is to become young. We have wrinkles because we are old. If we could make ourselves young, the wrinkles would spontaneously disappear.</p>
<p>If we want to be young, we need good metabolism. Our metabolism depends on our eating and drinking. If we eat nutritious food, we will receive more nutrients, and these nutrients will wash away our oldness. If we do not eat for three days, we will begin to wilt and decline, but if we eat nutritious food, the nutrients in the food will replace our oldness. The nutrients in the food that we eat cause a metabolic washing within us.</p>
<p>Similarly, in order for a Christian to grow, he must daily eat spiritual food, that is, the word of God. The words of the Bible are our spiritual food. In Matthew 4:4 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&rdquo; The word of God, that is, the word that proceeds out through the mouth of God, is our spiritual food. We should eat the words of the Bible not just once a day but many times a day. We eat physical food more than once a day. Similarly, the more times we eat spiritual food, the better. Some believers read the Bible once a day. This is better than not reading the Bible, but it is not sufficient. It is better to read, to eat, five times a day&mdash;in the morning, at noon, in the afternoon, in the evening, and at night. Some may say that they do not have time to read the Bible so often; however, if they are willing to set aside certain times, they will be able to read the Bible in this way. It takes me three and a half minutes to eat a snack in the afternoon. When I eat some fruit and drink a cup of water, I am revitalized and my strength is restored. If we are willing to spend three and a half minutes enjoying the Lord&rsquo;s Word, our strength will be renewed.</p>
<p>Some want to enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s Word, but they do not remember any verses. Hence, it is best to have a pocket-sized Bible. When I was around twenty years old, I took a Bible apart according to its books and made each book into a booklet. I carried these Bible booklets with me to work and read a few verses from them during my break. I spent less than five minutes to &ldquo;snack&rdquo; on the Word. We can all practice this. Since then I have memorized many verses. I have memorized almost the whole book of Ephesians, and I know the content and crucial points of each chapter.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I close my eyes in the afternoon, the water in the Lord&rsquo;s word washes me, sanctifies me, nourishes me, and cherishes me. Sometimes I spend a few minutes not to read the Lord&rsquo;s Word but to pray. Other times I muse upon a section of the Lord&rsquo;s Word while I take a walk. This is a &ldquo;snack.&rdquo; If I wake up very early in the morning and cannot fall back to sleep, I snack on a portion of the Lord&rsquo;s Word. This message is the issue of eating Ephesians 5 in the morning. In other words, I am speaking what I have eaten. I cannot count how many times I eat the Lord&rsquo;s Word in one day. Sometimes I eat the Lord&rsquo;s Word more than ten times. We should all be the same and daily eat the Lord&rsquo;s Word sufficiently in order to be supplied and washed by the Lord.</p>
<p>There is water in the Lord&rsquo;s word. This water refers to the life supply, the flowing of the divine life. When the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they were supplied by water that flowed out of a smitten rock (Exo. 17:6). This water signifies the divine life. In John 4 the Lord Jesus said to the Samaritan woman, &ldquo;Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life&rdquo; (vv. 13-14). In 7:37-38 the Lord Jesus stood and cried out, saying, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; The next verse says, &ldquo;This He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive&rdquo; (v. 39). These verses indicate that the living water is the Spirit. In Revelation 22:1 John says, &ldquo;He [the angel] showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.&rdquo; The river of water of life in the New Jerusalem signifies the flowing life of God. Today this living water is in the Bible. The words in the Bible contain the life supply. This living water is in the words of the Bible.</p>
<p>If we merely read the Bible with our eyes and understand it with our mind, we will gain knowledge but not living water. The living water is mysterious and spiritual. This water is not black and white letters; the letter can impart only knowledge. Deep in the words of the Bible is the life supply. This supply is the spiritual and mysterious water of life.</p>
<p>In order to touch the water of life, we must exercise our spirit through prayer. Man is tripartite. Our body is our outer part; our soul, including our mind, is in our body; and our spirit is even deeper than our soul. If we read the Bible with our eyes and our mind only, we are using just two parts of our being: our body and our mind. As a result, we will gain only knowledge. We must use our third part, that is, our spirit, when we read the Word. Then the living water of life in the Word will be transfused into us, and we will receive the life supply. This is why we must pray-read the Word. Praying enables us to exercise our spirit. Reading with our eyes and understanding with our mind will not give us life. We must pray the Lord&rsquo;s words and enter the depths in order for the living water to flow into our spirit, quench our thirst, and refresh, nourish, and strengthen us.</p>
<p>We must learn to exercise our spirit and pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word so that the life supply in the Word will become washing water. In the physical realm the metabolism that is triggered by eating food is a kind of washing. The same applies to our spiritual life. If we eat the Lord&rsquo;s Word, we will receive the life supply. This supply will trigger a metabolic washing that washes away the negative things within us; the spots and wrinkles will disappear. Then the church will become holy and be without blemish, defect, spot, wrinkle, or any such things in order to be presented as a glorious church to the Lord (Eph. 5:27).</p><h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3 speaks of Christ making His home in our hearts. In order to experience Christ, He must make His home in our hearts. We must give Him the freedom to make His home in our hearts, that is, to settle down in us. Then we will experience and enjoy Him.</p>
<p>There are three crucial items in chapter 4: being mingled with the Triune God, growing with the growth of Christ, and being renewed by accepting Christ as our person. Every saint in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery should arrive at a full-grown man by being mingled with the Triune God, grow up into Christ the Head in all things, and grow unto the building up of the Body (vv. 4-6, 13, 15-16). When we have these experiences, we will be renewed and transformed, and we will put off the old man and put on the new man, which is the church. We also will experience Christ as our person and live by Him, not by ourselves. Formerly, our self was our person, but our person will change. When we accept Christ as our person, we become the one new man.</p>
<p>These four items&mdash;Christ&rsquo;s making His home in our hearts and our being mingled with the Triune God, growing with the growth of Christ, and being renewed by accepting Christ as our person&mdash;are crucial. However, they have been neglected and lost in Christianity. These items are not taught in Christianity, nor can they be found in any Christian publication. Even though these four items are subjective and deep, we need to know and experience them in order to have the proper church life.</p>
<p>Paul knew the secret of experiencing these four items. If we want to experience Christ making His home in our hearts and our being mingled with the Triune God, growing in life, and being renewed by taking Christ as our person, we must receive the Lord&rsquo;s word. If we do not eat His Word daily by pray-reading with our spirit, these items will not be our experience. The Christ who is making His home in our hearts, who gives us the growth in life, and who is our person is in the Word, and the Triune God is in the Word. Therefore, we must receive the Lord&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<p>Dietitians say that the human body needs many nutrients, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and vitamins. These nutrients are in our food. Physical food signifies the Bible, the Word of God. The Bible contains various spiritual nutrients. If we do not eat the Word, we will be malnourished. Many Christians are malnourished. They have the Bible, but it is on a bookshelf or in a drawer. They have food in their hands, but they do not cook it, nor do they eat it. As a result, they are malnourished.</p>
<p>Many young people in the United States are lazy and loose; they like to wake up late in the morning. They have to be at work by eight o&rsquo;clock, but they sleep until a quarter to eight. Hence, they do not have time to prepare breakfast; instead, they rush to work and buy a doughnut on their way. Furthermore, they do not take the time to eat a proper lunch; they buy a hamburger. As a result of such a poor diet, many young people are malnourished and weak and lack energy.</p>
<p>We must take the time to eat the Lord&rsquo;s Word daily. If we eat properly, we will be nourished. This spiritual nourishment contains living water that washes us and removes negative things from our spiritual life, just as the food we eat washes and nourishes us. I am healthy because I eat properly. Proper food strengthens us, cleanses our blood, and unclogs our blood vessels. Food nourishes us, washes us, and protects us from germs. This also applies to spiritual food&mdash;the Word of God. We need to pray-read God&rsquo;s Word with our spirit so that we may be nourished and washed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD<br />
NOURISHING AND CHERISHING MAN</h2>
<p>There are two additional precious words in chapter 5: <em>nourishes</em> and <em>cherishes</em> (v. 29). To nourish is to supply a person with food so that he receives nourishment. When we pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, we receive spiritual food, which not only washes us but also nourishes us. The Lord&rsquo;s Word also supplies and cherishes us. To cherish is to nurse a child just as a mother holds and feeds her child in her bosom. A child in his mother&rsquo;s bosom is nourished and protected and also enjoys rest, warmth, and comfort. This is to cherish.</p>
<p>When we pray-read the Word, we have the sense within that we are in the Lord&rsquo;s bosom; we are filled with a gentle and intimate sense. Here we are enjoying the Lord&rsquo;s protection, comfort, and warmth while being nourished and cherished in His bosom. If we enjoy Christ in such a way, we will not grow old. Rather, we will be renewed daily; we will be rejuvenated, fresh, green, and tender. Then the church will not have spots, wrinkles, or blemishes but will be holy and glorious. This is the church that the Lord desires.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRAYER THAT APPROPRIATES<br />
THE WORD OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 6:11-20</h1>
<h2 class="head1">APPROPRIATING THE WORD OF GOD<br />
BY PRAYER</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6 ends with the crucial point of prayer. This is not general prayer; rather, it is prayer that appropriates the word of God (vv. 17-18). It is amazing that an Epistle concerning the church concludes with the prayer that appropriates the word of God. This shows that in order to have the proper church life, we must appropriate the word of God by means of all prayer and petition.</p>
<p>Chapters 3 through 5 of Ephesians cover the secrets to experiencing Christ for the church life. We must let Christ make His home in our hearts, be mingled with the Triune God, allow Christ to increase in us for our growth in life, and take Christ as our person for our renewing. These are the secrets to experiencing Christ for the church life. In order to apply these secrets, we must appropriate the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>If we have the word of God, we have Christ, the riches of Christ, the increase of God, and the reality of the Triune God. Christ&rsquo;s person and His work are in the word of God. Therefore, if we are to experience Christ, we must enter into the word of God; that is, we must allow the word of God to enter into us so that it can nourish us. The nutrients in the word of God wash and cleanse us from our old elements and bring in a new element so that we can grow, be renewed, experience the Triune God, and let Christ make His home in our hearts. This is the issue of our appropriating the word of God.</p>
<p>Even though it seems that Ephesians could end with chapter 5, we need chapter 6 to tell us how to appropriate the word of God. Paul begins verse 10 with the word <em>finally,</em> implying that the book is not yet complete. The last section of this book presents the final secret for the church life. This secret is the whole armor of God, which is our weapon to fight against Satan. The armor of God includes girding our loins with truth, putting on the breastplate of righteousness, having our feet shod with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace, taking up the shield of faith, and receiving the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God; we receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit by means of all prayer and petition (vv. 13-17). Prayer is the secret to putting on and using the whole armor of God. We should not pray for prosperity or security, but we should appropriate the word of God through prayer.</p>
<p>Some Christians pray every day, but they usually pray for blessings, security, prosperity, and healing. Very few Christians appropriate the word of the Lord through prayer. Verses 17 and 18 say, &ldquo;Receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition.&rdquo; This indicates that in order to appropriate the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, we must pray. The word of God is not mere letters but the Spirit. To appropriate the sword of the Spirit is to appropriate the word, which is the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord has given us the Bible, and His words are spirit (John 6:63). Hence, Paul says that we should appropriate the word of God, which is the Spirit, by means of all prayer and petition. <em>By means of all prayer</em> does not refer to one prayer, a few prayers, or even many prayers, but to all kinds of prayers. There is prayer and also petition. Prayer is general, but petitions are particular. We need general prayers and also particular petitions. This means that we must pray many times and in many ways in order to appropriate the word of God. We receive the word of God by means of all prayer, not by merely reading or understanding. Therefore, we must pray-read the Bible. Every word in the Bible must become our prayer. We must convert the words of the Bible into prayer.</p>
<p>The book &lsquo;<em>Lord, Thou Saidst&rsquo;</em> is a testimony of the saints&rsquo; experiences of pray-reading over the past centuries. One section of this book is on George Whitefield. George Whitefield lived around the same time as John Wesley, who was a powerful gospel preacher; both were English. George Whitefield pray-read every word of the New Testament in Greek, not in English. Prayer is the best way to appropriate the Lord&rsquo;s word. Pray-reading is the way to be filled with Christ, to live Christ, to flow out Christ, and to express Him in a prevailing way. Many saints throughout the ages have pray-read the Bible. We should pray-read in such a way as well.</p>
<p>We do not need to kneel before the Lord and pray in a feeble way. We often pray for our weaknesses, poverty, troubles, and problems with our children, school, and work. When we pray for the church, we often complain about the problems in our coordination and even accuse the saints of rebelling against the Lord, of falling away, and of not loving the Lord. These are pitiful and feeble prayers. Nevertheless, most Christians pray in such a way.</p>
<p>When we pray, we should forget everything and pray according to Ephesians 6. The primary purpose of prayer is to appropriate the word of God. We must practice this until it becomes our habit. The first thing we should do every day is to appropriate the word of God by prayer. As we appropriate the word of God, it will feed, water, refresh, empower, strengthen, saturate, and enlighten us. It will also adjust, reprove, and cleanse us. Then we will be filled with the Lord inwardly.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYER CONCERNING ALL THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>Verse 18 says, &ldquo;By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.&rdquo; The phrase <em>praying at every time in spirit</em> means praying all day long in our spirit, not in our mind. We need to watch unto prayer in all perseverance and petition concerning the saints. We need to pray in order to appropriate the word of God, and we also need to pray unceasingly. We should pray and petition concerning the saints. Many of us pray for other saints, but our prayer is low, not high. We pray concerning their sicknesses, family problems, marriages, and jobs. In Matthew 6 the Lord said, &ldquo;Do not be anxious for your life, what you should eat or what you should drink; nor for your body, what you should put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body than clothing?...Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed? For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things&rdquo; (vv. 25, 31-32). The Father knows all the needs of our daily life. He knows that we need a job, a house, and a spouse, and He takes care of these things according to His will. The Lord does not want us to pray for these things, because the Father knows about these problems better than we do. He knows what we need. Therefore, we do not need to waste our time by praying for these things. However, we often foolishly waste our time and the Lord&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>The Lord also said, &ldquo;Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you&rdquo; (v. 33). This can be compared to receiving a free gift from a department store because we purchased something. The Lord knows that we need a spouse and a job. If we seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, He will make us joyful by giving us His kingdom and His righteousness. In addition, He will give us a spouse and a job as a gift. Therefore, we do not need to pray concerning our marriage or job, because the Lord will give these to us as a free gift. I can testify that the Lord has given me many free gifts, for which I never prayed. I only sought His kingdom and His righteousness, but He gave me many things for which I did not pray.</p>
<p>The kingdom of God today is the church. Romans 14:17 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In the present age the church life is the kingdom of God. To seek the kingdom of God is to pray for the church life. We must pray for the kingdom of God in the church life. We should forget about our needs and simply pray for the church life, because the kingdom of God is the daily church life. We should care only for righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit and forget about eating and drinking, because the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking. We should care only for the kingdom of God and pray for the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>We should pray concerning the saints in the morning, during the day, in the evening, and at night. We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, remember the saints in Tokyo. Lead them in the proper church life and to experience You day by day so that You may make Your home in their hearts. Lord, grant the saints in Japan to realize that the church is the Triune God mingled with man and enlighten them to see that the Holy Spirit is in Your Body. Lord, enable the saints to see that You are joined with them organically. Our Father is over all, through all, and in all. Grant the saints to see that the Triune God is in the church.&rdquo; Such prayer and petition concerning the saints is high.</p>
<p>In the New Testament Paul prayed twice concerning the saints; both prayers are in the book of Ephesians. In chapter 1 he prays, &ldquo;That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him, the eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of His calling, and what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come; and He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all&rdquo; (vv. 17-23). We need to pray on such a high level concerning the saints. We should not pray for healing, blessings, health, security, school, work, marriage, or a happy family, because such prayers are low and feeble. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery our petitions need to be high and uplifted. Our prayers need to be uplifted by our asking concerning heavenly things.</p>
<p>In chapter 3 Paul prays, &ldquo;That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God&rdquo; (vv. 16-19). What a high prayer! We should pray concerning the saints in this way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING FOR THE APOSTLES</h2>
<p>Concerning prayer, Paul also says, &ldquo;And for me, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known in boldness the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in a chain, that in it I would speak boldly, as I ought to speak&rdquo; (6:19-20). We should also petition on behalf of the apostles so that they may be bold to make known the mystery of the gospel. Today most preachers preach the gospel of God in a low and narrow way. They say, &ldquo;You are a sinner, and you will perish forever. But God so loved the world that He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die for you on the cross. After dying, He rose from the dead and ascended to the heavens. If you believe in Him, your sins will be forgiven, and you will receive peace, joy, and blessings.&rdquo; Such a gospel is not wrong, but it is narrow, low, and shallow. Such a gospel does not contain the mystery. Nevertheless, this is the gospel that is preached today.</p>
<p>The gospel that Paul preached is much deeper. He preached Christ and His unsearchable riches, the mystery of God, the economy of God, His eternal intention, His purpose, and the mystery of Christ. These items are deep, hidden, and mysterious. We need utterance in order to preach these hidden and mysterious items. Human language is not adequate to speak about these items in a thorough way. We need an enriched utterance given by God. We need special utterance in order to make known the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ, conveying to people how Christ is the mystery of God, how the church is the mystery of Christ, and the meaning of God&rsquo;s economy, His purpose, and His heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>We need high prayers so that the Lord will have a way to answer our prayers and bring in the proper church life. The church has existed on the earth for nearly two thousand years, but the pitiful condition among Christians cannot satisfy God&rsquo;s heart. Most Christians do not understand the economy of God, the purpose of God, the mystery of God, and the mystery of Christ. These things are foreign to them. The Lord Jesus cannot return, because there is nothing on the earth that is ready for Him.</p>
<p>For this reason, He needs His recovery. He needs the local churches to carry out His eternal purpose. He needs a corporate man who knows the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ and who experiences Christ in a thorough way. This gathering together is for the expression of Christ, His organic Body, and His divine fullness. Christ needs such a recovery and such a corporate man. It is my earnest expectation that we will all be part of this corporate man. This is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and this is the revelation of the vision in God&rsquo;s economy. This is His divine revelation and our vision.</p><h1 class="series">SECTION FOUR:<br />
OTHER MESSAGES<br />
AND FURTHER FELLOWSHIP</h1>
<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SALVATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:26; Zech. 12:1; Job 32:8; Prov. 20:27; John 4:24; 1 Thes. 5:23; Heb. 4:12; John 3:6; 2 Tim. 4:22</h1>
<p>Everything in heaven and on earth is mysterious. The human body is a mystery, and everything related to man&rsquo;s inner being is even more of a mystery. However, the most mysterious thing about man is the human spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN HAVING A SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Some people speak of man&rsquo;s personality as being the deepest part of his being, but according to the Bible, the deepest part of man is the human spirit (Zech. 12:1; Job 32:8). Among all the creatures created by God, only man has a spirit. No other living creature has a spirit. Man is different from other creatures because he has a spirit.</p>
<p>The Bible says that God created man with a human spirit. God&rsquo;s creation of man was different from His creation of animals and plants because God made man in His own image. God&rsquo;s image is a mystery. He is invisible to man. Nevertheless, Genesis 1 says that God made man in His own image (vv. 26-27). Subsequent books of the Bible reveal that God&rsquo;s image is not a matter of a visible or tangible form but a matter of what He is, His nature.</p>
<p>We can enumerate many items of what God is, such as love, light, holiness, and righteousness. European and American laws are based mainly on the Ten Commandments that God gave in Exodus 20. The Ten Commandments reveal that God is love, light, holiness, and righteousness. The laws that a person makes are an expression of his person. The Ten Commandments were enacted by God, so they show that God is love, light, holiness, and righteousness. This is God&rsquo;s image. God&rsquo;s image is what He is. God created man according to what He is. God is love, light, holiness, and righteousness, so He created man with these virtues. To God these virtues are His reality, His attributes, whereas to us they are His image.</p>
<p>A glove is made according to the shape of a hand so that the glove can contain the hand. A glove has the form and image of a hand, but it is not the reality of the hand. For example, kindness and truthfulness are human virtues, but these virtues are limited in man because they are merely the image of God in man, not the reality of God. God&rsquo;s intention is to enter into man to be the reality of these virtues. Followers of Confucius talk about developing and magnifying the bright virtue, but the Bible says that God is the Creator, the source, of every virtue and that He is the reality of every virtue. Hence, man must receive God as his content, reality, and life so that God can express His attributes in and through man&rsquo;s virtues. Our human virtues can be compared to a glove; God&rsquo;s attributes can be compared to a hand. Our human virtues should contain and express God&rsquo;s attributes.</p>
<p>In every stage of human life, people testify that they feel empty and vain; they have a sense of emptiness. No matter how much they attain or what they accomplish, they still feel empty and vain and desire to be filled. They are like an empty glove that is not serving its purpose, because it does not contain a hand.</p>
<p>A few cases can prove that man has a spirit. For example, the body lusts after many things, and a person&rsquo;s lustful inclinations result in numerous falls. When a person acts according to his lustful inclinations, his will disapproves and tries to restrict him. Chinese metaphysicists call this &ldquo;the battle between reason and lust.&rdquo; Paul expounds on this in Romans 7, and his exposition is much clearer than the teachings of these metaphysicists. Paul says that he willed to do good, but when he tried to do good, he realized that there was a law of sin in his members (v. 23). The will to do good is what the Chinese metaphysicists refer to as &ldquo;reason.&rdquo; Their use of the word <em>reason</em> refers to the natural law in us that wills to do good. God created man with a natural law related to the will to do good. From the time a person is born, he has a desire to do good. This is an inward law. The lust within man, however, wars with this law. Those with a strong will might overcome their lusts for a time, but those with a weak will quickly fail. When man fails, something deep within him, which the Bible calls the human spirit, often condemns and convicts him.</p>
<p>When the ancient Chinese referred to the human spirit as the bright virtue and as the innate knowledge of good and the innate ability to do good, they were referring to the conscience. Man may follow his lusts, and his will may be weak and fail, but something in his deepest part will condemn and convict him. Even a man who follows his evil lusts has something deep within him that can never be conquered. Man&rsquo;s deepest part is the spirit (1 Thes. 5:23; Heb. 4:12).</p>
<p>The human spirit is related to the expression of God&rsquo;s image. John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo; When God created man, He formed a spirit within man (Zech. 12:1). All God&rsquo;s attributes are in a believer&rsquo;s regenerated human spirit because God is the content of his regenerated human spirit. The more a person follows his lusts, the more vulgar he becomes; he may even become like an animal. Conversely, the more a person follows his conscience, the nobler he becomes. A person who follows his conscience, his knowledge of good, belongs to the highest class of humanity. This proves that there is a spirit within man. In addition to emotions, lusts, and a will, there is also a spirit within man.</p>
<p>Furthermore, man has material and psychological needs. A person who has food and clothing in abundance may still sense a need for psychological comfort and satisfaction. If a person&rsquo;s psychological needs are met, he may discover yet another need, another sense of dissatisfaction, in his deepest part. This need goes beyond the material and the psychological, and it cannot be satisfied by food, clothing, psychological comfort, or entertainment. This need comes from man&rsquo;s deepest part, the spirit. Nothing but God can satisfy this part. Food, such as beef, chicken, and bread, cannot quench a man&rsquo;s thirst; only water can quench his thirst. When a person drinks water, he is refreshed inwardly, and his thirst is quenched. The need in man&rsquo;s deepest part cannot be met by material things, nor can it be satisfied by psychological comfort or entertainment. Only God can meet this need. I believe that every human being has a sense of his need for God in his deepest part. For over six thousand years of human history men all over the world have worshipped God, but no dog or monkey has ever built a temple for worship. Human history shows that regardless of race, age, or social status, man wants to worship God.</p>
<p>In 1953 I was in the Philippines, and I read an article in the newspaper about a leader in the Soviet Union, Beria, who failed in a power struggle and was sentenced to death. Before his execution he was asked what he wanted. Surprisingly, Beria asked for a Bible and picked it up to pray. Before his execution this top leader, who had killed countless people in an atheistic country, knew that he needed God. There is a Chinese saying, &ldquo;A dying man&rsquo;s words are good words&rdquo;; this refers to the conscience at work. Within man there is a need, but he does not sense this need when he is busy. However, when man is successful, receives recognition, or is about to die, this need surfaces, and man realizes his need.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE ORGAN TO CONTACT GOD<br />
AND TO SEARCH MAN&rsquo;S INWARD PARTS</h2>
<p>In order to contact something, we must use the right organ. It is ridiculous to try to see with our eyes closed. It is also ridiculous to cover our ears in an attempt to hear. If we do not see something or hear something, it is because we are not using the correct organ, not because there is nothing to see or to hear. For example, if our sense of smell is not keen, we will not be able to tell whether the air is fresh or foul. This is not because there is no smell in the air but because we have lost our ability to smell. Thus, there may be a foul substance in the air, but we will not be able to detect it.</p>
<p>Many people say that there is no God, because they do not use the right organ, not because there is no God. God is Spirit; hence, man must worship God in spirit (John 4:24). If we do not use our spirit, God will not be real to us. It is not that God is not real&mdash;God exists&mdash;but that we are unable to sense Him if we do not use our spirit. As long as we use our spirit, we will sense God&rsquo;s presence. The gospel speaks of God being Spirit and of man having a spirit, in the hope that man will repent. To repent is to no longer live in the flesh, to no longer care only for physical needs, and to no longer live merely according to reason. To repent is to turn to our deepest part, our human spirit, that is, to take care of our spirit. This is the repentance that we need and that we should preach.</p>
<p>When a person turns to his spirit, he understands the purpose of human life and realizes that human efforts are of little value. If we are not in our spirit, we do not know the purpose and meaning of human life, nor do we know the need of our human life. We know the meaning of human life when we exercise our spirit. If we want to know good and evil and right and wrong, we must not remain in reason; rather, we must exercise our spirit.</p>
<p>Proverbs 20:27 says, &ldquo;The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, / Searching all the innermost parts of the inner being.&rdquo; This means that the spirit of man was created by God to be a lamp that can search man&rsquo;s inner being. God&rsquo;s lamp is within man, and it can search man daily. The operation of the conscience is like the shining of a lamp. When this lamp shines, we see our faults and know that we are wrong toward our parents, spouse, neighbors, relatives, and children. Such a discovery is the issue of the shining of the conscience in our human spirit, because the spirit of man is a lamp. The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, and this lamp searches the innermost parts of man&rsquo;s inner being.</p>
<p>This proves that there is a God in the universe and that God is Spirit. The spirit within man is the organ to contact God and to search man on God&rsquo;s behalf. This is a clear teaching in the Bible that everyone can know and experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT ENTERING INTO MAN&rsquo;S SPIRIT<br />
TO BE MAN&rsquo;S EVERYTHING</h2>
<p>God is Spirit, and He made a human spirit in us so that He could enter into our spirit. Our spirit is His vessel, and He is our content. His entering into us can be compared to pouring water into a cup. Without water a cup is empty; with water a cup is full. God wants to enter into us to be our content. When we are filled with God in our spirit, we will be satisfied. This is the reason that new believers are zealous for the Lord, love Him, and are willing to forfeit their earthly treasures.</p>
<p>Those who believe in Jesus have received something. We have not merely believed in a religion, nor have we merely accepted some doctrines. We have received the true and living Spirit. The Spirit has entered into us with unspeakable blessings. When we suffer, He is our comfort. When we are lonely, He is with us. When we are weak, He is our strength. He does not merely resolve our outward problems; He is our inner joy. Those who have God are at peace, are joyful, and are satisfied, no matter what their outward circumstances are. We do not believe in a religion; we believe in the living Jesus.</p>
<p>The Bible is very clear: if we are willing to repent and believe in the true God, Jesus Christ, He, as the true and living Spirit, will enter into our spirit, and our spirit will be born anew (John 3:3, 6-7). We were born of our parents to be human beings, but since we have repented and believed in Jesus, He is in our spirit. When Jesus came into us, we received another life. This is regeneration. We have been born again in our spirit; our spirit is filled with God.</p>
<p>When the Chinese sages spoke of developing the bright virtue, they were referring to developing merely the conscience. But we who have believed in Jesus have received God, who is the source and reality of every virtue. He has enlivened our spirit, enlightened our inner being, and filled us.</p>
<p>This is the significance of our salvation. Salvation is the living Spirit entering into our human spirit. Second Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; The Lord God is Jesus, who is now the life-giving Spirit. He wants to be joined with our human spirit. He enters into those who believe in Him. His presence gives a bountiful and all-inclusive supply. If we need love, His presence is our love. If we need obedience and faithfulness, His presence is our obedience and faithfulness. If we need comfort, His presence is our comfort. Whatever we need, He is, because He is the source and reality of every virtue. When we have Him, we have the reality of human life, we know the meaning of human life, and we know our destiny in the future. This is not superstition, nor is it a matter of psychology.</p>
<p>This is the reality of the gospel of Christ: God created man as a vessel with a spirit to contain Him. When we received Him, He entered into us to regenerate us, and we experienced a fundamental and intrinsic change in our life and living. This is the experience of regeneration and salvation. The Lord Jesus is now in us as our life and our reality.</p>
<p>It is our hope that more people would humbly repent, believe in, and receive the Lord Jesus so that they may be blessed together with us. If everyone would receive the Lord Jesus, individuals and families would be blessed, and societies and nations would also be blessed. God Himself is the blessing. He is almighty and able to hear our prayers, but He is also the Lord of life in order to enter into us as the Spirit to be the reality of our life in our spirit. May the Lord bless us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BASIC CONDITIONS FOR SERVING THE LORD</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider a few basic points that are crucial in serving the Lord and in working for the Lord. We will also consider the basic conditions for serving the Lord. Many who serve the Lord do not realize that they neglect and even ignore these basic points.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING A TREE BY ITS FRUIT</h2>
<p>A person who does not pay attention to these basic points will be known by his fruit. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;By the fruit the tree is known&rdquo; (Matt. 12:33). We can know by its fruit whether a tree is a peach tree or an apricot tree and whether it is good or corrupt. A tree with apricots cannot be called a peach tree, and if its fruit is sour, tart, small, and dry, we cannot say that the tree is good. But if its fruit is sweet and juicy, everyone will know that this apricot tree is good. Similarly, the measure of a person&rsquo;s work depends on his fruit, not on his feelings or on the appraisal of others.</p>
<p>Some of you have been serving for more than ten years. I exhort you to spend time before the Lord, asking Him to show you the kind of fruit that your service has produced. There is no need for you to say that your fruit is good or even that it is corrupt; instead, let the Lord reveal this to you. The Old Testament speaks of an offering that is &ldquo;according to the shekel of the sanctuary&rdquo; (Exo. 30:13). This is a form of measurement. The weight of an offering that a person brought before God was not based on the standard of others but on the shekel of the sanctuary. A person who thinks highly of himself may think that his offering weighs one talent. According to the standard of the sanctuary, however, his offering may weigh only one gerah, which is one-twentieth of a shekel (v. 13), and there are three thousand shekels per talent. In contrast, a person who has been dealt with by the Lord may feel that his offering is not even half a gerah, but after being weighed in the sanctuary, his offering may weigh more than half a talent. Hence, our work is not measured by our own valuation or by the valuation of others. We need to go before the Lord and, without any consideration or bias, ask Him to show us the fruit of our work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR BASIC POINTS FOR DETERMINING<br />
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ONE&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>According to my experience, there are four basic points that determine the effectiveness of our work before the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Producing Churches</h2>
<p>First, we need to know whether our work produces churches. Those who have been in the Lord&rsquo;s work for some time should ask whether they have raised up local churches or whether their service has built up any local churches. The churches are raised up and built up in a definite way, just as there is a definite way to build a house. If a contractor says that he has not built any houses but that he has hammered a few nails and supplied building materials for others to build houses, there must be a problem with this contractor, and his company will surely go out of business. A qualified contractor, who has been working for more than ten years, will surely be able to point out certain buildings or houses that he has built. If he can point out the houses that he has built, no one will deny his work. His work will prove that he is a qualified contractor.</p>
<p>We have been working for the Lord for many years, but we are not clear concerning the situation of our work, nor are we clear concerning the situation of others&rsquo; work. We must see ourselves clearly before we can help others in the work. When we understand how to evaluate our work, we will not be deceived by others. Whether people speak of our work in a noble, a flattering, or even an ambiguous manner, we will be clear in our heart. Regardless of what a person says about himself, we should only ask, &ldquo;Where is your fruit? Has any church been built up by your service, or do you take advantage of others&rsquo; efforts and take credit for their work?&rdquo; The first basic point that we need to pay attention to in our service to the Lord is to know whether we have established or built up a local church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ministering Christ</h2>
<p>Second, we need to know whether our work ministers Christ. Have we ever helped the saints in practical matters? Have we ministered Christ to the saints? We need to let the Lord, as a spiritual Surgeon, cut open our being and our work in order to see whether we have ministered Christ to the saints in practical matters. If we indeed minister Christ to the saints in practical matters, then those who come in contact with us will be delivered from the world and filled with the Holy Spirit. Those who contact us will know the flesh, know the cross, and know how to live in the spirit. Whether we are sent somewhere by the arrangement of the co-workers or we go out of our own burden, we should pay attention to ministering Christ and rendering help in practical matters. This is a basic point.</p><h2 class="head2">Having a Definite Impact on the Saints</h2>
<p>Third, we need to know whether our work has a definite impact on the saints. We must minister to the saints and build them up in a definite way; we must not be careless. If we render help to people, there will be a definite impact. Rendering help that is not definite or solid can be compared to chicken scratches in the dirt. It seems that there may be some chickens nearby, but this is not definite. Our help to people must be solid and definite.</p>
<p>An incompetent carpenter cannot tell whether a piece of wood is good or bad material. He may put aside a good piece of wood, thereby wasting its function. Even if the best material is in his hand, he will be unable to produce something of quality and instead will produce something that is of inferior quality. An incompetent carpenter will either waste a piece of wood and render it useless or produce something of poor quality. When we serve the Lord and care for the saints, we should not be incompetent carpenters who waste the function of others; rather, we should provide solid help to others in order to develop their usefulness before the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Prevailing Results</h2>
<p>Fourth, we need to consider whether our work has prevailing results. Whether we establish churches, minister to the saints, or perfect co-workers, our work must be prevailing. In other words, our work should produce prevailing churches, prevailing saints, and prevailing co-workers. What does this mean? A prevailing church is definite concerning the ground, rich in life, full of the impact of life, and shines brightly. A prevailing saint is not careless and is not deceived, because he has spiritual discernment. A prevailing co-worker is able to serve and produce many useful persons. A prevailing work can be compared to definite and unmistakable colors in a painting: the blues are blue, the greens are green, the reds are red, and the yellows are yellow. If we want to do a work, we must do a prevailing work.</p>
<p>When we work for the Lord, we must pay attention to the results of these four basic points. Does our work establish churches, does our work minister Christ, does our work help people in a definite way, and does our work have prevailing results?</p>
<p>If we would allow the Lord to measure and examine us according to these four points, we may find out that most of us are not up to the standard. If our answers to these basic points are not positive, then our past work has been a failure. We must not continue in such a way. This does not mean that we should withdraw from the work. Rather, it means that we should no longer work as we have in the past, because our previous way was not effective; it delayed both the saints and ourselves.</p>
<p>Some who have labored and toiled for many years are frustrated and discouraged. Instead of being frustrated and discouraged, we should look at the result. We should be comforted and thank and praise the Lord if our work bears some trace of these basic points. However, there are some who have served for years and who are self-deceived and do not have prevailing results. They feel that they have done a good job and should continue to work in the same way, even though they do not have definite results. These ones have deceived themselves and delayed others. We must go before the Lord and allow Him to measure us and our work. We should never rely on our seniority or boast in our seniority, thinking that we know more than others because we have served longer. The more we rely on or boast in our seniority, the less worth we will have. Those who rely on their seniority or boast in their seniority will be disqualified. Seniority has no value in the Lord&rsquo;s work. What matters is our effectiveness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIC CONDITIONS FOR SERVING THE LORD</h2>
<p>Regardless of our age, if we desire to serve the Lord in a proper way and to be effective in our work for the Lord, we must know and meet the following seven basic conditions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Vision</h2>
<p>First, we must have a vision. We need to pray for the Lord to give us a vision. The work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not centered on preaching the gospel, teaching the Bible, or pursuing spirituality. Rather, our work is centered on Christ and the church. Throughout history many Christians have been zealous in preaching the gospel; they made the gospel the center of their work. Some Christians were so burdened to teach the truths of the Bible that they established Bible-study groups, Bible-study classes, Bible schools, and even seminaries. However, the center of their work was merely to teach the Bible. They cared for nothing else and were content only when they were able to teach the Bible. Still other Christians claimed to be spiritual and helped people to be spiritual. These Christians made inner-life experiences their center. These pursuits, however, are not the center of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The center of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is Christ and the church, that is, ministering Christ and building up the church. Every saint must see this vision.</p>
<p>If our work does not produce churches, minister Christ, have a definite impact, or have prevailing results, it is because we are short of a basic vision or because we violate or neglect this basic vision. If we have a basic vision, we will obey this vision in our work, and we will have proper results. Arguments are useless. We need to see whether we have results. If we value the basic vision, there will be a result. The result in our service proves that our service is according to vision.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Purged</h2>
<p>Second, we need to be purged so that we are clean and pure. Our natural old man is not pure; hence, we need to ask the Lord to purge us daily until we are clean and pure, just like gold and silver that are purified of dross. When our heart, motives, and aims are pure, we will ask for nothing other than the Lord. Our greatest fear in serving the Lord should be to serve without a vision. If we have a vision, our greatest fear should be that our heart is not pure. If we have a vision but are not pure in heart, we are finished as far as the work is concerned. An impure motive is a worm that will poison everything within us. Therefore, we must ask the Lord to purge us daily. When I began to serve the Lord, every morning I prayed specifically about this. I prayed, &ldquo;Lord, purge me. Examine me.&rdquo; Evil deeds are not necessarily of much significance, but an evil intention in our heart is terrible. I prayed for the Lord to purge and examine me for two to three years. Looking back, I realize that the Lord heard my prayer. We need to be purged. This is the second basic condition for serving the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Broken</h2>
<p>Third, we need to take the cross and be broken. It is easy to break a glass cup, but it is hard for us to be broken. A glass cup breaks when it is dropped just once, but one experience of being broken is not enough to fully break us. After an experience of breaking we often return to our previous condition. I can testify that it is possible to experience the Lord&rsquo;s breaking at least ten times in one day. We should not think that an experience of being broken in the morning will carry us through the day. This is not possible. A person who experiences being broken by the Lord in the morning is likely to revert to his previous condition before evening. When he rises the next morning, he is &ldquo;whole&rdquo; again; it is as if he had never been broken. We constantly need to receive the breaking of the cross within us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Enjoying Christ</h2>
<p>Fourth, we need to enjoy Christ. We must get into the Bible and genuinely enjoy Christ in a spirit of prayer. This does not refer only to reading the Bible or praying at set times; we need to become persons living in the words of the Bible. Others might not see us reading the Bible, but we should live in the words of the Bible. Others might not know that we pray all the time, but we should live in a spirit of prayer. We must be in the words of the Lord and in the Spirit of the Lord. We should practice reading the Bible and praying, until our whole being enters into the Lord&rsquo;s words and into prayer.</p>
<p>It would be good if we could consistently read the Bible and pray every day, but our environment and time may not allow us. Therefore, we must be persons in the Word and in a spirit of prayer. There are many good Christians who preach the gospel, but regrettably, they do many spiritual things without reality. They do not read the Bible in a genuine way, nor do they pray in a solid way. We do not want to read the Bible according to the letter, nor do we want to pray according to the letter. We need to read the Bible until our whole being enters into the Lord&rsquo;s word, and we need to pray until our whole being enters into a spirit of prayer. Being living, rich, and fresh depends on our entering into and remaining in the Lord&rsquo;s word and entering into a spirit of prayer and staying before the throne. This is the way to enjoy the Lord. In order for our work to produce results, we must pay attention to our enjoyment of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Insight without Opinions</h2>
<p>Fifth, we need insight without opinions. A person who serves the Lord must have insight but not opinions. Insight is related to vision. If we do not have a vision, we will not have insight. Insight enables us to minister Christ and build up the church. As long as we minister Christ and build up the church, we should have no opinions. Having no opinions means that we have no problem with the way things are carried out as long Christ is ministered and the church is built up. We should have no opinion about building a large meeting hall, a small meeting hall, a beautiful meeting hall, or a shack. Our only concern should be to minister Christ and build up the church. We should have no opinion concerning when to meet separately in districts and when to meet corporately. We should have no opinion concerning one person speaking or everyone sharing. We should have no opinions, because we have only one vision and one goal, which is to minister Christ and build up the church. As long as we can minister Christ and build up the church, we should not have any opinions concerning how things are carried out. In order to serve the Lord, we must minister Christ. Whether we are in a shack or a beautiful meeting hall, we should care only to minister Christ and build up the church. Then we will not insist or argue in our coordination and service, and there will be no display of our temper. May we all remember that we need insight without opinions.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Exercising Control</h2>
<p>Sixth, we should not exercise control; that is, we should not hold things in our hands. Holding things in our hands is to control and rule. Everyone likes to control and hold things in his hands. The co-workers must learn to do a prevailing and effective work without holding the work in their hands. They must not hold the work in their hands. If someone wants to be a king, let him be a king, but we should not be kings; rather, we would only work. This is not easy. Even young people like to hold things in their hands. I have been doing the Lord&rsquo;s work for many years. Whether in China, Taiwan, the United States, or other places, very few people do not hold things in their hands. Nothing kills a person&rsquo;s work more than this kind of control. However, the more a person likes to hold things in his hands, the less authority he has and the less he gains, because holding things in one&rsquo;s hands violates the spiritual principle of being small. If we want to be great, we must first be small. We are great when we become small. A person who assumes to be great is never great. This is similar to the spiritual principle that we must give in order to gain. We cannot gain without giving. When we give, we gain.</p>
<p>Having the foolish desire to rule and to hold things in one&rsquo;s hands comes from our fallen human nature. In the work we ask only whether we have done our best. We do not want to rule or hold on to things. As soon as we desire to rule or to hold on to something, we have failed. The principles in the Bible are that we should give instead of receive, that we should be small instead of great, and that we should be humble rather than exalt ourselves (Acts 20:35; Luke 22:24-27; Matt. 11:29; James 4:6). Controlling and holding things in our hands involve seeking gain, being great, and exalting ourselves rather than giving, being small, and being humble. These violate the principle of the Lord&rsquo;s blessing in the Bible. Those who have left us because they wanted to be great and gain the world did not receive any blessing in their work; instead, their work quickly vanished. Therefore, we should not control, hold on to things, or exalt ourselves; instead, we should work in humility. I will never exalt myself in order to gain the respect of others. The more a person exalts himself, the less respect he will receive from others. The more a person humbles himself, the more respect he will receive from others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing Only to Work, to Minister Christ,<br />
and to Build Up the Church</h2>
<p>The last condition is that we know only to work, to minister Christ, and to build up the church, desiring nothing for ourselves.</p>
<p>If we diligently practice these seven points, our work will not be a failure; instead, it will be effective, and we will be preserved. Otherwise, our work will not be effective or last, and we will be damaged on our path of serving the Lord. A few among the first group of young people in Taiwan were very promising and hopeful. However, they were damaged along the way. This is not an outcome that we desired. These young ones did not have a goal or a definite vision; they were like troops fighting without a reasonable cause. As a result, they could not go on, and others did not see the Lord&rsquo;s blessing in them. We do not want to do a vain work; we want to be fruitful. Therefore, we must diligently practice having a vision, being purged, being broken, enjoying Christ, having insight without opinions, not exercising control, and knowing only to work, to minister Christ, and to build up the church. Such a practice will bring in the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. However, if we are loose in regard to any of these points, problems will arise.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: I feel that these seven points are very hard. What should I do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: You feel that these points are hard because you have not practiced them. If you begin practicing them, you will no longer feel that they are hard. Do not focus on just a few points; practice all seven points. Then you will not feel that they are hard. The problems in our service to the Lord are due to a lack in practicing these seven points. If we see the vision of ministering Christ and building up the church, this vision will become our insight. However, we will bring problems into the service if we insist on our opinions instead of exercising and practicing these points. If we repent, confess to the Lord, and drop our insistence and opinions, the problems will disappear. The other serving ones and our environment are not the problem. Problems arise because we do not practice what we have heard. For example, a brother knows that he should not hold on to things in his hands or exercise control, but in the coordination he holds things and controls. His excuse is that he does not want others to mess things up. Those who take charge and hold things in their hands are likely to become like Uzzah, who reached out to hold up the Ark (2 Sam. 6:6-7). They will experience spiritual death. Often, others do not make a mess of things, but as soon as we take charge, things turn into a mess.</p>
<p><em>Question: I once rebuked a brother who handled a matter in a poor way, but he did not listen. What should I do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Whether or not you should do anything depends on whether you are responsible for this matter. If someone else is responsible, you should let it go. Whether or not a brother listens, you should not insist. Instead, you need to consider whether you have overstepped. For example, because you think that it is better for the cover of our books to have rounded corners, you ask the serving ones why they do not print books with rounded corners. If you were in charge of printing our books, every book would have rounded corners. However, they are in charge of printing, so our books do not have rounded corners. We should not insist on our opinions. Whether or not our books have rounded corners, our purpose is to minister Christ. In general, we must not argue with others, and we must pray for the service and the serving ones. We should only minister life, minister Christ, and build up the church. If someone else is sitting behind the wheel, let him decide how to drive. Even if he constantly gets lost, you are not driving the car. When you drive the car, you can drive as you wish. If your passengers have opinions, you do not need to argue with them; just continue to drive according to your knowledge of the matter, not according to their opinions. When you arrive at the destination, they will shut their mouth. Ministering Christ and building up the church are our primary goal.</p>
<p>We should never argue. Even if we are right and others are wrong, we still must not argue. As long as we achieve the goal of ministering Christ and building up the church, others will have nothing to say. Hence, we must not be confused over what our goal is. The goal in our service is not to find out who is right or to win arguments. Consequently, we must learn the lesson of not arguing with others regarding right and wrong. We must not have opinions, but we need insight. We should stay focused on the goal of ministering Christ and building up the church. Then there will be no problems. When we are clear that our service is to minister Christ, we will not debate with others. Regardless of what others say, we can continue to preach the gospel, visit the saints, minister Christ, and bring the believers into the church in a solid way. We should not oppose the church, criticize the elders, or accuse the saints, nor should we stop our service. We should simply do our best.</p>
<p><em>Question: What does it mean to hold things in one&rsquo;s hands? Can you give an example?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Let us consider the printing service as an example. Suppose there is an arrangement for you to serve with others on printing. If you do not hold things in your hands, you will do your best to labor but not discourage others from participating. Often, however, when we do something, we put it in our pocket. This is a problem. When others want to participate, we push them away. This is what it means to hold things in our hands. The brothers may arrange for a few brothers to coordinate with you. Instead of coordinating, you blame the brothers for not knowing the situation and for sending too many people who do not know how to serve. You also claim that the brothers who have been asked to coordinate with you will only cause damage. These are excuses. The fact that you do not allow others to participate proves that you are holding things in your hands. Furthermore, when the brothers fellowship with you and express the desire for others to be involved, you say that you do not need any help. This is holding things in your hands. This is our condition as fallen men. When we take care of something, we want to keep it in our hands and under our control.</p>
<p>Many people can testify that I travel extensively and labor diligently throughout the year, but nothing is in my hands. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy I realized in the beginning of my service that we should do our best in the work but refrain from controlling. The brothers who coordinated and served in the church in Chefoo know that I was strict in leading the church in Chefoo and that there was a prevailing work there. Every item related to the deacons&rsquo; office was neat and orderly. However, no matter how strict I was, no matters related to the church in Chefoo were held in my hands. When I later fell ill, I told the responsible brothers that I could no longer take care of the affairs of the church, but this did not create a problem for the church in Chefoo, because the brothers were responsible for everything; nothing was in my hands. I have served in many churches. The church in Taipei is another example. I have a deep relationship with the church in Taipei, but no matters related to the church in Taipei are in my hands. Even the Taiwan Gospel Book Room, which I set up, is not in my hands. This shows that I do not hold things in my hands and that I do not want to assert authority. As long as we do our best to minister Christ and build up the church, others will listen. The co-workers in some places do not fellowship with others and are secretive about what they are doing. They do not want to share the secrets of their work, because everything is in their hands. This is what it means to hold things in one&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>When we serve, we should both work and look for others to participate. If in Chefoo there had been some brothers or sisters who could have organized the deacons&rsquo; office, I would not have been involved. However, I had no choice, because initially no one could do it. Therefore, no one could say anything. If we know how to do something, we should do it in a way that shows others how to do it. If we do not know how to do something, we should learn from others. This is the way to be successful in whatever we do.</p>
<p>Someone who does not know how to conduct himself does not know how to do things and, therefore, does not know how to work. We must learn first how to conduct ourselves, then how to do things, and then how to work. This principle applies to everything. Those who are successful must be humble and willing to be taught; they must be willing to learn from others. Others often have superior methods, so we must learn from them. In the world people are afraid of competition, but in the Lord&rsquo;s work we should not be afraid of competition. If we fear that others will compete with us, our heart is not proper. The churches around the world can testify that nothing is in my hands. Hence, they welcome me, and I am very busy. If I held anything in my hands, no one would welcome me.</p>
<p><em>Question: When people are working together, how do they decide on a way through fellowship?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We often think that fellowship involves voting to follow the opinion of the majority. This is a wrong understanding of fellowship. Our work must be open. If others have better insight regarding the work, we should take their way. If our insight is better, there is no need to argue. When the work is accomplished, no one will say anything. Fellowship does not necessarily mean that we drop our way because no one agrees with our proposal. The Bible reveals that Paul insisted on certain things. For example, he did not want to take Mark, but Barnabas wanted to take him. Paul insisted on this matter (Acts 15:36-39), but his insistence was not a matter of opinion but rather of insight. Therefore, fellowship is not a matter of voting and following the opinion of the majority.</p>
<p>In the work there have been several important matters in which the brothers could not keep up with me, but I pressed forward. As a result, the church was blessed, and the brothers did not have anything to say. In another instance in 1959, however, I proposed to deal in a certain way with the brothers who caused the turmoil, but some co-workers did not have the same feeling. Therefore, I stopped. I later realized that if I had dealt with the matter forcefully, the result would not have been desirable.</p>
<p>If we have a clear view in our service and are able to determine that our actions will not result in serious problems or will not negatively affect the situation, we may continue. We must know the destination and know that we are taking the right way. We can continue driving if we know the goal and know that our actions will not complicate the issue or negatively affect the situation. If our actions will complicate the issue or negatively affect the situation, we should not insist on our way. Before operating on a patient, a surgeon first needs to know the patient&rsquo;s physical condition. If the surgery would lead to serious complications, the surgeon will cancel it immediately. Fellowship is not a means for finding the opinion of the majority; fellowship is a means for making things known to the members of the Body so that they can function according to their measure. If something needs to be done that the brothers cannot do, we can go ahead. Such an action would not be contrary to their fellowship, and no one should be offended. But if we disregard the feelings of others in our fellowship and do not allow them to participate, we will create conflicts.</p>
<p><em>Question: What should we do if someone insists on his opinion?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Whether we are younger or older, we need to avoid insisting on our opinions. The most harmful attitude is to love to be first, to want to be the head, and to disregard others&rsquo; suggestions. This is the principle of Diotrephes (3 John 9). In such a situation no one has a way, and the church is damaged. Furthermore, such ones are destroyed. Hence, we need to look to the Lord to keep us from becoming a Diotrephes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>We need to help the brothers minister Christ and build up the church according to the vision. It is delightful to see that everyone&rsquo;s spirit is strong and that the meetings are full of mutual support and prayer. I hope that we will grow in the Lord. We are clear that the way to grow is to enter into the Lord&rsquo;s word. The Lord&rsquo;s word is living; His words are spirit and life (Heb. 4:12; John 6:63). We must enter into the Word by pray-reading. We must also exercise our spirit, blend in spirit, mingle in spirit, and live in our spirit. When we touch the Word and the Spirit, we will be living, joyful, and enriched, and we will grow. Furthermore, in the meetings we must speak and function so that the church may be built up.</p>
<p>Many older saints are not far behind the younger saints; they are endeavoring to exercise their spirit and to speak in the meetings. This is good. The current atmosphere of speaking and praying in the meetings in Taiwan has changed. There is no longer a long opening and a tedious closing. The opening and closing have been dropped so that everyone can eat and be satisfied. The more everyone speaks, the more the meeting is living and rich. A long testimony will bring the meeting down. Now we know that the way of life is for all the saints to enter into the Lord&rsquo;s word, to enjoy and experience the Lord in their spirit, and to speak in the meetings. This is the way for everyone to be living and perfected and for the church to be built up.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE COMPLETE GOSPEL<br />
AND THE MANIFESTATION<br />
OF THE GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOUR GOSPELS CONTAINING<br />
A TRANSITIONAL GOSPEL</h2>
<p>We must discern the difference between the gospel preached in the four Gospels and the gospel preached in Acts. When the Lord Jesus sent His disciples to preach the gospel during His earthly ministry prior to His crucifixion, it was mainly to heal the sick, cast out demons, and proclaim that the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near, that is, to tell people that the age was changing from the Old Testament age of law to the New Testament age of grace (Matt. 10:5-8; Mark 6:7-13; Luke 9:1-2, 6). At that time the reality of the gospel, that is, the life contained in the gospel, was not yet available (cf. John 7:39).</p>
<p>We may say that the gospel preached in the four Gospels was preparatory and transitional; it was to bring people out of the age of the law of letters into the age of the grace of life. This transitional period included healing, casting out demons, and the proclamation that the age of law would soon be over because the age of grace would soon begin. Thus, there was a focus on the need for grace and life, not the law of letters. The three and a half years of the Lord&rsquo;s earthly ministry were a transitional period; they were not a period fully according to letter or to life, because the reality of life was coming but had not yet come.</p>
<p>In order for life to become man&rsquo;s reality, the Lord Jesus had to be raised from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit so that He could enter into all who believe in Him (1 Cor. 15:45). Only when the Lord Jesus became the life-giving Spirit and entered into those who believed in Him to be their life could the life in the gospel become a reality. The gospel that was preached after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection did not focus on healing, casting out demons, or proclaiming doctrines; this gospel concerned Christ as the reality of life coming into man. The preaching of this gospel began in Acts and resulted in men receiving Christ&rsquo;s life and becoming members in the Body of Christ (12:12-13).</p>
<p>We need to discern the difference between the gospel preached in the four Gospels and the gospel preached in Acts. The gospel preached in the four Gospels was mainly related to healing the sick and delivering man from the bondage of demons; it did not yet possess the reality of life regenerating man. Regrettably, Christians preach mainly the gospel contained in the four Gospels; they have not yet entered into the gospel of life. This is to take a step backward, to go back in time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ROMANS REVEALING THE COMPLETE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>In addition to the four Gospels, Acts and Romans can also be considered as gospels. The Epistle to the Romans can be called the &ldquo;Gospel to the Romans&rdquo; because the gospel of God is the subject of Romans. The gospel preached in this book is the complete gospel. Therefore, in the first verse of chapter 1 Paul says, &ldquo;Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated unto the gospel of God.&rdquo; The book of Romans is on the gospel of God; it is the complete gospel of God for man.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the four Gospels do not contain the complete gospel, whereas Romans contains the complete gospel. The gospel revealed in Romans can be divided into four sections. These four sections can be compared to four stations along a journey. After passing through these four stations, we reach our destination. There are sixteen chapters in Romans, and each station consists of four chapters.</p>
<p>The first station includes chapters 1 through 4 and ends with justification. The second station includes chapters 5 through 8 and ends with sanctification. This indicates that after people are justified by faith, they need to be sanctified. The third station includes chapters 9 through 12 and ends with the Body of Christ. This indicates that those who have been justified and sanctified need to be transformed in order to become the Body of Christ. The fourth station includes chapters 13 through 16 and ends with the local churches. Chapter 16 uses the words <em>church</em> or <em>churches</em> five times: the church in Cenchrea (v. 1); the church that was in the house of Prisca and Aquila (vv. 3-5), which was the church in Rome; the churches of the Gentiles (v. 4); the churches of Christ (v. 16); and the whole church (v. 23). This clearly indicates that without the local churches, the Body of Christ is not practical and has no way to be expressed. Hence, Romans presents the complete gospel, which includes justification, sanctification, the Body of Christ, and the church expressed locally. This is the complete gospel.</p>
<p>Justification concerns our outward position. Sanctification concerns the operation of life within us. Romans 1 through 3 reveals that we were sinners under God&rsquo;s condemnation but that when we repented and believed in the redemption of Christ, we were justified in Christ (3:24, 26). Then our position changed from one of being condemned to one of being justified. Through justification we can stand before God, we are in a position to receive grace, and we are qualified to enjoy all God&rsquo;s riches. Furthermore, we have been reconciled to God; there are no problems between us and God. This is signified in Luke 15:22 by the robe that was put on the prodigal son when he returned home.</p>
<p>The prodigal son was far away from his father and in a miserable position. When he repented and returned home, his father put a robe on him so that he could stand before him and be fully reconciled to him. However, putting the robe on merely solved the prodigal son&rsquo;s positional problem; he was still hungry. Consequently, the father said to his slaves, &ldquo;Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry&rdquo; (v. 23). Eating the fattened calf was a further step, because the prodigal son received the inward enjoyment of life after the problem of his outward position was resolved. Romans 5 through 8 concerns the matter of enjoying Christ, that is, of eating the fattened calf. The fattened calf signifies Christ as our life. When we enjoy Christ, He becomes our life. This life sanctifies us and causes us to grow in life. It also conforms us to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son so that Christ might be the Firstborn among many brothers (8:29). John 12:24 says that Christ is the grain of wheat that fell into the ground to die and became many grains in resurrection. These grains are the sons of God. Christ is the Firstborn, and we are the many sons. As the many sons, we bear the likeness of the Firstborn because we have the life of the Firstborn and the riches of the Firstborn.</p>
<p>The first station in Romans is justification. Here sinners receive a new position and are qualified to enjoy God&rsquo;s riches. The second station in Romans is sanctification. The sanctifying life makes man the same as Christ according to His life and image. Christ is the grain of wheat that produced us, the many grains. He is the only begotten Son who became the Firstborn to produce us, the many sons. As the many sons, we are blended together into one Body, just as many grains are blended together into one loaf. This brings us to the third station&mdash;the Body of Christ. We who are many are one Body in Christ (1 Cor. 10:17). However, the Body is spiritual and abstract; hence, it needs a practical expression, a manifestation. This expression is the local churches in Romans 16. Therefore, the fourth station in Romans is the local churches. The church expressed in each locality is the manifestation of the Body of Christ. This is the complete gospel revealed in Romans.</p>
<p>Christianity, however, does not know this complete gospel. Fundamental Christianity emphasizes doctrines, and the Pentecostal movement stresses speaking in tongues; furthermore, to some extent both practice healing and the casting out of demons. Neither fundamental Christianity nor the Pentecostal movement preaches the gospel in Romans but rather the gospel in the four Gospels. The gospel that most Christians preach may be considered as a transitional gospel, not the complete gospel. The saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must faithfully preach the gospel in Romans in order to arrive at the destination. We must ask ourselves which gospel we preach. In other words, do we preach the gospel of casting out demons, healing, performing miracles, and expounding doctrines, or do we preach the gospel of life by announcing the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel? In Ephesians 3:8 Paul says, &ldquo;To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.&rdquo; This indicates that Paul did not preach the gospel of casting out demons, healing, performing miracles, or expounding doctrines; he preached the dispensing of the unsearchable riches of Christ.</p>
<p>We need a clear vision of the gospel in Romans. This gospel includes justification, sanctification, the Body of Christ, and the local churches; it begins with sinners and ends with the local churches. Romans 1 states that fallen mankind is under God&rsquo;s condemnation; hence, everyone is a sinner. However, through the processes of justification, sanctification, and transformation, these sinners become the Body of Christ. Finally, chapter 16 does not speak of sinners, for the believers have become a local church manifested in a locality to be God&rsquo;s corporate expression. This is the complete gospel revealed in Romans, and it is the gospel that Paul preached.</p>
<p>If we preach the gospel that was announced in the four Gospels, we will remain in the transitional period. Although the transitional period is better than the age of law, it is not fully in the age of grace, and it cannot reach the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation. However, if we preach the gospel in Romans, we are in the age of grace, and we will advance station by station in the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">JOHN DOING A MENDING WORK</h2>
<p>During Paul&rsquo;s time the churches were brought into the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation. But this wonderful condition was short-lived and was soon damaged (2 Tim. 1:15; 4:10, 16). By the time of Paul&rsquo;s martyrdom in about A.D. 67, the churches had declined and degraded. By a quarter of a century later Paul&rsquo;s vision was nearly lost. It was then that John began to do a mending work.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John, the Epistles of John, and Revelation were written by John around A.D. 90. The divine revelation was completed through the ministry of Paul, but it was spoiled by the degradation of the church. After a quarter of a century God used John to do a mending work. As a result, some aspects of the divine revelation became even stronger than they were previously. In Revelation John reveals that the Spirit is now the seven Spirits, the sevenfold intensified Spirit (1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6). John also reveals that the local churches are golden lampstands (1:12, 20). This revelation is an intensification. We must see that we are not only in Paul&rsquo;s completing vision but also in John&rsquo;s mending vision. John&rsquo;s vision not only corresponds to Paul&rsquo;s vision; it is even stronger than Paul&rsquo;s vision.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING DIVIDED OVER DOCTRINE AND<br />
THE MIXTURE OF POLITICS AND RELIGION</h2>
<p>After John died, beginning in the second century the divine revelation was nearly lost again because there were many doctrinal contentions concerning the person of Christ and the Divine Trinity. Some said that Christ is God, not man. Others said that Christ is man, not God. Still others said that Christ is neither fully God nor fully man. These teachings concerning the person of Christ are heresies that resulted in battles over the truth.</p>
<p>Apparently, the dispute concerning the person of Christ was a guarding of the truth, a protecting of the faith, and a contending for the truth. However, when Christians fell into doctrinal contentions and became divided, they no longer paid attention to the truth of life and the experience of life. They did not know the Body of Christ, nor did they see the revelation and light of the local churches.</p>
<p>In A.D. 306 Constantine became the emperor of Rome. In order to stop religious debates among Christians and to maintain peace and order in the Roman Empire, he gathered the great teachers of the Bible and held a council in Nicaea in A.D. 325. This council issued the Nicene Creed, which is still recited in the Roman Catholic Church and in Protestant denominations. Between A.D. 325 and A.D. 570, for about two hundred and fifty years, many councils were held, and numerous issues related to the truth were resolved.</p>
<p>Although Constantine the Great was considered the leader of Christianity, he also held the pagan title of Pontifex Maximus. He used silver, clothing, and many other material things to encourage thousands of unbelievers to be baptized, and he made Christianity the state religion. In this way he corrupted the church and brought many Gentile customs into the church. This was the outward condition of the church at that time. Some pious men, however, did not approve of these actions, and in order to guard the truth, they met secretly. However, the Lord&rsquo;s church on the earth was divided and corrupted.</p>
<p>Around A.D. 590 the papacy was formally established, and the pope&rsquo;s authority was confirmed and recognized. Hence, the Roman Church is also known as the Roman Catholic Church. The word <em>catholic</em> means &ldquo;universal.&rdquo; The Roman Catholic Church prohibited the laity from reading the Bible; only the clergy were allowed to read the Bible and only according to the pope&rsquo;s interpretations. Thus, the Bible was locked up until the Reformation in the early 1500s; the Bible was locked up for ten centuries. Historians call this period in the Middle Ages the Dark Ages because the truth and light in the Bible were locked up; hence, the whole world fell into spiritual darkness.</p><h2 class="head1">VIEWING THE RECOVERY<br />
ACCORDING TO THE GOSPEL REVEALED IN ROMANS</h2>
<p>The Reformation began in the late fifteenth century. Martin Luther recovered the truth of justification by faith and unlocked the Bible. Hence, the Bible became an open book. After the Reformation some who cherished the truth discovered many truths in the Bible and were willing to practice what they saw. Hence, many groups established independent gatherings. These gatherings were the beginning of today&rsquo;s denominations. For example, some saw that baptism in the Bible was by immersion in water, not by sprinkling. According to this light, they practiced baptism by immersion in water. This resulted in the Baptist Church. Others saw the truth of church governance by a body of elders, so they preached this truth, which resulted in the Presbyterian Church. The Wesleyan Church, or the Methodist Church, resulted from the teachings of John Wesley. The term <em>Methodist</em> comes from the word <em>method</em> and refers to following methods and rules. The believers who formed the Methodist Church had a high regard for discipline, and they lived strictly by the rules of a holy life. However, they lacked genuine knowledge and vision related to Christ and the church.</p>
<p>The Reformation did not revive the church. It was not until the early nineteenth century that the Lord raised up the Brethren in England, who further unlocked the truth in the Bible and recovered the church life. Initially, the Brethren paid much attention to Christ. But later they were distracted and turned their attention to doctrines and different practices, which brought in divisions. As a result, in less than five decades they became dry and dead. Although the Brethren practiced the church life, they were too much on the line of knowledge. It was common for believers to pay no attention to the Holy Spirit. Some believers, however, reacted to this condition, and as a result the Pentecostal movement began. The Pentecostal movement emphasizes speaking in tongues, interpreting tongues, prophesying to foretell, healing, and casting out demons. This movement was a reaction to the dead doctrines of the Brethren. However, even though the believers in the Pentecostal movement are not dead, they do not teach the truth, nor do they have much Christ.</p>
<p>There were people in church history who had a deep knowledge and experience of the inner life. These people are called the inner-life group. The inner-life movement began in the seventeenth century with Catholic mystics, such as Father Fenelon and Madame Guyon. These believers were strong in the matter of the inner life and emphasized denying the self and bearing the cross. However, they lacked the knowledge of Christ being the Spirit to be man&rsquo;s life and to make man His Body, which is expressed in localities.</p>
<p>William Law was raised up in the eighteenth century. He improved upon the writings of the mystics and helped many people. Later, Andrew Murray developed William Law&rsquo;s writings. Andrew Murray is an important figure because he recovered the truth concerning Christ as the inner life and experience of the believers. His masterpiece is the book <em>The Spirit of Christ.</em> He knew Christ as the Spirit, Christ as life, and Christ in resurrection. However, he lacked knowledge of the Body of Christ and did not see the local expression of the Body of Christ. Hence, his revelation did not go past Romans 8.</p>
<p>The last renowned teacher of the inner life, Brother T. Austin-Sparks, knew the resurrection of Christ and the Body of Christ in principle. However, he did not see how the Body of Christ could be expressed practically in a locality. Furthermore, he opposed and condemned the practice of the local church. Therefore, the revelation that he received went only as far as Romans 12.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECOVERING THE LOCAL CHURCH<br />
AS A GOLDEN LAMPSTAND MANIFESTED IN A LOCALITY</h2>
<p>Eventually, the Lord could go no further in the West and was forced to come to China, a pagan and Gentile land. The people of China did not know Christ; thus, it was virgin soil that had not been touched by the confusion of Christianity. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been in China for sixty years. During this time the Lord has gradually revealed to us that the first section of Romans is concerning justification, the second section of Romans is concerning sanctification, the third section of Romans is concerning the Body of Christ, and the fourth section of Romans is concerning the local churches. The spiritual publications that we have published over the past sixty years can also be categorized into the four sections of justification, sanctification, the Body of Christ, and the local churches. However, we must not be proud and think that we have arrived at the final station. In some respects we have not yet arrived at the final station. Even if we have arrived, we must be careful, because if we do not stand firm, we will fall from the overcoming condition of the church in Philadelphia to the degraded condition of the church in Laodicea (Rev. 3:7-22). Therefore, the local churches must examine their spiritual condition in order to know whether they have arrived at the final station and in order to be careful and watchful lest they fall.</p>
<p>The Lord has also led us from the local churches in Romans 16 to the seven local churches in Revelation 1. The seven local churches in Revelation 1 are seven golden lampstands intensified by the seven Spirits (vv. 12, 4). Hence, we must pay close attention to the seven Spirits, which are the sevenfold intensified Spirit. The sevenfold intensified Spirit is Christ, who is making His home in us (Eph. 3:17).</p>
<p>The seven Spirits do not refer to seven different Spirits but to the one Spirit who is intensified sevenfold. A floor lamp with seven lamps can be used as an example. When bright light is not needed, it is sufficient to turn on only one lamp. If brighter light is needed, more lamps can be turned on until all seven lamps are on. At this point the light is intensified sevenfold. There are not seven lampstands but one lampstand with seven lamps, which result in a sevenfold intensified light. The seven Spirits are in us; hence, our spirit is intensified sevenfold.</p>
<p>Our urgent need is to let Christ make His home in us and occupy our whole being. In order for there to be a bright local expression of the church, the shining of the golden lampstand must be intensified sevenfold. If every saint lets Christ make home in him, the churches will shine as golden lampstands in each locality. Then the people in Tokyo, Osaka, and Tokushima will see one golden lampstand as the expression of the universal church, the unique lampstand.</p>
<p>We must not stop with experiencing the mingling of the Triune God with man; we must also let Christ grow and increase in us. Furthermore, we must daily experience renewing, transformation, the putting off of the old man, and the putting on of the new man (Eph. 4:22-24); we must let Christ be our person so that we may be one new man in Him (2:15). Hence, we must receive the Lord&rsquo;s word, because Christ with His riches are in His word. In addition, the ability to grow, to be renewed, and to be transformed are also in the Lord&rsquo;s word. The Lord&rsquo;s word in us can wash away the old creation and bring in the new creation, doing this until we are transformed into the same image as Christ to be His glorious and holy church that is without spot or wrinkle (2 Cor. 3:18; Eph. 5:27). This is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR VISION BEING CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Our vision is Christ and the church. This vision will save us from many mistakes and from focusing on trivial matters, such as healing, casting out demons, baptism by immersion or sprinkling, and church governance by elders. We must ask ourselves: How much has Christ made His home in us? How much have we grown in life? How much have we been renewed? How much do we experience the mingling of the Triune God? Do we enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s Word daily? Does His Word supply us as our food and drink? Are we being renewed and transformed by the Word? We must pay attention to these matters so that the glorious church will come forth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
AND ESTABLISHING A LIVING<br />
OF EATING THE LORD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRIST WHOM WE EXPERIENCE<br />
BEING THE CENTRAL CONTENT OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p><em>Question: We have only a dozen saints in my locality. How should we preach the gospel?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We preach what we are. We are the way to preach the gospel. We should not follow the methods used in Christianity. Even if these methods are good, they are merely methods that present the transitional gospel. We need to experience and enjoy Christ; then we can preach the gospel based on the Christ whom we enjoy. We need to preach according to our living, that is, preach the gospel that we experience. The content of our gospel should not be limited to the shallow gospel commonly preached by Christians.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 3:8 Paul says that God commanded him to announce the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel. Hence, we should preach the Christ whom we enjoy. Sometimes we may need to heal the sick or cast out demons when we preach the gospel; signs and wonders may also accompany our preaching at times, but we should not make these items our center. The center of our gospel is the Christ whom we experience. The purpose of preaching the gospel is not to save people so that they may &ldquo;go to heaven&rdquo;; rather, we preach Christ so that we may preach the church. According to Romans, such a gospel has four stations. It begins with justification, passes through sanctification and the Body of Christ, and ends with the local churches. This is the gospel that we should preach.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT REPLACING CHRIST WITH CULTURE</h2>
<p><em>Question: Some co-workers say that if we want the Japanese people to gain Christ, we must tailor our gospel to match the needs of the Japanese and use their culture, including literature and proverbs, to make the gospel easier for people to receive. According to the revelation in the Bible, however, preaching the gospel is simply to minister the life of Christ in a pure way to people. There is no need to use anything other than Christ. Furthermore, according to Paul&rsquo;s perspective concerning the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus (Phil. 3:8), culture is refuse. Since this is the case, should we use the Japanese culture as a means to preach the gospel?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Culture is helpful if it is used properly. If culture is used improperly, it will replace Christ. People without culture are like animals; therefore, culture has a function. Culture covers a very broad range of items. It includes nearly everything in human life, such as giving birth and raising children, and many items, such as clothing, food, housing, transportation, education, entertainment, society, public security, national governance, and different occupations. To say that we do not need culture means that we do not need these things. It is wrong to say that culture is not needed. However, we must realize that culture should not replace Christ, no matter how good it is. Culture is similar to the law in the Old Testament, because both should bring us to Christ (Gal. 3:24).</p>
<p>The Ten Commandments are very good. The first commandment says that there is only one God and that we should have no other gods beside Him (Exo. 20:2-3). The second commandment says that we should not make or worship idols (vv. 4-6). The third commandment says that we should not take the name of God in vain (v. 7). The fourth commandment requires us to keep the Sabbath (vv. 8-11). Although we may not keep the Sabbath according to the Mosaic law, there is nothing wrong with taking a day of rest after six days of work. The fifth commandment requires us to honor our parents (v. 12). The last five commandments say that we should not kill, commit adultery, steal, lie, or covet (vv. 13-17). If we abandon these commandments, we will worship idols, commit sins, steal, murder, and do all kinds of evil; there would be bandits and robbers in every place. We should not have the concept that the law is refuse and can be thrown away. We must understand that the function of the law is to bring people to Christ, but the law should not replace Christ. If the law replaces Christ, then it is wrong.</p>
<p>In understanding and applying the words of the Bible, we should not interpret them out of context, nor should we be extreme. For example, in Colossians 3:11 Paul says that there can be neither Greek nor Jew in the new man. However, it would be absurd to give up our nationality because of this. Our living must be balanced. On the one hand, Paul stresses that there can be neither Greek nor Jew in the new man, but on the other hand, he wisely utilized his Roman citizenship in order to be delivered from persecution when he was bound by the Romans. He said to the centurion, &ldquo;Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?&rdquo; (Acts 22:25). When the centurion heard that Paul was a Roman, he reported it to his commander. Although the commander acquired his Roman citizenship with a large sum of money, Paul was born a Roman. Therefore, those who were about to examine Paul withdrew from him. The commander also was afraid, realizing that he had bound a Roman (vv. 26-29). Paul wisely used his Roman citizenship to be saved from persecution.</p>
<p>In Acts 25 Paul told Festus that he was appealing to Caesar (vv. 10-11). Those who are extreme might accuse Paul, saying, &ldquo;Did you not say that you have forsaken all things and consider them as refuse? Surely Caesar is included in &lsquo;all things&rsquo; and is therefore refuse. Why do you appeal to Caesar instead of depending on God?&rdquo; Paul appealed to Caesar so that he might fulfill his desire of going to Rome in order to spread the Lord&rsquo;s testimony (19:21). This desire was also according to the Lord&rsquo;s instruction (23:11). If Paul had not appealed to Caesar, he would have been killed (cf. vv. 12-15; 25:1-3).</p>
<p>Countries have traffic rules as part of their culture. A person who ignores traffic rules, thinking that they are refuse, will eventually have an accident. National governance is of God for the purpose of maintaining an environment in which man can live in order to receive the Lord&rsquo;s salvation and be His testimony. All things are for the Lord, but they should not replace the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">CONTACTING PEOPLE<br />
BY WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p><em>Question: What should our attitude be toward Christians in denominations and toward people such as Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses or Mormons? Should we contact them or stay away from them?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We must learn to walk according to the spirit when we contact people. Whether we should contact someone does not depend on outward circumstances but on the sense in our spirit. Sometimes the person we contact is not open and rejects us; hence, we do not have the chance to speak. In Acts 13 Paul and Barnabas were preaching the gospel in Pisidian Antioch, and most of the city was gathered together to hear the word of God (v. 44). When the Jews saw the crowds, however, they were filled with jealousy and contradicted the things being spoken by Paul and blasphemed (v. 45). The Jews incited the women of high standing who worshipped God and incited the chief men of the city to raise up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and to cast them out from their borders (v. 50). Paul and Barnabas, however, shook off the dust of their feet against them and went to Iconium (v. 51). Because the Jews thrust the word away and did not judge themselves worthy of eternal life, Paul and Barnabas turned to the Gentiles (v. 46). Therefore, if people reject us, we do not need to compel them to receive. In Matthew 7:6 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Do not give that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the hogs, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn and tear you.&rdquo; Hence, when we contact people, we need to pay attention to their reaction and to the sense in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NAME OF JESUS BEING CONNECTED<br />
TO THE PERSON OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p><em>Question: According to my experience, calling on the name of the Lord is very practical. The more I call on His name, the more my faith is strengthened. Many saints obtain subjective experiences of the Lord by calling on His name. Can you give us further fellowship concerning calling on the name of the Lord?</em></p>
<p>Answer: When we call on the name of the Lord, we must be clear that we are not calling on an empty name. The name of the Lord Jesus is connected to the living person of the Lord. If I repeatedly call someone&rsquo;s name but get no response or if I call on a name that is fake, then I am calling on an empty name. When a person responds after I call his name, I know that the name is connected to a person. The Lord&rsquo;s name is connected to His person. When we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; He, as the Spirit, immediately comes to us. Jesus is His name, and the Holy Spirit is His person.</p>
<p>Christianity neglects the divine Spirit and the human spirit. People opposed us when we began calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name and paying attention to the Spirit, and they opposed us when we began pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word and paying attention to life. Such opposition was out of Satan, because he does not want us to enter into life or to touch the Spirit. We must see through Satan&rsquo;s stratagem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP THE HABIT<br />
OF EATING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD</h2>
<p><em>Question: I was deeply impressed with the fellowship concerning the washing of the water in the word. We have often heard such a word, and we know the importance of this experience, but it is hard for us to put it into practice. How can we build up the practice of eating the Lord&rsquo;s Word every day?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We must build up the habit of eating the Lord&rsquo;s Word. Some people are careless regarding their eating. Either they do not eat, or they eat in an unrestrained manner. As a result, they build up a bad habit. Other people eat a set amount of food at set times every day. They even eat their food in a certain order. It takes time to build up such a good habit. There is a need to give messages on eating the Lord regularly. Such messages will help the saints build up a good habit of eating the Lord&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<p>When a person builds up a good habit of eating at set times, his appetite will increase. Therefore, this question is related to habit. If new believers do not yet have an appetite for the Lord&rsquo;s Word, we need to spend time to help them pray-read the Word. It will not be sufficient to help them only once. After bringing a person to salvation, we need to spend one to two months leading him to pray-read the Word. As he gains a taste for pray-reading, his appetite will increase. We should not avoid or neglect spending such time with new believers. In principle, if the saints do not know how to pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, the church life in that locality will not be strong. It is better to reduce our work in other areas in order to spend more time to bring the saints, one by one, into the habit of pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word. This is more profitable.</p><h2 class="head1">RESTORING OUR SPIRITUAL APPETITE<br />
BY EATING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD AND<br />
SPEAKING FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p><em>Question: Sometimes I do not have an appetite for the Lord&rsquo;s Word. I am not hungry or thirsty. How can I restore my appetite? Is there a secret?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The secret to restoring our spiritual appetite is to eat something even when we have no desire. The less we eat, the less appetite we have. People know that food is the best medicine; therefore, we should never stop eating. Regardless of whether we have an appetite, we need to eat a little. Eating consistently will restore our appetite. We need to eat spiritual food, but we also need to practice speaking for the Lord in the meetings. Even if we have nothing to say, we still need to say something. Eating the Lord&rsquo;s Word and speaking for the Lord will restore our spiritual appetite.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S SAVING AND SUPPLYING US<br />
BEING A LAW</h2>
<p><em>Question: In past messages you said that the mysterious dispensing of the Lord operates constantly, twenty-four hours a day, and that His dispensing brings in an all-inclusive dose for healing. Does the Lord dispense Himself into us regardless of our condition? Will He still dispense Himself into us if we are occupied with the world?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We can use a tree with branches to illustrate dispensing. The branches of a tree are constantly supplied by the tree; they are supplied twenty-four hours a day. Such a supply is a law. As a further example, we are surrounded by air twenty-four hours a day. We breathe air, and we enjoy the supply of air. This is also a law. If we are to gain the Lord&rsquo;s supply, we must meet the conditions of His law. Most Christians do not know that the Lord&rsquo;s supply is a law. Even our being saved is according to a law. The natural understanding is that the Lord does not intend to save man but that He is moved to save man because man cries out, wails, fasts, abstains from sleep, and prays desperately to be saved. This is not the law of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. The Lord died for man&rsquo;s sin, was raised from the dead, ascended to heaven as the Savior (Acts 5:30-31), and became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). The Lord&rsquo;s way of salvation is a law. Any person who repents and confesses the Lord Jesus as his Savior will be saved. The Lord saves people according to His law.</p>
<p>Romans 8:2 says, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo; This indicates that the law of the Spirit of life frees us and saves us because we have met the conditions of this law, not because the Lord has heard our earnest prayer. As soon as we are in Christ Jesus, we are freed. For example, a person who is surrounded by air does not need to pray to receive air. As long as nothing obstructs his air passages, he will receive a constant supply of air if he obeys the law of breathing. However, he will not receive a constant supply if his breathing organs are defective, because air cannot get into him. Likewise, the Lord has no way to constantly supply a person who loves the world. The problem is not with the Lord but with the person. The Lord&rsquo;s supply and care for us are according to a law. He says, &ldquo;Come, for all things are now ready&rdquo; (Luke 14:17). All things are ready and have become a law. The problem is whether we are willing to eat. If we are willing to come to the Lord and eat, we will meet the conditions of His law. As a result, we will immediately enjoy His supply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING TO MAINTAIN<br />
OUR SPIRITUAL EXISTENCE</h2>
<p><em>Question: Pray-reading the Word can help us to have subjective experiences of the Lord, but I do not have much feeling when I pray-read. If enjoying the Lord is a law, should we believe that we are enjoying the Lord as long as we meet the conditions of the law, whether or not we have any feeling?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This is absolutely correct. We may not have an appetite or desire to eat by pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word, we may not feel any enjoyment while pray-reading, and we may even forget the Lord&rsquo;s Word immediately after pray-reading, but this does not diminish the effect of pray-reading. If someone asks me what I ate this morning, I may recall that I ate vegetables, an egg, oatmeal, and some bananas, but I may not recall what I ate yesterday morning. This does not mean that the breakfast I remember is effective and that the breakfast I do not remember is ineffective. We cannot say that only tasty food is effective, nor can we say that food that is not tasty is ineffective. Actually, food that is very tasty may not be good for our health. Americans like to eat sweets, but they are harmful to our health. Therefore, in order to maintain our spiritual existence, we should not pay attention to taste or feeling, nor should we try to remember what we pray-read. Our need is to eat. I do not remember what I ate twenty years ago, but I am clear that I will die if I do not eat. Hence, we need to build up the habit of eating. Similarly, calling on the name of the Lord should become a habit. We should not call in a casual way; rather, we should call in a serious way. Even if we do not have an appetite, we should still call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; We should call when we feel a sense of sweetness and call when we do not feel a sense of sweetness. The benefits that we gain are the same.</p><h2 class="head1">EATING TO CULTIVATE<br />
OUR SPIRITUAL APPETITE</h2>
<p><em>Question: Can we visit the saints who do not have a spiritual appetite and give them &ldquo;nutrition shots&rdquo; in order to boost their spiritual appetite? What should we do if we visit a home that has contracted a spiritual infectious disease, and we become infected?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This medical illustration is very appropriate, because medicine is closely related to our physical life. This principle can also apply to our spiritual life. If a patient does not have an appetite, he might be given an injection or fed intravenously in order to restore his appetite. This also applies to the spiritual realm. Sometimes saints are weak and do not come to the meetings; hence, we need to visit them in their homes. However, we need to bring a &ldquo;sterilizer&rdquo; with us. For example, some saints still enjoy playing mah-jongg. If we go to a saint&rsquo;s home while he is playing mah-jongg, and we are tempted to play with him, we have been &ldquo;infected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a person is accustomed to a certain kind of food, he will always prefer that food. People from northern China are accustomed to eating steamed buns; to them steamed buns are the most delicious food. They also like to eat dumplings. When I started the work in Taiwan, I established the workers&rsquo; home. Although a small number of the saints staying there were from northern China, the majority were from the south. For nearly half a year dumplings were not included in the meals, and the brothers from the north murmured and complained. After this, the kitchen crew served dumplings frequently, but then the saints from the south began to complain. The dumplings were a delight to the northerners but a suffering to the southerners. This example shows that the northerners liked to eat dumplings because they were accustomed to eating them. In the same way, the more we eat the Lord&rsquo;s Word, the more we will enjoy eating it. Therefore, we must build up the habit of eating His Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING OVER THE WORDS OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p><em>Question: When I am with the saints in the meetings, I am eager to pray, but I realize that I am short of words and utterance. Why is this so?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There are two reasons: there is a lack of prayer, and there is a lack of pray-reading. Therefore, you must learn to pray more. The best way to pray is to pray-read, that is, to pray over the words of the Bible. Then the words of the Bible will become the words in our prayers. It is not easy for us to come up with words to pray when we are by ourselves. It is also not easy to compose a prayer. The best way to pray is to use the words of the Bible, because the words of the Bible are exhaustless. We need much practice in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING PRAYER IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><em>Question: I feel that the messages and prayer should be separated; in other words, we should not use prayer to give a message. Is this view correct?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The Lord Himself should be the object of our prayer. It is not right to admonish people with our prayer. For example, if we feel that a certain brother is lazy and that his clothes are always dirty, we should fellowship with the brother. However, if we are afraid of offending him, we may use the time when everyone gathers for prayer to admonish him, praying, &ldquo;Lord, teach us to be diligent and clean. We do not want to be lazy and dirty.&rdquo; This is a criticizing prayer. There should not be such prayers in the church.</p>
<p>However, there may be a burden to release a particular truth through prayer, and we can find examples of this in the Bible. In Ephesians 3 Paul bowed his knees unto the Father and prayed that He would grant us, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith (vv. 14, 16-17). This type of prayer is acceptable in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPLYING THE GOOD NATIONAL CHARACTER<br />
WITHOUT REPLACING CHRIST</h2>
<p><em>Question: Since national character can become a hindrance to the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery on the earth, what are some points in the Japanese character that might become a hindrance?</em></p>
<p>Answer: National character is part of culture. A certain kind of culture produces a certain kind of national character. We cannot completely abandon culture; rather, we should use culture in a proper way for the sake of the Lord but not replace the Lord with culture. Every nation has its national character. Some national characteristics are good, but others are not. We must learn to apply the good national characteristics and to reject what is not good. The Japanese have a very good national character. They are conscientious, patient, and thorough. This fact is recognized throughout the whole world. Anything that is processed by the Japanese is a fine and delicate work.</p>
<p>When I was in the United States, I received the Life-study message outlines and the Recovery Version of the New Testament that were published by the Japanese Gospel Book Room. I showed them to the American brothers and said, &ldquo;The Japanese do a better job in printing and binding than the Americans. Their work is delicate and careful.&rdquo; The Japanese character is very meticulous. The Japanese character is also diligent and frugal. Such characteristics are helpful when we are conducting ourselves and handling things. We should learn to apply them, but they must not replace Christ.</p>
<p>Even more, the aspects of national character that are not good should not replace Christ. The national character in areas near the Equator tends to be loose. This has much to do with the weather. In South America and Southeast Asia the hot weather makes people dizzy, and they do not want to do anything. The local people need to shower in cold water many times a day. The coolest time in Brazil is the winter. When Brazilians are asked to do something, they often say, &ldquo;Tomorrow.&rdquo; Everything, except for eating, is postponed to the next day. This national character is related to weather.</p>
<p>In contrast, the countries in North Asia have a colder climate. Japan, Korea, and northern China, for example, have a strict national character. This is related to the weather as well. Similarly, the countries in Europe that are at higher latitudes, such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, also have a stricter national character. However, the countries that are at lower latitudes, such as southern France, southern Italy, Spain, and Portugal, have a looser national character. A loose national character is undesirable.</p>
<p>If we preach the gospel to a Brazilian, he may say, &ldquo;Wait until tomorrow,&rdquo; or if we tell him to repent, he may reply, &ldquo;Okay, I will repent tomorrow.&rdquo; This is not a good national character. The countries that are at higher latitudes, such as England, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Sweden, and Japan, have a strict national character. This is an indisputable fact. However, we must be cautious and not let good national character replace Christ. For example, the national character of the Jews has its strengths, but the Jews want their national strengths rather than Christ. This is wrong. We can use good national character and apply it to the things of the Lord. However, if we replace Christ with national character, we are repeating the mistake of the Jews.</p></body></html>
