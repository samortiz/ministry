During these service meetings Witness Lee gave messages to help the saints to be proper persons to preach the gospel
The first section of this book, chapters 1 through 13, is composed of notes from various messages related to the gospel conference
Based on references included in chapters 17 and 24, this series of messages was probably given in 1949 or 1950
Since the messages in the second section are similar in nature to those in the first section, they have been compiled and published together
In other words, the gospel had a mouthpiece not merely after the apostles spoke but as soon as the apostles were gained
The voices of the apostles and the words they spoke were secondary, but the apostles as a group of persons were primary
On the surface, it seems that the gospel preached by the apostles on the day of Pentecost was effective because of their words
In speaking concerning this need, we have no intention to stir up any excitement among the saints for the preaching of the gospel
In order to engage in spiritual warfare, we must have strong dealings before the Lord both inwardly and outwardly
If this were so, we would have no need for the covering of the blood when we rise up to do something for the Lord
By standing on the basis of the Lord's precious blood, we can have such dealings before God and such declarations to the enemy
We do not want to have any ground within that is connected to Satan, nor do we want to have any room in us that is attached to the world
It does not depend on our inward enthusiasm, excitement, and determination, nor does it depend on our outward toiling or activity
Although these matters have their place and value, the real preaching of the gospel depends on the overflow of the life within us
Through such a transfer of ownership, we will be thoroughly purified and will have room to be filled with the Lord
Whether or not we feel that the Holy Spirit has come upon us makes little difference; the value of our consecration remains the same
On the one hand, the Holy Spirit as a burning fire will consume us, and on the other hand, the Holy Spirit as the ointment will fill us
When we have this kind of faith, we will be in a condition of overflowing and will be able to allow the gospel to flow out through us
There is also a great difference between a person who has been dealt with by the Lord and gained by the Holy Spirit and one who has not
If we are not persons who have been gained by the Lord, it will be difficult to lead others to be persons who are gained by the Lord
If we do not fight the spiritual battle, it will be difficult to plunder people out of the authority of Satan in a thorough way
Whenever there is a gospel meeting, all the saints should pay more attention to prayer and should intensify their prayers
We need to bear such persons on our shoulders and pray for them by mentioning their names repeatedly and continually before the Lord
When we pray individually, we need to have a burdened spirit and always have the attitude that we are not coming before the Lord alone
Two or three weeks before a gospel meeting, many brothers and sisters should take the lead and have the burden to pray with fasting
Whenever and wherever we have the opportunity, we should stretch out our hands of faith to touch the throne of God
In addition to strengthening our prayers, we all need to have a turn in our concept concerning the gospel meeting
We need to see that in our gospel meetings, we do not and should not have only one person who evangelizes or conducts some kind of meeting
We all need to see that gospel preaching is an action of the whole church and a move in the Body and of the Body
Among us there is no renowned evangelist or preacher; there are only members one of another in the move of the Body
If many among us have such a realization, sinners will be saved, and we who preach the gospel and serve will be edified and perfected
If the Lord has no way to gain more of our being and we have no real dealings before the Lord, we will have only activities and excitement
The result will be that even if thousands are saved, we will be unable to keep the newly saved ones because our condition will be abnormal
It is not the result of stirring up the saints in their natural man to become fervent for the preaching of the gospel
We all should allow the Holy Spirit to impart this burden into us so that we all can bear this burden together in one Body before the Lord
We need to receive the Lord as our burden, to be loaded with Him as the heavenly cargo, before preaching the gospel
We need to see that the burden we have received is not what most people consider to be the burden of the gospel
The Lord Jesus whom we impart is the gospel that sinners need, and whoever receives Him receives the gospel and receives salvation
It was not that they desired to save sinners and rescue them from the lake of fire because they had seen that sinners would perish
The burden that the disciples received consisted of the Lord Jesus and the various processes He passed through
On the cross the Lord suffered God's judgment on our behalf, accomplished God's redemption, and dealt with Satan, God's enemy
The disciples, having seen so much concerning the Lord, must have been filled with all that they had seen concerning Him
The word occupied most adequately expresses the inward condition of the one hundred twenty disciples prior to the day of Pentecost
They were not people of the land of Judea or the city of Jerusalem but were Galileans from the northern region of Israel
Those who had a Galilean accent, especially an accent from Nazareth of Galilee, would have suffered hostility and difficulty
On the one hand, they were filled with Christ, and on the other hand, they were waiting earnestly for the power from on high
From the experiences and the attitude of the disciples prior to the day of Pentecost, we have seen what kind of persons they were
After the Lord's ascension, the disciples knew that the Lord Jesus had borne their sins on the cross and that their sins were forgiven
They knew that the Lord Jesus was rejected and crucified by the world but was accepted raised from the dead and received into heaven by God
These one hundred twenty were neither entangled by the world outwardly nor condemned by their conscience inwardly
They had never experienced resurrection personally, but because they believed into the resurrected Lord, they were in resurrection
In a real sense, the Lord Jesus brought them along with Him through His death, resurrection, and ascension into the heavens
The disciples' sins were forgiven, they were separated from the world, they were in resurrection, and their hearts were in the heavens
Many Christians can testify according to their experience that they often begin their prayer by coming to the Lord
During the ten days before Pentecost, the disciples 'continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer' in the upper room in Jerusalem
For at least ten days they lived a life that was not only in the heavens but also in God and in His countenance
They should be aware of the fact that they have ascended into the heavens with the Lord and are thus heavenly persons
Outwardly, they are still living on the earth, but inwardly, with respect to their inner life and mood, they are in the heavens
My burden is neither to describe the feeling of being filled with the Holy Spirit nor to help others seek this feeling
When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, we receive an inward burden, and this burden is the Lord Jesus Himself
Our gospel issues from the need to unload Christ, to impart Him into others, because we have been filled with Him inwardly
We preach the gospel because we have experienced Christ in the forgiveness of sins and in being separated from the world
Later he went to the temple healed a lame man and took the opportunity afforded by the healing to speak a strong word to many in the temple
Although about fifty-three days earlier Peter had denied the Lord three times, he condemned the Jews for denying and rejecting Jesus
Someone listening could have said, 'On the night that the Lord Jesus was taken away, did you not also deny and reject Him three times'?
On the day of Pentecost Peter became a different person, for he had received the Holy Spirit inwardly and outwardly
After the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, Peter seemed to say to the Jews, 'You denied Jesus; you committed this sin'
Prior to his salvation, he was like his friends, wallowing in sins, but after his salvation, he became different from them
When he speaks concerning the forgiveness of sins, he is not giving a message on the doctrine of the forgiveness of sins
Not only a few of the leading ones but also all the saints should have dealings concerning these matters in a detailed way
We need to invite people to the gospel meeting, to pray for the ones coming, and to make all the various practical preparations
When they see others preaching the gospel inviting people to the gospel meeting and serving in the meeting they desire to do the same things
It was a small matter whether or not people perished, but it was a great matter whether or not they gained Christ
Because they were full of Christ within, they were burdened to overflow Christ to others through their speaking
For various reasons, some may not be able to gather together with other saints, but they should still go to God on their own
We will know whom we should pray for, whom we should invite to hear the gospel, and whom we should bear as a burden
Preaching the gospel out of natural enthusiasm and excitement cannot stir up the sense of sin and the emptiness of human life within people
It will not help them to sense their need to gain the Lord Jesus and to have God in them as their satisfaction and life
The more we exercise to deny our self and whatever issues from the self, the more we will exercise our spirit to speak the gospel
As we consider and wait before the Lord, we should sense a special spiritual need concerning the preaching of the gospel
When we go out to contact people, we should not boast about our gospel meeting, nor should people sense our natural zeal or excitement
Rather, after being contacted by us, people should have the impression that we have nothing but Christ within us
The people whom we contact should never have the sense that we are zealous or excited or that we are religious people
They should sense that there is something special that fills us inwardly and that this special thing is Christ
Today He is in us as the Spirit , and we have joy and satisfaction in our human life because He fills us inwardly
When we give Him the ground in us, He as our life and our strength delivers us from the world and every sin that entangles us
We preach the gospel by contacting people not because we are zealous or excited but because the Lord has filled us inwardly
If a person has no joy inwardly yet pretends to be joyful it will be apparent that his joy is not real and his false joy will be shortlived
If we are filled with Christ inwardly, we will spontaneously and naturally express Him in our behavior and speaking when we contact others
We should help them to see that they need to open their hearts to receive Jesus as their Savior and their Lord
The genuine, valuable, and weighty experience of being filled with the Holy Spirit is the experience of being filled with Christ within
When Christ fills us with Himself in our spirit and in our mind, emotion, and will, we love Him, follow Him, and live for Him
After the outpouring of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, Peter stood with the other eleven apostles to preach the gospel
When Saul was on the road to Damascus, the Lord Jesus appeared to him, called him by name, and revealed Himself to him
In his Epistles although Paul who is Saul spoke concerning sin judgment and Gods righteousness his center content and focus were Christ
It is a life that honors Jesus as Lord, a life that allows Him to have the ground in us and the authority over us
On the positive side, we need to receive Christ and give Him the ground in us so that He can gain us and fill us with Himself
We need to be persons who are consecrated, who allow the Lord to be our Lord, and who allow the Lord to touch us
If we do not allow God to touch us, it will be difficult for us to touch God, and God will not easily let us touch His throne
Satan may cause some of those listening to shake their heads so that the speaker will be unable to continue to release the word
Prior to a gospel meeting, we all need to pray proper prayers and have thorough dealings before God concerning our person
If they respond with opposing words or are proud, we should neither be angry nor anxious, and we should not argue with them
Moody's word to this listener indicates that whether people receive the Lord or not does not depend on our grammar
Although Moody was not highly educated, he led almost a million people in Europe and America to believe in the Lord and be saved
Immediately Moody said to this person My God said that the wicked man does not have peace and then he asked him Friend do you have peace
On the following evening, after Moody finished his speaking, that same person came to Moody, held his hand, and said, 'Mr
Sometimes, the longer we speak, the more we quench the work of the Holy Spirit, and the weaker others' faith becomes
When we speak to others, we are not merely passing on knowledge to them about philosophy, science, or biblical doctrines
We should speak the words of the gospel by faith and believe that the Holy Spirit will operate in people through our words
If we are overconfident in our preaching of the gospel, it will be difficult for those who listen to us to believe in the Lord
We need to realize that our condition might have been more pitiful than theirs if we had not believed in the Lord
Adam, the first man created by God, sinned, and thus the entire human race became sinful and came under God's condemnation
Today in order to receive eternal life, joy, and peace and to be saved from perdition, man only needs to repent
If we have no feeling inwardly and merely recite words from the Bible to others, our speaking will have little effect
These portions from the Bible show that according to God's plan, sin leads to death, judgment follows death, and perdition follows judgment
When we speak these words, we should not speak them rigidly, repeating them in the way that we did in the past
Someone may respond to our preaching by saying that it is not necessarily true that there is only one God in the universe
In order to have good results in our preaching of the gospel, we need to earnestly care for all the points that we have covered
We need to be persons who consecrate ourselves to the Lord, who pray proper prayers, and who are full of God as our faith
When we preach the gospel, we need to have faith, because we are speaking God's words, and God's words will never return to Him vainly
Only God is able to give us the timely words that match a persons condition and mood touch his inward feelings and satisfy his inward need
The Bible says concerning salvation that the gospel of God 'is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes'
The Bible shows also that the Lord is able to save to the uttermost and guard from stumbling all those who come forward to Him by believing
The human life without God is empty and void, and everything that is done to fill this void ends with a greater sense of emptiness
Whether an electric fan, a microphone, an organ, a piano, a lamp, or a chair-everything has its unique function and purpose
We know that people are on the earth not merely to exist and be satisfied by wearing nice clothes and eating good food
We have an inward realization and an inexplicable feeling that the human life should have a higher meaning than this
The unique purpose of an electric lamp is to manifest the function of electricity by allowing electricity to shine as light through it
If we put the lamp in its proper place so that electricity can flow into and shine out of it, the lamp will function properly
As human beings, we are similar to lamps in the sense that we exist for the expression and manifestation of God
When a person has God, he has the solution to all the problems in life and the way to overcome all difficulties
There is a need within man that is deeper than the need of his body and deeper than the need of knowledge in his mind
He may feel that he should seek satisfaction in the psychological and intellectual realm by advancing his education
According to the Bible, man has not only a body outwardly and a soul inwardly but also a human spirit deep within him
If the filament in a light bulb is broken, it will not give out light even if the glass of the bulb is fully transparent
In the same way, a person may enjoy material things, a high education, and all kinds of psychological entertainment
A light bulb that does not have electricity passing through it loses its intended function and the purpose of its existence
We will simply drift on the sea of human life, going east when the current goes east and going west when the wind blows west
We fall into this situation because we do not have God, and we have no answer to these questions because He is not our center
The motivating power of the gospel does not come from man nor does it depend on man but it comes from Christ motivating His believers within
He desires that we would preach the gospel to all our relatives and friends, saying to them, 'Your life is like everyone else's life
Acts 17:27 says that God is not far from each one of us, and Romans 10:8 says that the word of the faith is in our mouth and in our heart
He ascended to the heavens and poured Himself out as the Spirit so that He can reach everyone who believes in Him
Today the Lord is the Spirit who can enter into us so that we may be satisfied in spirit and turn from darkness to light
As soon as he saw me, he cried and said to me, 'I have tasted many kinds of enjoyment, received a high education, and held a high position
If you open your heart and pray a simple and sincere prayer to receive Him as your Savior, He will immediately come into you'
Although this person was highly educated had held a high position and had tasted many kinds of human enjoyment he left with such last words
After the First World War and prior to the Second World War, many young people went to Germany for advanced studies
Those who visited Germany after World War II could testify that on every Lord's Day, almost every Christian meeting place was full of people
He replied, 'I do not have any problems with my outward circumstances; rather, my problem is in my inward frame of mind
Please consider, when you are thirsty, you can quench your thirst only by drinking some water, which is easy to obtain
You only need to open your heart, call upon the name of Jesus, and believe in Him by receiving Him as your Savior
You only need to come before the Lord sincerely and speak to Him from the depths of your being, from the feeling in your heart
If you have the sense that you have wronged others, you should confess these sins before God and receive the Lord's cleansing
When you confess and receive His cleansing in this way He will forgive your sins and enter into you to satisfy the needs in your human life
With Jesus, a vain human life will become meaningful, a family will become sweet and perfect, and society will be full of harmony
If we have Jesus our human life will not be empty but full of satisfaction because He is what we need and He is the One in whom we can trust
If we consider our family members one by one, we will have to bow our heads and say that our family is not up to standard
If we broaden our scope and consider our society, we will be convinced that society is full of sinful and perverse things
If we consider the matter of sin a little further, we will realize that sin damages man more severely than disease
Many people realize that the mass media report innumerable occurrences of people being damaged by sin in our society
Due to the invasion of sin, the harmony between husband and wife is lost, and the sweetness of love deteriorates
The wives who love to play mah-jongg often leave their children to nannies or maids and return home late at night
Those who like to go dancing rarely take proper care of their children or have adequate concern for their children's studies
If this is the condition of many wives, how can anyone expect to have a proper family or well-trained children?
Sin has attacked and damaged every aspect of human life, including the life of the individual, the family, the society, and the country
A person who plays mah-jongg every day and returns home late every night will find it difficult to adequately care for his responsibilities
Playing mah-jongg consumes a person's physical and mental strength and is only one example of a sin that can lead to sickness
His mother may realize that it is dangerous for her child to play in this way, but she may not know how to seize the knife from her child
When her child sees the chocolate, he will be attracted and will spontaneously drop the knife and pick up the chocolate with both his hands
In whomever the devil is, works of evil will be manifested , and in whomever God is, goodness will be manifested
They also have in the Chinese dictionary different terms to describe intellectual ability or power and physical ability
Although man may have physical and intellectual power, he does not have moral power, because he does not have God within him
Because he does not have God within, he does not have the power to do good, and when he desires to do good, he is often helpless
If we desire to overcome sin, it is meaningless and vain for us to make up our mind and determine to sin no more
After his salvation, he did not remember the problem between himself and his mother but simply prayed to the Lord
His inward being was touched by some kind of power so that he wailed and felt sorrowful concerning his relationship with his mother
Although he was far away from home, he immediately purchased a train ticket to return to his hometown on the following day
From that day onward, his mother became a person whom he loved and honored, and whenever he thought of her, he was always happy within
One day, after believing in the Lord, God touched his inner being and caused him to regret his attitude toward his wife
Today, however, by means of electric waves a person who is speaking in America can be heard in Taiwan over a wireless radio
What seemed to be mysterious in the past is becoming quite ordinary today because people now know how to utilize electric waves
If we repent and confess our sins before the Lord and open our heart to receive Him as our Savior, He will come into our inner being
He will not only save us and deliver us from our sin but will also take away the record of our sins before God
As the source of all goodness and the power to do good, God desires to enter into you so that your entire life may be changed
We will be able to identify the chickens and the ducks simply by observing their living, their expression of life
Some trees, such as the apple tree and the peach tree, are difficult to distinguish when they are still saplings
Philosophers throughout the ages have argued over the question of whether human nature is inherently good or evil
If our living is good, our life must be good, and if our living is improper, it is difficult to believe that our life is good
We do not need to ask others or criticize them concerning their human life; we simply need to examine our own living and walk
If we observe our behavior in a sober and serious way, we will immediately discover that our living is improper
In many matters we are neither honest nor righteous, and our thoughts are often filled with crooked, dark, despicable, and corrupt things
Some people rob others on the streets, and others rob in less obvious ways, using their pens to steal from others
If we examine ourselves in this way, we will only be able to bow our heads and admit that our living is neither righteous nor honest
In conversing with others, some people convey the assurance that they do everything according to their conscience
Can we genuinely assure anyone that as far back as we can remember, we have done everything out of a good conscience?
When a doctor checks the condition of a patient's lungs, he sometimes taps on different parts of the patient's chest
Today, as they 'tap' on their conscience, many people know their true condition by the different 'echoes' that they hear
We deceive others because our fallen and corrupted life is deceitful, and we steal because this life is greedy
He did not know that we were standing outside the bedroom watching him play through a small opening in the door
Since the two cats have the same kind of life, the second cat has the same tendency to catch mice as the first
If we consider our past experience, we will realize that it was often difficult for us to prevail when we encountered temptation
Although the actual condition of the fallen human life is evil and also frail and mortal, God desires to bring salvation to man
God's salvation does not begin from man's outward condition; rather, it begins by God's working on man's inner being
After some time, the clay doll's white and clean face became blurry and dirty due to the daughter's continual caressing and kissing
The little girl recalled that every time her face became dirty, her mother washed her face in a basin of water
Eventually, neither the nose nor the eyes of the doll could be identified, and the doll's face became nothing but a piece of clay
After he discovered that the clay doll no longer looked nice, he said to her gently, 'Silly girl, this clay doll is not washable
Are we dirty outwardly or are we dirty inwardly, and are our outward good deeds more or less than our filthiness within?
When they decide to improve their behavior, they begin to realize that the filthiness within them is incurable
If we were able to refrain from losing our temper, it would be a great miracle, because the life within us is against this'
Break off some branches from the tree with small and sour fruit and graft in their place the branches from the tree with large fruit
Grafting, however, is not merely to improve the behavior of one branch but to impart and join to one branch the life of another tree
With this example, the lady understood that grafting is not an improvement in behavior but two lives becoming one life
For grafting to take place, both trees have to be cut so that the branches of one may be grafted into the other
Through the new birth the fallen and corrupted human life is terminated, and we receive a good life, the life of God
They speak mainly of Jesus Christ being the Savior, but they do not emphasize that, even more, Christ is life to man
In addition to the problems of emptiness, sin, and man's life, the human life also has the problem of its destination
We need to consider whether human beings have a lord, or a master, someone to whom they belong and to whom they live
On the surface, husbands may seem to be the lord of their wife, and wives may appear to be the lord of their husband
Many people have no quick answer to the question of what the direction of human life is and where man is going
The first parable speaks of the Lord Jesus coming like a shepherd to seek a lost sheep, which signifies a lost sinner
We should return to Him, just as the prodigal son returned to his father and his father's house in the parable in Luke 15
Although we may not have much realization of His shepherding, in His divine authority God is caring for us and shepherding us every day
We do not know Him, and we often do things behind His back, conduct our lives apart from Him, speak evil of Him, and even deny His existence
We need to consider why our eyebrows do not grow underneath our eyes, and why our teeth do not grow inside our nostrils
Rather, the heavens are above our head, the earth is beneath our feet, and our nostrils breathe in the air created by God
We will be peaceful and satisfied within because we know that the Creator of all things is our Father and our Lord
In the past six thousand years of human history no philosopher or wise man, whether in the East or in the West, has ever spoken such words
Their condemning conscience will become a clear conscience, their anxiety will become peace, and their pain within will become joy
His crying turned into happiness, and he got up from the floor, joyfully and prayerfully giving thanks to the Lord
Whenever a person turns his heart to Him, calls on Him, and believes into Him, He enters into that person and reaches him as the Spirit
If such a person is condemned in his conscience, once he receives the Lord, He will give him the peace of forgiveness
Originally many people were idol worshippers but after they believed in Jesus others could see the difference that had been wrought in them
Many idol worshippers have sad countenances, whereas the faces of believers, regardless of their age, are always happy and full of smiles
When a person calls on the name of Jesus and prays to Him, his pale face turns rosy, and his sad face becomes happy
He rose from the dead , ascended into heaven , and was made by God the Lord of all , including the universe and mankind
In previous chapters we saw man's actual condition: man is empty and sinful, his life is wicked and fragile, and he is wandering and lost
Many wise men, from ancient times to the present and from the East to the West, have considered how man can be saved
The fact that so many ways of salvation have been invented indicates that because of his condition man needs salvation
Although we often have a desire in our heart to do good, what we do outwardly is the opposite of what we desire inwardly
There is a Chinese proverb that says, 'Doing good is like climbing a mountain, but doing evil is like flowing water'
In northern China there is a saying that man's life consists only of 'three fillings and one lying down daily'
Judging from the way people conduct themselves during their life, it is certain that their eternal destiny will not be good
Due to mankinds need of salvation many wise men and philosophers have tried to invent different ways of salvation to meet mans various needs
They believed that what man does and how he behaves will be proper and upright if he sincerely exerts his effort to cultivate himself
Other wise men have said that a person's nature is easily corrupted if he is accustomed to living an easy life
The Bible tells us how God prepared a wonderful way of salvation for the human race in order to deal with and to meet all of man's needs
God's wonderful way of salvation has three major steps, and each step comes out of God's heart of love toward man
From our experience we know that the greatest, richest, sweetest, and most intimate is the love of a mother toward her children
Although the prodigal son needed his father, he did not know how much more the loving father had been eagerly awaiting his return
When the children are out wandering, they may forget about their parents, but their parents at home will be thinking of them restlessly
Children who are without parents have no rest, and parents who are without children are even more without rest
We hardly consider that God also needs the desolated sinners because His heart loves man, is toward man, and is fully on man
Not only are the uneducated countrymen fearful toward God, but also some famous scientists are filled with thoughts of worshipping God
The more intelligent and thoughtful a person is and the more feeling he has, the richer his concept of worshipping God will be
A proper man who is rich in his mind, emotion, and will has no way to deny that there is a God in the universe
Although the objects of their worship may be different or completely wrong, mankind in general has the concept of worshipping God
The relationship that God desires to have with man is not merely that man would adore Him as a God who is high and far above man
When a person thinks of God, his natural concept is that God is sitting in the heavens and that he, as man, is somewhere below
His thought is that God is high in heaven and that he is a small man on earth; hence, he can only prostrate and worship God from afar
It is far from man's natural concept to think that God desires to enter into man and to have a union in life with man
When these people reached the peak of their worship, they prostrated themselves with their whole body and even crawled
We are people who are small and lowly; therefore, we dare not stand but can only prostrate ourselves to worship Him'
They worshipped five times from the morning to the evening, and they took turns to worship one group after another
Those who have studied the four Gospels acknowledge that the words that Jesus Christ spoke in the four Gospels are full of wisdom
While Jesus was on the earth, those who followed Him saw the things that He did and were puzzled concerning Him
Many Buddhists often burn incense and chant Buddhist scriptures, but in their chanting, none of them feel that Buddha has come into them
A new believer shared his experience after believing in the Lord, saying, 'I not only believed but also prayed
The longer we believe in the Lord and the more we pray, the more we will be filled with many experiences of the Lord
One night, while the manager's wife was ironing her clothes with an electric iron, she had to take care of her child
The flames from the burning iron set the table on fire, and because the table was close to the wall, the wall also was set on fire
We can compare ourselves to an electric iron, God to the source of electricity, and Jesus Christ to the electricity
Many electrical appliances can receive the flow of electricity, yet no one can see the electricity in these appliances
Many households can use a radio to receive the radio waves from the United States and listen to radio programs from the United States
God is Spirit , and in the same way that electricity is transmitted into electrical appliances, He transmits Himself into man
There is only one way of salvation, the way of calling on the name of the Lord Jesus so that He immediately enters into you
Jesus is God, and once He enters into you, He joins Himself to your spirit to become your life and causes you to be filled with power
We only need to open our heart, receive Him into us, confess our sins, unload our transgressions, and let His Spirit fill us inwardly
Without God entering into man and being joined to man, there would be no way for man to contact God and be saved by Him
Without being joined to man and becoming one with man, God could not provide man with a salvation that is subjective and real
God's becoming flesh is the first step in His salvation, and His crucifixion is the second step of God's salvation
Some people regard the cross as a sign of self-sacrifice, whereas others regard the cross as a sign of victory
No matter how people interpret the significance of the cross, it is a very special symbol among the human race
The cross is superior, wonderful, and excellent; consequently, we need to consider what makes the cross so excellent
God requires man to be honest and not bear false witness to deceive others, but man is filled with hypocrisy and lies
God is the sovereign Lord of the universe, and as His creatures we have the obligation and duty to obey His law
According to His righteousness and law, He must punish us and put us to death because our actions are contrary to His law
According to His righteousness and law, God must punish and condemn us, but according to His heart, He loves us and longs to gain us
His way involves coming as a man to stand in the position of a man to receive God's punishment as man's Substitute
If we look at the cross, we will understand how much God loves man, and if we look at the cross, we will understand the righteousness of God
If God had no love for man, He would not have died for man, and if God was not righteous, He would not have borne the sins of man
Through the Lord Jesus' death on the cross, God's love for man was demonstrated, and God's righteousness was satisfied
Anyone who believes in the Lord Jesus will be moved to say that His death on the cross is the expression of God's love
When we look at the cross, we should sense His love, but when we consider the cross, we should also think of His righteousness
If Christ was dying only as a martyr for the sake of some virtue or for the sake of justice, God's presence would surely have been with Him
At that very moment, in God's eyes the crucified Jesus was the greatest sinner because He was bearing all the sins of man
He was not merely sacrificed on the cross; rather, He stood in the position of our Substitute in order to bear God's judgment for us
Although God and man were separated by sin, God can reach out to man, and man can come to God through the cross
The cross has removed the barrier between God and man, causing man to be reconciled to God, bringing man back to God, and joining man to God
Without resurrection death would be the end, and without His resurrection the Lord's power would not be manifested
If we put only a grain of wheat on a table for people to appreciate, the power of its life will not be manifested
Similarly, the life of God in Jesus Christ was given the opportunity to be manifested through His death and resurrection
Without death Jesus Christ could not have been resurrected, and without resurrection He would have remained by Himself
Those who fellowship with the Lord Jesus and approach Him through prayer can testify that Jesus is living in them
Although they know that the Lord Jesus is sitting on the throne, they do not know that He is also dwelling and living in them
We should not think that He occasionally comes down from the heavens to visit us but then goes back to the heavens
We need to know that He is living in us, have a taste of His living in us, and experience the fact of His living in us
It might have seemed to her that my answer had nothing to do with her question, but this was in fact the real answer
When she again discussed this with the Lord Jesus, she received the same sense to prepare some snacks and wait at the door
As we love Christ and fellowship with Christ, we no longer live out ourselves; instead, we experience Christ's living in and out of us
When they are clear about the truth of the gospel, the salvation of the Lord that they have received will be clearer
The most important thing to know concerning the gospel is who Jesus is, because Jesus is the center of the gospel
They responded, saying, 'Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets'
Throughout the generations historians have studied Jesus, but many people still do not know who Jesus really is
Later versions speak of Him as a revolutionary in Judaism, and other dictionaries say that Jesus is a Western saint
Over the last two thousand years of history, it is difficult to find another person who is more revered or respected
The administration of the universe is monistic in nature, and this monistic administration proves that there is only one God
If there were two Gods, there would be two sovereign Lords, and with two sovereign Lords, there would be two administrations, two sources
If the earth was just a little closer or just a little further from the sun, it would be impossible for human beings to exist on the earth
Even though landing on the moon would be a marvelous matter, it would not change the fact that God is the sovereign Lord
If we do not know even these things about ourselves, it is foolish to think that we could be equal to the sovereign Lord in the universe
Science has become so advanced that everyone knows that our physical eyes cannot see many things that actually exist
The Bible tells us that one day the sovereign Lord in the universe, the one God, the unique God, became flesh; God became a man
In our consideration of radio waves it is clear that the radio waves which are being broadcast by radio stations are abstract and intangible
According to our limited human feeling, God is too abstract, and we have no way to feel Him, see Him, or touch Him
In order for man to touch Him, to contact Him, to be able to know Him, and to understand Him, God emptied Himself and was embodied in a man
It can receive radio waves that convey many different languages, such as English, Japanese, Taiwanese, and Mandarin
We can also hear many different kinds of sounds such as the sound of a piano the sound of singing the voice of a man or the voice of a woman
The Lord Jesus was in the likeness of men and was found in fashion as a man because He put on humanity through incarnation
Although many people celebrate Christmas to remember the birth of Jesus, many do not know the significance of His birth
Verse 23 then says, 'Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel'
The child who was born of a virgin was God coming to be man's Savior and also God entering into man to be with man
The child who was born in a manger in Bethlehem was the Mighty God, the Eternal Father; He was the sovereign Lord in the universe
During the thirty-three and a half years that He lived on the earth, the Lord Jesus manifested both His divinity and His humanity
He could calm the winds and the sea, command demons, and cause the blind to see, the lame to walk, the dumb to speak, and the deaf to hear
He could raise men from the dead, and He knew the intentions within men's heart because He was the omnipotent and omniscient God
When He was buried, His physical body was laid in a tomb, and when He rose on the third day, His physical body was resurrected
When the Lord came to the disciples after His resurrection, they were frightened and thought that they had seen a spirit
The Gospel of John illustrates this matter when it speaks of a grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying
When a grain of wheat is planted into the ground, its outer shell decomposes, and then a new sprout of wheat comes forth from the earth
A butterfly is originally an ugly caterpillar, but after being transformed in the 'tomb' of its cocoon, it becomes a beautiful butterfly
The human body that Jesus put on when He became flesh was a body of humiliation; it had no outward comeliness or beauty
He resurrected from the dead with both His divinity and His humanity, having a glorified human body, to be man's living Savior
He cannot be compared to animals that people often worship, nor can other idols or so-called gods be compared to Him
There is no difference between a robber or a gentleman, because everyone has stolen from others or taken advantage of others
Indeed, there was a young man sitting in front of him who had stolen three pounds and eighteen shillings from his employer
The young man had no peace when he returned home, and 'three pounds and eighteen shillings' filled his mind as he was lying on his bed
One day as he was preaching the gospel in Hankow, he pointed to a young lady in the audience and said, 'You concubine'
We should not think for a moment that we only occasionally make mistakes or that our inward nature is not corrupt
Luke 6:43 says, 'There is no good tree that produces corrupt fruit, nor again a corrupt tree that produces good fruit'
More than the aspect of our outward behavior must be addressed; we must also solve the aspect of our inward evil nature
Although there are schools for art and universities for education, we do not need schools or universities to teach us how to lie and sin
Similarly, we may have a certain measure of benevolence, righteousness, elegance, and love, but we are full of 'thorns'
We may have many virtues that are admirable, but these virtues are entangled with thorns that cause hurt to others
If someone dares to say in public that he has good behavior, he is the greatest sinner in the world because he has deceived everyone
With His death on the cross, the Lord Jesus solved the aspect of our problem associated with our sinful behavior
Our numerous sins have violated God's righteousness, and they prevent us from being accepted by God or receiving His blessing
When He was put to death on the cross, not only was He killed by men, but He was also judged by God on our behalf
As the Scripture says, 'Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God'
In order to rescue us and bring us to God, the Lord Jesus removed the distance between us by clearing away the charges that were against us
He bore our sins on the cross and received God's judgment on our behalf to satisfy God's righteous requirement
He brought us before God so that we could receive God's forgiveness, God's acceptance, and God's grace and blessings
Without a Substitute to receive God's righteous judgment, the charges against us before God would have remained
When the Lord Jesus died on the cross as a man, the human nature that He put on in His incarnation was also crucified
Peter 2:24 says, 'Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness'
Christ's bearing up of our sins not only issued in the forgiveness of our sins; it also enabled us to die to sin
Even if a person cut off one of his hands to keep from playing mah-jongg, he would not be able to refrain from playing
Deliverance from our sinful nature is not possible through resolutions, through struggle and striving, or even through the help of others
The principle of resurrection can be seen in the biological world, including the plant life and the animal life
Biologists tell us that many things receive life through the process of death, passing from death into resurrection
Just as our voice is transmitted through radio waves, the Lord's life is released through the Holy Spirit into everyone who believes
When we call on Him and draw near to Him, a wonderful thing happens: His Spirit enters into us with His life so that we may have His life
After receiving the Lord, every saved person soon discovers that there are two persons with two lives inside him
The first person is our old man with our original sinful life; the second person is the Lord Jesus with His divine life
When we believed in Him and called on Him, He entered into us as the life-giving Spirit in resurrection to be our life and to live in us
Now He wants to live in us and become one with us by being mingled with us in this way He becomes our living glorious and wonderful Savior
As God, the Lord Jesus entered into us to become one with us in order to save us so that we would receive His life and salvation
Everyone who believes in and receives Him obtains God's life and can have a new living that is well pleasing to God
Although being joined to the Lord is not an easy concept for man to grasp, the Bible reveals that it is as simple as eating and drinking
In the New Testament receiving the Lord's salvation is often described in terms related to eating and drinking
Matthew 22:4 says, 'I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatted cattle have been slain, and all things are ready
Even though God has prepared everything and only wants man to receive and enjoy, many rely on their own efforts
It is not uncommon for someone who has heard the gospel to pray about improving himself so that he might be acceptable to God
Even though he was not committing big sins, his small sins kept him from having the assurance of his salvation
Regardless of man's condition or even the state of his conscience, the Lord Jesus has shed His precious blood and has borne the sins of man
Regrettably, many who hear the gospel have their own ideas and opinions, and thus, they are like the troublesome ones who come to a feast
When we talk to these troublesome ones, they may feel that Jesus is very good, but they always have some reservation in their mind
God has become a man to be our Savior; He has died on the cross on our behalf, shed his precious blood, and cleansed us of our sins
Now He is the Spirit who can enter into us and impart His life into us to empower us to overcome every kind of sin
We drink with the mouth not with our eyes we listen with the ears not with our eyes and we hold the Bible with the hands not with our nose
The more we try to receive Him by thinking about Him, the more we will be confused, and the more God will not seem real
When someone draws near to the Lord, he may not have much feeling about his sins at first, but the Spirit of the Lord will work in him
Many people who have lived on the earth for thirty, sixty, or even seventy years are still confused about the meaning of their human life
Because they have not been cleansed of their sins, they are like persons who have not washed their hands for their entire life
When the Lord gives a person a sense of his sins, he should confess them one after another, as though he is spitting them out one by one
As he was judging cases in court, the people whom he previously thought were quite unworthy became lovely to him
When the Lord enters into a person, sometimes a person weeps before Him, and sometimes a person is filled with an inner peace
It also causes a person to realize that he has been accepted by God, based on the redemption of the Lord Jesus
None of these conditions are the result of mans efforts or moral cultivation rather they are the spontaneous issue of receiving Gods life
He shed His precious blood on the cross to redeem us from our sins, and He resurrected from the dead to enter into us as life
He passed through thirty-three and a half years of human living on the earth, experiencing all the hardships of human life
After three days and three nights He resurrected from the dead, ascended to the heavens, and completed the accomplishment of God's plan
Even though we know that God's salvation is received by faith, we still have many concepts about God's requirement for receiving salvation
He quickly opened his Bible to see whether it was different, but, of course, he could not find his thought in the Bible
Between 'believes' and 'eternal life,' there is no further requirement for things such as prayer and zealousness
The concept that something in addition to believing is needed for salvation can also include the matter of Bible knowledge
When he asked her how long she had believed in Jesus she said that she had been a believer for many years and even prayed to Jesus every day
When he then asked her whether she had eternal life she could not repeat her concept about waiting because it did not correspond to John 316
Even when we speak of just believing in the Lord, the devil can come to bother us, saying, 'What if your faith is not firm?
If a person believes in the Lord but does not know whether his sins have been forgiven, we need to show him the words of God's covenant
If we ask him to pray with us, he may begin by praying, 'Lord, You are my Savior' and continue by praying, 'O Father'!
If our relatives say, 'This Jesus cannot be believed,' there will be an immediate reaction of disagreement within us
Whoever stands with Jesus in this way has believed in Jesus and has been joined to Jesus because the Spirit of Jesus has entered into him
He thought that since God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble, he should not be bold to say that he was saved
We may remember the best robe and the fattened calf, but do we remember the other things that the father gave to his son?
In addition to the clothing and food, we must also pay attention to the ring on the hand and the sandals on the feet
The robe signifies the righteousness of the Lord Jesus, and with this righteousness, we, as prodigal sons, have been accepted by God
God's salvation not only clothes us outwardly with the righteousness of Christ but also satisfies us inwardly with the life of Christ
The Father has given us the Lord Jesus as the fattened calf as the bread of life so that we can have the strength to walk the path before us
Most believers do not mention these two items-the ring and the sandals-and of these two items, the sandals are the most easily forgotten
If we do, we will express the seal of the Holy Spirit, and people will know that we are Christians as soon as they see us
All of these responses involve an effort to keep our feet from touching the world, but they ignore our need to walk
When a person invites us to watch a movie, we should do more than say no; we should also preach the gospel to him
To put on sandals is to be separated from the defiled world through the gospel, that is, to be separated from the world through the gospel
Only those who are separated from the world can walk; therefore, putting on sandals involves preaching the gospel
Wherever a Christian goes, he should preach the gospel so that he can be separated from the world; in this way, he will be protected
In Mark 1615 He also charged the disciples to preach the gospel saying Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation
In Romans 1:16 Paul said, 'I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes'
Paul was filled with the spirit of the gospel, and he was glad to spend everything for the gospel, even his being
The church in Philippi also had fellowship with Paul for the furtherance of the gospel , and the believers there were one soul with him
When a Christian rises up to preach the gospel his spirit becomes burning and when the church preaches the gospel the church becomes burning
Regrettably, we focus on eloquence and the content of a message instead of paying attention to the spirit of the gospel
Consequently, it is worthwhile to study the matters of the Christian faith related to believing in Jesus Christ
Another hymn entitled There Is a God says Listen to the voice of your conscience If you say there is no God You go against your conscience!
When people ask about the existence of God, some strongly say that God exists, and others strongly say that there is no such thing as God
Rather than answering yes or no so assertively, others lack a willingness to say yes but are equally unwilling to say no
The number of people who believe that there is a God is about equal to the number of people who believe that there is no God
Those who deny the existence of God are just as superstitious and are overly assertive because they have no way to prove their denial
Since believing in God is not a matter of superstition, we can certainly provide some arguments for His existence
Before we offer any argument for the existence of God, we should ask those who do not believe about their proof that He does not exist
Often their strongest proof is nothing more than a declaration that God does not exist because no one has ever seen God
If we regard everything that cannot be seen as being non-existent, there are many things whose existence we would have to deny
The surface area of the earth is nearly 200,000,000 square miles, whereas human beings are only around six feet tall
Even the distance between the earth and the sun is slight in comparison to the distance between our solar system and other stars
Those who say that there is no God can only say that the universe came into being naturally, but this is a weak and irresponsible argument
Please look at the universe, and consider all the wonderful details of its astronomical arrangements and physical laws
Those who study astronomy and physics know that there is much that is unknown about the universe despite numerous observations and theorems
It is truly pitiful and ignorant to try to argue against the existence of God by saying, 'The universe came into being naturally'
A young student once asked a pastor about the origin of the earth, and the pastor spoke of the account in Genesis
When the student said that this account was mere superstition, the pastor asked, 'Then how did the earth come into existence'?
When the student said that the earth was formed from a nebulous cluster, the pastor asked him about the origin of the nebulous cluster
The vastness of the universe and the marvels and order of all things in the universe are strong arguments for the existence of God
He said that these hairs help keep unhealthy things from entering into our body and help eliminate unhealthy things from our body
If our hands were in the position of our legs, and our legs were connected to our shoulders, this would look quite terrifying
In contrast, the more one says that there is a God, the stronger and more powerful he becomes, because God has both strength and power
When he reaches the age of thirty, he will be much bolder, and as each year passes, he will become bolder and bolder
When he reaches fifty to sixty years of age, he will begin to be afraid and to wonder if God truly does not exist
It is not a coincidence that newspapers and magazines often have stories about successful people who have committed suicide
Some may say that they are too busy to feel empty but after many years everyone senses the tediousness of human life
When he signaled red, everyone had to stop in one direction, and when he signaled green, everyone could move in the other direction
Those who run well live in nice houses and ride in automobiles; those who run poorly live in shelters and travel on foot
A person who is a bureau chief will run to be an agency head, and a cabinet member will run to be the president
Those who work in companies say that they are serving society and those who work in government offices say that they are serving the country
Originally, man was full of purpose, but since he lost his original position and function, he has also lost his purpose
The function of a light bulb is to be placed in a lamp so that it can shine and fulfill its function of illumination
If a light bulb is placed in anything other than a lamp, it will be useless, and its inability to shine will make its existence superfluous
Even a high position will not take away a sense of meaninglessness because a high position is not the reason for man's existence
When she was asked about the reason for her tears, she said, 'Little Treasure is growing up and is no longer obedient'
Another sister also treasured her son, but when her precious son was married, he no longer seemed to care as much for his mother
Throughout the day the doorkeeper considered how to spend the five hundred dollars, but he could not decide what to do with the money
Without God, families, organizations, societies, countries, and even the whole world will be a source of vanity and misery
Romans 3:10-18 says, 'There is none righteous, not even one; there is none who understands, there is none who seeks out God
All have turned aside; together they have become useless; there is none who does good; there is not so much as one
Swift are their feet to shed blood, destruction and misery are in their ways, and the way of peace they have not known
When someone calls us an evil person, we are not happy, but our unhappiness only proves that we do not believe that we are evil
The cook was unconvinced because he acted according to his conscience and, therefore, did not regard himself as being sinful
There are pickpockets on trains, and there are 'pickpockets' in homes because husbands and wives often steal from each other
When we were in Shanghai recently, some brothers and sisters were riding on a train together, and a nurse sat next to us
When the conductor served us with tea and towels, she pretended to be in our group so that she would not have to tip the conductor
Confucianism is comparable to the work of a mortician; it can only dress up and cover up man's sinful behavior
Confucianism will not change the nature of a crafty man, eliminate the hostility within a violent man, or cleanse a defiled man
Although this was the honest confession of a student who was only in college, it reflects the situation of man in general
Students are honest and simple in elementary school, but they learn to do bad things from others in junior high school
Before receiving an education, a person may tell lies in a clumsy way, but with an education he will become a skillful liar
Regrettably, education is often put into the hands of those with an improper heart, and it becomes a tool for sin
Those in darkness can be guided into the light, and those with an improper heart can become proper persons only if they have God
In order for education to be beneficial, the educated one needs to have a proper heart, but education itself cannot change man's heart
Neither Confucianism, nor education, nor religion can save man; these are of no use in changing man's sinful condition
Man is corrupt, commits sins, and is full of evil because he lacks God; the root of man's sickness is that he does not have God
He scattered some rice on the ground to lure them forward, but once he approached them, the sparrows flew away again
Verse 3 says, 'All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being'
When Jesus was on the earth, no one was afraid of Him, including adults, children, prostitutes, and tax collectors, because He was a man
In the Gospel of John, Philip asked the Lord Jesus to show the disciples the Father, and it would be sufficient
Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism, did not say that he was God, and even Mohammed said that he was only a prophet
If a person claims to be God but is not there are only two possible explanations for his error he is either speaking nonsense or he is lying
From ancient times to the present and from the East to the West, no one has been able to credibly call Him a madman
The words that Jesus spoke were full of wisdom, containing the highest standard of morality that has ever existed in the world
During the first century, the Roman emperor Nero slaughtered many Christians because they confessed Jesus as God
If Jesus were not God, there would not have been so many people willing to sacrifice their lives because of their belief in Him
When the husband of the woman received the telegram notifying him of his wife's ability to walk, he could not believe the news
Demon-possessed people, whether male or female, have enormous strength and can easily break the restraints upon them
When they knelt down to pray, a demon-possessed woman tried to frighten them by jumping around with a pair of scissors in her hands
Consequently, demons do not want people to believe in Jesus, because once a person believes in Jesus, the demons' desire is frustrated
People who are in darkness receive light when they pray to Him, and those who are lost receive salvation when they open to Him
The New Testament begins with four Gospels: the Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel of Mark, the Gospel of Luke, and the Gospel of John
The Gospel of Matthew speaks of the Lord Jesus as the King who is bringing the kingdom of the heavens to the earth
Through the portrait in the four Gospels we can see that the Lord Jesus is a noble King a lowly Slave a perfect man and the Most High God
His introduction in the Gospel of John is different from what is recorded in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke
The Gospel of John begins, saying, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being
If we were to write down their stories, even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written
The cases that John recorded were specifically chosen by him to reveal various aspects about Jesus coming to be our life
Chapter 3 shows that the Lord can meet the need of moral persons, and chapter 4 shows that He can meet the need of a person with no morality
Chapter 3 speaks of persons at the highest level of society, whereas chapter 4 speaks of persons with no standing in society
The Lord purposely healed the blind man on the Sabbath to expose the vanity of religious ritual, which is the source of much blindness
Even a moral and honorable person needs the Lord in order to be regenerated so that he can enter into the kingdom of God
Those who are dying need the Lord, and those who are impotent and do not have the strength to be freed from sin need the Lord Jesus
Everyone who is impotent in regard to a particular weakness is like a person who is lying on a mat and unable to rise up
Those who are impotent do not have the strength to rise up from their 'mat'; they even rely upon their 'mats' as a means of support
If you have the Lord Jesus, you do not need to remain on your mat, because the Lord said, 'Rise, take up your mat and walk'
Once you have the Lord Jesus, you will not need to rely on your mat; you will be able to take up your mat and walk
Without the Lord, a person is impotent and stuck to his mat, whether it is smoking, mah-jongg, or something else
The Lord said I am the bread of life he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me
Verses 7 and 8 say, 'If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you
John 20 records the Lord Jesus' resurrection, but there also is no mention of His ascension in the Gospel of John
We need to fellowship with the Lord all the time; He is in us waiting for us to contact Him and expecting to fellowship with us
He passed through human living, crucifixion, burial, resurrection, and became a life-giving Spirit to enter into us and be with us
They do not have the realization that if God really manifested Himself as God, they would not be able to stand
It is possible for us to contact one another by telephone or telegraph, but the best way to contact one another is face to face
There are over six thousand years of human history, and during these years there must have been some record of His speaking, His word
It should contain prophecies concerning matters in the future, and every prophecy must be shown to have come to pass
Based on these six criteria, it is easy to see that only the sacred writings of various religions need be considered
Of these writings, the sacred writings of Buddhism cannot be considered as God's word because they do not speak of God
Since there are numerous religious systems that do not revere God, their writings cannot be considered as being the word of God
They think that money is so powerful that it can even influence people, demons, and the 'gods' behind their idols
Even though this is a cultured age, there has not been a generation with as little restraint as the current one
She answered, 'I would spread some candy on the floor so that he would drop the knife in order to pick up the candy'
In 1920 the League of Nations was established, and later a treaty was formulated specifically for maintaining international peace
Even though this incident was not the direct cause of World War II, the fighting throughout China began to spread
Whereas they were once dispersed among the nations because they did not listen to God's word, they are now returning to Israel
Although they were Germans and Americans by national citizenship, they remained as Jews ethnically and culturally
Because the Jews would never assimilate, Hitler was able to persecute and massacre them and to seize their properties
The principles of morality spoken of in the Bible are higher than the standards of morality contained in any other book
When Jesus was being crucified and suffering unbearably on the cross He prayed Father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing
Not only have many prophecies in the Bible been fulfilled, but the Bible also has special power, especially the power to change people
If the books written about the Bible were laid side by side, the distance would be greater than the width of the Pacific Ocean
Some people devote their whole life to study the Bible, and at the end they still do not understand its mysteries
At Pentecost, when the people heard the word of Peter, they were pricked in their heart, and they asked what they should do
According to the Bible, whenever someone receives the Lord through the preaching of the gospel, we need to tell him to be baptized
It is not sufficient to receive salvation merely by believing, we still need to receive the salvation that is related to baptism
Although death is terrifying to many, it is truly wonderful in God's salvation because our death in Christ terminates all our problems
Romans 6:3-4 says, 'Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?
Because we have believed into the Lord we have died with the Lord Jesus and because we have died with the Lord we need to be buried with Him
From our point of view, there have been many people who have lived on the earth from the ancient days until now
Adam is the first man, because there was no man before him; Christ is the second man and the last man, because there is no man after Him
In God's eyes every man is in Adam, comes from Adam, and belongs to Adam, which is to say that every man is identified with Adam
Although we may not have personally passed through the Pamirs, we passed through the Pamirs when our ancestors passed through the Pamirs
In God's eyes every man who has believed into Christ is saved because a saved person enters into Christ and is identified with Him
One day the Word, who was with God and who was God, became flesh; that is, God put on humanity, and His name was Jesus
The Jews think that the death of Jesus was just the death of a rebel, but a saved person knows that Jesus died to bear his sins
Those who have a further understanding of salvation know that Jesus also bore all of the old creation in His death
Before His ascension, Jesus was Emmanuel , meaning 'God with us'; after His resurrection, He is with us even more
Once we were only in Adam, but through the second birth, that is, regeneration, we have entered into Christ and are now in Christ
Those who are not saved do not need to prepare to sin or even make an effort to sin, because sinning is easy and natural
No matter how much force and effort we exert, we will sin because the law of sin and of death is a part of Adam
There is also a law in Christ, and in this law of the Spirit of life, we have been freed in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death
Utterance concerning the law of the Spirit of life does not exist in the thoughts, the classical writings, or the philosophies of the world
Because of his considerable spiritual experience related to the law of the Spirit of life, the apostle Paul spoke of it in detail
Even though we had some experience of this law, we did not have adequate knowledge of it or adequate utterance related to it
Verse 22 speaks of 'the law of God,' and verse 23 speaks of 'the law of my mind' and 'the law of sin which is in my members'
According to the preceding verses there are four laws the law of God the law of the mind the law of sin and the law of the Spirit of life
While psychologists consider man to be of two parts-soul and body-the Bible speaks of man as having three parts-spirit, soul, and body
Man was initially created by God to be good, and this law of good is related to our human nature and human life
After man was created, he listened to Satan's word, and Satan entered into his members, becoming his fleshly passions and evil desires
What Chinese philosophers call the 'war between rationality and lust' is, in fact, the war between the soul and the body
When man fell, he received the law of sin in his body, and when man is saved, he receives the law of the Spirit of life in his spirit
When man partook of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, good and evil were mixed together in him
When man is saved, however, the Spirit of life enters into him so that good, evil, and life exist simultaneously in him
In addition to these three laws, there is the law of God that is above man and outside of man, that is, the written law of God
We do not need to learn how to do good or try to avoid evil, because we are no longer limited to the realm of good and evil
When a man is saved, God's life enters into him; hence, the law of the Spirit of life is in a believer's spirit
In man's soul there is the human life, in man's body there is the devil's life, and in man's spirit there is God's life
A person who is not saved is quite complicated because he has two lives-the life of man and the life of the devil
The law of good is in our soul, the law of sin and of death is in our flesh, and the law of the Spirit of life is in our spirit
In addition to the law of good and the law of sin and of death, however, believers have the law of the Spirit of life
The center of Christ's salvation is God Himself, and the purpose of salvation is to express God, not to express good
In the salvation of God the passions and lusts of the body must be crucified, and our soul, our self, must be denied
If the lusts of our body are not crucified and our soul is not denied, the life within our spirit cannot be expressed
God regarded His work of creating man as being very good, and this good was expressed through the goodness of man's soul
If salvation could be obtained through the fulfillment of good by the soul, there would be no need for the law of the Spirit of life
The real hindrance to the flowing out of God's life is not a hot temper or pride but the meekness and humility of the self
An electric light shines because it has 'fellowship' with a power generator, and there is an electrical current 'abiding' in the power plant
Although a Christian lives on the earth, the heavenly, divine life within him can flow when he abides in the Lord
All Christians are connected to the heavenly Christ, and when we abide in the heavenly Christ, the fellowship of life flows
We must consider every matter in the light of our fellowship with God, not according to our own view or even the views of others
No matter how good our view or the views of others are, we should not do anything without fellowshipping with the Lord
If we do this, the fellowship of the divine life within us will be restored, and the divine life will begin to flow again
If we avoid contact with God's children, contact with the church, and contact with the Word, something is wrong with our fellowship with God
In Greek, the word revelation means 'unveiling,' which is the opening of a covering, a veil, so that people can see what is inside
Even though we have light from the Bible, there are still many people in Christianity who are involved only with natural service to God
Service according to revelation is a service that comes from contacting God and touching God's will in fellowship with Him
Any service that results from the fashion of the times and from outward demands is natural service, not service according to revelation
If we receive an anointing as we open ourselves and fellowship with God, the resulting service will be according to revelation
We should not be influenced by the environment; instead, we need to have direct fellowship and contact with God
Before Saul met the Lord on the way to Damascus, he served God zealously, but his service was a natural service
Although he was zealous for God in the heavens, he thought that he was only persecuting Christians on the earth
Through the Lord's speaking, Saul realized that he was persecuting Jesus when he was persecuting Christians on earth
When he received a revelation from God in chapter 10, he went to Cornelius's house to preach the gospel to the Gentiles
Service according to revelation is not derived from doctrinal consideration; it comes out of the revealed will of God
In order to receive revelation, we need to go before God and open to Him, consecrate everything to Him, and live in fellowship with Him
We should not hold on to our own views or be influenced by our background, traditions, customs, and circumstances
Every member has a function, and all the members must be coordinated together in order to manifest the beauty of the Body
If some members are not coordinated, they will be separated from the other members and be unable to manifest their function
In the service of God the saints can never act alone, serving as an individual, because we are not individuals
No matter how great the function of a member is he is only a member and no matter how small the function of a member is he is still a member
Our status will forever be as a member, that is, a member of the Body; as such, we cannot be separated from the Body and exist by ourselves
Our service should always be as members one of another; it should be the service of the church, not a service of individuals
In order for God to have a way to go on, all the saints in all the localities must rise up to serve God corporately
In the early days there was the service of the apostles as well as the service of the saints; the apostles were in the midst of the saints
From the time of Martin Luther until now, the recovery of the church has been moving toward the recovery of this matter
In 1943 the saints in the church in Chefoo were willing to migrate to the northwest to serve, and the church made arrangements for this
Most of them went to the regions of Paotou and Shanpa; now there are four to five hundred saints serving God there
Even miscellaneous affairs, such as cleaning chairs, sweeping the floor, and preparing meals, are part of the service
Even if there are specific people serving in relation to specific items, there should always be an opening for other saints to serve
After two months of all the saints serving, the number increased to over two hundred; in the second year there were more than six hundred
God's work in China is to raise up saints to serve Him and to have the saints rise up corporately to serve God
