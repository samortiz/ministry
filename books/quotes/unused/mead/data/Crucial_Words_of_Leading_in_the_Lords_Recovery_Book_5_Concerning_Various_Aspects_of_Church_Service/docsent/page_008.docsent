   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BROTHERS HOUSES AND SISTERS HOUSES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING RECEIVING STATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If a school looks promising for the gospel work, those who labor in that school should consider moving close to it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can start either a brothers house or a sisters house with three or four students.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such an apartment does not need to be large, but it needs to have a living room where we can receive students.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This kind of arrangement will hit the target every time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is effective.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Two to three brothers or sisters, who are students, and a couple can live in such an apartment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every day after school is over, we can bring students to the apartment and meet with them for thirty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The meeting should be without an obvious form.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There can be gospel tracts, snacks, and something to drink in the living room so that the students can talk freely.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we first contact the students, their parents may not understand and may interfere.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, they will gradually understand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After some children are saved, their behavior will change, and their parents will notice the change.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, the parents will find out that their children have believed in the Lord Jesus, or their children will tell them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, by that time it will be too late, even if the parents want to interfere.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nonetheless, it is a great comfort and blessing to the parents when their children change for the better.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When they first find out, most parents do not agree with their children believing into the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But some children have even brought their parents into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church in San Francisco rented a house across from a large high school.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The house was for the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the first floor there was a large living room, and every afternoon the door to the house was wide open.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All that a student had to do after leaving school was to cross the street, and he would be in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The students could have a drink, sit down, and talk.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The gathering was only for half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>More than a hundred people were saved in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One of the high school students who was saved through such contact even became an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The full-timers who are involved with the gospel work in the schools must find suitable, nearby locations to receive the students.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The closer such a location is to the school, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, to labor at National Taiwan University it is best to move near the university and open our home as a receiving station.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Initially, it may be that we only receive students, but eventually we will be giving them hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes students have special circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A student may become sick and come to our home to be cared for.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the most effective way to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When our homes are receiving stations, we can contact students on a daily basis, and the care that we render will not be routine or formal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the most effective way to labor among the students in high school and in junior high school.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should also be practical.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can receive a student in our home on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not bring a student to the Lord s Day meeting immediately after he is saved; rather, we should labor on him gradually until he becomes solid.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we can bring him to the Lord s Day meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before a student is solid, we can meet with him on the Lord s Day, not in the meeting hall but in our home.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After we build up the habit of meeting with our new ones on the Lord s Day, we can then bring them to a young people s meeting on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not be too quick to bring them to a general meeting of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the work in the high schools and the junior high schools is progressing well, we will go further.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can have a conference or a big gathering for all the saints in high school and junior high school at least every six months.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can use a large meeting hall or rent a hall for such a gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such a conference is very helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can use it to bring the students step by step into the atmosphere and the realm of the gospel, into life, into truth, and into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a good way for the work in both high school and junior high school to develop.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>TAKING THE STUDENTS TO THE MOUNTAINS</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Based on our experience in the United States, we can take the junior high school and the high school students to the mountains every six months for a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such an activity would need the support of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The saints children, who are saved, can also coordinate with us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must entrust the newly saved ones to our children who are students.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some of the newly saved ones are their classmates, and it will be easy for our students to converse with them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In America we conduct mountain trips every six months.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We can hold a mountain trip every three months to have a greater impact.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A mountain trip should not be long; it can last for a holiday or a weekend.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I am burdened to have a meeting with the elders in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Perhaps the church can purchase a plot of land in the nearby scenic area and build a recreation center for the students.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we have such a center, the churches can take turns using it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perhaps this week the students from hall two use it, and next week the church in Yung-Ho or the church in Ban-Chiao can use it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It would be best to purchase about six thousand square feet so that all the meeting halls in the church in Taipei and the nearby churches can use it regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Having such a place available for the young people will make everyone happy, and its effect will be beneficial.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We can take the teenage saints, those in junior high school and high school, to the mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even their gospel friends can be saved on such a trip.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We can arrange activities for them, and we should set aside three periods of time to teach them something.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In two days we can have six periods.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even a naughty child can be saved on such a trip.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The mountain trip can be regarded as a kind of incubator.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After staying in the incubator for three days, everyone will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the United States a teenager was saved during a mountain trip and stopped smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Such a change is applauded by every parent.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should do this work earnestly, and we should be even more aggressive with the college students.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Presently, in the United States the work with the high school and college young people depends on these conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Such conferences uphold our young people.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must work in the junior high schools, the high schools, and the colleges.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Every college campus on the island of Taiwan must have a gospel work so that the students who are saved in high school can be worked on for another four years.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>By the time a person who is saved in junior high school finishes college, he would have received at least seven years of cultivation in the truth, and it will be difficult for him to fall away.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we can weave such a gospel net in the junior high schools, the high schools, and the colleges all over this island, it will uphold all our saved young people.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The principle for the college work is similar.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There is one advantage to the college work, which is that college students have more freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They live in the dormitory away from home, and the colleges do not watch over them strictly but allow them more freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We should utilize this.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We need to carefully study how to labor on the college campuses to know how to best utilize their time and how to contact them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>According to our experience with institutions such as Ching-Hwa and Yen-ching universities, most professors live on campus.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We can therefore use the homes of the saints who are professors at the universities to contact students and even have meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The principle is similar to what we fellowshipped earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We should consider what we will say when we contact the college students.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We need to know how to speak and what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>What we say needs to supply them with food so that they may be fed.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We must also supply them with medicine to heal their sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Sometimes we even have to operate on them as a surgeon.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The content of our conversation with the junior high school students and the high school students should be simple, but it should also stir up their interest.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We should avoid debates with the college students.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When a person grows to be eighteen years old, he begins to consider the meaning of life.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Therefore, when we supply the truth to them, we should avoid debates.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It is easier to select material for junior high school students and high school students than it is to select material for the college students.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is what makes college work easy and yet difficult at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The difficulty lies in the fact that the college students have begun to consider certain deep issues, making it easier for them to debate.</S>
