<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. To Be Raised Up and Have His Head Lifted Up by God</H2><P>David also said that God would raise him up upon a rock and that he would have his head lifted up by God (27:5c, 6a). Most of the time, we drop our heads. We do not have our heads lifted up. When we walk, we mostly walk with our heads down. We need to be raised up and have our heads uplifted. We are earthly people, always looking upon the earth. It seems that we have lost something valuable and that we are looking on the ground for it. But when Abraham heard God's promise in the night, God told him to look toward heaven at the stars. Then God told Abraham that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars (Gen. 15:5). We need to forget about all of the earthly things. Instead, we need to look up. We need to lift up our heads and say, "Praise the Lord! Hallelujah!" This is a glory to Him.</P><P>Psalm 24:7 says, "Lift up your heads, O gates;/And be lifted up, O long enduring doors;/And the King of glory will come in." The gates are of the cities of the nations. The doors are of the houses of the people. We need to lift up our heads because our King is coming. We lift up our heads when we dwell in Christ and in the church, praising God and enjoying Him. Then we are raised up persons, and we have our heads lifted up by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. To Offer Sacrifices of Shouts of Joy<br>with Singing and Psalming to God</H2><P>Psalm 27:6b says, "And I will offer in His tent/Sacrifices of shouts of joy:/I will sing and psalm to Jehovah." This all should be experienced by us in the house of God&#151;in Christ and in the church. Surely we will also be like this in the New Jerusalem. We will behold God's beauty in the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem will be our shelter for us to be concealed and our hiding place for us to be hid. We will be raised up with our heads lifted up, praising, singing, psalming, and offering Christ to God. This is the enjoyment of God in the house of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Lifting Up His Hands<br>unto the Innermost Sanctuary</H2><P>In Psalm 28:2 the psalmist said that he lifted up his hands unto the innermost sanctuary.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Praising God in His Temple by Saying, "Glory"</H2><P>The psalmist also said that in Jehovah's temple all say, "Glory!" (29:9).</P>
