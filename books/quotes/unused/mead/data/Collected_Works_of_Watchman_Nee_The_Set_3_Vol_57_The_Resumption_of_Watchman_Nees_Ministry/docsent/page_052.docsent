   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Leading in the Body Cutting Short</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>an Individual's Journey</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is a strong relationship between a person's spiritual journey and the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is a need for the leading of the Body because an individual's spiritual journey can be shortened with the leading of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a brother is left to himself, he may stumble for ten years before he can come up with something.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But through the Body he may acquire the same thing in one evening.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the brother will take the judgment of the Body, he will save much time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The use of authority in the church is for the purpose of reducing the mistakes and shortening the journeys.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everyone Functioning</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>and Everyone Submitting to Authority</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The principle of service in the church is that all the one-talented ones have to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But as soon as they rise up, the flesh rises up also.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, in order for the church to become the church, all the one-talented ones have to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, in order to deal with the flesh, there must also be the exercise of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here the only solution is for man to listen and obey.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you think that something is right, you should obey.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you think that something is not right, you should nevertheless obey.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everyone should rise up, and everyone should learn obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After a church has its authority established, there is still the need for the one-talented ones to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without the one-talented ones, there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the same time, without authority there will be confusion in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The problem with the Catholic Church is that the one-talented ones have not risen up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, most of the people in the church are one-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today the church has fallen into desolation because the one-talented ones are buried.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If all the one talents are dug out and everyone is submissive, the authority in the church will be able to deal with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There was a brother in Foochow who could be considered the very "incarnation of opinion.''</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was very zealous toward the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was right that his one talent be put to use, but the church could not let him do whatever he liked.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the same time, the church had to give him the opportunity to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At any rate a person must learn to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may not see the result today, but in eight or ten years we will see the result.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Having authority alone is empty; having the one-talented ones alone is disorderly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when the one talents are added to authority, we have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Under these circumstances, what could have only been accomplished in ten years can now be accomplished overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The brother that I mentioned earlier was later dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He responded by saying that he would quit and would move back to his hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I said, "Brother, you cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You still have to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, you must serve according to the way the church tells you.''</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One's submitting to authority is his inheriting the riches that lie in the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a man truly learns to drop the self, he will have no problem with the matter of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Service in the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>and God's Light Being Found in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The kind of service that is in the Holy Spirit is found only in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 1 and 2 Timothy and in Acts, we see the matter of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul told Titus to remain in Crete Titus 1:5 , and he told Timothy to come to him before winter 2 Tim 4:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul did not ask them to go and pray; he only told them directly where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today God's move is carried out through the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our service is also under the direction of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the beginning God created a garden, and He went to the garden to look for man Gen 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After man sinned, God no longer had a place of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Noah's dove was not able to find a resting place over the entire condemned earth Gen 8:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God did not have a place of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is why He later built the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The tabernacle is God's resting place.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The tabernacle brought in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Later, the temple was judged, and not one stone was found on top of another.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then the church was brought in. Ephesians 2 says that the church is the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today God dwells in the church 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the Old Testament the light was in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There was no lamp or sunlight in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Yet there was light because God was there.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the same principle, if you want to receive light today, you have to come to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is a strange thing for a person to be able to come to the church yet not receive any light.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If a man is outside the church, he can remain in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But once he comes into the church, he will see light.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Let me ask the co-workers a question: Do you receive more light when you read the Bible by yourselves or when you meet in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do you understand the Scriptures more by staying in your room or when you speak on the platform?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What one person cannot see clearly by himself, he will see clearly when he is with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You may think that what you have received comes from your own mind.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But have you ever given more thought to the matter?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All revelations come from the light.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Only when there is the light can there be the revelations Psa 36:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Today there is abundant light in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is why we have to see that it is impossible for us to be an individual Christian.</S>
