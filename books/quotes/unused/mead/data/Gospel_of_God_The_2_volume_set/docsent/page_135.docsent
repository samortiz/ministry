   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Acts 19:18 and 19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are only three places in the New Testament which record this matter of confession of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We come now to the third place, which is in Acts 19:18 and 19, which says, "And many of those who had believed came, confessing and making known their practices.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And a considerable number of those who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them before all; and they counted up the price of them and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although there is only the word "confessing," without the mentioning of "sins," the same thing is referred to.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1 John 1 it says "confess our sins," in Matthew 3 it says "confessed their sins," and here it says "confessing" and "making known their practices."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, the confession and the divulgence of their practices were not reckoned as a way to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second, those who confessed and recounted their practices were not sinners but believers, people who were Christ's. This can be compared to some brothers and sisters standing up in the meetings to give a testimony acknowledging what they have done in times past.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It can also be compared to some who testify at their baptism of things done in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are altogether not saved through this kind of confession.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some have believed and have become the Lord's. They now confess their past history.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They admit that they were evil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are no longer afraid to tell the saints that they have been transferred from the miry clay onto a solid rock.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the Ephesians burned their magic books, they were making an open demonstration that though they had practiced these things, they now belonged to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Third, "And many of those who had believed came."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not all came.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not every saved person needs to confess in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is because the Holy Spirit moves strongly to prompt people that they rise to disclose their practices that they may glorify God by showing the extent of God's salvation in them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Friends, you can discover from these three portions of the Word that the way of salvation is through faith and not through public confession.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These are the three portions of the New Testament where confession of sins is specifically covered.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is one other place, in James 5:16, where confession of wrongdoing to one another, rather than confession of sins, is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>James tells us when a brother or sister is sick, the elders of the church should be called to pray over the sick person and anoint him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And if any wrongdoings are involved, there should be mutual confession and forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a different matter from our subject today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have looked into all the verses in the New Testament concerning the confession of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you now see the way for one to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is through faith and not through the confession of sins.</S>
