   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before we go any further, we need to see something of great importance to our understanding of God s full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The goal of God s salvation is not many individual people who have been saved by God, but one corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is a corporate man?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Men, as we know them, are all individuals, independent from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can there be such a thing as a corporate man?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I. THE CHURCH THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we saw in the last lesson, the sons of God all have God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, God s life is not a thing but a Person, God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To have this life is just to have a living Person in us, the living God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When these many individual people become filled with the one living God, they become one corporate God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are no longer many individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They have all become the many parts of this one corporate man, the many members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Consider yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Inside your body you have only one life, one person living there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you go to school, your whole person goes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you do a job, your whole person does the job.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All that you do, you do in oneness, because within you there are not two persons but only one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How about God?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He too is in oneness, and His purpose is to be expressed in this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When so many individual people receive Him as life, they become one with Him, and they are called the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In eternity future, these people will be called the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is what we call the corporate man that God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is what makes God happy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you read Ephesians 3:9-11, you will see that the church is not a thing that just happened after many individual people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, the church was planned in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was for the church that the many people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was planned in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then, in time, through our salvation in Christ, the church was brought about to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to Revelation 21 and 22, it will continue on into eternity as the eternal goal and dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church is a people filled up with God as their life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are no more just individuals who care for their own things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, they are many individuals who are being filled up with God as their life and are being built up together in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When they are living in this one life, they have the one image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They are His one expression and they represent God with His authority.</S>
