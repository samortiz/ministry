   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE FOUR POINTS FOR FULFILLING THE PRIESTHOOD OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19; John 15:16; 1 Cor 15:58; 2 Tim 4:2 COMING TO THE LORD AND GOING TO SAVE SINNERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In our hymnal, there is a precious hymn which says:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Must I go, and empty-handed?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Must I meet my Savior so?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not one soul with which to greet Him: Must I empty-handed go?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hymns, #930</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The story behind the writing of this hymn is very touching.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A number of years ago, a certain saint was dying and was full of regret for not having brought anyone to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A servant of the Lord told this saint that he would write a hymn that would help others in the coming years to rise up to take the time while they are still living to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The matter of saving sinners is something which all of us need to seriously consider.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we were to go to meet the Lord this very day, what would our condition be related to this matter?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Within the past four and a half years, the Lord has led me to raise up this matter of gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I did not have any intention to raise up a doctrine or concept.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>My burden, which I believe was of the Lord, came from my realization that most Christians today, including us, do not have the real and sincere burden to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some may have such a desire, but they do not have the proper way to carry out their burden.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, the result has been poor.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I began to study the Word to see the way which God ordained related to gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From such a study we have now seen that the way which is ordained by God is for the believers to go to people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the New Testament, the word "go" is a big word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Another big word is the word "come."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I gave one or two crucial messages concerning these two words while I was in Shanghai more than forty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I said that in the New Testament, there are two words which are crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord says, "Come to Me" Matt 11:28; John 6:37; 7:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then after we come to the Lord, He tells us to "go" Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He desires us to come to Him and then go to others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the word "come" is the word "go."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, the preaching of the good news is the very propagation of Christ Himself in His person and in His wonderful redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as we preach Him through the power of the Holy Spirit, such propagation should not be opposed or criticized.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If there had been no opposition within these past three years, by now many thousands of sinners would have been brought to the Lord, and there would have been a very high revival among us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead, this matter of visiting sinners to preach the gospel to them has become a subject over which some would debate.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What a shame this is!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the New Testament, the primary matter is to come to the Lord and to come to Him continually.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then after coming to Him to touch Him, He will tell us to go!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more we come to Him, the more He will trouble us to go.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It may be that He will trouble us to go to another country or to go to our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>My experience is that, almost without exception, whenever I come to the Lord, He always charges me to go.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He charges us to go with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must go to our relatives and to everyone with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God's kingdom is spread by our going and by our preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is God's ordained New Testament principle, but without our willingness to go, His principle cannot be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He has never charged His angels to do this because the preaching of the gospel is fully based upon the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God lives with man, and man works with God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without the mingling of God with man, without the incarnation of the divine person with the human person, God cannot accomplish His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Acts 10 an angel went to Cornelius and told him to send men to Joppa to get Peter Acts 10:3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This was done so that Peter could come to Cornelius in order to preach the gospel to him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As a young person reading this portion, I asked myself, "Why would the angel not preach to Cornelius?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Later, I saw the principle that we are saved by men, not by angels.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As men we should not only go and preach the gospel but also pray for the ones to whom we would preach.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Without our going, our preaching, and our praying, men cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We do not need to pray to see if it is the Lord's will for us to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are considering marriage, then we should pray very much.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, related to preaching the gospel, the Lord simply says for us to go and disciple the nations Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul said we should preach the gospel "in season and out of season" 2 Tim 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This means that we need to preach the gospel whether the opportunity is convenient or inconvenient and whether we are welcome or unwelcome.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whether the time is in season or out of season, we have to preach the word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord said, "Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them" Luke 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to go to gain the people for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once we go to preach the gospel, we will be revived, and we will see the church in our locality revived.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Devil is the one opposing the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If he can stop us from preaching the good news for another five years, the issue will be death.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is his goal.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Within the last few years, the saints in Taipei have become convinced that they need to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They are all of the same mind to go to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because of this their attendance at the Lord's table, which was three thousand five years ago, has now become five thousand.</S>
