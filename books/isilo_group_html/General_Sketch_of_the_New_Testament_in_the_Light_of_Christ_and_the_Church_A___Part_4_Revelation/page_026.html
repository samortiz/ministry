<p>The parable in Matthew 13:47-50 corresponds to the one in Matthew 25. Of the seven parables in Matthew 13, the first six relate to the church and the kingdom. These include the parables of the sower, the wheat and the tares, the great tree, the leaven, the hidden treasure, and the pearl of great value. The seventh parable is the parable of the net cast into the sea. The net signifies the eternal gospel preached to the Gentile world by an angel. A net is cast into the sea to gather from every living species, which are brought to the shore and divided into the good and the foul.</p>
<p>Pearl, which also comes from the sea, signifies the regenerated and transformed ones. In contrast, the things brought up from the sea by the net refer to the ones who are not regenerated and transformed. Even the ones that are good are naturally good. The eternal gospel will be a net to bring the whole Gentile world to the presence of the Lord so that He may exercise His judgment upon them based on the contents of this gospel, that is, on whether they treated the least of Christ&rsquo;s brothers well or badly.</p>
<p>In order for some to reign in the millennial kingdom, there must be people there to reign over. All the sheep, the good ones, will be transferred into the millennial kingdom to be the nations, the people, on this earth. The Jews, however, will be the priests in the millennial kingdom helping people to know God (Zech. 8:20-23), and the overcoming believers will be the kings (Rev. 2:26-27; 12:5; 20:4, 6).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FALL OF RELIGIOUS BABYLON</h2>
<p>Revelation 14:8 says, &ldquo;And another angel, a second one, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great, who has made all the nations drink of the wine of the fury of her fornication!&rdquo; Babylon has two aspects, the religious aspect (17:1-18) and the political, material aspect (18:1-24). Verse 8 in chapter fourteen refers to the religious Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church. The wine of the fury of her fornication refers to the teachings, the doctrines, and the heresies of the Roman Catholic Church, which has made almost the entire world drunken. At the beginning of the last three and a half years of this age, Antichrist and the ten kings under him will turn against the Roman Church. That will be the fall, the end of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WARNING AGAINST THE WORSHIP OF ANTICHRIST</h2>
<p>Verses 9 to 12 say, &ldquo;And another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also shall drink of the wine of the fury of God, which is mixed undiluted in the cup of His wrath; and he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb. And the smoke of their tormenting goes up forever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name. Here is the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.&rdquo; The cup of His wrath mentioned in verse 10 will be the seven last plagues, the plagues of the seven bowls, spoken of in chapter sixteen. These plagues will be poured out on Antichrist, his kingdom, and his people.</p>
<p>Verse 12 speaks of two kinds of people. Those who keep the commandments of God are the genuine Jews, and those who keep the faith of Jesus are the New Testament believers. This again proves that during the last three and a half years, during the great tribulation, some New Testament believers and some genuine Jews who fear God and keep His commandments will remain on this earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HARVEST OF THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>Verse 13 says, &ldquo;And I heard a voice out of heaven, saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.&rdquo; Those who die in the Lord are those who are martyred under the persecution of Antichrist.</p>
<p>Verses 14 to 16 continue, &ldquo;And I saw, and behold, there was a white cloud, and on the cloud One like the Son of Man sitting, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand. And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, Send forth Your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come because the harvest of the earth is ripe. And He who sat on the cloud thrust His sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped.&rdquo; In 10:1, the Lord is clothed with a cloud, but at this time He is sitting on the cloud. This indicates that He is now in the air. That this One has a golden crown proves that He is the Lord.</p>
<p>Revelation 14 indicates that the rapture will occur in parts. In the physical type, firstfruits are reaped early, while the general harvest may be reaped a few weeks later. The firstfruits are the fruits which ripen first. Because the rest of the harvest is green, it is left in the field until the earthly waters, the earthly supply, are dried up. Then it will be mature and ready to be reaped. Whereas the overcomers as firstfruits are raptured to the temple of God, the majority of the believers as the harvest are raptured to the air (1 Thes. 4:17), that is, to the barn, which is between the field and the farmhouse.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GATHERING OF THE GRAPES</h2>
<p>Verses 17 to 20 say, &ldquo;And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. And another angel came out of the altar, he who has authority over fire, and he cried with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripened. And the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the fury of God. And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress up to the bridles of the horses for a thousand six hundred stadia.&rdquo; After the firstfruits and the general harvest are reaped, the grapes are gathered into the winepress.</p>
<p>The great winepress of the fury of God in verse 19 is the war at Armageddon (16:12-16). <em>Outside the city</em> in 14:20 means outside of Jerusalem. <em>Armageddon</em> is a Hebrew compound of <em>Har,</em> meaning &ldquo;mountain,&rdquo;and <em>Megiddon,</em> that is, Megiddo (Judg. 5:19; 2 Kings 23:29; Zech. 12:11), northwest of Jerusalem, meaning&ldquo;slaughter&rdquo;;hence, &ldquo;the mountain of slaughter.&rdquo;At the end of the great tribulation all the worldly forces who follow Antichrist will be gathered together to fight against Jerusalem. They will surround Jerusalem with the intention of destroying it, but they will not realize that they are being gathered as grapes for the winepress. The Lord will come back to tread the winepress, destroying a great number of the evil Gentile forces. Their blood will be as deep as the bridles of the horses, and it will flow from Bozrah (Isa. 63:1) to Armageddon, a distance of 182 miles.</p>
<p>According to the order of Revelation 14, the rapture of the firstfruits will take place before the great tribulation. Following this, the eternal gospel will be preached due to the persecution carried out during this period of three and a half years. Antichrist will set up his image for people to worship, and he will persecute the saints who remain on the earth. Therefore, the saints will undergo much suffering. Because of the suffering of the tribulation, the believers will be helped to grow and ripen, just as the green harvest is left in the field under the hot sun to be ripened. When the believers ripen, they will be reaped, that is, raptured. Then the Lord will come back to judge the unbelieving Gentiles who are reckoned as grapes for the winepress. When wheat becomes ripe, the water within the grains is dried up, signifying that for believers to ripen and mature means that all the worldly things within them are dried up. However, when grapes are ripe, they become full of water, signifying that the worldly people will be full of sin and sinful things. As such, they will be ripe and ready to be judged. Then the Lord will collect them and tread them in the winepress of His fury.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>General Sketch of the New Testament in the Light of Christ and the Church, A - Part 4: Revelation &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
