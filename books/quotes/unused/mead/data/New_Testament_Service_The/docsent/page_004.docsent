   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INITIATED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Furthermore, the New Testament service is something completely initiated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Mary did not expect such a thing to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suddenly the angel appeared this is a strong proof that it was not initiated by Mary, but by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If it were something of the old way of religion, there would have been some idea or concept there already, but this was something initiated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, it had nothing to do with the old way of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The New Testament service is something new, something up-to-date, and something as a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It has nothing to do with old things and is not initiated by man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In principle, it is initiated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to learn to apply all these principles to today s service.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even our visiting of others should not be something initiated by us, but something initiated by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It should be a surprise to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not visit others in a natural way; our visiting should be something newly and instantly initiated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>While the people were paying their attention to the priests and the leaders, God went to one little virgin to have a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to learn that the initiative should be of Him and out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the New Testament service.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The recovery of the church life is simply the recovery of the New Testament service.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The principles have been lost, but the Lord is going to recover them in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today many try to learn things in the old way, the traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are schools for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some say that you need to go to these schools to learn how to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God does not care for all the knowledge and all the tradition!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He needs only a little virgin without any experience or knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the first case, the unique case, of New Testament service.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Throughout all the centuries, the Lord has been doing things in the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>May the Lord be merciful to us that we will drop the old traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to learn to be a virgin, even learn to be unlearned.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Pharisees were arguing with the Lord Jesus concerning the matter of divorce, He told them that from the beginning it has not been so Matt 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to go back to the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Simply to go to Moses is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moses allowed divorce, but from the beginning it was not so.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For the New Testament service, we need to come back to the first case of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We think that we need to do something for the Lord, but in the beginning it was not so.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>CONCEIVING CHRIST OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The New Testament service is simply a service of conceiving Christ of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not something of knowledge, letters, regulations, thinking, imaginations, or dreams, but of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The New Testament service is that of conceiving the holy thing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Have you noticed in Luke 1:35 that Christ conceived by Mary is called the holy thing?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The holy thing which is born will be called, Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The New Testament service is the very holy thing conceived of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To serve the Lord in the New Testament is not a matter of having something conceived of Bible knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is the holy thing which is conceived of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Mary was the first one to serve the Lord in the New Testament dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whatever she did and whatever happened to her should be the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In a sense, she was a person who really had nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She was simply a virgin who knew nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suddenly, the power of the Lord came upon her, brooding over her and within her.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the service of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not something conceived of knowledge about certain things, and it is not something conceived of the environment or of circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is something conceived of the Holy Spirit, something which is apparently against nature, culture, and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How much we need to be unloaded and to become as simple as a young virgin!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A virgin like Mary is not strong, experienced, or preoccupied, but so weak, so young, so keen, so fresh, and so open.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We all need to learn to say, I am a bondmaid of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Let it be unto me according to your word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then the Lord will send Gabriel to us with good news, and we will be commissioned to conceive something holy of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Eventually we will bring forth One who is the saving power.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is Jesus, the saving One.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We will bring forth Emmanuel, who is God with us not simply in an individual way, but in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We will bring forth the corporate Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This should be something conceived by the Holy Spirit; it could not be conceived in any other way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is not something initiated by us, but something initiated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>May the Lord be merciful to us that we may become unlearned like Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need to be so young, so fresh, so inexperienced, and so open to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then we will bring forth Jesus as the Savior, the Great One, the King, and the Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our service will bring forth the saving power, the greatness of Christ, the kingship of Christ, and the corporate Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the New Testament service.</S>
