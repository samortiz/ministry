<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. In His Priesthood</H2><P>First, the excellent Christ appeared in His priesthood for taking care of His chosen people (v. 5a). His priesthood is signified by the linen robe. He appeared to Daniel not wearing armor for fighting but dressed in a linen robe, the Old Testament priestly garment. In typology, linen signifies humanity. The fact that Christ is clothed in linen signifies that His humanity is His priestly robe. At the time of Daniel 10, Christ Himself, God's centrality and universality, was a Priest taking care of the children of Israel in captivity. He is a Priest in His humanity taking care of God's captive people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. In His Kingship</H2><P>Second, Christ appeared to Daniel in His kingship (signified by the golden girdle) for ruling over all the peoples. Verse 5b says that His "loins were girded with the fine gold of Uphaz." A girdle is for strengthening. Christ's kingship is signified not by linen but by gold. His priesthood is human, whereas His kingship is divine.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. In His Preciousness and Dignity</H2><P>Furthermore, for His people's appreciation Christ appeared also in His preciousness and dignity as signified by His body being like beryl (v. 6a). The Hebrew word for beryl here is not easily translated. Darby uses the term chrysolite. The Hebrew word could refer to a bluish-green or yellow precious stone. This signifies that Christ in His embodiment is divine (yellow), full of life (green), and heavenly (blue).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. In His Brightness</H2><P>Furthermore, Christ appeared in His brightness for shining over the people. His brightness is signified by His face being like the appearance of lightning (v. 6b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. In His Enlightening Sight</H2><P>Christ's enlightening sight for searching and judging is signified by His eyes being like torches of fire (v. 6c).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. In His Gleam in His Work and Moves</H2><P>Christ also appeared in His gleam in His work and moves, tested by people and testing people. His gleam in His work and moves is signified by His arms and His feet being like the gleam of polished bronze (v. 6d). In typology, bronze signifies God's judgment, which makes people bright. God's judgment is a kind of trial. Christ was judged, tried, by God, and God's trial and judgment made Him bright like polished bronze. Such a Christ is the One who has been tested by others and who also tests others.</P>
