 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>

<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE OF BUILDING<br />
BEING FULFILLED THROUGH HIS PROCESS AND OUR TRANSFORMATION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL PURPOSE</h2>
<p>God has an eternal purpose. Ephesians 3:11 says, &ldquo;According to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; In brief, God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is the purpose that God made in eternity past to work Himself into a group of human beings to be their life, nature, and everything. In this way He will produce a Body to contain and express Himself (1:22-23). This Body ultimately will be the holy city, New Jerusalem, the wife of the Lamb (Rev. 21:2; 19:7). God in Christ will be the center, the hub, of this corporate entity (21:22-23; 22:1).</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Eternal Purpose<br />
Being Revealed in a Mysterious Way</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is revealed in the Bible in a detailed yet mysterious way. The revelation of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose in the Bible may be compared to the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. It takes much time to put all the pieces of a puzzle into the proper place to form a complete picture. It has taken centuries for many saints to finish the job of putting together all the pieces of the puzzle of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose in a proper way. We should be grateful that we were born in the twentieth century and not in the second century. If we had been born in the second century, we would not be able to see a clear picture of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Through the past centuries many great teachers have found various parts of the puzzle and have placed them properly one by one. At a certain point Martin Luther picked up a piece of the puzzle and put it in the proper place. Today in the twentieth century the last piece of the puzzle has been correctly placed. Now we can see a complete picture.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Standing on the Shoulders<br />
of Many Great Teachers to See<br />
the Complete Picture of God&rsquo;s Eternal Purpose</h2>
<p>We are not boasting that we have seen the picture of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, for we are standing on others&rsquo; shoulders to see this vision. We thank God for those who have gone before us. Many great teachers are our support. We are standing on the shoulders of John Nelson Darby, Darby stood on the shoulders of Count von Zinzendorf, and Zinzendorf stood on the shoulders of Martin Luther. We have gone higher, not by ourselves but by standing on all the foregoing great teachers. The divine book has never been as open and clear to the church as it is today. Even twenty years ago the Bible was not as clear to us as it is today. It took us more than forty years to properly place some of the pieces of the puzzle. It is because of the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace that today we are able to see and speak of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, which is to work Himself into all of His chosen people as their life, nature, and everything that they may be fully saturated by and with God Himself. This purpose can be seen in Ephesians 3:17, which says, &ldquo;That Christ may make His home in your hearts.&rdquo; Christ making His home in our hearts is the experience of God working Himself into us to fulfill His eternal purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT COMING TO THE BIBLE <br />
FOR DOCTRINAL KNOWLEDGE</h2>
<p>The Bible is a volume of sixty-six books; it has thousands of chapters and pages and contains many doctrines. The Bible has been used by all kinds of people. The kind of Bible we have depends on the kind of person we are. Everyone seemingly has a different Bible. The words in our Bibles are the same, but our understanding and application of the Bible vary greatly. If we use our mind to come to the Bible in a doctrinal way, we will have much to argue about. We each have our own concepts, and we each know how to use certain verses to support our concepts. However, we should not use the Bible to find support for our personal causes. The Bible was not given by God to be used in this way.</p>
