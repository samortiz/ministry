   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE STORMY WIND From the North</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first part of Ezekiel 1:4 says, I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John Nelson Darby s New Translation and the American Standard Version both translate the Hebrew word rendered whirlwind as stormy wind, and I feel that this translation is preferable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, this verse is saying that a stormy wind came from the north.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why did the stormy wind come from the north and not from the south, the east, or the west?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The answer to this question is found in Psalm 75:6-7a: For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But God is the judge.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here north is replaced with God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that God is at the north.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In geographical terms the north is commonly regarded as up, and thus to go north is to go up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God, who is at the north, is always up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Spiritually speaking, this means that when we are going north, we are going to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fact that the stormy wind came from the north means that it came from God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The dwelling place, the habitation, of God is the source of all spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The stormy wind came from the north, from the habitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God, therefore, was the source of the stormy wind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Signifying the Spirit of God</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Hebrew word for wind is ruach.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ruach may be translated wind or breath or spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the King James Version of Ezekiel 37, this Hebrew word is translated in all three of these ways: wind in verse 9, breath in verses 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10, and Spirit in verses 1 and 14.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is difficult for translators to decide whether in a certain verse ruach means wind, breath, or spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The decision must be made according to the context.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 1:4 ruach denotes a wind, a stormy wind which signifies nothing less than the powerful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the day of Pentecost there was a rushing, mighty wind which filled the house where the one hundred twenty were sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then all of them were filled with the Holy Spirit Acts 2:2, 4a .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No doubt, that rushing, mighty wind was the powerful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In John 3:8 the Lord Jesus said, The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some versions point out in a footnote that the word wind in this verse is a translation of the Greek word for spirit, pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Hebrew word ruach and the Greek word pneuma have exactly the same meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Like ruach, the word pneuma can be translated wind, breath, or spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, in this verse the Greek words translated the wind blows may also be rendered the Spirit blows.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Ezekiel 1:4 the strong, stormy wind is a figure, a picture, of the mighty Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Bible the wind has both a negative and positive significance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In its negative significance the wind is a symbol, or sign, of God s judgment upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the significance of the wind in Daniel 7:2 and in Revelation 7:1.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In its positive significance the wind is a symbol, or sign, of the blowing of the Holy Spirit upon man or the descending of the Holy Spirit upon man to take care of man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This, of course, is the significance of the rushing, mighty wind in Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the book of Ezekiel the wind also has this twofold significance: the negative significance God s judgment by raising up circumstances through which He judges those who rebel against Him; the positive significance in the Spirit s coming to man to cause man to have God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The stormy wind in Ezekiel 1 has this positive significance.</S>
