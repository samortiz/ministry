<p>I absolutely believe that from that time on, their criticizing mouths were sealed. We would have given them everything, and all that we asked for in return was the oneness. In the end, however, they still said that although it was good, they would rather meet in their own meetings. During this time, a brother from among them opened his mouth and said, “When you speak of fallen Christianity, you always denounce others for being fallen.” I immediately answered, “Brother, if today’s Christianity is not fallen, then what is fallen? Fallen Christianity refers not only to others but also to us. If we are fallen, then we too are fallen Christianity. Today it is not a matter of denouncing or not denouncing. The question today is whether or not we are standing on a fallen ground.” I am telling you this to testify to you that the concept in today’s fallen Christianity is that the church today is not able to come up to the standard. They think it is impossible.<p>I can also tell you that when I go to Europe or America, I frequently meet Christians with whom I sit down and fellowship. When we speak of the truth and reach a conclusion, they cannot deny that this is the truth. But they say, “Even though this is the truth, there is no way to practice it today, so we can only wait for that day.” Sometimes I have asked them, “When will that day be?” They are unable to say when that day will be. I have said, “After the church age is over, it will be the kingdom age, and we will not be able to practice the church in the kingdom age. After the kingdom age is over, it will be the New Jerusalem, and in the New Jerusalem we will not need to practice the church. So when exactly will the day be when we will have the practice of the church?” They were unable to answer me and could only say, “It is true that the Bible says so, but it is impossible today.”<p>I would like to ask you, brothers and sisters, do you believe that it is possible today, or do you believe that it is impossible? I have already said that I am the first to say that according to the natural concept it is impossible; according to the Lord’s Word, however, I am the first to believe that it is possible. Previously in America I could not say that the situation was possible, but I can testify that today for the most part it is possible, and this possibility is being manifested. Yet there are some opposers who criticize, saying, “Why do you listen only to that one man? You receive anything Brother Lee says, and you feel that anything not spoken by Brother Lee has a problem. How can all of you be so foolish as to follow that little Chinaman?” You can see how pitiful today’s Christianity truly is. When I first went to America, I told those criticizing brothers about this testimony, and they said it was impossible. After more than ten years, the possibility is being manifested, but they are still unwilling to give in. Furthermore, they begin to criticize and condemn us by saying that the people in the Lord’s recovery are foolish to follow a man. Sometimes when I hear what the opposers say, it makes me want to laugh. I tell them, “Why don’t you be this way? It won’t hurt you to try!” Some said, “I cannot do it.” Then I said, “We thank and praise the Lord that there are some who can.” Brothers and sisters, do you think this is something done by man? No, this is not man’s doing.<p>At this time I have a burden and hope that you all will see the vision that all the churches on the entire earth will be the one new man; this is definitely possible. Our Lord never speaks anything in vain; He will certainly do everything according to what He has spoken, and whatever He has spoken will come to pass. He has said that there will be one new man, so there will be one new man. It was not accomplished in the last century, nor has it been accomplished in this century, but there will be a century in which it will come to pass. It was not done yesterday, and maybe will not be done today, but it will definitely happen tomorrow. Do not forget that He is the Lord. His word will never return void. Men, Satan, and all the demons can only prolong the time, but they cannot make His word void. The Lord said that the church is the new man, so the church eventually has to be the new man.<p>In America there are several thousand brothers and sisters. If the devil comes and says, “You Christians are not one!”, I certainly have the assurance that these few thousand brothers and sisters in America would all stand up to say, “We are one! We are not merely one assembly, one household, and one Body; we are also one man!” Brothers and sisters, can you now all say together, “We are one new man”? You can! Yes, we are one new man.
