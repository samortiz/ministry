   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>About to Begin the Work at Nu River,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Yunnan Province</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Two weeks ago, Brother Hu came to Wei-Si and has now returned to Yeh-Ji.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After he finishes his preparations, he will come to Wei-Si again, and I will set out with him to Nu River for the work there.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We will probably leave on the twenty-sixth or twenty-seventh of this month.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The way to Sikang is still very rugged.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We heard that the two brothers from Norway are still in Yien-Jing County because of the inaccessibility of the roads.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Due to the fact that the way to Sikang is still not clear and the door to the work among the Yi tribes in Nu River has now opened up, we decided to go to Nu River and work there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Last year Brother Hu and I worked for only a month there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the places we went to now have two groups of people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One group just goes along with what we say, while the other group has truly heard the Lord's truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They have accepted it and are practicing it according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the Lord's doing!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some time ago some men came from Nu River and asked Brother Hu and me to go and do some work among them again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are going to places we have not been before and will be away for two months before returning to Wei-Si.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord willing, we will probably be able to sustain ourselves for two to three months.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After we return we will look to the Lord's leading for the next journey.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Please pray much for us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brother David Ho will travel with us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May the Lord lead us in His path according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Give our greetings to Brother Nee if he has returned to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Greetings to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>June 24</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Recent News of the Work in Kulangsu One</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I arrived safely in Kulangsu on the morning of the twentieth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After praying in one accord with the brothers and sisters, we all felt the need to preach the gospel here.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have decided to have gospel meetings every evening from the twenty-fourth to the twenty-ninth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the same time, we will have a prayer meeting every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was unusual for the Lord to lead me to leave Shanghai just when Brother Nee returned.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is even more surprising that I have a burden for working outside Shanghai at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Perhaps the Lord is teaching me the lesson of dropping everything and trusting in Himself alone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Indeed, what else can we trust?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can only lift our eyes to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Tang Shou-ling, July 24</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thank the Lord for leading His servant, Mr. Tang, to arrive safely in Kulangsu on July 20.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although he suffered sea-sickness on the boat, he is still healthy for the most part.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We preached the gospel to the outsiders from the twenty-fourth to the twenty-ninth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>About five to six hundred came and listened.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Over one hundred raised their hands to indicate their willingness to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Glory to His name!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From July 31 to August 5 there will be five days of edification meetings for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>May the Lord accomplish His will through the ones He uses.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The meeting hall has become inadequate for our use.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After more than a year's consideration and prayer, it seems that there is no other way except to build something ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Recently, we purchased a piece of land.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord willing, we will begin to build.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Wan-ching</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>August 1</S>
