IN OUR LEADING</h2>
<p>According to our experience, we must impart spiritual content into our young people. This spiritual content must be related to spiritual knowledge on one hand and to spiritual life on the other hand. These two aspects are indispensable in leading the young people. We should not lean too much toward knowledge or too much toward life; we must be balanced. Those who serve the Lord know that according to God&rsquo;s law in the universe, everything is balanced. The more we touch the Lord&rsquo;s service, the more we realize that something is effective only when it is balanced. For example, God created man with two hands and two feet. There are countless other examples of balance in the universe. For instance, in a family there is a husband and a wife, and in society there are men and women; this brings balance to human situations.</p>
<p>In our work and in the administration of the church, we should keep the principle of being balanced. In the Old Testament God used the kingship and the priesthood to rule over His people. The priesthood balanced the kingship, and fellowship balanced authority. Today we should lead the children of God in the same way. I treasure very much what the apostles said in Acts 6:4: &ldquo;We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.&rdquo; The apostles did not just give messages to care for the ministry of the word; they also continued steadfastly in prayer. Their service was balanced.</p>
<p>In our service with the young brothers and sisters, we should keep the principle of being balanced; we must instruct them in matters related to spiritual knowledge and to spiritual life. We should not focus on knowledge and then on life; rather, we should give the young people knowledge and life in a way that these aspects interact with each other, being both a cause and an effect, and balance each other. The content of what we give them should be absolutely spiritual; however, in teaching, we should adopt the way of instruction. Our time of leading the young people should be educational with two-thirds of the time being like a teaching meeting of the church. Our teaching and speaking depend on the Spirit, but when we teach and speak, our words must be logical and follow a line of thought. Both logic and a line of thought are needed in order to touch a person&rsquo;s rational mind; hence, our teaching must be educational. Nevertheless, our way of teaching should not be exactly like a worldly education, because worldly education has knowledge but no life. The messages we speak have a spiritual content, but this spiritual content must be imparted through material that is educational.</p>
<p>When we give a message, we must touch the parts of a person&rsquo;s soul, because people are moved and inspired through the soul. If we cannot speak a message in a clear way to a person&rsquo;s mind, he will not be touched. If we give a confusing message, we should not expect people to be touched in their spirit. Hence, when we give a message, we must enable people to understand in their minds even though we use our spirit. A good message will open a person&rsquo;s mind and enable him to understand, because the spoken word has been mingled with the spirit. A message should not only make a person clear in his mind but also touch his spirit through his mind because the word has been released from the spirit.</p>
<p>In order to give a good message, the speaker must have a sharp and clear mind. He should have a definite idea concerning the line of thought, the main points, and the word that should be spoken first. Then when he speaks, his words will enlighten people&rsquo;s thoughts and minds. A good message should also have the Spirit, because the Spirit imparts spiritual content through the speaking that is related to the line of thought. When a speaker speaks, his words should follow a line of thought to open people&rsquo;s mind so that they may understand. At the same time, the Spirit will touch the spirit of the hearers through these words, causing them to have a response in their spirit.</p>
<p>When we lead the saints to study the Bible or a spiritual topic, we must have an educational focus. We need to realize that the young people are currently receiving an education; therefore, they have a predisposition to receive instructions. The schools they attend, from elementary schools to college universities, are all educational in nature. If our speaking in the young people&rsquo;s meeting does not fit with their educational experience or is not educational in nature, they will feel that the content is outdated. Hence, we should not ignore their educational disposition when we seek to impart spiritual knowledge and life into them. We can compare this situation to moving forward on railroad tracks that have been laid. We need to move forward on the tracks; we do not need to find another way.</p>
<p>Young people receive an education in a progressive way. Consequently, they should not come to a meeting merely to listen to a message on randomly chosen topics. Rather, they should go through a definite learning process. For example, young people attend junior high school for three years, high school for three years, and college for four years; there is a continual and definite progression in their learning. Similarly, our leading should progress over the course of several years, and we should speak to them in ways that correspond to their academic level. It would be ideal if we could teach them progressively and enable them to reach new levels of understanding each year. When a young person graduates from junior high school, he should also be led from a &ldquo;junior high&rdquo; understanding of matters related to spiritual knowledge and spiritual life to a &ldquo;high school&rdquo; level. He should similarly progress from a &ldquo;high school&rdquo; level to a &ldquo;college&rdquo; level when he graduates from high school.</p>
<p>Many of the families in the church in Taipei have children who are in the sixth grade. When these children begin junior high school, we should have a course of spiritual education for them. When they begin high school, we should have another set of spiritual material for them, and when they are in college, they should receive four years of advanced spiritual education. If our young saints receive a spiritual education in this way, we will see great results in ten years. This is not too difficult.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
