   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Accusing the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 12:10</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Satan pays much attention to our every move.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is always looking for an opportunity to accuse us and to draw us into his punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, we should overcome him "because of the blood of the Lamb" Rev 12:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin" 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The blood of Jesus is still cleansing us today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord's blood is our ransom; even if Satan accuses us, what effect can it have?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, if believers have sinned accidentally and have already asked that the Lord's blood cleanse them afresh, they should no longer condemn themselves for this sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Otherwise, they will inevitably be taken advantage of by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Corrupting Their Faith</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2 Corinthians 11:3</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should be pure and chaste toward Christ, as a virgin is toward her fianc .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The devil tries to defile men, causing them to become unfaithful to Christ and to fall into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we can overcome him with 1 John 2:14: "The word of God abides in you and you have overcome the evil one."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's word is the sword of the Holy Spirit Eph 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we counter Satan's deceptions with the sword of the Holy Spirit, he will be wounded.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Lord Jesus was tempted, He overcame Satan with the words of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this reason, we should always keep the word of God richly in our hearts, so that we can overcome the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then whenever a temptation or attack comes, we can immediately remember the appropriate Scriptures, and if we exercise full faith to believe that the Scriptures must be fulfilled, the enemy will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the meaning of overcoming the enemy by the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Transfiguring Himself</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>into an Angel of Light</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>2 Corinthians 11:14</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If Satan were to unveil his evil form before the watchful believers, they would know for sure that this was Satan and would not follow him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For this reason, to deceive the believers, Satan has to transfigure himself into an angel of light so that they will unknowingly fall into a way of deception.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He feigns God's voice and the Holy Spirit's leading, causing the believers who are zealous for the Lord's will to think that these are the Lord's leading and to hasten to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He also feigns many truths, making them to appear true and leading men to accept them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This point seems to be the hardest for one to prevail against, but the Scripture says, "Prove the spirits...You are of God, little children; and you have overcome them because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world" 1 John 4:1, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we trust in the Holy Spirit within us, we can overcome the false spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we cannot decide whether or not a leading is from God, we should first take a neutral attitude and pray, "O God, whatever is of You I will keep.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whatever is of Satan I will reject.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Please reveal to me the source of this leading."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we will do this, surely the Lord will show us clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we do this all the time, we will have a strong and healthy spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Trying His Best to Persecute</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Revelation 2:10</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The devil's deceptions are exhaustless.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He uses all kinds of ways to hinder the believers from advancing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, when he finds that he can no longer prevent the saints from advancing spiritually, he will put them into prison, persecute them, and stop their work, hoping to make them fall.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All those who love and pity themselves are no match for Satan; the minute he coerces them with a life-threatening persecution, they will stop resisting him!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the Lord's faithful ones have long put their own life aside.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, although there may be chains and tribulations, although they may be brought to the verge of death and even to death itself, "they love not their soul-life even unto death" Rev 12:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the end, they overcome Satan!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"This is the victory which has overcome the world our faith" 1 John 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How then can chains shake our heart!</S>
