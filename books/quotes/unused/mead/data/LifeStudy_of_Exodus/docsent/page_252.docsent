   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE SEVENTY-FIVE THE ANGEL OF JEHOVAH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR HIS PEOPLE TO TAKE POSSESSION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE PROMISED LAND 3 Scripture Reading: Exo 23:20-33</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the foregoing message we considered from God s side how to take possession of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we shall consider the matter from our side.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>C. By Cooperating with God in the Destruction</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>of the Pagan Tribes 1.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Source of Sin against Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to take possession of the promised land, God s people must cooperate with Him in destroying the pagan tribes 23:31-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Exodus 23:33 says, They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is a fact of history that the pagan tribes were the source of Israel s sin in the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Israel lived in the promised land, their sins came from the source of the pagan tribes that were still in the land.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that the natural life is the source of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our sins come from our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether our sins are gross or somewhat refined and cultured, they have their source in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some people are refined and polite even in the way they lose their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes a husband may be very cultured and refined in the way he offends his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such culture and refinement are actually a mask.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Wearing this kind of mask, people often lie by speaking the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even sins that appear to be rather refined come from the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the sight of God, all those who live according to the natural life are sinning continually, even when they give alms or donate to charity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the source of sin among God s people, the natural life frustrates them from possessing Christ as the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because the natural life keeps us from possessing Christ and enjoying Him, we must hate it and, as we grow, be willing to drive it out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we have pointed out, without growth in Christ it is not possible for us to drive out the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Making No Covenant with Them</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The children of Israel were forbidden to make any covenant with the pagan tribes v. 32 . Today we should not make any covenants with the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To make a covenant with the natural life is to compromise with it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because it is not easy to eliminate the natural life, we may be tempted to compromise with it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To compromise in this way is to tolerate some aspect of the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But we should not tolerate the natural life in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whether or not we are able to drive out the natural life, we still must hate it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead of agreeing with any aspect of your natural life, hate it and do what you can to drive it out.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Of course, without growth, your attempts to drive out the natural life will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more you grow, the more you will be able to drive it out.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we take the initiative to drive out the natural life, God will come in to honor us and strengthen us in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This principle is found in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yes, Romans 8:11 indicates that God will give life to our mortal bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But this depends on whether or not we take the initiative to put to death the practices of our body Rom 8:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we take the initiative to do this, God will honor this by giving life to our mortal bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God is ready to give us life, but we must be willing to kill the practices of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are not willing to do this, not willing to cooperate with God, God has no way to impart life to our mortal bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to Romans 8, we should also take the initiative to walk according to spirit v. 4 , to mind the things of the spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>5-6 , and to be led by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 14 says, For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This verse does not speak of the leading of the Spirit, but of our being led by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Spirit is willing to lead us, but we must be willing to be led by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are not willing to be led, there is no way for the Spirit to lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, it is first our responsibility to be led; then it is the responsibility of the Spirit to lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even in this matter, we must take the initiative.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to Romans 8:15, we should also take the initiative in crying Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This verse says that we have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A verse parallel to this, Galatians 4:6, says that it is the Spirit who cries Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Who is it, then, who cries out, we or the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The answer is that both we and the Spirit cry together.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although the Spirit is ready to cry, we must take the initiative.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He cries when we cry.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But if we do not cry, He will not cry either.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Romans 8:16 says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This verse indicates that we must be the first to witness, then the Spirit will witness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are not told that our spirit witnesses with the Spirit, but that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When our spirit testifies, the Spirit honors our testifying and testifies with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Romans 8:23 speaks of our groaning, and verse 26, of the Spirit interceding for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we groan, the Spirit intercedes.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Actually, He intercedes in our groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we do not groan, the interceding Spirit has no way to work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, we need to groan, the more the better.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By taking the initiative to groan, we give the Spirit an opportunity to intercede on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>According to Romans 8, God gives life and the Spirit leads, witnesses, and intercedes.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, these four activities depend on our taking the initiative.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we put to death the practices of the body, God gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we are willing to be led, the Spirit leads.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we cry Abba, Father, the Spirit cries.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When we witness, the Spirit witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Furthermore, when we groan, the Spirit intercedes.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the same principle, when we drive out the pagan tribes, the natural life, God also drives out these tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hence, we and God together drive out the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Nevertheless, we must again emphasize the fact that we must take the initiative.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is easy for God to drive out the tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He is always ready to do this, but we usually are not ready.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Instead, we may make a covenant with them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In such a situation, God has no way to drive them out.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Therefore, it is crucial for us to take the initiative to drive out the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Catholicism teaches that we must work for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>At the time of the Reformation, Luther fought against this teaching and declared that salvation is by grace, not by works.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We are justified through faith, not through works.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>After the Reformation two schools of theology came into being: the Calvinist school, which emphasizes God s sovereign mercy and grace, and the Arminian school, which claims that a person can lose his salvation and that good works are necessary to keep one from losing his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Although the Calvinist teaching is far more accurate than the Arminian, it is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>According to the Bible, everything is by God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Nevertheless, man must cooperate with God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This cooperation can be illustrated by a mother feeding her child.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>No matter how much the mother loves the child and how carefully she prepares nourishing food for him, she cannot eat for him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The child must take the initiative to eat the food prepared by his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In the same principle, we must take the initiative to cooperate with God s working.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This was the reason on the day of Pentecost Peter commanded the people to repent and be saved Acts 2:37-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>God cannot repent for us or believe for us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We ourselves must repent and believe.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>To be sure, we cannot save ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>God has done everything necessary to save us, but we must still repent and believe.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We cannot save ourselves, but we can, in Peter s words, be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The Savior is at hand, ready to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>But we must be willing to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>In this matter we take the initiative.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This is a basic principle in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This principle is also illustrated in Philippians 2:12 and 13: Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Our working out of our own salvation is related to God s operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We take the initiative to receive God s operation.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When we receive it, we work out our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Then the more we work out our salvation, the more God operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In this way we have a practical salvation for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Taking the initiative to drive out the pagan tribes, the natural life, depends on our growth in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>God promised the children of Israel that He would drive out the pagan tribes from before them.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>But the children of Israel had to take the initiative to drive them out.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>However, this was dependent on their growth, their increase.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The more they grew, the more they could take the initiative to drive out the tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Likewise, the more we grow in life, the more we shall take the initiative to drive out the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We need to grow and be replaced by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>As we are growing, we shall take the initiative to deal with our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>God will honor this by coming in also to deal with the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This is the proper way to drive out the frustraters that we may take possession of Christ, enjoy Him, and gain Him in an experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Do not think that driving out the natural life and possessing Christ depend on a sudden inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>In this matter, we should not wait for the Lord, because the Lord is actually waiting for us.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>In particular, He is waiting for our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Are you ready to cooperate with Him to drive out the natural life?</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>If so, take the initiative and God will honor you.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Our Christ is with us not as a doctrine, but as a living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Furthermore, God has promised to work on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>However, we must grow and be replaced by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>We must have the increase of Christ within us so that we can be replaced by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>For this, we need to cooperate with God.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We have already pointed out how Philippians 2:12 and 13 illustrate this cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>On the one hand, God is operating in us; on the other hand, we must work out our own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>In this matter we and God are partners.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Prayer and mere waiting on the Lord are not the way for this to be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>That is the religious way, not the biblical way.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>According to the biblical way, Christ is with us and God has promised to work for us.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>But we must grow to have the increase of Christ and be replaced by Him so that we may take the initiative to drive out the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>We know from our experience that when we take the initiative in this way, God comes in to honor us and to join us in driving out the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Thus, the teaching of the New Testament and our spiritual experience agree with the type portrayed in Exodus 23.</S>
