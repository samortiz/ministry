   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE SPIRIT BECOMING THE SEVEN SPIRITS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE EXECUTION OF GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Holy Spirit in Revelation is no longer the one Spirit in the Epistles but the sevenfold, intensified Spirit, because the world today is corrupted, and the church is degraded, full of darkness and confusion; even the eyes of man s heart are blinded and cannot see clearly the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is similar to a person not being able to see clearly under one lamp, and who needs, instead, the shining of seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why the one Spirit in the Epistles has been intensified to become the seven Spirits in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This sevenfold, intensified Spirit is the shining of the seven lamps of fire, enabling us to see the church clearly according to God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Item number one of the outline says that the pneumatic Christ in the Epistles is the redeeming Lamb in Revelation, who has become the Executor of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The pneumatic Christ in the Epistles is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Revelation, He has become the redeeming Lamb of God to execute God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Item number two of the outline says that the all-inclusive, compound Spirit in the Epistles has become the seven Spirits before God s throne in Revelation, the center of the divine Trinity, proceeding out from the eternal One and of the redeeming One.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Based on what do we say this?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is based on the fact that the seven Spirits are the seven lamps of fire before the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are also the one river that proceeds from the throne of God, the eternal One.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The seven eyes of the Lamb are surely of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, the seven Spirits which are the seven eyes of the Lamb are surely of the Lamb, who is the redeeming One.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, on the one hand, the seven Spirits are out from the eternal One, and on the other hand, they are of the redeeming One.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE SEVEN LAMPS BEING FOR GOD S MOVE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>AND THE SEVEN EYES BEING</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>FOR SEARCHING AND TRANSFUSING THE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Item number three says that these seven Spirits are the seven lamps of fire before God s throne for the execution of God s economy in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the midst of the universe, there is the throne of God in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before the throne of God, there are seven lamps of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These seven lamps are for God s move.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is similar to driving at night; when the car is about to move, the two headlights are turned on.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once the lights of the car are switched on, the driver will be able to move clearly in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The seven lamps of fire shining before the throne of God are an indication that God is executing His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Item number three continues to say that these seven lamps of fire are the seven eyes of the slain Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The seven lamps are for God s move in the execution of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The seven eyes are for searching and transfusing the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The seven lamps of fire are sent forth into all the earth for the execution of God s economy in the universe, and the seven eyes are on the face of the Lamb, Christ, who is the High Priest, for the searching of the churches condition.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, the seven eyes are there to search out the condition of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the other hand, they are there to supply the need of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Similarly, when I speak to you, not only is my mouth speaking, but my eyes also are there transfusing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Through my eyes I transfuse what is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The seven eyes of Christ are for searching and transfusing the churches, while the seven lamps before the throne are for the executing of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But then, the seven lamps before the throne are the seven eyes on the face of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is indeed a mystery!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Revelation, on the one hand, Christ is the One executing God s economy, and on the other hand, He is the One that searches and transfuses the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Item number four says that the redeeming Lamb, as the High Priest in the holy place, with the seven eyes which are the Spirits of the seven lamps of fire of God, walks among the churches which are the seven golden lampstands, to search and to transfuse all the churches, that they would become His testimony, the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is shown in Revelation 1.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this chapter, you can see the seven lampstands and one High Priest walking in the their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His eyes are as a flame of fire searching the churches and, at the same time, supplying all the churches needs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>SPEAKING TO THE CHURCHES TO PURIFY THEM</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>AND TO CALL FORTH THE OVERCOMERS</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Item number five says that this One, who is the all-inclusive Head who walks in the midst of the churches to search and to transfuse them, is the Spirit that speaks to the churches, purifying the churches and calling forth the overcomers to enjoy Him, that they would overcome the deformed churches to bring in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This refers to the seven epistles to the seven local churches in Revelation 2 3.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Each of these seven epistles opens with the words that these epistles are spoken to the churches by the One who is the Lord Christ, the Head, the One walking in the midst of the churches, and the Christ who holds the seven stars.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But at the end of every epistle, it says that these words are spoken by the Spirit to the churches and he who has an ear, let him hear.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This proves that the Spirit and Christ are one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The totality of all the words in the seven epistles is for the purifying of the churches and for the calling forth of the overcomers to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Spirit says to the church in Ephesus that to him who overcomes will be given to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God Rev 2:7 ; to the church in Pergamos, to him who overcomes, will be given of the hidden manna Rev 2:17 ; to the church in Laodicea, to him who overcomes, He says, I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me Rev 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To eat of the tree of life, to partake of the hidden manna, and to dine with the Lord are all matters of enjoying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All three kinds of enjoyment are typified in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The first kind is the tree of life recorded in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The second kind is the manna recorded in Exodus 16.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The third kind is the produce of the good land as the feast for all to dine, as recorded in Deuteronomy 8.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, in His promise to the overcomers, He has included the three highest enjoyments of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The tree of life, the hidden manna, and the feast in the good land are all types of the rich enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only by these can we overcome today s deformed church and bring in the kingdom of God.</S>
