   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The inscribing Spirit writes Christ into us to make us the living letters of Christ 2 Cor 3:3: Christ is being inscribed into us with the spiritual ink, the Spirit of the living God; if we are under the Spirit s inscribing, we have the deep sensation of being living within.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit is the ink, and the content of the ink is Christ with His person, work, and attainments; the compound Spirit as the compound ink adds the substance of Christ into us and saturates us with the essence of Christ.</S>
