   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>That Man May Be One with God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God created man with the desire that one day He would enter into man.</S>

   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today we have God in us.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As God who became a man, He has divinity, and He also has humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is one person with divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is both divine and human; He is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the complete God plus the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the God-man.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The life of God is in the incarnated Word John 1:1-4a; 14:6a , and this incarnated Word came to bring God's life to man abundantly 10:10b .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, He died as a grain of wheat to release the divine life 12:24 , and He became the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17-18 .</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The God-man Jesus is the fulfillment of God's good pleasure and promise.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, this God-man was alone, by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's desire is that this God-man would enter into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God created man, including us, and He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But now He wants to enter into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After being born to be a God-man, He lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, traveling back and forth, from Bethlehem to Nazareth and from Nazareth to Jerusalem.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In His resurrection He included us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we were resurrected with Him, we all were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We were resurrected before we were born.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the time of our resurrection with Christ, we all received His divine and resurrected life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God Acts 13:33 , and we were born with Him to be the many sons of God Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was in this way that He entered into His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After entering into His believers to be their life, He ascended Acts 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From the heavens He poured Himself out as the consummated, compounded, all-inclusive Spirit upon His disciples 2:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through this the church was established and began to carry out His commission to disciple all the nations Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, the church reached even China, where I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At first when I heard the gospel I did not like it, and I would not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I did not like this "foreign religion."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But gradually, I believed, even against my wishes and against my will.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After I believed, I began to be bothered, because something entered into me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This I cannot deny.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This made me happy and even made me a different person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today I am not merely a man; I am a God-filled man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am a man who has God in him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today I am living God, expressing God, and magnifying God.</S>
