<h2 class="head1">THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLE OF THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Meeting with the Believers</h2>
<p>Now we want to see the governing principle of the church meetings. The number one principle is that Christ meets with the believers. If we do not have Christ meeting with us, this is not a real Christian meeting. To have a real Christian meeting, we must have Christ meeting with us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Reality of Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection&mdash;<br />
In the Spirit and Life of the Resurrected Christ</h2>
<p>We must also have our meetings in the reality of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;in the Spirit and life of the resurrected Christ. We must have our meeting in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. The very resurrected Christ must be the Spirit and life in our meeting. This is a deeply subjective matter; it is not a doctrine. We need to come together in the Spirit of the resurrected Christ and in the life of the resurrected Christ.</p>
<p>We may feel that this matter is hard to understand. The best way to know this matter is to realize the following principle: as long as we pray or speak in our natural life, in ourselves, we are neither in the Spirit nor in the life of the resurrected Christ. It may be hard for us to know when we are in the Spirit, but it is easy for us to realize when we are not in the Spirit. If a person were to stand up in a meeting and tell the brothers and sisters that he did not like them, he surely would not be speaking in the Spirit and life of the resurrected Christ but in his natural hatred. When we realize that we are not speaking in the Spirit and life of Christ, we have to drop this kind of speaking.</p>
<p>Perhaps the same person mentioned above could say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Naturally speaking, I could not love you all. But today in Christ I love you and I love all the brothers.&rdquo; This kind of speaking comes from the source of the Spirit and life of the resurrected Christ. It is easy to realize when we are speaking in ourselves, in the natural life, and in the flesh. When we realize this, we know that we are not in the Spirit and life of Christ. We have to change our way of speaking until we have the assurance that we are not speaking according to our natural life. If we are not speaking by our natural life, then undoubtedly we are speaking by the Spirit and life of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Make God&rsquo;s Economy in His Fatherhood<br />
Known to the Believers<br />
for the Praise of the Father</h2>
<p>The Christian meetings are to make God&rsquo;s economy in His fatherhood known to the believers for the praise of the Father. God&rsquo;s economy is God&rsquo;s plan, God&rsquo;s arrangement, His desire to carry out what He loves. This economy is in the fatherhood. When I use the word <em>fatherhood,</em> I mean the very Being of the Father with all His intentions, desires, purposes, and wishes. As an illustration, we can say that there is a fatherhood with a father who has seven children. This fatherhood denotes his being as a father. It also denotes whatever is involved in his being a father and implies all his wishes for his children, including his desires, his intentions, his purposes, and his goal that he could accomplish for all his children. Likewise, the divine fatherhood is the Father&rsquo;s Being and implies all of His intentions, purposes, desires, and will to accomplish something for His children. The Son declaring the Father&rsquo;s name implies that the Son tells His brothers not only that the Father is the begetting Source but also that this begetting Source has many intentions, purposes, wishes, and desires to accomplish many things for His sons.</p>
<p>The fatherhood includes all that our Father God has done, is doing, and will do for us. The New Testament tells us that this begetting Father first selected us according to His plan, His economy (Eph. 1:4). Before the foundation of the world, He chose us, and then He marked us out, predestinated us (1:5). In time He came to call us, to grasp us, to gain us, while we were busy in worldly affairs or involved in sinful things. Perhaps we wanted to enjoy ourselves where we were and put off believing in the Lord Jesus for a number of years. But the Father came into our situation and called us to go with Him. Eventually, we called, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; and the Father with the Son entered into us as the Spirit. He has forgiven us, redeemed us, justified us, and regenerated us. He is now indwelling us, sanctifying us, and transforming us. He is going to conform us and glorify us. Eventually, He will bring us into Himself as an immense glory. We and He will be an enormous glory in the whole universe! We will be glorified with Him, and He will be glorified within us. Then we will be in the Father&rsquo;s glory, gathered around Him to always praise Him, to manifest Him forever and ever. These items of God&rsquo;s full salvation are some of the intentions, purposes, desires, and wishes that the Father wants to work out in us, and they are included in the fatherhood. The firstborn Son, Jesus Christ, comes to His brothers to explain all these things.</p>
<p>Whenever a brother speaks with God&rsquo;s utterance in the ministry of the word, the Son makes the fatherhood known to the believers. A number of us can testify that the Son has made the fatherhood known to us for the past twenty-five years in the United States through the ministry of the word, the divine speaking in the New Testament ministry. In conference after conference and training after training, our big Brother, the firstborn Son, was making God&rsquo;s economy in His fatherhood known to us. Within the proper minister of the word there is a wonderful One telling us many marvelous things about the Father: He is the choosing Father, the predestinating Father, the redeeming Father, the regenerating Father, and the transforming Father who has many good intentions toward us. He has many purposes in His economy for us in order to make us a group of praising sons to manifest Him.</p>
<p>This revelation of the fatherhood will make us full of &ldquo;hallelujahs!&rdquo; We are the sons of the divine Father, and we are enjoying the fatherhood! We may not understand the fatherhood fully, but we enjoy it and taste it. We are in this fatherhood, and we will be in it more and more. Today we are enjoying a miniature of the fatherhood, and one day we will be in the full taste of the fatherhood. We need to declare, &ldquo;God is my Father, and I am one of His sons expressing Him, manifesting Him. Hallelujah!&rdquo; Our story and our song should be that we are praising Him all the day long. Our Christian meeting should make God&rsquo;s economy in His fatherhood known to the believers. Today in our meeting we are the divine sons to express the begetting Source, to manifest Him, to magnify Him, to express Him, which is altogether a divine praise rendered to Him.</p>
<p>In ancient times, not only the Chinese race but also all the races had big families. In China it was considered good to have a family of five generations. The Bible reveals the great family of Abraham. Abraham had two sons: Ishmael who was eventually excluded from Abraham&rsquo;s family and Isaac who was Abraham&rsquo;s unique seed. The New Testament tells us that Abraham&rsquo;s family comprises us today. We are the sons, the descendants, of Abraham, and he is surely our father in the faith (Gal. 3:7, 29).</p>
<p>When I was young in China about sixty or seventy years ago, there were families with a great father living with his fourth generation. If he had five sons, they had children of the third generation. These third generation children had children of the fourth generation. On the birthday of this great father, all the sons, grandsons, great grandsons, and great great grandsons came together to talk about what they had inherited from their great father and what they were going to inherit. They would talk about what they were doing at that time and about all their interests and possessions, such as properties, houses, lands, schools, etc. They would talk about these things in front of their great father. As the father was listening to them and watching them, he was so happy. The more they talked about these things, the more they gave praises to that great old man and the more they expressed him and manifested him.</p>
<p>That birthday meeting is a model of our meeting today. Our Father&rsquo;s birthday is eternity, and our meeting today is the birthday meeting of our Father. When we come together, we talk about all that the Father is, all that the Father has done for us, all that the Father has given us, all that the Father is intending to do for us, and about what we have inherited of Him. What we talk about includes whatever the Father has done, is doing, and is going to do. The more we talk about these things in our meeting, the more praise we give to our Father. This kind of speaking makes our Father happy.</p>
<p>The Scriptures reveal that the Father is the very source of the divine Trinity, the Son is the course of that source, and the Spirit is the flow within the course (2 Cor. 13:14). Then this flow reaches us. This fatherhood includes whatever the Father as the source is, whatever the course is, and whatever the flow is. The ultimate picture of this fatherhood is the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem, God the Father is in the Son as the Lamb, and the Spirit as the flowing river spirals its way through all the contents of the holy city (Rev. 22:1). Thus, all the redeemed saints of God as the constituents of this city are under the watering of this flow of the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. Everything in the New Jerusalem is the fatherhood.</p>
<p>When we come together, we should never have nothing to say. We should have a great deal to say. We can say, &ldquo;The Father begot me. This begetting Father is the very source of the Triune God, whom I enjoy. The source goes through the course, the course goes through the flow, and the flow as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God reaches me to saturate me and water me. How wonderful!&rdquo; If we all see this vision of the fatherhood, everyone will have something to say when they come to the meeting. We are coming to our great Father&rsquo;s birthday! Look at Him. How ancient He is! How wonderful He is! This great Father has done great things for us. All the spiritual blessings we have received come from our great Father. We all have something to say. We all can speak of the spiritual blessings with which we have been blessed by our wonderful Father (Eph. 1:3).</p>
<p>This fellowship shows us the rich store, the rich provision, that we have for our meetings. How could we come together with other saints with nothing to say? If I came to the meeting as a son of God, redeemed, regenerated, indwelt, and being transformed by Him, and He is with me all the days, how could I come without anything to say? This would be pitiful. It is not good enough just to say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! O Lord Jesus! Amen!&rdquo; We have to tell others what we are saying hallelujah for. We can say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! our Father is the begetting Father! Hallelujah for His divine life! Hallelujah for His divine nature! Hallelujah for His divine presence! Hallelujah for His course, who is the Son! And hallelujah for the Son&rsquo;s redemption, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.&rdquo; We have so much to say.</p>
<p>Degraded Christianity has made us so poor. It has robbed us and annulled all our functions. This degraded system robbed our divine riches and made us inactive, passive laymen listening to the clergy. Perhaps we listened to someone from the clergy every Sunday for fifty-two weeks of the year. We went week after week to listen to speaking that was a waste as far as our development in life and function was concerned. Recently the big denominations in the United States came together to talk about how to evangelize the entire world by the year 2000. They said that one of their problems was a shortage of manpower. How could they say that they are short of manpower when they have millions of people? Christians compose about half of the population in the United States. More than half of these Christians are Protestants and most of the others are Catholics. According to statistics on religious bodies in the United States, there were approximately one hundred twenty-six million Christians in 1986. Does Christianity have the manpower? They do have the manpower, but they have annulled everyone&rsquo;s function, making the members of the Body of Christ paralyzed to the extent that they do hardly anything and know hardly anything. Today our intention is to revive the saints and get them out of that condition. We must learn to speak. We must learn to celebrate our great Father&rsquo;s birthday. Whenever we come together, we should link our meeting to that great Source, the very begetting Source. He not only has begotten us but He also has done many wonderful things for His begotten sons. Now we are in His fatherhood enjoying Him in every way and in every aspect. But we must learn to speak.</p>
<p>Let us consider again the illustration of the great father in China with four generations. Suppose that over two hundred of his family came to celebrate his birthday and everybody came silent. How would this great father feel with two hundred silent people sitting in front of him? This great father would probably be angry. He might say, &ldquo;What happened to you? I did not beget dumb children. Are you my sons? Do you have my life? Do you possess my nature? Why are you so dumb? What happened to you all?&rdquo; If our heavenly Father came to a Christian meeting where His children did not speak, He might feel to rebuke them in the same way. He might say, &ldquo;I did so many things for you, and I am so much to you. Why don&rsquo;t you have anything to say about Me? Who killed you? Who annulled all your functions? Who shut all your mouths? Christianity did this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What about us today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? Are we bubbling Christians? When we come to the meeting, are we bubbling attendants? I cannot stay in a meeting for a half hour without speaking. I like to bubble. I have something to say. We should not merely say &ldquo;hallelujah,&rdquo; but we have to say &ldquo;hallelujah&rdquo; for something. We can say, &ldquo;I was begotten of our Father about two thousand years ago, and God&rsquo;s only begotten Son has become my big Brother! I am one of the many brothers of this big Brother!&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been in the United States for twenty-five years, and we have published hundreds of messages. Regrettably, many of these messages remain on our bookshelves. We need to spend time to get into them so we can learn the many things concerning our divine family. This will enable us to speak with boldness and assurance. Even to speak concerning the Triune God as the source, the course, and the flow is inexhaustible.</p>
<p>We have seen that after His resurrection, the Lord Jesus came back to His brothers. Before His resurrection when He was on this earth, the Lord did not have brothers. According to John 15, He only had friends (vv. 13-15). He considered the disciples as His friends. But immediately after His resurrection, He told Mary, &ldquo;Go to My brothers&rdquo; (John 20:17). Immediately the friends had become brothers. In His resurrection, His friends were begotten of His Father. That is why the Lord told Mary in John 20:17 that His Father was their Father and that His God was their God. Then on the evening of His resurrection, He came back to His brothers (John 20:19). According to Hebrews 2:11, the Son as the big Brother came back to His brothers to declare the Father&rsquo;s name, which implies the Father&rsquo;s Person, the Father&rsquo;s Being, with all His intentions, wishes, desires, and purposes regarding His begotten children. The Son revealed this great fatherhood to His brothers who were participating in the fatherhood. The Christian meeting is a meeting in and for the fatherhood.</p>
<p>Now we are meeting in this fatherhood which comprises so much. We meet in the Son&rsquo;s name (Matt. 18:20) to declare the Father&rsquo;s name. Whatever we do and say in the meetings should declare the Father in order that the Father may be praised, magnified, manifested, expressed. Our meeting is for the praise of the Father&mdash;for the magnification and glorification of the very source of the divine Trinity. The very source of the divine Trinity is the begetting Father. Our meeting is just for the praise of this begetting Source, and our praise is our magnification, our glorification, our expression, of Him to the uttermost.</p>
