   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Making Decisions for Others</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should never make decisions for others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is to consider that we are superior to them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to be honest with the ones who are under our care, but we must still be restricted by the Lord not to make their decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Never Arguing with People</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We also should never argue with people, regardless of whether they are right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Every conversation is a temptation to adjust others, convince them, or sell our good opinions and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must avoid all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is no need to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do, it will not help them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not Passing On Vain Knowledge</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must never pass on vain knowledge to people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>People may ask us about many matters, but we must learn to exercise our spirit to discern the purpose of the questions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we discern properly, we may realize that the questions are in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>People often like to gain knowledge, asking about the elders, the brothers and sisters, and many other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must learn to be wise, not be involved with questionings, and not pass on vain knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This also is a difficult lesson for us all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not Being Involved in Any Negative Talk</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not be involved in any negative talk.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, we should not be a trash can.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Flies like to find a dirty place, but we must be clean and sterilized.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do not visit people in a clean way, but rather take germs to them, they may be incited to open up in a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They will open their tombs, and death will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not get into any negative talk or answer any questions about negative matters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must be in another realm, another kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Being Honest and Not Political</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must learn to be honest, never pretending and never playing politics.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not be political in order to make the situation easier.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must be honest persons, answering honestly yes or no. If the situation does not allow us to answer yes or no, then we should not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we learn all these lessons, we will be able to care for others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Ministering Life to Others</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Most importantly, we must learn to minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to do this, we ourselves must have life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may illustrate this with money.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we desire to give money to someone, we must first have some ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If our pocket is empty, we have nothing to give.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must have something before we can minister it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we must learn the lessons of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we will know how to minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In fact, if we have life, there is no need to purposely minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Life will already be ministered to them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When visiting others to take care of them, the proper principle is to minister life to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All the foregoing points are a preparation for ministering life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do not have this preparation, whatever we do will only diminish our ministry and supply.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are careless about any of these matters, our ministry of life will be annulled and swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are careful about all these items, we will remain in a pure condition to minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Taking the Lead to Bring Others</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>into a Prayer Life</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to pray with others and help them to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not try to wrongly impress people that we have the way to do things, that we are smart, or that we know everything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Rather, we should simply help people to put their trust in the Lord and depend on Him for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To this end, we should bring with us a spirit and atmosphere of prayer to help others to come into a prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to create an atmosphere so that whatever happens to people, they will pray, look to the Lord, and rely on Him for His presence and clear leading.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to build up those under our care with a prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we ourselves are not persons with a prayer life, we will not be able to build up others as this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We ourselves need to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Contacting People with Patience</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In order to care for others, we need patience.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should not expect that someone who is newly saved or recovered will immediately be in a proper condition.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need patience to care for the weaker ones.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A weaker one may require our patience to contact him again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This kind of continual, patient contact will shepherd people.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This takes time, but there is nothing else we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The church grows through shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we have gospel preaching without shepherding to take care of the new ones, many of the newly saved ones will fall away.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This will spoil and damage our appetite for gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many will say, We brought so many to the Lord, but most of them are not here anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We will be like a family that has lost its children.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, we need the proper shepherding for the proper child raising.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is impossible for only the leading brothers in a church to take care of the shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Everyone must pick up the burden to take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This requires our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Trusting Those Who Are under Our Care</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must learn to trust and rely upon the ones who are under our care.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is to have a proper fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In one sense, we are the parents nourishing our children, but in another sense, we are all brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Therefore, we should show others that not only do they rely on us, but we also rely on them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This mutual reliance creates much profit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It causes others to be open to us, trust us, and have confidence in us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is to open our veins for the blood to circulate.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>All the members must be open to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then the circulation will do its proper work.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have seen that some of the ones who are under our care do not open to us, regardless of how much time we spend with them.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This means that they have no confidence in us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We need to behave in a way to build up a mutual confidence; this will cause them to open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This requires us to depend on them, rely on them, and show them that we need their help.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Never Forcing Anyone to Do Anything</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We should never give anyone under our care the sense that we are forcing them to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We must all learn the attributes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>From the beginning, God never forced people.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Rather, He gave them a free choice.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We should not even try to overly influence people.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Not to force or coerce people is contrary to our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In shepherding, however, we should stay away from every kind of forcing, coercing, and convincing.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We should allow people to have a free choice.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Fellowshipping with Others</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>according to Our Own Experience</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Whatever we fellowship with the dear ones must be according to our own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Paul told the Thessalonians, Just as you know how we were to each one of you, as a father to his own children, exhorting you and consoling you and testifying 1 Thes 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>No doubt, Paul testified many things to the saints, but a great part of his testimony must have been his own experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We need personal experiences to be able to testify to the younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>In the proper sense, whatever we render to them as a help should be from our own testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>How much we can testify in this way depends on how much we have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We must have a certain amount of experience of all of the foregoing detailed items.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The more we pick up the burden to shepherd others, the more things we will need to learn.</S>
