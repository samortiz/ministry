Such a sentence is not long, but it is very costly. Do not esteem it lightly. This is the summary of the first forty-one Psalms. In this summary of Book 1, there are three key words: the law, Christ, and the house. God has turned His saints from the law to His Anointed, for the house. Christ is for the house; Christ is for the church. If we, the saints of God, do not contact the house, there is no place for us to enjoy the riches of Christ. Though we have Christ, yet without the house we have no place to enjoy Him. God&#8217;s intention is that through Christ the house may come into existence for the enjoyment of His people. The church is God&#8217;s desire, His intention, and His eternal purpose. Thus, in the first book we have the law on the negative side, and Christ and the house on the positive side.<p>I can testify that I had been a Christian for many years before I knew what the Psalms spoke about. It is easy to grasp the book of Romans; it is easy to comprehend the content of the book of Acts; but you can read through the Psalms several times and still not apprehend their message. We need divine revelation to see that God&#8217;s intention in the first book of the Psalms is to turn our thoughts, our concept, our understanding, from the law to Christ, that we may enjoy His house.<p>We have also seen that Book II, Psalms 42 to 72, indicates how the saints experience God and His house and city through the suffering, exalted and reigning Christ. When we come to the second book, we have the deeper experiences of Christ; hence, the house is increased to a city. We enjoy God through Christ, we enjoy God&#8217;s house through Christ, and we enjoy God&#8217;s city through Christ. In the second book we see the suffering, exalted, reigning, and coming Christ. It is through such a Christ that we enjoy God and His house and city.<p>We need to put the first and second books of the Psalms together to apprehend their combined message. In the first book God brings us to Christ, and then we have the house for enjoyment. The second book continues by telling us that through further and deeper experiences of Christ, the house is increased to a city. Here, in the house and in the city, we enjoy God with this house and city through the suffering, exalted and reigning Christ. In these few sentences we have crystallized the message of Book I and Book II of the Psalms.<p>Every book in the Psalms is a continuation of the previous one. Therefore Book III, Psalms 73 to 89, continues Book II by telling how the saints in their experiences realize that the house and the city of God with all the enjoyments thereof can only be preserved and maintained with Christ properly appreciated and exalted by God&#8217;s people. In the first two books we have Christ, the house, and the city-this is the peak, the highest enjoyment, of the saints. But, as we have seen, it is always difficult to maintain such a high standard for long. God&#8217;s house and God&#8217;s city were damaged, and desolation ensued. Yet, through this experience, the saints realized how to preserve the enjoyment of the house and city of God. When Christ is given His proper position in the church, we can continually preserve the church life at the peak.<p>Have you been deeply impressed by these three books? Without these summaries, it is difficult to apprehend them. In short, in the first book we have Christ in the house; in the second book we have the house and the city; and in the third book we have the desolation and how to maintain the enjoyment of God&#8217;s house and city through Christ.<p>Let us recall now the leading Psalms in each of these three books. In Book I, Psalm 1 is a good Psalm negatively. A good painting requires a proper background. Without a dark background, it is difficult to set forth a bright figure. The darker the background, the brighter the main image will be. Hence the leading Psalms of Book I are Psalm 1 on the negative side, and Psalms 2, 8, 16, 22, 23, 24, 27, and 36 on the positive side. Finally we should include Psalm 31, verse 21, which speaks of the strong city.<p>In Book II the leading Psalms are Psalms 45, 46, 48, 68, and 72. In these Psalms we see Christ in a deeper way, the house, the city and the earth. These leading Psalms present the main features of Book II solidly and adequately and bring us to the climax of enjoyment. In these Psalms we also have the move of God, the victory of the Lord, with all the praises of the saints. Then, at the end, we have Christ&#8217;s reign over the entire earth.<p>In Book III we have already considered three leading Psalms: Psalms 73, 80, and 84. In Psalm 73 we have seen how we need God as our unique portion, and in Psalm 80 we have seen how Christ must have the unique position. When these are secured we have, in Psalm 84, the sweeter experience of the house of God. The house becomes much sweeter than before the desolation. It has been recovered by the experience of God as our unique portion and by Christ being given the unique position. It is by this that the house is sweeter than ever.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_061.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_063.html">Next</a> </body></html>
