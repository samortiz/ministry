With this message we shall begin to cover Christ's person, and in later messages we shall cover Christ's attributes, virtues, and work
When we say that God is dispensing Himself into us, we need to realize that this dispensing God in His economy is Christ
They may give the impression that God is not our Redeemer and Savior and that Christ is someone besides God who is our Savior and Redeemer
It is more accurate to say that without being Christ God could not be our Savior and that without being Christ God could not be our Redeemer
In order for us to enjoy God's dispensing, we need to consider all the aspects of who Christ is and what Christ is
Regarding Christ being the complete God, John 1:1 says, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
It is not, as supposed by some, that Christ was not God from eternity past and that at a certain time Christ became God
In this Gospel Christ is 'without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life'
We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that our Lord Jesus Christ is the very God who is over all and blessed forever
The Godhead includes the Father the Son and the Spirit and the fullness of the Godhead is the fullness of the Father the Son and the Spirit
The fact that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily means that the Triune God is fully embodied in Him
Hebrews 1:3 says not only that Christ is the effulgence of God's glory but also that He is the express image of God's substance
When this seal is pressed on a piece of paper, the paper will bear the same image with the same letters as the seal
The substance within is the source of the express image, and the expression without is the effulgence of God's glory
For Christ to be the effulgence of God's glory and the express image of His substance means that He is God coming to us
The image in Colossians 1:15 does not mean a physical form, but an expression of God's being in all His attributes
Speaking of Christ, Philippians 2:6 says, 'Who subsisting in the form of God did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped'
The Greek word translated 'subsisting' denotes existing from the beginning; it implies Christ's eternal preexistence
According to His good pleasure, God created the heavens and the earth and all the billions of items in the universe
God's history refers to the process through which He has passed so that He may dispense Himself into His chosen people
In Matthew 16:16 Peter, receiving a revelation from the Father, declared, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God'
Regarding the Son of God there are two aspects: the aspect of the only begotten Son of God and the aspect of the firstborn Son of God
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
As we shall see, from the time of His resurrection He became the Son of God in another sense, in the sense of being the firstborn Son of God
Before His incarnation Christ was the only begotten Son of God, but through resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God
In His first birth He was born of Mary to be the Son of Man, and in His second birth He was born of God in resurrection to be the Son of God
We who believe in Christ are the many sons of God and the many brothers of the Lord, the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God
The Gospel of John emphasizes that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and as the Son of God He is the very embodiment of the divine life
The Word is the definition, explanation, and expression of God; hence, the Word is God defined, explained, and expressed
The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us in order to declare God, express God, explain God, and define God in many practical ways
As the Word, Christ is the defined God, the explained, expressed, and revealed God, the God made known to human beings
No one has ever seen God, but the Son as the Word of God, as the speaking of God, has declared and expressed Him
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
Christ is the expression of God in the same way that grace is the expression of love and reality is the expression of light
When we enjoy Christ as grace and reality, this enjoyment brings us into the bosom of the Father where we enjoy God as love and light
The Word is God expressed, life is God imparted, light is God's shining, grace is God enjoyed, and reality is God realized
Although no one has ever seen God, the Son of God declares Him, expresses Him, in the way of being the Word, life, light, grace, and reality
In verse 7 the Lord Jesus pointed out to the disciples that if they had known Him, they would have known His Father also
If we have seen the Son, we have seen the Father because the Father is embodied in the Son to be expressed through Him
According to the natural understanding, the Son is the Son, the Father is the Father, and the two are distinctly separate one from the other
Although the Son and the Father are one, we should not say that there is no distinction between the Father and the Son
For this reason 1 John 223 says Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either he who confesses the Son has the Father also
Since the Son and the Father are one, to deny the Son is to be without the Father, and to confess the Son is to have the Father
He always did the Father's work and will, spoke the Father's word, sought the Father's glory, and expressed the Father
The New Testament says not only that the Son and the Father are with each other, but also reveals that the Son and the Father coinhere
It is easy to see the matter of coexistence, but it is much more difficult to realize the matter of coinherence
The coinherence of the Son and the Father means that the Son is in the Father and that the Father is in the Son
As their scriptural ground for teaching this, they refer to the Father's speaking from the heavens at the time of Christ's baptism
We use the word essential to refer to Christs existence in His substance and the word economical to refer to Christs work in Gods economy
Essentially, that is, according to Christ's existence in His substance, the Son was always in the Father and the Father in the Son
As we have seen, the Son and the Father were coinhering, for the Son was in the Father, and the Father was in the Son
Some have mistakenly thought that the Son and the Father are separate and that the Son merely represents the Father
Christ the Son coexists and coinheres with the Father so that He with the Father may be dispensed into our being
Because Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit through resurrection, He is now the life-giving Spirit
According to 1 Corinthians 15:45, the first man Adam became a living soul, and the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit
When we believe into Him, He enters our spirit, and we are joined to Him as the life-giving Spirit to become one spirit with Him
The crucial matter here is not whether the article is definite or indefinite; it is the clear mentioning of the life-giving Spirit
Do the opposers believe that there are two Spirits who give the divine life, the Holy Spirit and the life-giving Spirit?
It is truly according to the divine revelation in the Scriptures to say that Christ, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit
To say that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit is similar to saying, according to John 1:14, that the Word became flesh
By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the Lord imparted Himself as life and everything to them essentially
We need to be impressed with the fact that as the eternal Word Christ took the two steps of incarnation and resurrection
They do not see that in resurrection He, the last Adam in the flesh, became the life-giving Spirit in order to come into us to be our life
As the last Adam in the flesh, Christ, through the process of death and resurrection, became the life-giving Spirit
In the book of 2 Corinthians the title the Lord is always attached to the Lord Jesus and God is called the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
Corinthians 3:17 is, then, a strong word in the Bible telling us emphatically that Christ the Lord is the Spirit
The Spirit given by Christ is the immeasurable Spirit, and the immeasurable Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit
After His resurrection, through His resurrection, and in His resurrection, Christ became the life-giving Spirit
When the unlimited Christ is applied to us, appreciated by us, and enjoyed by us, He is the immeasurable Spirit
To be baptized in the Holy Spirit is to be baptized into Christ , into the Triune God , and even into the Body of Christ
In his preaching in Acts 3:15 Peter declares, 'And the Author of life you killed, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses'
Archegos does not denote a prince; it denotes the very source, the origin, even the Originator, of life, the Author of life
Peter is saying that Christ is the source of life, the Originator of life; He is the Author, the Chief Leader, in life
Peter wanted the people to realize that the One they had killed and whom God had raised from the dead is the Author of life
Through incarnation Christ, the Word, the Author of life, came as life to be received by the man whom He created
As applied to Christ, the Greek word for 'Lord' used in the New Testament equals the divine title 'Jehovah' of the Old Testament
In the administration of God's judgment upon the earth, Christ is the Angel standing on the position of One who has been sent by God
Revelation specifically describes Christ as another Angel indicating that He is not a regular or common angel but a special Angel
The first altar in Revelation 8:3 refers to the altar of burnt offering , and the golden altar before the throne refers to the incense altar
Christ is unveiled as another Angel in relation to 'a hundred and forty-four thousand sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel'
The rainbow upon His head indicates that Christ, in His judgment upon the earth, will keep the covenant God made with Noah
The pillars indicate steadfastness and fire signifies the holiness of God according to which Christ will execute His judgment upon the earth
Having considered Christ's person in the Godhead, we shall go on in this message to see Christ's person in the divine economy
The aspects of Christ's person in the Godhead are deep, but the aspects of Christ's person in the divine economy are even deeper
The divine economy is God's household management, God's household administrative arrangement, the divine dispensation
Joseph in the Old Testament, for example, was the administrator of Pharaoh's house, which was so rich that it could supply other nations
Concerning this, John 1:41 says, 'He found first his own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah '
They replied, 'Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets'
According to the Old Testament principle, anyone used by God to carry out His administration had to be anointed
His commission is to accomplish God's eternal purpose through His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and second advent
Through the function of Christ, the anointed One, the Triune God is dispensed into us for the producing of the church
In Colossians 1:15 we are told that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation, and in verse 18, that He is the Firstborn from among the dead
Because Christ is the first both in the universe and in the church, He must be all things in the universe and in the church
According to our estimation, if Christ is the first, then something else should be the second, third, and others in sequence
Ephesians 1:22 says, 'And He subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church'
According to this understanding, a great gift was given to Christ by God, and this great gift was the headship over all things
Through all the dispensations of God in all the ages, all things will be headed up in Christ in the new heaven and the new earth
The economy, or dispensation, which God purposed in Himself is to head up all things in Christ at the fullness of the times
Many things are still in a state of collapse because the process of the heading up of all things in Christ has not yet been completed
In His Christ to head up all things Is our God's economy; Taking Christ as Head and Center, All is one in harmony
Christ as Head will be the Center; God within will be the Light; Christ enthroned, with God, His substance, Will fulfill His heart's delight
Ephesians 1:10 indicates that in the divine economy Christ is not only the Head of all things but also the center of all things
Ephesians 4:10 says, 'He who descended is the same who also ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things'
Eventually, He ascended from Hades to the earth in His resurrection and from the earth to heaven in His ascension
He died on the cross, descended into Hades, ascended in resurrection from Hades to earth, and then ascended to the third heaven
For Christ to be the First means that none is before Him, and for Him to be the Last means that none is after Him
In suffering the church needs to know that Christ is the First and the Last, the ever-existing, unchanging One
The First indicates that nothing is before Him, whereas the beginning means that He is the origination of all things
Not only is there nothing before or after the Lord Jesus, but also there is no origination or consummation without Him
As the Alpha and Omega, the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, Christ is also every other letter in the alphabet
Christ is the content and continuation of God's operation, for He is not only the beginning and the ending but also the Alpha and the Omega
He is the First and the Last the beginning and the ending of Gods operation and He is the content and continuation of whatever God is doing
Christ is the all-inclusive One, the One who is the First and the Last, the beginning and the end, the Alpha and the Omega
Colossians 1:12 says, 'Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light'
The Father has qualified us not to inherit some heavenly mansion, but to have a share in Christ as the all-inclusive portion of the saints
Of course, our portion, our allotment, today is not a physical land in Palestine; it is the all-inclusive Christ
Each of the tribes had an allotment of the good land, and the members of each tribe had a share of this allotment
Today Christ is our portion, our allotment, our everything, just as the land was all things to the children of Israel
In God's economy Christ is not only the portion of the saints; He is also the glory of Israel, God's chosen people
What does it mean that all things came into being through Him and that apart from Him nothing has come into being?
We may say that, in a sense, the Creator did not need to work in order to make anything, for there was no need for Him to do anything
If Christ were only God and not man, He could not have been born, for God is infinite and eternal, without beginning or ending
According to God's perspective in eternity, according to God's viewpoint, Christ has always been the first of all creatures
Arius taught that Christ's divinity was incomplete and that He came into being through the union of the Logos and the human body
According to Arius, Christ cannot compare with God, but is merely the most outstanding, the noblest, and the highest among the creatures
Arius further affirmed that because Christ died without sin, He could be resurrected, ascend to the heavens, and thus become God
The Bible says that Christ is the very God, who exists from the beginning and who is self-existent and without beginning
Arius said that there was a time when Christ did not exist and that He became God only after His resurrection and ascension
In saying that Christ, the Creator and the means of creation, is the first among the creatures, we are simply following the pure Word of God
Prototokos means the first one born, the first one produced in the beginning; it can thus be translated 'the firstborn'
Verse 15 says that He is the Firstborn of all creation, and verse 18 says that He is the 'Firstborn from among the dead'
If He were not the Firstborn of all creation and thereby the first among the creatures, He could not have the preeminence in creation
As the Firstborn of all creation He does not come into being by Himself; rather, He has a beginning in creation
As the Creator He is the uncreated, self-existing One, but as a creature, even the Firstborn of the created ones, He has a beginning
Christ is called the Firstborn of all creation because even before creation God ordained that He should become a created man
For in His eternal plan, before the foundation of the world, God ordained that the Son should become flesh to accomplish redemption
In God's plan and in His eternal view, Christ is the first One created, the Firstborn of all creation, the Head of all created ones
According to the revelation of the Bible, Christ is both the Creator and a creature, because He is God and also man
The Bible clearly reveals that Christ is the Creator and that He became a creature, just as He is God and became a man
Through Him' indicates that Christ is the active instrument through which the creation of all things was processed
He was not merely an objective Creator but also the subjective instrument through which creation was processed
According to the Greek, we may translate the last prepositional phrase in Colossians 1:16 either 'for Him' or 'unto Him'
The three prepositions in, through, and unto are used by the apostle to point out the subjective relationship of Christ to creation
Creation took place in the power of Christ's person, through Him as the active instrument, and unto Him as its consummation
To exist is to be, to consist is to be composed or constituted, and to subsist is to be held together for existence
All things were made in the intrinsic power of Christ's person, through Him as the active instrument, and unto Him as the consummate goal
According to the New Testament, the word 'subsist' includes, or implies, three things: to exist, to live, and to live together
The New Testament indicates that in the beginning was the Word, and this Word is the entire Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Because of the influence of traditional teaching, we may think that only the Son of God, not the entire God, was incarnated
The New Testament does not say that the Son of God was incarnated; it says that God was manifested in the flesh
As the cloud overshadowed the Mount of Transfiguration and the tabernacle , the power of the Most High overshadowed Mary
Matthew 118 and 20 tell us that Mary was found having in womb out of the Holy Spirit and the thing begotten in her is out of the Holy Spirit
Some who did not understand this mingling said that it caused a third nature to be produced, something which is neither divine nor human
According to this definition, when two or more things are mingled together, their original natures are not lost but remain distinguishable
Because the conceiving was of the Holy Spirit, what was born of this conception was a holy thing, something intrinsically holy
Jesus' is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua , which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah
He is not only our Savior saving us from sin; He is our Joshua bringing us into rest, which is Himself as the good land
In His incarnation Christ emptied Himself by putting aside the form the outward expression of His deity and becoming in the likeness of men
To accomplish God's purpose and to establish the kingdom of the heavens, it was necessary for Christ to be a man
Without man, God's purpose cannot be carried out on earth, and the kingdom of the heavens cannot be constituted on earth
God had created man with a purpose according to His design, but man failed Him in His purpose and ruined His design
Concerning Christ as the second Man, 1 Corinthians 15:47 says, 'The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second Man is out of heaven'
We have pointed out that in His incarnation Christ was conceived of the Spirit of God and was born of a human virgin
When Joseph returned and learned that Archelaus, the son of Herod, was in power, he was afraid to remain in the territory around Bethlehem
When Jesus Christ was born into the human race, He appeared in a way that was somewhat hidden, in a way that was not open or evident
Philip went to Nathanael and told him that he had met the Messiah and that He was the son of Joseph, a man of Nazareth
Apparently, Jesus was from Galilee, from Nazareth; actually, He was born in Bethlehem according to His hidden and secret way of appearing
Jesus was not born in a recognized and honored royal home, and He did not grow up in a renowned city like Jerusalem
All this made Him a Nazarene, not a lofty branch of a stately tree but a seemingly insignificant shoot from the stump of Jesse
They were astounded by His teaching, by His wisdom, and by His works of power, but they regarded Him as a person of low status
Mark 6:3 says that those who rejected the Lord Jesus, regarding Him merely as a carpenter, were 'stumbled in Him'
No matter how rich He was or how much He knew the truth in the Holy Scriptures, He was despised and rejected instead of welcomed
Speaking of Christ, Philippians 2:7 says that He 'emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men'
In His incarnation the Lord did not alter His divine nature but only His outward expression of the form of God to that of a slave
Because Mark presents Christ as a slave, he does not tell us His genealogy and status, for the ancestry of a slave is not worthy of note
Neither does Mark intend to impress us with the Slave's wonderful words , but with His deeds in His gospel service
In Mark 10:45 the Lord Jesus says, 'The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many'
The word 'ransom' here indicates that even the Lord's redemption was His service rendered to sinners for God's plan
Although He was a despised Nazarene and even a slave, His living was a testimony of God, for He was a living witness of God
His living, which was absolutely separated unto God, for God, and one with God, corresponded to God's desire and nature
Only the Lord Jesus can be called the Righteous One because only He is right with God and with everyone and everything
Of course, as He lives within us we shall have a human living that is low in position and rank, yet holy in nature and righteous in behavior
In John 1:29 we see that in redemption Christ is the Lamb of God: 'Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world'!
From 1 Corinthians 15:3, 1 Peter 2:24, and Hebrews 9:28 we see that as the Lamb of God the Lord Jesus died for our sins
In redemption Christ as the Lamb of God satisfied God's requirements, the requirements of His righteousness, holiness, and glory
There was the need of a Redeemer, the Lamb of God, designated by God to fulfill His righteous, holy, and glorious requirements
Through Christ as the Lamb of God fulfilling all the offerings we may enter into God and participate in the divine life and nature
We may boldly come into God, knowing that He does not have the right to reject us, because we come through His Lamb
Christ was foreordained, prepared, by God to be His redeeming Lamb according to His foreknowledge before the foundation of the world
As a man in the flesh, Christ had only the likeness, the form, of a fallen man; He did not have the sinful nature of a fallen man
When the flesh that Christ put on through incarnation was crucified, God condemned the sin in the flesh of fallen mankind
When Christ died on the cross, He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He did not have the nature of the flesh of sin
Because the Lord died on the cross as a man, the last Adam, in the old creation, our old man was dealt with through His death
When Christ died on the cross for our redemption, He died not only as a man in the flesh, the last Adam, but also as a creature
Hebrews 2:9 says clearly that Christ tasted death not only on behalf of every man but also on behalf of everything
Hebrews 10:20 speaks of 'a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh'
The brass serpent lifted up on a pole is a type of Christ lifted up on the cross for us as a serpent in form according to John 3:14
We need to be very clear that Christ was a serpent in form but that He did not have the poisonous nature of a serpent
In Matthew 23:33 He called them 'serpents, brood of vipers,' the offspring of the most poisonous kind of serpents
No doubt, the Lord Jesus was crucified as a serpent in form in order to deal with Satan, the Devil, the old serpent
It was through being crucified as a serpent in form that the Lord Jesus crushed the head of the old serpent, the Devil
In this way He judged the ruler of this world: 'Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out'
As the One who died as a serpent in form under God's judgment, the Lord Jesus dealt with the Devil and with his world, the satanic system
Through the death of Christ, sins, sin, the old man, the entire creation, the Devil, and the world have all been dealt with
All the ordinances-the habits, customs, traditions, and practices among the human race-were abolished on the cross
Not only was there a partition between Jews and Gentiles; there were also partitions between every nationality and race
Christ, who has accomplished full redemption for both Jewish and Gentile believers, is Himself our peace, our harmony
Due to the fall of mankind and the call of the chosen race, Israel, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles
The middle wall of partition is 'the law of the commandments in ordinances,' which was given because of man's flesh
All these negative things were terminated and taken away through the all-inclusive death of Christ, our Redeemer
As we remain under the Lord's dispensing, all the aspects of His person in redemption will be dispensed into us
Concerning Christ as the Savior, Luke 2:11 says, 'A Savior was born to you today in David's city, who is Christ the Lord'
What He is and what He has accomplished make Him competent to be the able Savior to save us to the uttermost from all our problems
When Christ came and was presented to God as a child, the old, righteous and devout Simeon blessed God for Him as God's salvation
If Christ is not our life in our practical experience, then all He is and all He has attained and obtained will remain objective
On the other hand, we still need to be saved from many present problems, including temper, disposition, pride, and jealousy
Although we need to be saved from hundreds of items, in the book of Romans Paul deals with seven major things from which we need to be saved
God has nothing to do with our natural being, our natural life, our natural strength, our natural disposition, or our natural power
We need to be saved in life from self-likeness, and we need to be conformed to the likeness of the glorious Christ
Christ died on the cross as our Substitute, but there is still the need for us to be identified with Him in His life
The only way Christ's accomplishment in substitution can be applied to us in our experience is by our having Christ as our life
To those called by God, the crucified Christ is God's power for carrying out, for accomplishing, what God has planned and purposed
Wisdom is for planning and purposing, whereas power is for carrying out and accomplishing what is planned and purposed
Corinthians 130 says Of Him you are in Christ Jesus who became wisdom to us from God both righteousness and sanctification and redemption
We are now in Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God, and Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God
In 1 Corinthians 1:30 Paul does not say that Christ became our wisdom; he says that Christ became wisdom to us
The expression 'to us from God' indicates something present, practical, and experiential in the way of transmission
We need Christ as the Author of faith because, according to our natural man, we do not have any believing ability
When we look unto Jesus, He, as the life-giving Spirit , imparts, dispenses, Himself into us as the believing element to believe for us
Step after step He cut the way of faith, closing the gaps and removing the mountains like the builder of a highway
The entering is the entering into the heavens, the Holy of Holies within the veil today, where the Lord Jesus entered
He is the Forerunner in glory; He is also the Captain leading us into the very place where He is as the Forerunner
He is qualified to be the Captain of those who are entering into glory, and He is called the Captain of our salvation
Christ, as the Pioneer, has fought His way into this glory, and now He is the Captain of salvation leading God's many sons into His glory
Christ entered into glory as the Pioneer and now He dwells in the full, glorious expression of the divine being
As the One in glory, He is the Captain of our salvation, who one day came into us and now dwells in our spirit
Now we all have this seed of glory, that is, the Captain of salvation Himself, within us, leading us into glory, into the expression of God
Eventually, when our whole being has been permeated and saturated with the element of glory, the glory will come out of us
In this message we shall cover some deep and profound matters concerning Christ's person in reproduction and resurrection
The Lord Jesus indicates that He, as a grain of wheat, will fall into the ground and die in order to produce many grains as His reproduction
In His resurrection Christ imparted the divine life into us and made us the same as He is in life and nature to be His reproduction
Corinthians 15:20 says, 'Christ has been raised from among the dead, the firstfruit of those who have fallen asleep'
Christ being 'the Firstborn from among the dead' is for the new creation in resurrection, which is the church, the Body of Christ
Through designation in resurrection the Christ who was already the Son of God before His incarnation became the Son of God in a new way
The Spirit of holiness is the Spirit of the divine essence, whereas the Holy Spirit is the Person of the Spirit
As the Son of God, Christ is constituted of the Spirit of holiness; the Spirit of holiness is His very element
When He resurrected from among the dead, He was designated in power by resurrection according to the Spirit of holiness that was in Him
Acts 13:33, which quotes from Psalm 2:7, indicates that Christ was begotten as the Son of God on the day of His resurrection
The word 'Firstborn' in Romans 8:29 indicates that in addition to the firstborn Son of God there will be other sons
His resurrection was the release of the divine life and nature, and through this release He was begotten as the firstborn Son of God
Through the two births of Christ divinity has been brought into humanity, and humanity has been brought into divinity
Our limited mentality cannot comprehend this, but it is a fact, and we must receive it according to the divine revelation
We cannot understand how a body of flesh and bones can be spiritual, but with the resurrected Christ flesh and bones have become spiritual
Luke 24:36 and 37 say, 'As they were speaking these things, He Himself stood in their midst and said to them, Peace to you!
In 1 Corinthians 15:44 Paul speaks concerning the resurrection body: 'It is sown a soulish body, it is raised a spiritual body
Christ's body of glory is His resurrected body, saturated with God's glory and transcendent over corruption and death
Christ's resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit in order to enter into His believers
If He were not a Comforter, then He would not have said that He would ask the Father to send another Comforter
If we read John 14:16-20 carefully, we shall see that, eventually, the second Comforter is actually the first Comforter as the Spirit
The Lord again reveals that He Himself would be in the disciples as the Spirit, as the life-giving Spirit in resurrection
Christs resurrection includes the fact that He the last Adam the One who is the Lamb of God the Redeemer has become the lifegiving Spirit
In chapter twenty of the Gospel of John, the Lord came to His disciples, who were in a place where the doors were shut, as the pneuma
In John 1 Christ is the Lamb, but in John 20, after His death and in His resurrection, He is the pneumatic Christ
Day by day we are enjoying not only the redeeming Christ but also the life-giving Christ, the pneumatic Christ
Just as a car tire must be pneumatic, that is, full of air, so every Christian should be pneumatic, full of heavenly breath
When He entered into resurrection, He became in resurrection the life-giving Spirit, and in resurrection He is called the Lord Spirit
The 'same image' means we are being conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, being made the same as He is
When we have contact with Him and stay in the organic union with Him, we shall enjoy His dispensing of Himself into us
Three verses that say definitely that Christ is in us are Romans 8:10; Colossians 1:27; and 2 Corinthians 13:5
Romans 8:10 says, 'If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness'
As long as a believer realizes that Jesus Christ is in him, he is qualified, approved, as a genuine member of Christ
The high priest asked the Lord if He was the Son of God, but He answered by referring to Himself as the Son of Man
Revelation 1:13 indicates that the ascended Christ is the Son of Man: 'In the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man'
Romans 8:34 says, 'Christ Jesus who died, but rather who was raised, who is even at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us'
Christ died for us, He was resurrected, and He is now in the heavens at the right hand of God interceding for us
The right hand of God is the first and highest place in the universe, and God has put the ascended Christ there
Hebrews 29 says We see Jesus who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor
For Christ to be seated at the right hand of the throne of God does not mean that He is seated next to the throne of God at Gods right hand
In Revelation we see that there is only one throne of both God and Christ , one throne for both God and the Lamb
The Lamb the Redeemer the One slain on the cross for our sins is now on the throne carrying out Gods administration over the entire universe
As the Lamb with the seven eyes, the seven Spirits of God, He is carrying out God's administration for the accomplishment of God's economy
Apparently the earth is ruled by kings and presidents; actually the Lord Jesus rules the whole earth through the earthly authorities
