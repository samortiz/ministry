   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN FUNCTION BY PRAY-READING Scripture reading: Deuteronomy 27:14-26; Revelation 5:9-14; 19:1-6; 1 Corinthians 14:16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last chapter, we mentioned the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without the release of the spirit, there is no real function of life in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may have certain functions of teachings, doctrines, and knowledge, but we cannot have any function of life if there is no release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is because "it is the Spirit that gives life."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The function of life in the church requires the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And we have found by our own experiences that the best way to release the spirit is by pray-reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To find a proper way that really is effective in releasing our spirit, we must try pray-reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"AMEN" TO THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to see something more regarding the pray-reading of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The pray-reading we have had in the past is still not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we pray-read, we deal with the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We as human beings are very dull and slow when we come to the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may be intelligent in reading scientific or philosophical books, but when we come to the Bible, we are blind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Something may be clear and definite in the Bible, but we may read it again and again, study it diligently, and even make careful research without seeing it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Have you ever noticed that in Deuteronomy 27:14-26, the people say "Amen" to the Word of God twelve times?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must say "Amen" to the Word of God!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The people of God in the Old Testament were even ordained by God to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They had to say "Amen" to every word at the closing of God's Word in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Have you ever heard God's people say "Amen" to His Word?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are nine blessings in Matthew 5 "Blessed are they."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Have you ever said "Amen" to these blessings?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have been a Christian for more than forty years, and I have never heard this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some may say that this is something of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But in 1 Corinthians 14:16, the Apostle Paul tells us to pray with clear words that others might say "Amen" to our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moreover, the saying of "Amen" is not just something done on earth, but also in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Revelation 5 says that when the Lord Jesus ascended into the heavens, the heavens were filled with "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Revelation also shows us that in the future there will be a great "Amen" in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not just a matter on earth, but also in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>NOT ONLY SINGING, BUT SAYING</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Have you ever seen a church on the earth doing this?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may say that you have seen quite a number of churches singing, "Amen, Hallelujah."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But that is singing, not saying.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Revelation 5 and 19, it is saying, not singing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not a kind of singing, but a kind of saying.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Have you ever seen Christians gathering just to say, "Amen, Hallelujah"?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have heard Christians singing, "Amen, Hallelujah" many times, but I have never heard a group of Christians saying, "Amen, Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What must we say "Amen" to?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must say "Amen" to the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Have you ever heard or practiced this?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I believe that the Lord will lead us to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suppose we were to read Ephesians 4:4-7.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I read "One body," you all will say, "Amen!"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When I say "One spirit," you all will say, "Amen!"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And when I read "One hope," you will say, "Amen!"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"One Lord" "Amen," and so on.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I believe that would be marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Let us come together to "Amen" the Word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we open the Bible, we can say "Amen" to every word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we say "Amen" to the Word, it will release the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Take any book, any chapter, any phrase, and read.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then say "Amen" to what you read.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes we should let the sisters read and the brothers say "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At other times, we can have just four brothers stand up and read, and all the rest say, "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we have a large congregation, we can have ten read, and all the congregation say "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I believe they are already doing this in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There, they have an enormous crowd to say, "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Without mercy, grace and heavenly enlightenment, we cannot see this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But, praise the Lord, we do have this enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Why do we only use hymns to praise the Lord and not the Bible also?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Bible is full of praises.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must learn to say the Word together, to pray-read the Word together.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We not only need to sing the music, but to say the words.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>That means to pray-read the words.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I do believe that after pray-reading the Word in this way for a short time, our spirit will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is wonderful and it is so good.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We do not need to compose anything, it is composed already.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We only need to pray-read and say "Amen" to every part of the Word.</S>
