   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us turn to 1 Corinthians 14:29-32, which says, "And as to prophets, two or three should speak, and the others discern.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But if something is revealed to another sitting by, the first should be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For you can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Prophethood is the highest ministry among all ministries of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Holy Spirit gives the word to the prophets, and the same Spirit is within the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is the spirits of the prophets which enable the prophets to speak God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But something else is also mentioned: A speaker has to watch to see if others have also received God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If they have, then he has to allow them to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although the first one may have God's word in his mouth, he should stop and allow others who have received a revelation to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If four or five persons have received a revelation, they should not all speak; at most two or three should speak, while the rest should keep quiet, because the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Holy Spirit is upon a person and he is serving as God's minister of the word, the spirit of such a person is subject to him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets" this is God's own word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here we find a basic principle: In releasing God's word, the Holy Spirit decides what should be spoken, but the prophets decide when and how the word should be spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In a meeting, if two or three have received a revelation and are speaking, the fourth and the fifth should shut their mouths even though they have also received a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the word they have received is from the Holy Spirit, they have to decide when they should release it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They cannot speak whenever they want.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If someone else receives a revelation while they are speaking, they have to stop and allow the other to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the word is given by the Spirit, but the time and way it is delivered is determined by the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Spirit of God wants you to speak, you should bear in mind that your spirit is subject to you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The time and way to speak is determined by the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One does not speak whenever the word comes to him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The responsibility of the ministers of the word is great.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Much of the responsibility rests on the shoulder of the ministers, not on God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the ministers are not proper, God's word will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The words may be the right words, but the attitude of the speaker may be wrong or the timing may be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a consequence, God's word will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are not proper, we cannot release a proper word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Or if we are not trustworthy, the word will fail even while it is still in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets, how great is the responsibility of the prophets!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is relatively easy to speak when the word comes upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is also easy to stop speaking when the word does not come upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But when the Lord gives us the word, we still have to decide how and when we should speak such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we have never been dealt with or restricted by the Lord and if there is no constitution of the Holy Spirit or knowledge of His way in us, His word will suffer damage in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord entrusts His word to us, and we have to consider how and when we should deliver it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a tremendous responsibility, and we must not regard it lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should realize that the ministry of the word means that God has entrusted His word to man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This word is not a replay from a tape recorder, but a word that is placed within man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It gives room for man to consider the way and time for it to be delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord intends that such spirits be subject to the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The time and way for the word to be delivered is entirely the responsibility of the prophets; they are not the responsibility of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a prophet has not experienced the proper dealings, discipline, and restriction, his spirit will run wild, and trouble will result.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The critical issue today is not related to whether one is a prophet but to what kind of person a prophet is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The distinction is not between prophets and non-prophets but between one prophet and another prophet, that is, the difference between one prophet and another.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Putting it in another way, what is the difference between Jeremiah and Balaam?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must be clear about this basic principle before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today there is the need for God's word, and there is the need for the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without God's word, there is no ministry of the word, and without a proper person, there is also no ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One basic problem in the church is the lack of proper ministers of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This does not mean that God's word is rare or that the vision or light is unclear.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It means that there is a shortage of men whom God can use.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God desires that the spirits of prophets be subject to prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Who are the prophets to whom the spirits of the prophets will be subject?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Can the spirits of prophets be subject to those who walk according to their own will, who give ground to the flesh, and who are stubborn in their mind and emotion?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a man does not bear the mark of the cross in his spirit, he is a wild and proud man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He may have suffered years of discipline, but he is not yet defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord's smiting hand may have been on him once, twice, or even ten times, but he is still not defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In spite of the Lord's repeated chastisement, he is still unyielding.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Such a man proves himself to be a useless vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Is the problem before us a shortage of vision, light, or the word?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>No. It is a shortage of prophets whom God can use.</S>
