[3]  CHAPTER ONE IN HIS INCARNATION 1 Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 1 Tim 3:16; Rom 8:3; Isa 9:6; Luke 1:35; Matt 1:20 OUTLINE The move of God in man being unprecedented in history: Before incarnation God moved only with men and among men.
[4]  God's move with men and among men: Being not the direct move to carry out His eternal economy for Christ and the church.
[5]  In this series of messages, we want to see the move of God in man, which is God's history in His union with man in the New Testament.
[6]  God moved with men and among men in the Old Testament, but He never moved in man.
[7]  B. But the Indirect Move in His Old Creation
[8]  God's move with men and among men was just the indirect move in His old creation for the preparation of His direct move in His new creation for His eternal economy.
[9]  The God-man the complete God and the perfect man.
[10]  In this message we want to see the issue and the purpose of God's incarnation.
[11]  Because of the fall, sin came in, death came in, Satan came in, and the world came in.
[12]  Even we ourselves became sin because our body became the flesh of sin and our soul became the self.
[13]  Since the Lord's recovery has come to this country over thirty years ago, thousands of messages have been released through our ministry.
[14]  Many of the saints in the recovery have received all the truths, yet they are short of the Spirit and of walking according to the spirit.
[15]  Recently we have been paying our attention to the vital groups, but according to our actual daily practice, we are not picking up God that much.
[16]  THE PURPOSE OF THE INCARNATION A. To Bring God into Man
[17]  CHAPTER THREE IN HIS HUMAN LIVING Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:16; Phil 2:7-8; John 3:17; Matt 9:10-13; Luke 4:19-22a; Acts 10:38; Isa 53:2; Luke 2:7, 12, 40, 52, 42, 46-47, 49; 3:23; Isa 53:3; Matt 13:55-57; Luke 4:28-30; Matt 26:4, 16; 4:1, 11 OUTLINE God manifested in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16: Taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men, found in fashion as a man Phil 2:7-8.
[18]  To express the eternal, infinite, invisible, glorious, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent God through the mortal, finite, visible, inglorious man, limited in power, knowledge, and presence: Divinity unveiled in humanity.
[19]  In this message we want to fellowship concerning Christ's human living.
[20]  We may think that Christ's human living was a common thing, but it was altogether uncommon.
[21]  To say that we live Christ, that we live God, means that we and Christ are one.
[22]  The Bible does show us that we need to live for Christ and to live to Christ, but it also shows us that we need to live Christ.
[23]  It seems that this is right, but we need to consider this from another angle.
[24]  We are those who take Christ as our person.
[25]  First Timothy 3:16 says that God was manifested in the flesh.
[26]  The Lord Jesus told the Pharisees God desires mercy and not sacrifice Matt 9:10-13 .
[27]  Christ in His body of the flesh being the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9.
[28]  In this message we come to the third step of God's move in man.
[29]  God was born into the womb of a virgin, and after nine months Jesus was born out of that virgin.
[30]  The very One by the name of Jesus Christ was crucified on the cross, but God participated in that crucifixion.
[31]  God bought, purchased, the church with His own blood, so the church is so dear, so beloved, in the feeling of God and in the eyes of God.
[32]  Christ also died for all of us 2 Cor 5:14-15 .
[33]  of the Believers to Constitute the Body of Christ
[34]  On the positive side, He released the divine life through His death for the producing of the believers to constitute the Body of Christ John 12:24; 1 Cor 10:17 .
[35]  In this message we want to continue our fellowship concerning the crucifixion of Christ and answer a number of serious questions concerning this crucial part of the move of God in man.
[36]  First, we need to consider how we can say that the death of Christ is the death of God and how the Scriptures show us that Christ's death is God's death.
[37]  Since the manifestation of Christ is the manifestation of God in the flesh, the crucifixion of Christ is also the crucifixion of God.
[38]  There is another verse in the Bible, however, which says that God forsook Christ on the cross.
[39]  Matthew 27:46 says, "And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"
[40]  On the one hand, God never left the Son, but on the other hand, the Son cried out that God had forsaken Him.
[41]  Now we need to consider how we can prove that God in Christ died for everything.
[42]  Now we need to consider how we can prove that when Christ was suffering death on the cross, God was busy there.
[43]  Colossians 2:14 says that when Christ was being crucified on the cross, God was wiping out the handwriting in ordinances, which was against us, contrary to us, nailing it to the cross.
[44]  Christ died on the cross not only for our transgressions, wrongdoings, mistakes, offenses, but also for our sinful nature.
[45]  IN THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 3:18b-20a; Luke 23:46; Rom 4:25b; Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29; 1 Cor 15:45; Eph 2:6a; 1 Pet 1:3; Heb 2:10; John 12:24; 1 Cor 10:17; John 7:38-39; Acts 5:30-31; Eph 1:20-23; Phil 3:10; 2 Cor 4:10 OUTLINE In the move of Christ during His burial 1 Pet 3:18b: The crucifixion of Christ having put Christ to death only in His flesh and not in His spirit His spirit was committed into the hands of the Father at His expiration Luke 23:46 .
[46]  In the resurrection of Christ: Proving that God's requirements were satisfied by the death of Christ for us, that we are justified by God because of Christ's death, and that in Christ, the resurrected One, we are accepted before God; and making the resurrected Christ live within us a life that can be justified by God and is always acceptable to God Rom 4:25b.
[47]  In this message we want to see the move of God in man in the move of Christ during His burial and in the resurrection of Christ.
[48]  When Christ was buried in the tomb physically, He went in His spirit to Hades, and there He was very busy.
[49]  God had to destroy the whole generation of that age because the mixed marriage between the angels and human beings made the human race impure.
[50]  When Christ was crucified, on the one hand, His body was killed; on the other hand, God renewed, empowered, His spirit.
[51]  I. IN THE MOVE OF CHRIST DURING HIS BURIAL A. The Crucifixion of Christ
[52]  The crucifixion of Christ put Christ to death only in His flesh, in His body, and not in His spirit.
[53]  The resurrection of Christ proves that God's requirements on us sinners were satisfied by the death of Christ for us.
[54]  In the resurrection of Christ, God also made Christ, who was the last Adam in the flesh, the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .
[55]  In John 7 the Lord told us that the Spirit would flow out of our innermost being as rivers of living water vv.
[56]  Hence, the resurrection is the pneumatic Christ as the processed, consummated, compound, and life-giving Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17-18.
[57]  In the resurrection of Christ, God moves in us, and this is God's move in man.
[58]  John 20 tells us that He appeared to Mary early in the morning and then in the evening He appeared to the disciples and breathed Himself into them as the life-giving Spirit v.
[59]  Merely to come on time for the training classes does not in itself build up your character.
[60]  Your character must be built up in resurrection, and character is built up mainly in the sundry things, the small things in your daily life.
[61]  CHAPTER EIGHT IN THE ASCENSION OF CHRIST 1 Scripture Reading: Acts 2:36; Rev 1:5; Acts 5:31; Heb 5:10; 7:3; 8:1, 6; 7:22; 1 John 2:1; Heb 13:20; 1 Pet 5:4; 2:25; Eph 1:20-22 OUTLINE In His ascension Christ being made: Lord the Lord of all, to possess all, after He brought His humanity into God in His resurrection Acts 2:36.
[62]  Christ God's Anointed, to carry out God's commission for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy Acts 2:36.
[63]  Most Christians pay their attention only to the ministry of the Lord on earth when He was in the flesh.
[64]  The second stage is the stage of His work from His ascension to His descension at His second coming.
[65]  Revelation 11 reveals that when the Lord descends in His second coming, He will take the earth with all the nations, making them a part of the eternal kingdom of God v. 15 . At the sounding of the seventh trumpet at the Lord's second coming, not only will the great tribulation end, but also this age will close 16:17 , the mystery of God will be finished 10:7 , and another age, the age of the kingdom, the millennium, will begin.
[66]  Now we want to see the statuses of Christ in His ascension.
[67]  I. The Advocate the Paraclete, the Comforter, the Patron, the One Who Is at Our Side
[68]  CHAPTER NINE IN THE ASCENSION OF CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: 1 John 3:24b; 4:13; Rom 8:11; 2 Tim 4:22; Phil 2:13; Heb 13:21; 2 Cor 13:14; 1 Pet 5:10; Eph 4:3-6, 12 OUTLINE God's move within us in the offices and ministries of Christ in all the above-mentioned statuses: Dwelling in us through His indwelling Spirit in the presence of Christ in our spirit 1 John 3:24b; 4:13; Rom 8:11; 2 Tim 4:22.
[69]  Operating in us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure Phil 2:13.
[70]  Perfecting us in every good work for the fulfilling of His will, doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ Heb 13:21.
[71]  As the Father of all of us, being over all of us, through all of us, and in all of us for the constituting and building up of the Body of Christ in the oneness of His Divine Trinity Eph 4:3 6, 12.
[72]  Christ today is ministering, is working, in His ascension.
[73]  Ephesians 2:6 says that God raised us up together with Christ and "seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus."
[74]  The Bible tells us that Christ is not only in ascension but also in us Col 1:27 .
[75]  If He were working only in ascension, His work would have nothing to do with us, and His work could never be our story as a part of God's history in us.
[76]  In Christ's ascension God dwells in us through His indwelling Spirit in the presence of Christ in our spirit 1 John 3:24b; 4:13; Rom 8:11; 2 Tim 4:22 .
[77]  Whenever we have the presence of Christ within us with a consciousness of the Spirit as the instrument and of the Father as the Dweller, the Triune God is moving in us to write His history, and that history is our story.
[78]  While God is dwelling in us and operating in us to perfect us, He is dispensing, imparting, all His riches into us for our enjoyment in His love through the grace of Christ and the fellowship of the Spirit 2 Cor 13:14 .
[79]  In Christ's ascension God moves within us as the God of all grace, perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding us that we may participate in His eternal glory, into which He has called us in Christ 1 Pet 5:10 .
[80]  CHAPTER TEN IN THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18; Eph 4:11-12, 15-16; Col 2:19; 1 Cor 12:28, 18; Rom 12:3; 1 Cor 12:24, 6; 14:25 OUTLINE In Christ: Christ will build up His church Matt 16:18.
[81]  He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers for the perfecting of the saints unto the building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:11-12.
[82]  Such a subject may not seem to be very organic, but the building up of the church as the Body of Christ is altogether an organic matter within our being.
[83]  In the building up of the Body of Christ, God moves intrinsically, not in an outward way.
[84]  When I was young, I was instructed that the term the Body of Christ was merely a metaphor signifying what the church is to Christ.
[85]  The church is built in Christ, and it is also built by God.
[86]  In Ephesians 4 it is Christ who gave the apostles, prophets, and teachers v. 11 , but in 1 Corinthians 12 it is God who placed these members in the church.
[87]  First Corinthians 12:24 says that God has blended the Body together.
[88]  THE NEW JERUSALEM Scripture Reading: Heb 11:10; Gal 4:26; Heb 12:22; Rev 3:12; 2:7; 20:4-6; Col 2:19; Eph 4:13; Col 1:28b; Rev 14:1-4, 14-16; 21:1-3, 9-23; 22:1-5 OUTLINE The New Jerusalem being the city with foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God and for which the Old Testament saints such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob eagerly waited Heb 11:10.
[89]  In Genesis 1 and 2, we are told that God created the heavens and the earth with man as the center.
[90]  Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him.
[91]  Thus, we can say that the work of God's new creation occupies the entire Bible except the first two chapters.
[92]  The new creation work of God began from Genesis 3, not from Matthew 1.
[93]  We should not forget that God's work for the new creation began in Genesis 3.
[94]  Eventually, both Adam and Abel became a part of God's new creation work, so they will be a part of the material for building up the New Jerusalem.
[95]  But at that time He was not yet in the disciples, so He prayed that the Father would give them another Comforter that He might be with them forever v. 16 . The Lord said that when this Comforter would come, He would be in the disciples as the Spirit of reality v. 17 . Furthermore, He told them that on the day of resurrection, they would know that He was in the Father, that they were in Him, and that He was in them v. 20 . Before that time, He was in the Father, and the Father was in Him, but He was not in the disciples.
[96]  In His mercy He is operating within us to cause us to love Him so that He can grow within us.
[97]  If it were not for His mercy, we would not be here.
[98]  Today God is moving in the overcomers by growing in them Col 2:19 .
[99]  He is making them mature to arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Eph 4:13; Col 1:28b .
[100]  The holy city as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in, and God and the Lamb as the temple 21:22 are for the redeemed saints to dwell in. In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place for God and man for eternity.
