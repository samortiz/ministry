<h2 class="head1">HAVING COLLEGE CONFERENCES<br />
IN THE SUMMER AND WINTER</h2>
<p>We need to take the college students to the mountains many times, at least twice a year. The mountain trip can last longer than the trip for the younger students. The conference for the junior high school students can be two to three days, but for the college students, it is best to have at least one more day. There should be a college conference during the winter holidays and during the summer vacation. The college conference should be by region. The churches in northern Taiwan can have a joint college conference, the churches in central Taiwan can have a conference, and the churches in southern Taiwan can also have a conference. Every region should have a college conference instead of one large conference for the whole island. A large conference will use too many resources and will not be as fruitful.</p>
<p>The location for the college conference needs to be carefully considered. We must seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading. The church in Taipei does not have an adequate facility. Hall one is not large enough for the whole church. The church in Taipei does not have a meeting place where the whole church can gather. It has to rent a place when the whole church comes together. This is inconvenient. If the conference site is not adequate and does not provide sufficient accommodation, some students may have to stay in either the meeting halls or in the saints&rsquo; homes. Even if the messages are uplifting, the time that it takes to travel between the meeting place and their hospitality would be a distraction to the students and will reduce the effectiveness of the conference.</p>
<p>The practice of the saints in Brazil is quite good. For their gatherings, they purchased a piece of property that is about one hundred acres. In order to do a long-term work, we need property. If it is not easy to find such a place in the city of Taipei, it is better to look in the suburbs. Every six months there should be a weeklong college conference. Not more than two thousand college students can gather together for a week and be trained in life, truth, and the gospel. We do not need to have only one speaker for the college conference. Several co-workers can coordinate together for the speaking. We have much material that can be used. If we have a proper place, we can be certain that we will have results. All those in the college conference will be fed spiritual meals for seven days and will be satisfied.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO YEARS OF SERVICE AFTER GRADUATION</h2>
<p>The gospel work should begin with the children. The children in elementary school should be nurtured by the children&rsquo;s work. When they enter junior high school, there will already be a gospel work with the junior high students. Then as they proceed to high school, they will be cultivated by the gospel work in the high schools. During the time they are at college, they will be perfected. If a person is gained in the first year of college, instead of through children&rsquo;s work, the serving ones should take him to the mountains once every semester for a week of training. In four years he would have attended eight mountain trips. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, after eight mountain trips, when he graduates from college, he will continue with two years in the full-time training. Imagine how many thousands of serving ones there will be after a period of time!</p>
<p>If the young people can be perfected from elementary school, through junior high school, high school, college, and two years in the full-time training, they will know whether or not they will serve full time after the training. I believe that at least one out of ten students will give themselves to serve full time for the rest of their life, and the rest will probably get a job. The ones who are trained will be different even if they get a job, because they have a solid foundation in the truth and have been gained by the Lord. Therefore, when they enter into society to work, they will still be working for the Lord. For this reason, the full-timers who are laboring in the gospel work in the schools must be clear and have this goal. This is the goal of the work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We begin our labor with the children and continue with those in junior high school, high school, and college so that they continue with two years of full-time service in the church. This plan is much superior to any plan set up by a seminary.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GRASPING THE OPPORTUNITY WITH NEW STUDENTS DURING ORIENTATION</h2>
<p>We should also grasp the opportunity with the incoming new students during their orientation. Two brothers once testified that they contacted five hundred new medical students during orientation. This is a good way to contact the students. The best time for a college student to receive the gospel is during his first semester as a freshman. It is easy for a person to receive the gospel when he is undergoing change. If we miss this window of opportunity, that is, the new student&rsquo;s transition from high school to college, we will miss the best time for the gospel. It will be much more difficult to gain the students later. For this reason, we should try our best to preach the gospel to freshmen at the beginning of a semester. The brothers have done a good job in this aspect. Eighty percent of their labor during orientation has been good, but our follow-up is still lacking. If we can take care of the follow-up more thoroughly, more people will be saved. We need to grasp the opportunity during the freshmen orientation.</p>
<p>Our labor can be compared to harvesting wheat in northern China. In May, when the wheat is ripe, none of the farmers are concerned about eating or sleeping. The old people have a saying: &ldquo;The wheat is falling; are you still sleeping?&rdquo; Once the wheat is ripe it must be harvested immediately; otherwise, it will fall to the ground. When the wheat is ripe, no one can sleep peacefully. All the wheat must be harvested in half a day. The new students coming into the schools can be likened to the wheat falling off the stalk. We must not be bothered with anything else, not the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting or any other matters, other than the new students. If we cannot gain eighty percent of the new students, we should at least gain fifty percent. We must grasp this opportunity.</p>
<p>We must also be thick-skinned when we preach the gospel, and we must be sure of what we preach, just as a salesman must be thick-skinned, not shy but confident of his product and confident that the customer will buy it from him. A salesman who can guide a customer in a simple way to buy his product has made a sale.</p>
<p>We still need further study concerning how to put everything into practice. Please do not pay lip service to our fellowship, but outline a way and hit the target. This requires much effort. Our goal is to gain people. Whatever way by which we can gain people is the way we will take. We must take the time and make the effort to study this. In principle, whether we serve full time or part time and are under thirty years old, our labor in the gospel should be in the schools. The saints who are over thirty years old can participate in all areas with the gospel.</p>
