   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TAKING IN THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A few days ago I had a painful toothache.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I had to have it treated in the emergency room of the hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I had gotten an infection from a dead tooth which was decaying.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After some surgery, I was given thirty tablets of antibiotics to kill the infection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There was no need to ask the surgeon to kill the bacteria.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I myself had to take the tablets.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then the killing power would get into me and take care of the germs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In our natural being there are many germs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The antibiotic is the compound Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must take Him in.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Besides an antibiotic to kill the germs, we need nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Antibiotics kill infection, but they do not provide us with nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need the proper food to supply us and maintain us in good health.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The antibiotic of the death of Christ kills the germs, and the nourishing food of the resurrection of Christ supplies us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of course, we must be sure to take the antibiotics and the food.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I had left my tablets on the table instead of taking them as I had been directed, there would have been no killing of my infection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I may be provided with the most nourishing food, but if I do not eat it, it will not do me any good.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without the medicine and the food, my infection might flare up again in a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How do we take in the compound Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Over fifty years ago I heard our pastor say that Jesus is the heavenly manna, the bread of life that came down from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He spoke many times from John 6 but never told us how to take this bread or eat the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I really did not discover the secret until 1958, thirty-three years after I got saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then I gave a message in Taipei on eating Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After the meeting a brother who was a professor came up and shook hands with me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He said, "Brother Lee, tonight's message is good."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I waited, because I knew something was not good!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"But to use the word eat," he continued, "especially to say that we must eat Jesus, is a little wild."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Brother," I replied, "I am not the first one who is wild.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus was.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said in John 6:57, He who eats Me shall also live because of Me.'</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord did tell us to eat Him."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You may have heard sermons on Jesus as the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Were you ever told how to eat this bread?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You were probably told that to eat the living bread is to meditate on the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I tried that way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I would read a portion of the Word and then close my eyes to meditate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before very many minutes went by, the fowls of the air would come to visit!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My father-in-law would come to mind, or my thoughts would travel to Hong Kong, or London, or New York!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was not until 1958 that the Lord showed me how necessary it is that we eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How are we to eat?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From John 6 it is clear that the Lord Jesus cannot be separated from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After saying that we must eat of this bread v. 51 and that He Himself is eatable vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>55-57 , the Lord goes on to say, "It is the Spirit Who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life" v. 63 . In this one verse are two key words: the Spirit and the word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have the word in the Bible and the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These are the means by which we can eat and drink of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By Pray-reading the Word</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The way to eat the Lord is to pray the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even before 1958 we did have some experience of coming to the Bible in a prayerful way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We would read a portion, and then pray over the verses we had read.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We would even use the verses themselves as our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We came to the Word not with a reading mind but with a praying spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this way we were nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After 1958 the saints who were helped by that message began to practice eating Jesus by eating the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Gradually pray-reading became common among us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We found out that the best way to get spiritual nourishment from the Word of God is not only to read it but also to pray it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we read, we use our eyes to see, our mind to understand, and our heart to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we pray, we exercise our spirit to digest what we understand and receive.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To pray-read the Word of God is to exercise our spirit to digest the Word rather than our mind to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All of us who pray-read can testify what nourishment we receive from it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To eat, then, is to take the Lord in by praying His Word.</S>
