<h1 class="msg">Lesson Twenty-Four</h1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CHRIST IN ETERNITY</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Scripture Reading</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Rev. 20:11-12, 15; 2 Pet. 3:10; Rev. 21:1-2; Jn. 1:29; Psa. 46:4; Ezek. 47:5-9; Jn. 7:38; 6:35, 57; Rev. 2:7; 22:14, 19; 21:9; 22:17.</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Outline</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The redeeming God</li>	<li>The river of water of life</li>	<li>The tree of life</li>	</ol><li>The Spirit and the bride</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Text</H2><P>At the end of the millennial kingdom Satan will be thrown into the lake of fire to burn forever. Then, Christ will sit on the great white throne to judge the dead unbelievers of all the ages. In Revelation 20, John wrote, "And I saw a great white throne and Him Who sat upon it, from Whose face earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by the things which were written in the books, according to their works....And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire" (vv. 11-12, 15).</P><P>After this judgment, the old heaven and the old earth will pass away and eternity will begin with a new heaven and a new earth (2 Pet. 3:10; Rev. 21:1). By then, Christ will have eliminated every negative thing in the universe including Satan, his followers, and the world. Then the purpose of the ages will have been fulfilled. Through Christ's work, man will have been fully redeemed, transformed, glorified, and built up into the corporate expression of the Triune God. What a Christ! What an accomplishment!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE NEW JERUSALEM<br>IN THE NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH</H2><P>In eternity, Christ will continue to rule, to feed, and to supply His people. Old things will have passed away. The new heaven and new earth will be brought in and the New Jerusalem will descend from God out of heaven. The New Jerusalem is not a physical city; rather it symbolizes what God is to His people and how His people will be fully mingled with Him. In the center of this symbolic city is the throne of God and of the Lamb, out from which flows a river of water of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Redeeming God</H2><P>In the New Jerusalem we will still know Christ as our redeeming God. In Revelation 22:1 we see the throne of God and of the Lamb. There is only one throne since God is in the Lamb and the Lamb is in God. This Lamb is the redeeming God. Because man fell, the creating God became a man (John 1:1, 14), and this man was called the Lamb of God (John 1:29). The creating God became the redeeming God to take away the sins of the world. Praise the Lord that we have been saved by the redeeming God! We were condemned to be in the eternal lake of fire; but instead, for eternity we shall thank the "Lamb-God" that He saved us. We shall have an eternal remembrance of His great redemption. Praise the "Lamb-God!"</P>
