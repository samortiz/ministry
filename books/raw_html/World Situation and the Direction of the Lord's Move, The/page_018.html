 <h2 class="head2">To Serve in the Spirit<br />
according to the Divine Revelation</h2>
<p>We also need to serve in the Spirit according to the divine revelation. In the past, did we serve in the Spirit according to the Scriptures? The Spirit surely did not guide us and lead us to serve in the old, traditional, and unscriptural way of meeting and serving. We have to change our way to the new way of meeting and serving. Human culture changes and advances as time goes on, and people need to change to live in this culture. By saying that we need to change, I do not mean that we have to follow the world or fashion ourselves according to the world.</p>
<p>In our work to spread the divine truths, we should always serve in the Spirit. Before I minister the word, I always take some time to pray, &ldquo;Lord, here I am again. You must fill me up with Yourself. You must infuse me with Your desire, with Your intention, with Your feeling, with Your thought, with Your word, Your utterance, and Your expression. Fill me, Lord, and pour Yourself out upon me to be my impact. I don&rsquo;t want to speak just by myself. I want to speak in You as in one spirit with You. I pray that You would speak in my speaking.&rdquo; We need to serve in the Spirit in such a way.</p>
<p>Our serving in the Spirit should also be according to the divine revelation in the Scriptures. We should consider how the Bible tells us to preach the gospel. The scriptural way is to preach the gospel by contacting people one by one. Then we need to be like nursing mothers to feed the new ones (1 Thes. 2:7) and like teaching fathers to raise them up in home meetings (2:11). We also need to have group meetings to perfect them so that they can do the work of the New Testament ministry as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers do (Eph. 4:12). We also need to have larger church meetings, encouraging everybody to prophesy (1 Cor. 14:23-25, 31). This is the biblical way.</p>
<p>We all need to function as priests of the gospel. We have seen the truth revealed in Romans 15:16 concerning the priesthood of the gospel. In this verse Paul said that he was a priest of the gospel of God, presenting the saved nations as sacrifices to God. Preaching the gospel is not merely a matter of getting sinners saved or of winning souls; it is a matter of gaining sacrifices to offer to God. When we go out, we must serve in the Spirit according to the Scriptures as priests of the gospel of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Meet according to the God-ordained Way<br />
as Revealed in the New Testament</h2>
<p>We need to meet according to the God-ordained way as revealed in the New Testament, fully in mutuality, avoiding the one-man ministry, and abhorring the system of clergy and laity, for worshipping God, remembering the Lord, praying, saving sinners, feeding the new believers, perfecting the saints, and building up the church as the organic Body of Christ, without any element of the traditional way, formality, and ritual (1 Cor. 14:25; 11:25; Matt. 18:19-20; Acts 12:12; Rom. 15:16; John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; Heb. 10:24-25; Eph. 4:12; 1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 31). We need to study the truth concerning the God-ordained way. We have published many messages on the God-ordained way, and we need to read these messages.</p>
<p>The God-ordained way of meeting is in mutuality not in plurality. In the eldership we should have plurality, that is, a number of elders. But the church meetings are not a matter of plurality but of mutuality. We may arrange to have ten or twenty speak in the meeting. This is plurality. But when the meeting is open for everybody to speak, this is mutuality. I speak, and you listen; then you speak, and I listen. This is mutuality. Mutuality, not plurality, is the biblical way. The biblical way is for the church meetings to be open for everybody to function.</p>
<p>We have to practice all the aspects of the God-ordained way. Then we will be qualified to go to Europe. Europe has changed and is still changing. The people there will not accept anything old. Many of them have dropped atheism and communism. They like democracy and they want to know the things concerning God as the Bible reveals, but they do not want any kind of empty religion. This is why we have to learn to minister Christ to people according to the God-ordained way revealed in the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE MATTER<br />
OF FELLOWSHIP WITH THE SAINTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">In Our Meetings, Which Are Grounded on the<br />
Unique Oneness of the Body of Christ, Receiving<br />
All Real Believers in Christ without Any Terms</h2>
<p>In our meetings, which are grounded on the unique oneness of the Body of Christ, we receive all real believers in Christ without any terms (Rom. 14:1, 3; 15:7). Any term or condition added to the faith in Christ, which is the unique term for us to be members of Christ, causes divisions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Attending, if Necessary, the Christian Meetings<br />
Which are Grounded on the Unique Oneness<br />
of the Body of Christ, without<br />
Trying to Adjust, Correct, or Improve<br />
the Way of Their Service and Meeting</h2>
<p>We should attend, if necessary, the Christian meetings which are grounded on the unique oneness of the Body of Christ, without trying to adjust, correct, or improve the way of their service and meeting. We should avoid going to other meetings that are not grounded on the unique oneness of the Body of Christ. We should go to Europe to have a new start with the Lord&rsquo;s new way. Our time is short, so we should spend it to contact people in a new way with the high gospel, the deeper truths, and the Christian experience.</p>
