 <h2 class="head1">CARING FOR NOTHING BUT BEING<br />
DRIVEN BY THE LAMPS OF FIRE</h2>
<p>The burning of the fiery lamps is not only for shining and burning but also for motivating. Lightnings, voices, and thunders come forth out of the throne, and before the throne are seven burning lamps of fire for impelling us. Perhaps some would say that they cannot do it. The more we do not do something, the more we cannot do it. This is a principle in the Bible. To everyone who has, more shall be given, and he shall abound; but from him who does not have, that is, who does not use what he has, even that which he has shall be taken away from him (Matt. 25:28-29). We cannot do it simply because we do not do it. I can do it because I have done it many times. The more I do it, the more I can do it.</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, today in the church the seven lamps of fire are burning not only to shine on us and to burn us, but even more to motivate us. If there were a raging fire in front of us, would we not run from it? We would not stand here to appreciate it. Once a fire starts burning, everyone moves. When the seven lamps of fire are burning in the local churches, will all the churches in the different localities start moving? Certainly they will! Today we are not only in the Holy Place; we are before the throne, which is the center of God&rsquo;s administration. The throne is God&rsquo;s move and God&rsquo;s economy. The seven lamps of fire are burning here to impel us.</p>
<p>According to my observation, there are at least five thousand active members in the church in Taipei. If every one hundred of you are responsible for a full-timer, at least fifty people can go full-time. Never mind whether or not you are qualified; the Lord is coming soon, so let us serve with our full time. When I was young, I had a very good job. My monthly income was more than enough to cover the expenses of five households. One day, the Lord came to me. He called me and forced me to leave my job to do His work. I said, &ldquo;O Lord! On what should I depend for my living?&rdquo; The Lord said, &ldquo;I will be responsible.&rdquo; I believed, yet I had unbelief. However, since the Lord wanted me, there was nothing I could do. Therefore, I said to Him, &ldquo;O Lord, I will follow You. I am determined to eat the roots of trees and drink water from the mountain to preach the gospel for You.&rdquo; Hence, I resigned from my job. When my father-in-law heard this, he shook his head and said, &ldquo;There is no fool like you. Can&rsquo;t you go to work in the daytime and preach messages at night and on Sundays? Besides, your income can help those who are in need. Now that you have forsaken your job, what is your family going to live on?&rdquo; I said in my heart, &ldquo;I will eat tree roots and drink water from the mountain,&rdquo; but I praise the Lord that for these many years, I never had to eat tree roots or drink water from the mountain. Hallelujah, the Lord is living!</p>
<p>When I was sent by the work to Taiwan, the work did not supply even one dollar for me. For a household of twelve, I only had a little over three hundred dollars. However, the land for the meeting halls of several principal churches on this island were purchased with the money from my ministry here. You may ask me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, where does your money come from?&rdquo; There is always a place it comes from: It descends from heaven. The Lord knows that I am prepared to eat tree roots and drink water from the mountain. Nevertheless, praise the Lord, He has given us what we have not asked for, even superabundantly above all that we ask or think.</p>
<p>My point is this, brothers and sisters: Our God is a trustworthy God, and He is true and living. Young people, there is no need to consider your future. The most glorious future is to serve Him. No other future is more honorable than this. Do not look at the present. At present, you may ask what you will do without a job. There is no way according to the earth, but there is a way according to heaven. There is no way with man, but there is a way with God. I encourage you to know the age; the time is short. The throne is in the church, and the seven lamps before the throne are burning here, not only to illuminate and burn us, but even more to motivate us, to impel us. How happy I am to see many young ones rising up to be the succeeding generations! I do not want to merely excite you, but I hope that among us the seven lamps of fire are burning. The Lord is here and He is speaking. Do not be worried about your future and your environment; the environment is in His hand. We thank the Lord that He has blessed Taiwan, and we believe that He will continue to bless it. We should seize the opportunity and try our best to preach the gospel and bring the testimony of the church to different cities, towns, and villages; this is our responsibility. Today the seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne in the Holy Place.</p>
