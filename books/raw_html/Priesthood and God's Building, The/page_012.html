        <h2 class="head1">THE LORD AS THE KING AND THE PRIEST<br />
BEING THE WATER OF LIFE FLOWING<br />
FROM THE THRONE</h2>
<p>In Revelation 21 and 22 there is a throne as well as a river of water of life. The throne points to authority, and the river of water of life points to fellowship. The matters of authority and fellowship run throughout the entire New Jerusalem, which is built with gold, pearl, and precious stones, because authority and fellowship, fellowship and authority, run through the entire city. The throne shows that the Lord is the King, bringing God&rsquo;s people under His authority, and the river of water of life shows that the Lord is the Priest, bringing God&rsquo;s people into the fellowship of His life.</p>
<p>Whenever the Lord is on the throne with authority, life flows. In other words, whenever the Lord exercises His authority, fellowship flows freely. If there is authority and order among us, this authority and order will enable the Lord&rsquo;s life to flow among us, causing us to fully be in fellowship. This is because the river of water of life proceeds out of the throne. On the one hand, wherever there is the throne, there is the flow of life, the fellowship of life. On the other hand, the fellowship of life ushers in the authority of the throne; that is, wherever the river of water of life flows, there is the authority of the throne. The flow of life brings the authority of the throne, which flows, moves, and spirals throughout the entire New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is full of glory with God&rsquo;s presence, God&rsquo;s light, God&rsquo;s supply of life, and God&rsquo;s way of life, which is the unique street. Moreover, the flow of life produces gold, pearl, and precious stones and builds these materials together. The New Jerusalem has both fellowship and authority because the water of life flows out of the throne. This is fellowship with authority and authority with fellowship, running throughout the city in a balanced way.</p>
<p>The throne with living water flowing out of it is the consummate depiction in the Bible of the Lord Jesus as both King and Priest. There is no better picture to illustrate the Lord Jesus being both King and Priest than the river of water of life flowing out of the throne. The throne speaks of the Lord Jesus as the King, who brings God&rsquo;s authority to His people, and the river of water of life speaks of the Lord Jesus as the Priest, who brings God&rsquo;s people into the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. The river of water of life refers to the Spirit (John 7:38-39). The flowing life of God is in the Spirit; thus, the Spirit is the fellowship. The Lord Jesus is the Priest who brings God&rsquo;s people into fellowship, that is, into the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, as both King and Priest, brings us under God&rsquo;s authority as well as into God&rsquo;s fellowship so that we may have God&rsquo;s authority and God&rsquo;s fellowship. When these two offices converge, there is also the counsel of peace. In addition, this fellowship and authority are coordinated and balanced because there is a river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God. In this situation there is both a submission to God&rsquo;s authority and a living in fellowship with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RELEASING THE SPIRIT BY MEANS OF ALL PRAYER</h2>
<p>The saints among us have always submitted to the authority of the church and kept a proper order. As a result, there has been no confusion. This is God&rsquo;s mercy. However, I still have a heavy feeling that we have not entered fully into the matter of fellowship; that is, there is not much fellowship in spirit among us and not much flow of life. We need to enjoy this fellowship daily. Hence, our present need is to enter continually into this fellowship. This fellowship is in the Spirit of life. We all need to be in spirit and allow the life in the Spirit to flow. The key to entering into this experience is for our spirits to be released so that we may fellowship in Spirit and blend in spirit with all the saints.</p>
<p>The way to release our spirit is through prayer. If we do not pray, our spirit will not be released. Hence, we must be diligent to learn to pray. In this regard, there is no distinction between personal or corporate prayer. We should exercise our spirit when we pray personally and when we pray corporately. We should exercise when we pray at home, when we pray with two or three, and when we pray in the meetings of the church. From morning until evening, we should pray continually, and then our spirit will be released through prayer.</p>
<p>Within every believer there is a spirit of prayer, a spirit of fellowship. This spirit is like an egg that is waiting to be hatched. Many believers, however, have a spirit that is like an unhatched egg. Within an egg there is the life of a chicken, but without hatching, this life cannot take shape and manifest the chicken. The egg must be hatched so that the life within the egg can begin to grow. In order for a chicken to grow, the shell must be broken so that the baby chick can be released. There are several thousand saints in the church in Taipei who can be likened to unhatched eggs. If the brothers and sisters in the church in Taipei would begin to pray every day, like the one hundred twenty who were in the upper room in Jerusalem (Acts 1:13-14), I believe that everyone&rsquo;s spirit would be released. If we are willing to spend the time to &ldquo;hatch our eggs,&rdquo; there would be a living expression in the church.</p>
<p>We need to ask ourselves whether or not our spirit has been released. If the shell of our spirit has not been broken, we must use prayer to release the life within us. We must pray continually until our spirit comes forth. From this time forward, we must find brothers or sisters with whom we can pray.</p>
<p>When we pray, we should not worry about having a topic. There are plenty of topics. We can pray for the building of the church. We can pray for the release of our spirit. We can pray for the blending in the spirit. We can pray for anything and everything. The topic of prayer is not as important as the release, the coming forth, of our spirit. The more we pray, the more exercised we will be and the more we will pray in spirit. When we begin to pray in this way, we may still use our mind and our intellect. But as we continue to pray, we will turn from our mind to our spirit. Then, as we continue to pray, we will be in the spirit. If we exercise in this way for an extended period of time, we will be in spirit whenever we open our mouth.</p>
<p>A person who does not pray very often will surely be in his mind when he opens his mouth to pray. This is because his spirit is not very exercised, and it is not very responsive to the Spirit. However, if our spirit has been exercised, our spirit will come forth as soon as we open our mouth.</p>
<p>We all need to exercise to release our spirit when we are in the meetings. We should learn to release our spirit to pray as soon as we arrive at the bread-breaking meeting. Remembering the Lord, praising the Lord, and giving thanks to Him are very good topics for prayer. We can use these topics to release our spirit in prayer. We should practice this way in the meetings, and when we come together to fellowship, we should grasp the opportunity to pray and release our spirit. In this way, the saints will come under the authority of God and enter into the fellowship of God. Thus, the offices of the kingship and the priesthood will converge and be balanced in the experience of the saints. We must arrive at this point in order to build the church.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
