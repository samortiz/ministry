   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE AGGREGATE OF THE DIVINE BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE GOSPEL GIVEN TO US</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Galatians 3:14 shows us that the Spirit is the aggregate, the totality, of the divine blessing of the gospel given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This blessing is all-embracing and all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a blessing includes redemption, regeneration, the divine life, righteousness, justification, sanctification, transformation, and renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>DOING EVERYTHING AND BEING EVERYTHING</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>BY THE SPIRIT, WITH THE SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>IN THE SPIRIT, AND THROUGH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today in our Christian life we Christians should just deal with this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since we have life and live by Him, we also should walk by Him Gal 5:25; Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should do everything and be everything by the Spirit, with the Spirit, in the Spirit, and through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should pray by the Spirit, read the Bible by the Spirit, love others by the Spirit, and preach the gospel by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Galatians 6:18 indicates that the Spirit as the all-inclusive grace is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must treasure the two spirits in Galatians the divine Spirit as the aggregate of the divine blessing to us and the human spirit as the receiver, the container, the keeper, of the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, we need to take care of our spirit, doing everything by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then we will experience the divine Spirit living in us, making His home in us, and transforming us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The divine Spirit lives in us to pray, to read the Bible, to speak God's word, to love our spouse, and to visit sinners for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such a living is the mingling of the processed Triune God with the regenerated tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the divine revelation in the New Testament as the answer to the sufferings of Job and to the great question concerning God's purpose in His creation of man and in His dealing with His chosen people.</S>
