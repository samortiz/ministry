   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PREACHING THE GOSPEL TO FULFILL GOD S DESIRE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church life is not only great for our enjoyment; it also is great in God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From eternity past, God planned to have this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His enemy, Satan, has been frustrating Him from achieving this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have the deep sense that today is the end time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the close of this age, God has revealed His heart to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot say that we have not seen His heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His desire is that a group of His chosen people would practice the real church life with His Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are here on earth for this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is worthwhile to give all we are for this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I had ten lives, I would give every one of them for this cause.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I would spend one life in Africa, another in Europe, and another in Australia.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As you go to the campuses, do not carry on a so-called work of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Go there to be people living, walking, moving, and working in the spirit as a true testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We do not preach the gospel simply because we love sinners and want to see them saved from hell to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the concept of poor Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our burden is to preach the gospel in order to bring people into a glorious vision, into the participation of Christ, and into God s standard in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What goal is higher than this?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you are an ambitious young person, you must take this as your ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our eyes need to be open to see what a wonderful person is the Christ whom we experience in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This wonderful Christ is for us to have the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the church life today we have a foretaste of the full taste to come in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How great it is to experience Christ and to live in the church life!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>CONTACTING PEOPLE IN A NORMAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you go to the campuses, do not shout, saying, Don t you know that I am here?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have come with Christ from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you do this, others will think that you are mentally disturbed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Be a normal person, a proper human being with a stately and weighty humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You even need to be shining with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But do not declare anything or label yourself in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Simply be a common and normal person who can easily contact others and be contacted by them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you live, walk, and behave in the spirit, then you will be a common person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not attempt to be holy, angelic, or spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, be a neat, clean, normal human being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You all need to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not make yourself peculiar or contact people in an abnormal way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not conduct yourself like a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Often, preachers are not very human.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Consider how peculiar are the monks in Buddhism and Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They dress in strange garments and, by so doing, label themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must let people see how human we are.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As you read the four Gospels, you will see that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was a common person, living a normal human life with a weighty humanity yet without being peculiar in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His humanity was clean, high, right, and shining.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we also are like this, there will be no need to label ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we speak to people, they will realize that we are human and common.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But they will also recognize that we have a certain something, and this will cause them to respect us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although you may be just nineteen years old, your professor will consider you to be quite weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE NEED TO HAVE A BURDEN</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We also need to pray to be burdened, saying, Lord, burden me with Your commission.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Burden me with Your move and Your economy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you would all go to the Lord and pray like this, after one prevailing prayer you will be burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You will be burdened with the Lord s present economy and with His commission to go to people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to work for the Lord we must have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I believe that you all can testify that I truly have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When I speak with a burden, I do not speak vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I do not like to speak without a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Young people, you must go to the campus with a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This burden should not simply be the burden of the gospel construed in the terms of Christianity, but the burden of God s up-to-date move.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have a heavy burden and the clear understanding that the Lord desires to accomplish His recovery in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The only way He can do this is to gain the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord s up-to-date economy is to gain young people, not only in this country but in all the leading countries for His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Pray to be burdened with this commission.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You should all be able to say, The purpose of my life is not to be a scholar or a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>My life is for the Lord s up-to-date burden.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I do have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For this burden I study and work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For this burden I am what I am today.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Pray that you might become burdened in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It means a great deal to have a burden like this.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If I had come to this country without having this kind of burden, I would have given up by now.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But since I am burdened, nothing can quench me.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I do not care about the opposition, attacks, and rumors.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I only care for the burden with which I am burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I can testify that the Lord honors this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whenever you have been burdened by Him, He will honor that burden.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is why I have said many times that this work is not mine; it is something wrought by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The attacks are not directed against me, but against the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>One day, the opposers will know that they have been attacking His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This work is not a work accomplished by a man; it is a work according to the divine burden.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When you go to the campus, go with such a divine burden.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Do not shout at people, but in your spirit remind Satan that you have come with a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Many times I have spoken to Satan, saying, Do not touch this work.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is being done according to a burden from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is not something of me, but of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After you pray to the Lord and speak to people, you need to talk to Satan, telling him to stay away from you because you have a burden from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Get this burden and go with it.</S>
