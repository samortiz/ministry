   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the days ahead we may suffer more misunderstanding and more severe opposition; but since we have been destined for this we should remain faithful....Brothers, please continue to remember me in your prayers so that in all my afflictions I may be able to stand fast, faithfully bearing a good testimony for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Just a few more miles beloved;</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And our feet shall ache no more;</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No more sin, and no more sorrow;</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hush thee, Jesus went before;</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And I hear Him sweetly whispering,</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This issue was completed in the midst of much suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I know that Satan and his evil spirits are very busy, for he is aware that the message of The Present Testimony is harmful to him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, both the message and the one who preaches it are the objects of his attack.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this reason I beg all the brothers in the Lord to supply me with more prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The various temptations, oppressions, misunderstandings, and hardships which come can weaken even the physically strongest one, to say nothing of someone like me whose earthly tabernacle is often being shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is difficult to become a martyr, but it is also difficult to become an apostate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is difficult to be faithful, but even more difficult to lose chastity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To restrain our lips is indeed painful, but to vindicate ourselves does not bring joy either.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We care only to work faithfully, keeping the first love and maintaining a single eye while waiting for the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Did not the Lord tell us from the outset that we must bear the cross and encounter sufferings on this earth?</S>
