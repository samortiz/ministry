 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE SCRIPTURAL WAY<br />
TO MEET AND TO SERVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 13:52; Gal. 5:16; Rom. 8:4</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL,<br />
FITTING THE TASTE<br />
OF THE LIVING AND SPIRITUAL MAN, AND<br />
REQUIRING MAN TO BE LIVING AND IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The scriptural way to meet and to serve is in contrast to the traditional way. In chapter four we saw that the traditional way to meet and to serve is natural, fitting man&rsquo;s natural and fallen condition, not requiring man to be living and in the spirit, religious, and adopting the way of human society for religion. In contrast to this, the scriptural way to meet and to serve is spiritual, fitting the taste of the living and spiritual man, and requiring man to be living and in the spirit. It requires him to confess his sins, failures, and wrongdoings thoroughly and to deal with all negative things, and it requires him to be filled with the Spirit (Acts 13:52), living and walking in and according to the spirit (Gal. 5:16; Rom. 8:4). Furthermore, it is against the religious and social way of meeting and service and is unpleasant to the natural man.</p>
<p>When we were in the denominations, we attended meetings in the traditional way. As long as we were either not saved or saved but deadened in our spirit, we felt good about those meetings. Within us was no dissatisfaction or expectation of anything further. We felt that everything there was good, including the silence. However, once we were saved or revived, our spirit was quickened and stirred up to seek the Lord. After this, whenever some of us attended this kind of traditional meeting, we were offended. This way of meeting did not fit our condition. When we were deadened, this way of meeting fit our condition, but once we were made alive, became living, and sought to live a life of seeking after Christ, this way of meeting began to offend us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AGAINST THE RELIGIOUS AND<br />
SOCIAL WAY OF MEETING AND SERVICE</h2>
<p>The scriptural way to meet and to serve surely is against the religious and social way of meeting and service. The religious and social way, as we have seen, is natural, fitting man&rsquo;s natural and fallen condition and not requiring man to be living and in the spirit. The scriptural way is just the opposite. As we have seen, this way is spiritual. It fits the taste of the living and spiritual man and requires man to be living and in the spirit. To take this way we need to be revived, to live a victorious life, and to walk by and according to the spirit. For this way to be prevailing in our meeting and in our service, we also need to have an uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord daily and hourly. We need to contact the Lord from the beginning of each day by calling on His name and pray-reading His Word that we may enjoy Him and be supplied with His riches. We need to speak Him to people all day long whether in season or out of season. To live such a life for the scriptural way to meet and to serve surely requires us always to pay a price. It is absolutely against our natural desire and tendency. It is also against the religious life and social customs. For this we need to pray much and receive grace from the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">UNPLEASANT TO THE NATURAL MAN</h2>
<p>We have seen that the traditional way to meet and to serve fits man&rsquo;s natural and fallen condition. It is surely pleasant to the natural man. But the scriptural way, since it is against the religious life and social customs, could not be pleasant to the natural man&rsquo;s feelings. It is only pleasant to the spiritual man who is living in the spirit to live Christ pleasantly toward God. This does not only change our Christian life and family life but also our church life to overcome fully our natural man in all its aspects.</p>
