   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOREWORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This book is a translation from Chinese of a collection of messages taken from brief meeting notes of Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi and his first wife, Lin I-tien.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Except for some slight adjustments in sentence structure, the majority of the material is presented as found in the manuscripts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The main speakers of these messages are Brother Watchman Nee and Brother Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first section comprises notes of private fellowship between Brother Nee and Brother Weigh in Foochow during September of 1947.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The notes are comparatively scanty in content.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The second section, except for the last chapter, is a record of Brother Witness Lee's first visit to Hong Kong in December, 1947, and the help he rendered to the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It includes four conference meetings, four fellowship meetings, one gospel meeting, and one account of private fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The main burdens of these meetings are the believers' living by the life of God and the proper way to serve in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The last chapter is Brother Lee's testimony given in Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The third section is a record of Brother Lee's words given to the church in Swatow in January, 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It includes eight conference messages, two Lord's Day morning messages, one open talk, and thirteen private talks with a small number of individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The main burden lies in God's way of life and the way to help the whole church to rise up to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fourth section comprises fellowship and messages of a nationwide co-workers' conference in Shanghai during April and May of 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first chapter begins on April 9, and the final chapter ends on May 16.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In total there are thirty-eight days of meetings and fellowship, covering forty-two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During this period, most of Brother Nee's talks were given in the co-workers' meetings rather than in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only a few times did he speak to the whole church in the church conference meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This fellowship is weighty, full of light, sober, and direct.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The main burdens are the way of recovery that the church takes on earth today, the recovery of the Body life, the coordination of the co-workers, ministry and authority, the relationship between the local churches and the work, release from the bondage of money, the way to preach the gospel, and the way to arrive at the universal priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The materials covered are precious and invaluable.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Due to the size of this work, we have divided the series into two volumes, with chapters one to forty-five as the first volume, and chapters forty-six to seventy-nine as the second volume.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>May God bless His church through these messages.</S>
