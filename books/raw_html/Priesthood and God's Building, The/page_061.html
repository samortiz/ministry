        <h2 class="head1">BECOMING MORE USEFUL THROUGH MORE EXERCISE</h2>
<p>When we exercise to contact God, we will be able to supply the saints. The basic requirement for supplying others is our fellowship with the Lord. If we are filled with the Lord inwardly, our spirit will be living and fresh, and there will be no barrier between the Lord and us. Thus, whenever we are with the brothers and sisters, we will be able to contact them in spirit. It is not enough for our spirit to be released; our spirit needs to be released in order to supply others. We should take every opportunity to pray and praise; we should also speak and supply others. We need to have such a spirit, a spirit that is fresh, living, strong, open, and easily released.</p>
<p>We need to exercise our spirit in order for its function to be strengthened, just as we need to exercise our physical body in order to strengthen our body. This is a principle in the Bible. Luke 8:18 says, &ldquo;Whoever has, it shall be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him.&rdquo; The more we exercise our spirit, the stronger our spirit will become and the richer its function will be. In contrast, the less we exercise, the weaker we will become. I hope that all the responsible brothers will fellowship with the Lord more and exercise more.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE FUNCTIONING</h2>
<p>All the brothers and sisters should function and supply others according to their respective portions. We need to consider the condition of those who are in the meeting. If a brother who seldom comes to the meeting is present, we should show concern for him. If a brother is absent several times, we should visit him and invite him to come again. When he comes to the meeting, we should speak a few words of concern and greeting, and after the meeting we can walk with him to the street. Sometimes because of this simple care, the Lord will lead him to come to the meeting the following week. This can be compared to the circulation of blood in the body. Even a small amount of blood circulation can have a great influence and prevent a serious illness. If we function to care for people, we will become living and be able to supply others. Hence, we should not think that we are unable to do anything because we are not a leading one. There are many things that we can do.</p>
<p>In the small &ldquo;classes&rdquo; everyone can be a supplier. Sometimes the prayer of a brother is a little weak, but it is still possible to add to and strengthen his prayer; there is no need to correct him. This will be a helpful demonstration to him, and unconsciously, he will learn something. The fellowship in the &ldquo;class&rdquo; should not fill the time to the point that the saints are unresponsive; everyone should endeavor to add something according to their portion. In this way there will be a rich supply.</p>
<p>Sometimes after the fellowship, there may still be a need to strengthen the crucial points. When someone brings out a crucial point and we have a feeling to follow him, we should strengthen the point. We need to learn to coordinate to the point that we are speaking as one person. A basketball player needs training in both personal skills and in coordination with others. Basketball is not a game for individuals; it is a team sport. Similarly, our priestly service is not a matter of individual service; it is a matter of corporate service. A basketball team passes the ball around, and in our meetings we should mutually coordinate in this way.</p>
<p>The only way to bear this burden is to bear it together. We should labor together. When everyone is serving to carry this burden, the burden will not be too heavy for anyone. Once the weight of a heavy load is distributed among those who are bearing the burden, the weight will not be heavy for just a few. The more we share the burden together, the lighter it will be. We need to coordinate in matters related to the word, to prayer, and to fellowship. These may seem like small, trivial matters, but the success of our practice depends on these details. If we take care of these details, our &ldquo;classes&rdquo; will be profitable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAYING ATTENTION TO THREE CRUCIAL POINTS</h2>
<p>Concerning the small &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; we must pay attention to three crucial points. First, in regard to the message, the speaker must be very exercised and should not speak in a routine manner. Second, the ones bearing responsibility in the &ldquo;classes&rdquo; must be flexible, not rigid. Third, the saints should cooperate in a good way. If we can take care of these three points, the &ldquo;classes&rdquo; will be effective, and as a result, many brothers and sisters will be supported and built up.</p>
<p>We need to treat this matter seriously; it is not something that we have done before. The brothers who have been speaking for the past eight or ten years should not think that they have experience in this new way. Please do not have this concept. Our spirit must be living and fresh; we must absolutely have a sense of newness and have genuine fellowship with the saints. Formerly, the entire time of our message meeting was devoted to the message; now at least one-third of the time must be devoted to fellowship among the saints. We must have a new beginning. The brothers must take the lead not only to practice and to pray but also to do it well and to do it thoroughly. If we cannot do it well, there will be no change.</p>
<p>Although the time devoted to the &ldquo;classes&rdquo; is not that long, we cannot afford to let the time slip away. We should grasp the opportunity to fellowship with the saints who do not meet regularly. However, we should not do anything impulsively; instead, we should prepare by having fellowship with the Lord and by seeking to advance in what we do in the meeting. We should not think that we are too busy to consider such things. We should exercise and prepare during the week. On our way to work we can consider these matters. After work, while walking on the street, we can consider them. Perhaps the Lord will give us a feeling that a certain aspect in the previous meeting was somewhat weak and that we need to fellowship with others about it. There are many lessons that we can learn from taking this way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IMPROVING THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING</h2>
<p>Concerning the bread-breaking meeting, I will share some feelings and thoughts based on my observation. First, the saints are strong and living in spirit, and they are even vying for opportunities to pray and fellowship. This is very good. However, the saints do not coordinate with one another in their speaking because of a lack of training. This situation can be compared to a car that is running at full speed but without a definite direction. Even though the meeting is very rich, the riches are displayed as if they are separate items on a grocery stand, which have not been coordinated together to produce a fully satisfying meal. For example, one person may share about being a priest, another about the Holy of Holies, and still another about the throne. Others share about living water and grace and still others share about eternity, the ancient times, and the Alpha and the Omega. We not only pray in this way, but we also sing in this way. I simply want to point out the fact that we need more exercise. With more exercise we will become more coordinated, and our &ldquo;driving&rdquo; will become more focused.</p>
<p>In the bread-breaking meeting, we must pay attention to our worship of the Lord and of the Father. Many saints do not know how to apply their knowledge of the Lord and of the Father in prayer and praise. When we gain some knowledge of the Lord, we should be able to apply it in the bread-breaking meeting. Our prayers should speak of the eternal nature of the Lord because we have knowledge of the Lord in this aspect and some consciousness of it as we are breaking the bread. The Lord is eternal, and when we touch Him, what He gives is eternal and what He works into us is also eternal. The Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness of sins is eternal, His redemption is eternal, the life He gives is eternal, His presence within us is eternal, and His leading in us is eternal. Although we live in time and space, eventually time and space will end, but the Lord is eternal.</p>
<p>Therefore, we need to know the truth related to the Lord. Our knowing cannot be entirely subjective according to our feeling, experience, or standing; we need to know the objective truths concerning the Lord Himself. The material for our &ldquo;classes&rdquo; provides us with this objective knowledge. Any believer, however, who has some genuine, objective knowledge of the Lord, must also have some subjective experience of Him in relation to these truths so that the truths can be applied. When the brothers speak of knowing the Lord, they are presenting objective truths. In the &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; however, the saints need to be given some explanation and demonstration so that they can apply these truths in their daily exercise.</p>
<p>We should follow this principle in every meeting, whether it is a big meeting in the meeting hall or in a small meeting in the districts. We need to lead the saints but avoid giving too much correction. Too much correction affects the spirits of the saints, and it truly does not matter if the saints make some small mistakes. This does not mean that we should not be aware of the situation but only that our adjustments should be slight. If the spirits of the saints are living, we will move past any mistakes and make progress.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
