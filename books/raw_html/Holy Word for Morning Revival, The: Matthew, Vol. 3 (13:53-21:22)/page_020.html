<p class="bold">WEEK 13 — DAY 5</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 17:24-26</h2><p class="bold">24 &nbsp;And when they came to Capernaum, those who take up the <sup>1</sup>temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your Teacher pay the <sup>1</sup>temple tax?</p> <p class="bold">25 &nbsp;He said, <sup>1</sup>Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus <sup>2</sup>anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?</p> <p class="bold">26 &nbsp;And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said to him, So then the sons are free.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Unless we receive light from the Lord, it is difficult to see the connection between verses 1 through 23 and verses 24 through 27. In 17:24-27 we have the matter of paying the temple tax to the poll tax gatherers. This is a test to determine whether or not we know how to apply the revelation and vision concerning Christ. In chapter sixteen Peter received a clear revelation from the heavenly Father regarding Christ as the Son of the living God. From that time onward, Peter was certain that Christ was the Son of the living God. Following this, on the mountaintop he saw a vision of Christ manifested as the Son of the living God. Therefore, he both received the revelation and saw the vision. It is possible to have a revelation without having a vision. What Peter received from the heavenly Father in chapter sixteen was merely the revelation. In chapter seventeen he saw the Son of God manifested and expressed through the man Jesus of Nazareth. Nothing could have been more clear than this revelation and vision.</p><p>Peter, however, had to be tested regarding the application of the revelation and the vision. To receive the revelation and to see the vision is one thing, but to apply them in a practical way is another. For example, we probably all have received the revelation from Galatians 2:20 that we have been crucified with Christ and that Christ lives in us. Perhaps even the weakest one among us has received this revelation. However, when your wife or husband gives you a difficult time, can you still say, “It is not I, but Christ”? When you are with your wife or husband, the revelation of having been crucified with Christ and of Christ living in you may vanish. Very few who have received this revelation apply it to the practical matters in their daily living. Peter might have been like this. He might have said, “I have received the revelation that Jesus is the Son of the living God, and I saw Him transfigured on the mountain. This is very clear to me. Perhaps you have not seen this vision, but I have.” For Peter to receive the revelation and see the vision was wonderful. But now he had to be tested by those who collected the poll tax.</p><p>Verse 24 says, “And when they came to Capernaum, those who take up the temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?”…When Peter was asked this question, he immediately said, “Yes.” Peter did not know how to apply the revelation and the vision, and he was exposed.…It is the same with us today. After a conference or training, we may proclaim that we will never be the same. But I assure you that after you return home, you will be exactly the same. However, do not let this disappoint you. (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 596-598)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>24<sup>1</sup> A Jewish poll tax for the temple, equal to a half-shekel (Exo. 30:12-16; 38:26).</p><p>25<sup>1</sup> On the Mount of Transfiguration Peter heard the voice from heaven, which charged him to hear Christ (17:5). If he had still remembered that word, he would have referred the poll tax gatherers’ question to Christ to hear what He would say. But he answered instead of listening to what Christ would say.</p><p>25<sup>2</sup> Peter had spoken presumptuously. Hence, the Lord stopped him and corrected him before he began to speak to Him.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 596-598; Hymns: #501</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
