   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Believing and Confessing Sin</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some have said that our sins are like strips of paper hanging one by one on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we confess one sin, one strip is taken off the cross, while the sins which we have not confessed are still hanging there.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the Bible does not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nevertheless, this does not mean that we do not need to confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should confess our sins, but the confession of sins is not a condition for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, some may reply, "Since 1 John 1:9 says, If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness,' does this not indicate that we must confess our sins?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Indeed, this verse is in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But 1 John is not written for unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word "we" indicates Christians, which means it is written for believers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This book mentions three kinds of Christians: 1 little children, those who have the life; 2 young men, those who are strong; and 3 fathers, those who are experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First John is different from Romans because the entire book speaks to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The subject of 1 John is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a Christian commits a sin, he must confess his sin; otherwise, his fellowship with God will be hindered.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If he wants to restore the fellowship with God, he must confess his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, it is wrong to tell an unbeliever to confess his sins in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Holy Spirit convicts a sinner of sins, righteousness, and judgment and causes a person to believe the works which the Son of God has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When a person believes, his sins are forgiven before God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The condition for a sinner to be forgiven by God is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We cannot find a passage in the Bible that says a sinner must believe and confess his sins before he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jesus Christ has accomplished redemption, and whoever believes the testimony God gave of His Son will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Believing and Repenting</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many say that salvation depends on repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The book of Romans presents the matter of salvation very clearly, yet this book does not mention that salvation is by any kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Gospel of John is the clearest book concerning the gospel, yet it contains no indication that salvation is by repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Salvation is by faith, not by repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then is repentance unnecessary?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the Bible, those who believe must first repent, and a saved person must also have repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is a repentance before believing, and there is a repentance after believing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a person never has a change in his view concerning sin, himself, the world, and the Lord, he cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word repentance means to have a change of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For instance, what one person treasured before his salvation is no longer treasured after his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, repentance is not a condition of salvation but a part of believing and a part of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is believing?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To believe does not mean to believe in some theological doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To hear is to hear the doctrines, but to believe is to believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ephesians 1:13 says, "Having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We hear the word of truth, the gospel, but we believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some people say that they believe, but actually, they only agree with the doctrines they do not really believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some with other motives may say that they have believed, but they have never known Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These persons are not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, preaching doctrines is not our aim; our aim is for people to believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What does it mean to believe in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First John 5:9 through 12 says, "If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God that He has testified concerning His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He who believes into the Son of God has the testimony in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, believing is receiving the witness that God gave of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whoever believes in His Son has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We rejoice because we are saved by believing and not by anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should have good works, confess Christ before people, confess our sins, repent, be baptized, and pray frequently to be pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not neglect these things and bring about God's displeasure.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, we are not saved by doing these things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our salvation is only by believing.</S>
