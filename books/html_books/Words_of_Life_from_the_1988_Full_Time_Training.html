</ol>
<p>In this book we will present a series of messages covering the matter of man. From the Bible we see that the relationship between God and man, whether before man&rsquo;s fall or after man&rsquo;s fall, is a matter of the spirit. If man&rsquo;s spirit is right, he is right; but if man&rsquo;s spirit is wrong, he has a problem. In this chapter we will see that the right kind of person, the kind of person God wants, is one who walks only according to the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD<br />
DISPENSED INTO THE TRIPARTITE MAN</h2>
<p>In the seven points listed in the outline, some very particular adjectives are used. For example, the Triune God is referred to as the processed Triune God. In Romans our God is no longer simply God as He was before the incarnation, before He was processed. According to the revelation in the Bible, with God there are two periods. The first period was before His incarnation, when He did not possess humanity. At that time He was God, but not man, possessing divinity, but not humanity. He was purely the self-existing, ever-existing, eternal Creator, who has no beginning nor ending. The second period began at His incarnation, when He put on humanity. He became flesh to be a man, passed through human living, entered into death, came out of death, and entered into resurrection. After His resurrection, in one of His last meetings on earth with His disciples, He revealed to them the name of the Triune God, the name of the Father, the name of the Son, and the name of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19), declaring the Triune God in full.</p>
<p>Hence, we see that before the resurrection of Christ, the Triune God had not yet been completed in a consummated way. Indeed, in eternity He was perfect, but not completed. It was not until after He passed through all the processes that He became the consummated and completed God. Therefore, in Acts He is no longer just God, but the God-man, possessing divinity with humanity and having divinity within His humanity. With Him there is also the experience of human living, death, and resurrection. Therefore, when we come to Romans, the God we experience is the processed God. If He had never passed through the processes of incarnation, death, and resurrection, even His entering into us would have been impossible, not to mention our experiencing Him. But now He can enter into us because He has completed two great things: incarnation and death with resurrection. These two great things opened up the way for Him to enter into fallen sinners, even into you and me, who still had sin within us. The God we preach today is not just the Creator, the Redeemer, and the self-existing, ever-existing, eternal God, but the God who passed through the processes of incarnation, death, and resurrection. He is the God-man with humanity, who passed through human living, tasted hardship, and suffered mistreatment. He went to the cross with sinners, sin, and all negative things upon Him and was crucified. Then He resurrected from the dead. Today He is the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>Concerning man, the old man mentioned in Romans is a tripartite man, with a spirit, a soul, and a body. When a man dies, outwardly we see that the body dies. But actually both the spirit and the soul within the body are also affected. We are a tripartite man (1 Thes. 5:23).</p><h2 class="head1">THE MINGLING OF THE SPIRIT OF<br />
THE CONSUMMATED AND COMPLETED TRIUNE GOD<br />
WITH THE SPIRIT OF MAN</h2>
<p>The Spirit of God is not only the Spirit of the Triune God, but also the Spirit of the consummated and completed Triune God. This Spirit is the consummated and completed Triune God. Today the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, is the consummated completion of the Triune God. Today He is lacking in nothing, for in Him there is divinity, humanity, incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. This consummated and completed Spirit is just God Himself.</p>
<p>The spirit mentioned in Romans 8:4 is not just the Spirit of God, nor is it just the spirit of man; rather, it is the mingled spirit, the mingling of God&rsquo;s Spirit with man&rsquo;s spirit. The Spirit of God is the processed, consummated, and completed Triune God; the spirit of man is the spirit that has been regenerated and indwelt by the regenerating Spirit. These two have been mingled as one spirit. When we walk by the spirit, we are walking according to the mingled spirit. Many Bible translations take this spirit as the Holy Spirit. But Darby points out clearly that this spirit is the human spirit with the presence of the Holy Spirit. These two spirits in themselves are already quite complicated, but the spirit which is the mingling of these two is, of course, even more complicated. I hope all of you would have a thorough understanding of this spirit. If you want to know how to experience God as your life, you must know all the things concerning God and man mentioned above.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRISTIANS BEING THOSE<br />
WHO HAVE THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST AND<br />
WHO WALK ONLY ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The emphasis in this message is to help you know what a Christian is. In the past we have said simply, though accurately, that according to the Greek a Christian is a Christ-man. He is one who has Christ&rsquo;s life and nature within and lives Christ out. But we did not point out that the secret to being a Christian is the spirit. A Christ-man is one who has the Spirit of Christ. The Spirit of Christ is just the consummated and completed Triune God. If we read the context of Romans 8:10 carefully, we will see that the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ are just one. He is one with three aspects. This is the Triune God. Therefore, the Spirit of Christ is just the Triune God.</p>
<p>Today the Triune God is the Spirit who has come into us and who now indwells our spirit. Hence, there is life in our spirit. It is the resurrection life, the life of God that never dies. The created life which we possess will die, and in some it has died already. But this life, which is the Triune God who passed through death and lives again, can overcome, conquer, and resist death. He has become the enjoyment in our spirit. Romans 8:23 says that we have the Spirit as our firstfruit. He is within us as our life and as the firstfruit for our enjoyment. We are the first to taste this enjoyment.</p>
<p>When we enjoy this firstfruit, we enjoy the Spirit, who is the processed Triune God. This enjoyment makes us right and proper persons. According to the revelation in the Bible, whenever we are short of the Spirit, we are improper persons. If you are very short of the Spirit, you are surely an improper person; but if you are even a little short of the Spirit, you are still improper. As long as you lack the Spirit, you are improper. If we were to measure the so-called saints in the world by this standard, none would come up to it because they do not even talk about the Spirit. But neither are we proper, because we do not walk according to the spirit. God does not need right persons or wrong persons; neither does He need good persons or evil persons. He only wants people who walk according to the spirit and who walk only according to the spirit. This kind of people are proper persons.</p>
<p>Since our youth, we have been told not to do wrong things. But we were never taught that we need to walk according to the spirit. It was after we were saved that we realized that the Bible teaches us to walk according to the spirit and to walk only according to the spirit.</p>
<p>I am afraid that you may have the wrong concept, thinking that you have come to this training to learn some techniques. The first technique to learn is door-knocking. You must learn to do it right, do it properly, do it well, and do it effectively. In addition, you need to learn some rules and methods. It is true that our training does have these things, but these are not the goal of our training. It is like a peach tree having both good leaves and bad leaves, both old leaves and new leaves. The leaves are part of the peach tree. The tree is indeed a peach tree. But a peach tree is not just for growing leaves; it is for bringing forth peaches.</p>
<p>In the same principle, we are not training you to keep rules and practice methods, but we are perfecting and equipping you in the truth of the Bible and in the divine life according to the Bible. You must dive deep into the truth and grow in God&rsquo;s life. To dive deep into the truth and to grow in life are our two basic requirements. A student&rsquo;s main purpose in attending school is not to learn rules or wear uniforms, but to be prepared and equipped academically. If he studies medicine, he will be equipped in medicine; if he studies physics, he will be equipped in physics. Our training is to equip you in the truth and in life. The result will be as 2 Timothy 3:17 says, that the man of God will be fully equipped in truth and life, lacking in nothing, and will become a complete and proper person.</p><h2 class="head1">THE KIND OF PERSON GOD WANTS<br />
BEING A PERSON WHO WALKS ONLY<br />
ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>For you to be a person who serves the Lord, the primary thing is not your way of doing things outwardly, nor your outward expression, but the kind of person you are. From the entire Bible, you can see that what God uses is not your methods, but your person. Actually your person is your methods. God did not call Moses until he was eighty years old. At that time God did not give him any methods; rather, God led him step by step, showing him that what He wanted was his person, not his methods. I do not mean that we do not need a method in doing things. For example, when you build a house, you must have good methods in order to build a house that is good for people to live in. In serving the Lord, you must also have methods. But you must see that serving the Lord does not depend on your methods, but on your person. You may have the same methods and experiences as others, but others succeed, while you do not. You do not succeed because you are not the kind of person that you must be in order to succeed. If you just learn the methods without becoming that kind of person, you still will not succeed. Therefore, the emphasis of this training is not on training you in some methods, but on perfecting you daily with life and truth in order to bring you into the consummated and completed Spirit of the Triune God. This Spirit is just the processed Triune God. Today He is right in your regenerated spirit. In this spirit you enjoy God as your life, and you live and move in this spirit. This is to walk only according to the spirit. Then you are the right person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING THE VISION</h2>
<p>If you want to be a right and proper person, walking only according to the spirit, first you must have the vision, that is, you must have the revelation and the truth. The vision, simply speaking, is that God wants to be our life. This is God&rsquo;s eternal desire. The life we originally had was the created life, which became fallen and was ruined, even usurped, by Satan. But God did not give us up; rather, He desired to come into us to be our life. The meaning of human life is God coming into us to be our life. If we have everything, such as education, position, wealth, houses, lands, and so forth, yet do not have God as our life, we are still empty. In the New Testament, our God is not only the creating God, but also the God who became flesh, passed through death and resurrection, and became the Spirit. The God we are experiencing today is the Wonder of wonders and the Miracle of miracles, and yet He is so normal to us.</p>
<p>At times the Christian life is sunny, full of the Lord&rsquo;s presence, yet sometimes it is cloudy, even stormy and dark. At such times we may ask ourselves questions such as these: Is God real or not? Is regeneration real or not? Is the sanctifying and transforming work of the Spirit of God within me real or not? I believe that all of us have been in this kind of situation. But no matter what trials we went through, we discovered that there is something within us that cannot be annulled. We could not deny His existence. This morning all of us must see the vision that God is within us as life.</p>
<p>Second, we must see that as believers, the old man of our tripartite man has been crucified with Christ. Even before we were born, we were crucified. Third, we must see that the Spirit of the consummated and completed Triune God has now made our spirit life. In other words, the Spirit of the Triune God is now within our spirit as our life, enabling us to enjoy God as our all. We have this life within our spirit as the enjoyment of the firstfruit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR IMPORTANT EXPERIENCES</h2>
<p>After seeing this vision, we need the following experiences. First, we need to set our mind on the spirit (Rom. 8:6b) without any mixed thoughts. Do not think about trying to improve or refine yourself by your self-cultivation. The best way to set your mind on the spirit is to pray and praise. This will make your mind life. Second, you must walk according to the mingled spirit (Rom. 8:4). Third, you must experience the Spirit of the Triune God, who passed through death and resurrection, giving life not only to your spirit and your mind, but also to your mortal body (Rom. 8:11). By these experiences, there is life in your spirit, in your soul, and even in your mortal body. The three parts of your being, the spirit, the soul, and the body, will have life.</p>
<p>Lastly, by the Spirit we must put to death the practices of the body (Rom. 8:13), which are the practices of the entire person. We live by putting ourselves to death. Concerning this point Paul&rsquo;s words are very mysterious, deep, and complete. He says that we put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit within us. The body wants to go to the movies, to lose its temper, to joke, to love, to hate, to do good, or to do evil. All these need to be put to death. If you put to death the practices of the body, you will live. The Christian life is one that lives by dying. Madame Guyon wrote a book about this entitled <em>Life through Death.</em> The way to put to death the practices of the body is to remain continuously in the Lord&rsquo;s death. John 15 says that we should abide and remain in the Lord. If you are to abide in the Lord, you must abide and remain in the Lord&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we are to experience God as life, we must first see that the Triune God wants to be our life. For this, He terminated the old man of our tripartite man with Christ on the cross in order that He as the Spirit of the Triune God could come into our spirit, making our spirit life for us to enjoy Him. We should set our mind on the spirit so that the Spirit of the Triune God who is in our spirit may come into our mind and make our mind life. We also must live and move only according to the Spirit. If we do these things, the Spirit of the Triune God, who passed through death and resurrection, will give life to our mortal body, thus making our whole being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;life. Then, by the Spirit we have to put to death the practices of the body and live. In this way we enjoy God as our life. In practice we must be watchful and careful, fearing that in some point of our daily affairs, whether big or small, we may not be according to the spirit. If in any point we are not according to the spirit, we are not proper. I hope that all of you will practice what has been presented in this chapter.</p>

</ol>
<h2 class="head1">THE FEELING OF OUR CONSCIENCE<br />
BEFORE WE ARE SAVED<br />
BEING THE FEELING OF OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>There are few Christians who pay attention to the matter of following the spirit&rsquo;s feeling. There is a lot of Christian literature, but it is difficult to find one book that talks about the feeling of the spirit. Though the term <em>the feeling of the spirit</em> is not found in the New Testament, there is such a thing according to its revelation. The word &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; is used in Ephesians 4:19 regarding the hardening of the feeling of the Gentiles. The Chinese Union Version of the Bible renders this word &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; as &ldquo;conscience.&rdquo; This is because prior to our salvation, the feeling of our spirit is the feeling of the conscience. The hardening of the feeling of the conscience is the loss of all the conscience&rsquo;s feeling. The conscience has become numb. It has become what is mentioned in 1 Timothy 4:2: &ldquo;Seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron.&rdquo; In other words, the conscience has lost its sensation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FEELING OF THE SPIRIT AFTER<br />
WE ARE SAVED BEING LIFE AND PEACE</h2>
<p>In Romans 8 the word &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; does not appear. However, the fact is there. The last part of verse 6 says, &ldquo;But the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&rdquo; Life and peace are feelings of the spirit. We know that there is life and peace within us because we feel them. The first part of verse 6 says, &ldquo;For the mind set on the flesh is death.&rdquo; Death includes uneasiness. When death comes, it causes people to feel uneasy. Within each Christian there are these two phenomena&mdash;life and peace, and death and uneasiness. What makes a man what he is are the thoughts in his mind. If our mind is set on the spirit, we will surely have life within. When we have life, we feel at ease. To feel at ease is peace. If our thoughts are always on the flesh, we will surely feel uneasy. That is a sign and registration of death. I believe that all of you have had this kind of experience. Before we were saved, when we thought about going to the movies, we were elated. But now, after being saved, when we think of going to the movies, we feel uneasy within. This is a phenomenon of death; it indicates that our spirit is deadened. As a result, we lost the proper feeling. If, at this time, we would turn to the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me; I want to quiet down before You,&rdquo; we would then settle down within. This is peace. Peace is a phenomenon of life.</p>
<p>There are various phenomena of death. Once we are deadened within, we will immediately feel uneasiness and emptiness. Once we feel empty, we will be afraid and withdrawn; we will be weak. The sum total of these is death. Death is the totality of the above. There are also various phenomena of life. If we have peace within, that is life. In this life, there is joy, satisfaction, fullness, and boldness. These are all phenomena of life. Death is the culmination and totality of weakness; life is the totality of strength. We Christians are just &ldquo;thermometers&rdquo; of life and death. When we are weak within, death has come in. When there is peace within, life has begun. This is so not only with the newly saved ones, but also with the ones who have been saved for decades.</p>
<p>Our mind represents our being because the mind is the main part of our soul and our soul is our self. When our being, which is our soul, makes plans for the flesh, and considers going to the movies or traveling for sightseeing, we begin to have death within. But if we turn our mind from the flesh to the spirit to pray, read the Bible, or contact the Lord, and if we do everything by the spirit, we have life within and begin to live.</p>
<p>If we do not feel peaceful, we know that within we are deadened. On the contrary, if we have peace, we know that we have life within. Whether or not we are peaceful is totally a matter of feeling. It is quite difficult to explain feeling, but as long as a person is alive, he will have feeling. For example, if you touch your arm with your hand, your arm will have feeling. But if you touch a corpse, it is cold and will not have any feeling. If I touch your hand, I know that it is a living hand because my fingers activate your feeling, and the feeling in your hand and that in my fingers respond to each other. In this way, I know that your hand is living. If there is no feeling, the hand is dead.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FEELING OF THE REGENERATED SPIRIT<br />
BEING FROM GOD</h2>
<p>Our spirit is the most living part of our being, and its feeling can be considered the most sensitive. The feeling that we are speaking of here is the feeling of the mingled spirit that comes from the mingling of the two spirits. This spirit is not only our spirit, but is also the Spirit of God; the Spirit of God and our spirit have been mingled together. Therefore, the feeling of this spirit is very keen and very delicate. Our regenerated spirit has become very delicate and meek because of the mingling of God and man. On the one hand, the Spirit of God is the Spirit of power, and on the other hand, He is the Spirit of life. He is the Spirit of power without and the Spirit of life within. Therefore, the Bible uses two symbols to speak about these two aspects of the Holy Spirit. It uses the eagle as the symbol of the Spirit when it speaks about the Spirit of power, and it uses the dove as the symbol when it speaks about the Spirit of life. In the Old Testament, when the Israelites were coming out of Egypt, God said that He would be like a large eagle carrying them on His wings out of the land of bondage (Exo. 19:4). This refers to the power aspect of the Spirit of God. In the New Testament, when the Lord Jesus was baptized and came out of the water, the Spirit of God descended upon Him as a dove (Matt. 3:16). This refers to the life aspect of the Spirit of God. As such, the Spirit of God is very delicate, meek, and calm. He does not shout, make noise, cry out, or yell. Because He is so delicate, meek, and calm within us, we usually neglect His presence.</p>
<p>I believe that all of you are saved and know that the Holy Spirit is within you. But how do you know? Is it in doctrine or by experience? If you say, &ldquo;The Bible tells me so,&rdquo; then it is according to doctrine. But if it is according to our experience, we will say, &ldquo;We have the feeling of the spirit.&rdquo; Before one is saved, he already has a little feeling in his spirit. If a child steals some candy from his mother, he does not feel peaceful and will hide from his mother. This shows that he has a feeling in his conscience. However, as he advances in age, the feeling of his conscience may be ignored and may gradually become dull. Some even go to the extreme and would even dare to rob and kill. Still at that stage, these ones will feel unpeaceful within.</p>
<p>When we were saved, our spirit was regenerated and the feeling was recovered. Now the Holy Spirit is reinforcing the feeling of our spirit within. However, the principle of the New Testament is that of incarnation, that is, the mingling of God and man; therefore, when we were saved, even though the feeling of our spirit was strengthened, it was not strengthened to a great extent. One may have had a strong, keen feeling at the moment he was saved. He may have repented and confessed thoroughly before God. But this feeling was maintained for only one or two days, or perhaps even one or two weeks. Eventually this feeling decreased. Sometimes this feeling can decrease so much that some may wonder whether they are saved at all. Nonetheless, if you are saved you will discover that you have more feeling in your spirit than before. You can say from your experience that no matter how delicate, meek, and calm it is, your spiritual feeling within has become much stronger than before. Within this little, feeble feeling, you have the presence of God.</p>
<p>Before we were saved, though we had some feeling, it was different from the feeling after salvation. For example, everyone loves to be proud; everyone wants to show off. To glorify oneself makes a person feel wonderful. But sometimes one&rsquo;s conscience may convict him that being proud is wrong. After we are saved, however, not only do we feel that to be proud is wrong, but in our deepest being we have the sense of shame. Before being saved, we may have known that to be proud is wrong, but we did not have the sense of shame. After being saved, not only do we feel that to be proud is wrong; we also feel shameful about it. This proves that we are saved ones. In many matters, we can use this principle as a test.</p>
<p>This feeling is not something that is taught to us, but is innate. It was born into us when we were born again. When we are saved, we surely have an added ingredient within which cannot be discarded. This ingredient is God Himself. He is added into us. Once we have this ingredient within, the feeling inside will be different than before. This can be likened to a cup of bitter tea. Before sugar is added into it, it is bitter; but after sugar is added into it, it has a little sweetness. As long as there is some sweetness in the tea, this is proof that the ingredient of sugar is within. Similarly, prior to salvation, our life was a bitter one. But now that we are saved, though some bitterness remains, there is sweetness in the bitterness. This proves that another ingredient has been added into us. The ingredient of God has been added into our spirit, and this ingredient has produced a feeling, the feeling of the spirit. This is what we are talking about here.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE FEELING OF THE SPIRIT BEING<br />
THE FEELING OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The feeling of the spirit is the feeling of life. This life is not our natural life, but the life of God. Because the spirit is life and life is the spirit, the feeling of the spirit is the feeling of life. With all kinds of life, there is the feeling. A higher life has a higher feeling, and a lower life has a lower feeling. A strong life has a strong feeling, and a weak life has a weak feeling. The life of God within us is the Spirit, and this Spirit is our life. This life is the highest life and therefore surely has the most feeling. As saved ones we should be filled with all kinds of spiritual feeling. We should not be void of feeling.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE FEELING OF THE SPIRIT COMING<br />
FROM THE OPERATING OF THE LAW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The feeling of the spirit stems from the moving of the Spirit within us. This moving is like the anointing of an ointment. When you put a face cream on your face, your face feels it. Our feeling of the spirit likewise stems from the moving of the Spirit within us. This is what is spoken of in Philippians 2:13 when it says that God is operating in us. Moreover, His operation is a law; it is the operation of the law of life within us. This law belongs to the life and is a natural function of the life. As long as conditions meet the requirements of the law, the law automatically operates. When this law of life operates within us, it gives us the feeling of the spirit.</p>
<p>The feeling of the spirit is liveliest, keenest, and strongest when we pray. This is like our blood circulation, which accelerates when we run. When we pray and have fellowship with the Lord, the operation of the Spirit within increases so that the feeling of the spirit within becomes keener.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE FEELING OF THE SPIRIT BEING<br />
DELICATE, MEEK, AND CALM</h2>
<p>The feeling of the spirit is delicate, meek, and calm. If we want to sense the spirit&rsquo;s feeling, we have to learn to be calm. If you are of a quick temper, you will not be able to sense the feeling of the spirit. The more delicate, meek, and calm you are, the clearer your feeling of the spirit becomes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE FEELING OF THE SPIRIT<br />
BEING LIFE AND PEACE<br />
AS OPPOSED TO DEATH AND UNEASINESS</h2>
<p>The feeling of the spirit is life and peace as opposed to death and uneasiness. Life includes satisfaction, fulfillment, strength, livingness, and freshness. These are all phenomena of life. Death includes emptiness, dissatisfaction, weakness, depression, and oldness. The general phenomenon of life is peace, and the general phenomenon of death is uneasiness. If you are satisfied, full, strong, living, and fresh, you will surely feel at ease and peaceful. If you are dissatisfied, weak, depressed, and old, you will certainly feel uneasy. These phenomena within us produce a feeling which lets us know whether or not we are in the spirit. If we are in the spirit, we will have life and peace. If we are not in the spirit, but in the flesh, we will have death and uneasiness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE FEELING OF THE SPIRIT NEEDING<br />
A STRONG AND SOBER MIND</h2>
<p>The feeling of the spirit needs to be matched by a strong, sober mind. If you want to be strong in your spirit, you must have a strong will. And if you want to have a sober spirit, you must have a sober mind. When your will is strong and your mind is sober, your spirit will be calm. If you are an indecisive person, like a ship without a rudder drifting without direction according to the wind, your feeling of the spirit will not be accurate. If you wander all the time in your imagination, your mind will not be sober and your feeling of the spirit will not be keen. You will be like a piece of glass which, though it should be transparent, has lost its transparency because all kinds of paint have been put upon it. Therefore, the feeling of the spirit needs a strong and sober mind.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. SUDDEN FEELINGS REQUIRING<br />
WAITING AND OBSERVING, AND<br />
SUSTAINED FEELING BEING MORE RELIABLE</h2>
<p>Sudden feelings within us are not reliable and require waiting. You may have a sudden thought during your prayer that you can surely perform a miracle, that you can pray for and lay hands on a certain sick one and he will be healed. Or the thought may come that tonight when you go out to knock on doors, in the first house you visit the whole household will be baptized. These kinds of sudden thoughts can be frequent and can come to you during prayer, while you sleep, or during the day. Some Christians are not clear about these situations and are manipulated by these sudden thoughts, doing things without consideration. Such thought is not of God, but of the evil one, who tempts people. He tried to tempt the Lord Jesus to turn stones into bread and to jump from the top of the temple (Matt. 4:3-9). We who live in the spirit should follow the feeling of the spirit. When we do, we will not trust in the sudden feelings. These sudden feelings are usually from the imaginations of the flesh or from the fiery darts of Satan. Therefore, we should wait and observe these sudden feelings. The real feeling of the spirit is surely lasting, and only the lasting feeling can be reliable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. TO FOLLOW THE FEELING OF THE SPIRIT<br />
BEING TO OBEY THE ANOINTING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Not only does the feeling of the spirit come from the operation of the law of life; actually the feeling of the spirit is the anointing of the Spirit. The Spirit Himself is an ointment which anoints us within. This anointing produces the feeling of the spirit. If we obey the anointing of the Spirit, we are following the feeling of the spirit. When we follow the feeling of the spirit, we are walking according to the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IDLE BABBLING, MURMURING,<br />
AND CONTENTIOUS WORDS<br />
NULLIFYING THE FEELING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>James 3:2 says, &ldquo;If anyone does not stumble in word, this is a perfect man.&rdquo; Also, Proverbs 10:19 says, &ldquo;In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.&rdquo; These verses show us how important our talk is. Idle words, babbling, murmuring, and reasonings will annul the feeling of the spirit. Therefore, the Apostle Paul says, &ldquo;Do all things without murmurings and reasonings&rdquo; (Phil. 2:14). Murmurings are from the emotions, and reasonings are from the mind. Generally speaking, murmurings are more with the sisters, and reasonings are more with the brothers. Whether from the emotions or from the mind, they are from the soul. When a person is not living in the spirit, he is living in the soul and will murmur and reason. In the church life, if we want to nullify all these negative things, we have to follow the feeling of the spirit. I wish that there would be no murmurings and reasonings among us, but only the feeling of the spirit and our following of the feeling of the spirit.</p>

<h2 class="head1">HUMAN PHILOSOPHY BEING<br />
TO LIVE THROUGH SUFFERING</h2>
<p>Human philosophy, including the ancient Greek philosophy and the Chinese Confucian philosophy, are confined to teachings concerning the refining or improving of the self. Hence, there have been many instances of asceticism and self-infliction. Similarly, various kinds of religions such as Buddhism and Catholicism also stress this kind of practice. This is because from man&rsquo;s viewpoint, human beings are degraded, having sinful lusts, and the only way of salvation is to live through suffering.</p>
<p>The Word of God shows us that the fall of man began with the transgression of Adam and Eve. They ate the fruit forbidden by God. As a result, sin came in and brought the whole human race into degradation. Through this, Satan&rsquo;s evil nature and corrupted elements entered into man&rsquo;s constitution. From that time on, there has been an evil constituent or element within man. Now there are two kinds of elements within the man God created: one is the good element which came from God&rsquo;s creation and bears God&rsquo;s image; the other is the evil element which came out of the evil one Satan and bears the evil nature of Satan. Within man there is not only the good created by God but also the sin injected by Satan (Rom. 7:17, 20). This sin is also called evil. It is sin itself and is the transfiguration of Satan within man.</p>
<p>There are only two sources in the universe; one is God and the other is Satan. God is good (Matt. 19:17) and Satan is evil (Rom. 7:21). Due to the fall of man, the evil nature of Satan was injected into the good man created by God. Therefore, there are two kinds of nature within the fallen man: the good nature and the evil nature. This was why within Chinese Confucianism there were those who advocated man&rsquo;s inherent good nature and those who advocated man&rsquo;s inherent evil nature. Actually, according to the biblical view, there is a basis for both schools because both good and evil are within man. Many philosophers throughout the ages came up with the thought of asceticism through their observation and realization of fallen mankind. They considered that the evil lusts within man could be eliminated only through the exercise of self-suppression. Hence, in their consideration only suffering could restrain man&rsquo;s evil and cause him to behave, to do good, and to be delivered from the sorrows of life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF THE BIBLE<br />
BEING TO LIVE THROUGH DYING</h2>
<p>However, the divine thought of the Bible is greatly different from human philosophy. The way of deliverance revealed by the Bible is not suffering, but death. It is not suffering which delivers man, but death. Romans 6:7 says, &ldquo;For he who has died is justified from sin.&rdquo; Although suffering can restrain man and keep him from sin, it can deliver him only to a certain extent. Moreover, those who suffer are not necessarily free from sin; sometimes they may sin even more. Therefore, suffering cannot actually deliver man. What saves and delivers man from sin is death. This is God&rsquo;s way of salvation. This way is not through suffering, but through death.</p>
<p>Catholicism has subtly changed the meaning of the cross. There is a book among the Catholics called <em>The Imitation of Christ</em> which teaches people to bear the cross and to apply the suffering of the cross as an element of asceticism. Later, those from the inner life group had similar thoughts. Madame Guyon once said that the cross is something to be loved, and that she desired to embrace and kiss the cross. Even in the early years I had felt that this kind of speaking could lead to improper impressions. Therefore, forty years ago I wrote a hymn especially to clear up the confusion caused by Catholicism. The hymn (<em>Hymns,</em> #622) says:</p>
<p class="hbody">If we take up the cross, will we but suffer pain?<br />
Nay, if we bear the cross, be sure that we will die!<br />
The meaning of the cross is that we may be slain;<br />
The cross experienced the self will crucify.</p>
<p class="hbody">Divine deliverance e&rsquo;er slays man by the cross;<br />
Though cruel it may seem, it is a grand release.<br />
Christ ne&rsquo;er will be our life if we escape the cross;<br />
Christ ne&rsquo;er will be expressed but by our sure decease.</p>
<p class="hbody">The cross&rsquo;s final goal, that God&rsquo;s will be fulfilled;<br />
His will&rsquo;s arch enemy is but the self of man.<br />
If self be done away and all the soul-life killed,<br />
God&rsquo;s will shall then prevail and prospered be His plan.</p>
<p>Christianity has followed Catholicism in this matter. In Christianity, speakings on the cross generally emphasize suffering. To many, bearing the cross means to suffer for the Lord. However, this is not the revelation of the Bible. The cross mentioned in the Bible emphasizes the termination and the putting to death of a person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING THROUGH DYING<br />
BEING GOD&rsquo;S WAY OF SALVATION</h2>
<p>Living through dying is the basic thought of the Bible. For one to live, he must die. In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; Brother A. B. Simpson also said in one of his hymns, &ldquo;This the secret nature hideth, harvest grows from buried grain&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #482). This shows us that the biblical principle is living through dying. God&rsquo;s way of salvation is to terminate us by the cross of Christ and to resurrect us by His Spirit of life. This appears to be a cruel punishment, but actually it is a glorious deliverance. Based on the revelation of the whole Bible, we see clearly that living through dying is God&rsquo;s saving way.</p>
<p>The first ministry in the New Testament is that of John the Baptist. He came out to preach the baptism of repentance and immersed and buried men into the water, which signifies death, in order to terminate the man of the old creation. Following that, there was the ministry of the Lord Jesus. His ministry caused the terminated ones to have a new beginning, to resurrect from the dead, and to obtain the divine life. This adequately proves that in the salvation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, there is a fundamental thought and principle, which is that fallen man can receive life only through death. Death is the initiation into resurrection. We have a hymn <em>(Hymns,</em> #631) which speaks very well concerning this matter.</p>
<p class="hbody">If I&rsquo;d know Christ&rsquo;s risen power,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must ever love the Cross;<br />
Life from death alone arises;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s no gain except by loss.</p>
<p class="hbody"> If no death, no life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no death, no life;<br />
Life from death alone arises;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no death, no life.</p>
<p class="hbody">If I&rsquo;d have Christ formed within me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must breathe my final breath,<br />
Live within the Cross&rsquo;s shadow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put my soul-life e&rsquo;er to death.</p>
<p class="hbody">If God thru th&rsquo; Eternal Spirit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nail me ever with the Lord;<br />
Only then as death is working<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will His life thru me be poured.</p><h2 class="head1">A FEW PROOFS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>Now let us examine a few obvious and important verses concerning this profound principle of living through dying.</p>
<p>First, Galatians 2:20a says, &ldquo;I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.&rdquo; According to God&rsquo;s economy, when Christ was crucified on the cross, I was also included in Him. Through the death of Christ, I am dead in Him; and now through His resurrection, He lives within me. This shows us the principle of living through dying.</p>
<p>Second, Romans 8:13b says, &ldquo;But if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.&rdquo; What we need to put to death is not the body itself, but the practices of the body. These practices do not refer only to the sinful things, but also to all the things done by our body outside of the Spirit. When we take the initiative to put to death the practices of the body, the Spirit will apply the effectiveness of the death of Christ to those practices and terminate them so that we may live.</p>
<p>Third, Galatians 5:24-25 says, &ldquo;But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&rdquo; Verse 24 speaks about death. Our old man and the &ldquo;I&rdquo; were crucified on the cross. This is a fact accomplished by Christ on the cross. The crucifying of the flesh with the passions and the lusts is our practical experience of this fact. The experience of this fact can be fulfilled only by our carrying out through the Spirit the crucifixion accomplished by Christ. Verse 25 speaks of living. In our Christian life, God does not want us to keep the law by the flesh, but to live Christ by the Spirit. Living by the Spirit implies that our living depends on the Spirit and is regulated by the Spirit. This again shows us that the Christian experience of life is one of living through dying.</p>
<p>Here we see that the way of death revealed by the Bible is not a way of committing suicide. Rather, it is a way of believing and receiving the fact accomplished by Christ at the cross. When Christ was crucified on the cross, we who were in Him were also crucified together with Him. The ark is a type in the Old Testament which illustrates this matter. Noah and his household of eight members were saved in the ark by passing through the flood waters (Gen. 7:1, 7; 1 Pet. 3:20). Similarly, we who are in Christ passed through death with Him. We were buried with Him and were resurrected with Him. We do not experience crucifixion, burial, and resurrection alone, but experience them with Christ by being in Him. What He passed through was suffering and death; what we pass through is enjoyment and deliverance. This is our living through dying in Christ. The death of Christ is not the goal; rather, it is an initiation into resurrection. In Adam, death is fearsome; in Christ, death is lovable. The death in Adam leads to perdition; the death in Christ leads to resurrection. Let us now consider the outline of this chapter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANT ITEMS<br />
IN GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY<br />
BEING FULLY ACCOMPLISHED FACTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Triune God Having Become Flesh</h2>
<p>The Triune God becoming flesh is an extraordinary thing in the universe. Man&rsquo;s body was originally created by God. Due to the fall of man, Satan&rsquo;s elements were added into man&rsquo;s body, and the body was changed in nature to become the flesh. One day God became a man. The Bible says that He not only took on a body, but also became flesh (John 1:14). By this, the fall of man and sin are involved. But this does not mean that the sinful nature, or Satan, were in the body of Christ. Romans 8:3 clearly says, &ldquo;God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin.&rdquo; This shows that although Christ became flesh, He had only the likeness of the flesh. He did not have the satanic elements in the flesh which is sin. Therefore, 2 Corinthians 5:21 says that Christ has no sin and even has no knowledge of sin.</p>
<p>Concerning this matter, not only is there a clear revelation in the New Testament, but there are illustrative types in the Old Testament as well. When the Israelites sinned against God and were bitten by the fiery serpents, God commanded Moses to lift up the brass serpent to bear the judgment of God for them. Whoever beheld that brass serpent was made alive (Num. 21:4-9). In John 3:14 the Lord Jesus applied this type to Himself. He said, &ldquo;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&rdquo; This word indicates that when He became flesh He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, that is, in the form of the brass serpent, with the form of the serpent yet without its poison. This is indeed a marvelous thing. The Triune God, the Lord who created the heavens and the earth, entered into man and joined Himself with the fallen man, the flesh, and even became flesh. The only thing that He did not have in Him was the nature and poison of sin.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Having Accomplished the All-inclusive Death</h2>
<p>Hebrews 9:26 shows us that through the offering up of Christ as a sacrifice, He dealt with the sinful nature, that is, the singular &ldquo;sin&rdquo; within man. Verse 28 follows by saying that by His offering up of Himself once, He took care of the consequence of &ldquo;sin,&rdquo; which is the outward sinful acts, that is, the plural &ldquo;sins,&rdquo; of man. Romans 6:6 says that the death of Christ on the cross took care of our old man. Hebrews 2:14 says that through death, Christ destroyed him who has the might of death, that is, the Devil. John 12:31 says that when Christ was lifted up on the cross, Satan was judged and the world which hangs upon Satan was also judged. Furthermore, Ephesians 2:15 says that when Christ was crucified, He abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances. John 12:24 shows us even further that Christ was like a grain of wheat which fell into the earth and died to release the divine life. All these were accomplished by the all-inclusive death of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Having Accomplished the Resurrection<br />
Which Produced the Firstborn Son of God<br />
and the Many Sons to Be the Church</h2>
<p>Another great act of Christ was His resurrection. The death of Christ terminates, while the resurrection of Christ germinates. First, through the resurrection of Christ, Jesus the Nazarene was born the firstborn Son of God (Acts 13:33). Second, His resurrection regenerated the ones chosen by the Father to become God&rsquo;s many sons (1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 8:29). Eventually, the firstborn Son and the many sons are constituted the church (Heb. 2:12). Hence, the church is produced through the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Having Accomplished the Ascension<br />
Which Made Him the Christ, the Lord,<br />
the Head, and the Savior</h2>
<p>Christ accomplished ascension, and in His ascension He was inaugurated as the Christ, the Lord of heaven and earth, the Head of the kings of the earth, and the Savior of all mankind (Acts 2:36; 5:31). In this way, He is able to inherit all and to fulfill God&rsquo;s commission, which is to rule and to exercise sovereignty over the whole earth by His authority. By this, God&rsquo;s chosen ones are enabled to receive God&rsquo;s salvation in a proper way. All these were accomplished by Christ in His ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Having Accomplished<br />
the Outpouring of the Holy Spirit<br />
and the Producing of the Church</h2>
<p>Christ has also accomplished the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the producing of the church. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit was based upon Christ&rsquo;s accomplished process of becoming flesh, dying an all-inclusive death, resurrecting, and ascending. After Christ passed through these processes, He was ready to pour Himself out upon all His believers and to baptize them into the Body, which is the church (Acts 2:33; 1 Cor. 12:13). By this, He accomplishes His heavenly ministry on earth and fulfills God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE ACCOMPLISHED<br />
DIVINE FACTS BY FAITH</h2>
<p>The important items of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, from the Triune God becoming flesh to the producing of the church, are fully accomplished facts. Now all we have to do is to acknowledge, receive, enjoy, and experience by faith these accomplished divine facts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING OUT CHRIST THROUGH<br />
DYING TOGETHER WITH CHRIST</h2>
<p>Among the divine facts we receive by faith, one primary item is our dying and living together with Christ (Gal. 2:20). In Christ we are already dead. But now in Christ we are made alive. Through the death of Christ, we are dead in Him. And now through His resurrection, He is living within us. In this way, we can live Christ and have Him as our center and everything in our daily life. Christ and we, we and Christ, both have one life and one living.</p><h2 class="head2">Knowing the Resurrection of Christ</h2>
<p>Through our dying and living with Christ, we can experientially know His resurrection (Phil. 3:10a). John 11:25 shows us that Christ Himself is the resurrection. Therefore, as long as we are in Him, receiving and enjoying the fact of dying and living with Him, we can experience and know the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Conformed to the Death of Christ</h2>
<p>When we know the resurrection of Christ, we will live a crucified life in the power of His resurrection. Our knowledge of the resurrection of Christ becomes a kind of power that enables us to be conformed to the death of Christ, that is, to have the death of Christ as our mold of living (Phil. 3:10b). Therefore, our daily life ought to be a life under the cross, in which our soul life is continually put to death, so that we may live by the life of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Crucifying the Flesh and the Lusts of the Flesh</h2>
<p>When we acknowledge the fact of our dying with Christ and live under the cross, we can practically and experientially crucify the flesh and the lusts of the flesh (Gal. 5:24).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Putting to Death by the Spirit<br />
the Practices of the Body</h2>
<p>The facts accomplished by Christ on the cross can become our practical experience through the Spirit (Rom. 8:13b). The Spirit executes in us the accomplished crucifixion of Christ. In other words, it is by the Spirit that we put to death the lusts of the body, including the practices of the evil members of this lustful body. As a result, we will live.</p>
<p>As a conclusion, the New Testament consistently reveals to us that our Christian life is a life of living through dying. It is a life that expresses the resurrection of Christ through being crucified. This was what Christ experienced in His human living; this is also a principle and a fundamental fact in the Bible. Such a living through dying surpasses any philosophy in the world and any concept of asceticism taught by religion. We Christians already have the accomplished facts in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. All we have to do is receive by faith. These facts will become our enjoyment and experience, and we will live out Christ through dying with Him.</p>

<h1 class="title">TO KNOW THE POWER<br />
OF CHRIST&rsquo;S RESURRECTION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 3:10; Eph. 1:18-20a; Acts 2:23-24; Rom. 6:9; 8:11; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 4:10-12; Rom. 6:4-5; 8:13b</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF THE TRUTHS<br />
IN THE BIBLE&mdash;DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>In this chapter we have quoted many verses from the Scripture. They all contain a basic principle of the truths in the Bible, that is, death and resurrection. In the universe, from the viewpoint of God&rsquo;s economy, God has two creations: one is the natural creation which is the old creation; the other is the resurrected creation which is the new creation. God&rsquo;s natural creation came about through His speaking; He called things not being as being. When God speaks, things come into being; when God commands, things come into order (Psa. 33:9). Originally, there was nothing; but when God spoke, things came into being. God did not use any resources; God only used His speaking to call things not being as being. This natural creation of God is just temporary, not eternal. It is something that God used as a means and an instrument to arrive at another creation, the new creation.</p>
<p>The new creation is accomplished by the old creation passing through death and resurrection. Our salvation as believers is an example of this. We were originally men of the old creation. When God created Adam, millions of men, including you and I, were included in this Adam. After we believed into the Lord and were organically joined to Him, we were in Him and were crucified with Him; moreover, through the power of God&rsquo;s life, we were resurrected with Him. Dying with Him causes us to be delivered from the old creation of Adam; living with Him causes us to enter into the new creation in resurrection. This is the death and resurrection revealed in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE BEING FOR US TO BECOME<br />
THE NEW CREATION<br />
THROUGH DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>God does not want anything of the old creation; God only wants the new creation transformed from the old creation. This is why in the Bible God usually does not care for the first but for the second. There are many examples of this. For instance, God did not want Abraham&rsquo;s first son Ishmael, but his second son Isaac (Gen. 21:12). Isaac&rsquo;s first son Esau was hated by God, while the second son Jacob was loved by God (Rom. 9:13). Furthermore, Hebrews 8:7 says, &ldquo;For if that first covenant was faultless, no place would have been sought for a second.&rdquo; The first covenant here refers to the old covenant, and the second covenant refers to the new covenant. &ldquo;In saying new, He has made the first old. Now that which is becoming old and growing decrepit is near to disappearing&rdquo; (v. 13). All these speak of the biblical truth concerning death and resurrection.</p>
<p>The same is true with our human birth. Our first birth was of man, natural, and of the old creation. The second birth was of God; it happened when we were saved and regenerated, and is of the new creation. Today, God does not want anything that we do by our natural life. Not only does He not want the bad; even the good He rejects. God only wants what we do by the life of God. God does not want anything natural; God only wants what is resurrected. God does not want anything of the old creation; God only wants what is of the new creation.</p>
<p>The first two chapters of the Bible show us the first creation, the old creation. The last two chapters show us the second creation, the new creation. Revelation 21:1 says, &ldquo;And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away.&rdquo; Actually, the new heaven and new earth come about by the old heaven and old earth passing through the burning, renewing, and transforming work of God&rsquo;s fire of judgment (2 Pet. 3:10-13). This is similar to the new man being formed by the old man being renewed and transformed (Col. 3:9-10; 2 Cor. 3:18). From this you can see that there is a basic principle in the Bible: whatever is of the old creation will have to pass through death and resurrection to become the new creation.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Resurrection can be divided into two categories. One kind is resurrection by the wondrous power of God. It is not a resurrection caused by the life of God. The other kind is resurrection through the life of God becoming one&rsquo;s organic power. According to the revelation of the Bible, all the dead ones, whether saved or not, will be resurrected in the future. In principle, the dead believers will resurrect before the millennium at the coming of the Lord Jesus; all the dead unbelievers will resurrect after the millennium. John 5:28-29 says, &ldquo;For an hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs shall hear His voice, and shall come forth: those who have done the good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done the evil to the resurrection of judgment.&rdquo; This means that one group of people&mdash;the resurrected unbelievers&mdash;will be judged at the great white throne, and their entire spirit, soul, and body will be thrown together into the lake of fire; the other group of people&mdash;the resurrected believers&mdash;will enjoy the eternal life.</p>
<p>In this message, we are not talking about the first kind of resurrection, which is resurrection without God&rsquo;s life; we are talking about the second kind of resurrection, the resurrection with God coming into us as life. This is like what the Lord said in John 12:24 concerning one grain of wheat which fell into the earth and died to bring forth many grains. It did not resurrect through any outward power but through the inward life, which enabled it to grow out of death and to bear many grains in resurrection. Today we all have the Lord&rsquo;s life which went through death and resurrection, and we all have become His many grains. The Lord&rsquo;s life brings in two kinds of elements, the death element and the resurrection element. They supply us within day by day. By this we experience His death and resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING THE RESURRECTION<br />
AND THE GOD OF RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Before chapter one of Genesis, God was merely God; He was God in eternity. However, after passing through Genesis 1 and 2, this God in eternity became the God in creation. At the beginning of the four Gospels, He became the God in the flesh. After more than thirty years of human living, He went to the cross and died. Then He entered into resurrection, and became the God of the resurrection from the dead. Therefore we can say that our God is the eternal God. He created everything, became flesh, passed through death, and entered into resurrection. Today He is the God of the resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p>Many Christians have understood this matter of death and resurrection as something which only happened to the Lord Jesus as a man. They did not see that when the Man Jesus died, God did not leave Him; rather He was in Him and was with Him all the time. It was only during the short moment when He was on the cross bearing our sins that God temporarily left Him (Matt. 27:46). According to the revelation of the Bible, the Lord Jesus was the embodiment of God. Within Him was God. Moreover, God never left Him. He once said that He was not alone because the Father was with Him (John 16:32). Not only so, the Triune God&mdash;Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;coexist and coinhere from eternity to eternity. Therefore, when the Son passed through death and entered into resurrection, the Father and the Spirit also passed through death and entered into resurrection together. In other words, it was the Triune God who passed through death and resurrected. As long as we have this God, we have also the God of creation, the God of incarnation, and the God of the resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p>John 11 shows us that this God of resurrection is Himself resurrection. He did not have to wait until He resurrected from the dead to be resurrection; He was resurrection even before He resurrected from the dead. When Martha and Mary were mourning for their brother Lazarus who had been dead for four days, Jesus came to their village. Martha went to greet Him and complained to Him saying, &ldquo;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.&rdquo; Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Your brother shall rise again.&rdquo; Martha said, &ldquo;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection.&rdquo; Jesus said to her, &ldquo;I am the resurrection&rdquo; (vv. 17-25). This means that with the Lord, time is not a problem. When it is early, the Lord is resurrection; when it is late, the Lord is still resurrection. When Lazarus was alive, the Lord was resurrection; when Lazarus was dead, the Lord was even the more resurrection.</p>
<p>This is not all. When the Lord spoke this word, He Himself had not yet passed through death and resurrection. This means before the Lord was resurrected, He was resurrection already. In other words, the Lord Jesus was able to resurrect because He was resurrection. If He were not resurrection, He could never have resurrected. But because He was resurrection, and was so even before He resurrected from the dead, He could not be held by death (Acts 2:24).</p>
<p>I would like you to remember one thing; today the God whom we believers have received is not only a mighty God, or a holy, righteous, and glorious God, as most Christians preach. Today the God in whom we have believed, whom we have received, and whom we have obtained is even the more the God of resurrection.</p><h2 class="head1">TO KNOW CHRIST<br />
AND THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Based on the principle presented above, let us come to the quoted verses one by one. The first portion in Philippians 3:10 says, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.&rdquo; We not only need to know Christ, but we also need to know the power of His resurrection. As far as His person goes, He is the Christ. As far as His function goes, He is the power of resurrection. If we know the power of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, we surely will be willing to be conformed to His death. What is contained here is the experience of death and resurrection. You should know that Christ first died and then resurrected; however, we first resurrected and then died. This is like the Lord Jesus who first bore the cross and then was crucified; but we were first crucified and then we bear the cross.</p>
<p>At the time we believed and were saved, we were already crucified and resurrected with Christ. After that, in our Christian life, the Lord put us into different situations such as our family life, the church life, the training center, the &ldquo;kingdom houses,&rdquo; or the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses, in order that we would daily experience death and the power of His resurrection. When we encounter some troubles, difficulties, or even ill-treatment, we will have a genuine joy and release if we know the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and are conformed to His death. Our natural disposition and virtues, such as our natural power, natural love, or natural humility, will gradually pass through death and be terminated. We will then enjoy the power of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and will live out the love and humility of resurrection.</p>
<p>The second portion in Ephesians 1:18-20a says, &ldquo;That you may know...what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead.&rdquo; The surpassing greatness of His power mentioned here is the power of resurrection mentioned in Philippians 3:10. The power God has toward us is the same as the power which He wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead. How surpassingly great is this power! We need to know and experience this power.</p>
<p>The third portion in Acts 2:23-24 says, &ldquo;This man, delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to the cross and killed; whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it.&rdquo; Due to the power of God&rsquo;s resurrection, death and Hades cannot hold Christ. Christ resurrected from the dead through the power of God&rsquo;s resurrection within Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THE INDWELLING SPIRIT OF GOD<br />
GIVING LIFE TO OUR MORTAL BODIES</h2>
<p>The fourth portion in Romans 6:9 says, &ldquo;Christ having been raised from among the dead dies no more; death lords it over Him no more.&rdquo; Romans 8:11 says, &ldquo;But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&rdquo; Christ in His resurrection far surpasses death. Since He was resurrected from among the dead, He took care of death completely. Not only so, the One who raised Christ from among the dead was God, and God Himself is resurrection, and resurrection is the Spirit of God. Today this Spirit dwells within us, giving life to our mortal bodies so that our mortal bodies can be made alive.</p>
<p>The fifth portion in 1 Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; Christ not only resurrected from among the dead by the Spirit of God, He Himself in resurrection became a life-giving Spirit. And now this life-giving Spirit is the reality of resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GROWING TOGETHER WITH THE LORD IN<br />
THE LIKENESS OF HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The sixth portion in 2 Corinthians 4:10-12 says, &ldquo;Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body. For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh. So then death operates in us, but life in you.&rdquo; The putting to death of Jesus destroys our natural man, the outward man, and the flesh so that our inward man may have the opportunity to develop and be renewed. This kind of daily putting to death will eventually cause the resurrection life to be manifested. This is the living we ought to have.</p>
<p>The seventh portion in Romans 6:4-5 says, &ldquo;We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into death that as Christ was raised from among the dead through the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection.&rdquo; Through baptism, our old man was buried with Christ into death so that we may live and move in the realm of resurrection. During baptism, we grew together with Him in the likeness of His death; and now through His death we grow into His resurrection. Christ Himself is the resurrection. After we have experienced the proper baptism, we in Him will continue to grow together with Him in the likeness of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p>The last portion in Romans 8:13b says, &ldquo;If by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.&rdquo; By the Spirit means by the power of resurrection because the Spirit is the power of resurrection. To put to death the practices of the body is to deny whatever I am and whatever I do outside of the Spirit. The result is that the power of resurrection will give us the strength of life to make us live.</p>
<p>All the Scriptures presented above show us clearly the principle of death and resurrection. Today our God is the God of resurrection; moreover, resurrection is God Himself, that is, the Spirit of God and also the life of God. Therefore God, the Spirit of God, and the life of God are all resurrection moving and operating within us to bring us the power of resurrection so that we may experience His death and resurrection. Day by day, we put off the nature of the old man and everything in the old creation and live and move in the newness of life in order to live out the new creation.</p>

<p>We need to continue the fellowship from the last chapter to see what it is to know the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. We need to spend some time to look at the outline. But before we look into the outline, I would like to add a few words.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST BEING<br />
GOD&rsquo;S HIGHEST PROCESS</h2>
<p>Whether from the point of view of the believers&rsquo; experience or God&rsquo;s economy, the knowledge of the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is the peak in the New Testament. We all know that in God&rsquo;s economy, God is a processed God. In the Old Testament, although God had created the heavens, the earth, mankind, and everything, He Himself had not yet passed through any process. Just as He was the self-existing, ever-existing, and unique Jehovah God in eternity past, He was still the same after creation, without any change.</p>
<p>However, in the New Testament, He began to pass through many processes. The first one was incarnation; the second was human living; the third was an all-inclusive death. Through this death, on the negative side, He nullified sin and death, destroyed Satan, judged the world, and also terminated the old creation. On the positive side, He released the life of God. Then He entered into another process, that is, resurrection. Following that, He also went into another process, that is, ascension. In ascension, first, He was appointed as the Lord, the Christ, the Head, and the Savior. Moreover, He obtained honor and glory and was crowned and enthroned to have all authority in heaven and on earth. He also received the Spirit from the Father. At the same time, He gave all the saved ones as gifts to His Body, the church. In this long process from incarnation to His perfecting of the gifts to give to His church, the peak was His entering into resurrection.</p>
<p>Although the enthronement in ascension appears to be higher than resurrection, according to the experience of life, the peak is resurrection because it was in resurrection that Christ was fully completed. Although He was the Triune God before His incarnation, there was no human element within Him. Neither had He passed through human living or the all-inclusive death. From the point of view of the Triune God Himself, He is complete; but from the point of view of the process, He was not yet complete. It was after His resurrection that all these processes were completed: incarnation to take on humanity, passing through human living, and the all-inclusive death. Now, this Triune God has divinity as well as humanity. He also has a human living, an all-inclusive death, and a resurrection. After that, His ascension, enthronement, and rulership did not add any more elements to Him. Therefore, in the process that the Triune God has passed through, resurrection is the peak. Not only so, in the New Testament, resurrection is not merely a matter, but also a Person, that is, the Triune God. He is God as well as man. He does not only live a human living; with Him there is also death and resurrection.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST BEING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When the Triune God entered into resurrection, He became the Spirit. The Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. Therefore, we may say that resurrection equals the Spirit. In the same way that resurrection is this mysterious Triune God, the Spirit is also this mysterious Triune God. Therefore, Matthew 28 records that after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and before His ascension, He charged His disciples to disciple the nations and to baptize them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (v. 19). The name of this complete Triune God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Before this time, although there are many places in the Bible which reveal the divine Trinity, there is no place like this one which puts the divine titles of the Father, Son, and Spirit together to form one name. This is because before resurrection, the Triune God had not yet been ultimately consummated; it was after He had entered into resurrection that He was ultimately consummated. Therefore, if we want to know the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, the important point is that we must first know this processed Triune God. He was incarnated, passed through human living, accomplished an all-inclusive death, entered into resurrection, and became the life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is now the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>According to the revelation of the Bible, four items mentioned in the New Testament&mdash;Spirit, life, resurrection, and power&mdash;all refer to one Person. The Spirit is a wonderful Person, yet the Spirit is resurrection; therefore, resurrection is also this wonderful Person. Moreover, resurrection is life, so life is also this wonderful Person. Yet life is power, so power is also this wonderful Person. This wonderful Person is the processed Triune God. Today in resurrection, He is the Spirit, He is resurrection, He is life, and He is also the power for us to receive and enjoy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING AND EXPERIENCING<br />
THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>I hope that you can see such a vision, and can have the deeper revelation of the Bible to know that our God is the complete Triune God. With His divinity, humanity, human living, and all-inclusive death, He went into resurrection and even became resurrection itself. When we believed in the Lord, what we received was this resurrection. Romans 10:9 says, &ldquo;That if you confess with your mouth, Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from among the dead, you shall be saved.&rdquo; Believing in the resurrection of Christ is the condition for our salvation; the highest goal of our faith is the resurrection of Christ. The resurrection of Christ is the Triune God, who is all-inclusive and is Himself everything. He became the Spirit, and today He is dwelling in our spirit. How wonderful it is that such a universal, excellent One, after passing through all the processes, would come into us, the insignificant beings, and dwell in our spirit. This is the wonder of all wonders.</p>
<p>Now let us look at the outline. First, the resurrection of Christ is death-overcoming. The death of Christ mainly deals with sin. The result of sin is death; therefore sin and death constituted a law called the law of sin and death (Rom. 8:2). Sin is the cause, and death is the result. The death of Christ eliminated sin, and the resurrection of Christ overcame death and also swallowed death. Sin in the universe was eliminated by the death of Christ, and death in the universe was overcome and swallowed up by the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>Second, the reality of the resurrection of Christ is the Spirit. In other words, resurrection is the Spirit, because it was the Spirit who raised Jesus from among the dead (Rom. 8:11) and because Christ resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). The Spirit is resurrection. Now with all the riches and elements of the Triune God, He is within us, supplying and filling us constantly. Although sometimes we do not seem to feel it, we cannot get rid of this &ldquo;thing.&rdquo; Sometimes when we have much prayer, this &ldquo;thing&rdquo; may rise up within us. Spontaneously we are cherished. Eventually, we have tenderness, patience, and also humility. We have all the supply that we need. This is because there is resurrection within us. To be a Christian is to exercise oneself to allow this resurrection to &ldquo;warm&rdquo; one up within. There is no need for us to do anything. All the supply comes from Him. This is to know the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p>The various kinds of situations and circumstances in our daily life are all for us to know the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. We are not trying to be a Christian. Rather, we are living out a Christian life. To be a Christian is not a matter of trying, but a matter of living. Trying depends on human effort; living depends on resurrection. <em>Hymns,</em> #362 says, &ldquo;He died for me that I might live,&rdquo; and &ldquo;He lives for me that I may live.&rdquo; The Lord did not only die for me, but He also lives for me so that I can live. Instead of trying by myself, I am living by Him.</p>
<p>Because the Spirit is Christ, to live in the Spirit is to live in the resurrection of Christ. In the Spirit there is the resurrection of Christ, and the Spirit is the reality of the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>Third, the resurrection of Christ is the manifestation of the divine life. Resurrection is the life of Jesus manifested through His death. Paul wrote the fourth chapter of 2 Corinthians fully from experience. He described how the apostles lived out the crucified life and manifested the resurrection life. He said, &ldquo;Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body. For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh&rdquo; (vv. 10-11). The putting to death of Jesus destroys our natural man and our outward shell, so that the life of God within us can be manifested. Resurrection is also the life of Jesus working in others through His death working in us. Paul continued in verse 12, saying, &ldquo;So then death operates in us, but life in you.&rdquo; When we are under the operation of the Lord&rsquo;s death, His resurrection life will be dispensed into others through us.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT THE RENOUNCING OF EVIL<br />
AND THE PRACTICING OF GOOD,<br />
BUT THE DYING OF US AND THE LIVING OF GOD</h2>
<p>Now we can clearly see that the Christian life mentioned in the Bible is altogether a matter of life and death, a matter of being put to death to receive resurrection. This is altogether different from the Chinese teachings of Confucius or Mencius. The teachings of Confucius and Mencius emphasize humanity, taking kindness as the main point. They proposed that within man there is a battle between reason and lust. Only by cultivation and self-refinement can reason be maintained and lusts be removed until one arrives at the realm of &ldquo;bright virtue.&rdquo; The Chinese Confucians made a thorough study concerning human beings, but they did not know God&rsquo;s salvation, nor had they received God&rsquo;s life. Therefore, even though their teachings were good, they were merely a matter of human study and behavior. The human living revealed in the Bible emphasizes the relationship between God and man. God has come and has entered into man to have a relationship with him. By this, God&rsquo;s life and man&rsquo;s life can join together to become one life. Thus, man&rsquo;s life should come under God&rsquo;s life. It should even submit to God&rsquo;s life unto death. Philippians 2 shows us that the man Jesus humbled Himself and obeyed unto death, even the death of the cross (v. 8). His death, that is, the death on the cross, was a laying aside of Himself. He did not act according to man&rsquo;s will, but to God&rsquo;s will (Matt. 26:39). Today our Christian life is the same. We should be obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, without self-choosing, desire, inclination, or enjoyment, instead, only seeking God and His will. This kind of willingness to be put aside is the highest definition of death, and it is in this death that the life of God is manifested.</p>
<p>In the universe, only the death of the Lord Jesus was an utmost obedience to God. By putting Himself aside, God&rsquo;s life was manifested. The life that Paul lived on earth was such a life of being put to death. He did not choose a way that was comfortable, enjoyable, self-expressing or self-justifying. Rather, for the Lord&rsquo;s sake he experienced much suffering, difficulty, ridicule, and persecution. He allowed the death of Jesus to do the killing work upon him so that the life of Jesus could be expressed through him. The Christian life revealed in the New Testament is such a life of death and resurrection. It is not a life of good and evil. The Christian life does not emphasize the removal of evil and the practice of good. Rather, it emphasizes us dying and God living. For a person to do good, he does not need to die; however, for a person to live out God, he must die.</p>
<p>What the Bible speaks concerning human beings and human behavior is different from the ethics and morality developed by Chinese philosophical thought. What they have is merely a matter of philosophy, but what the Bible says is a matter of truth and revelation. The Bible shows us that God has an eternal plan, which is to create for Himself a group of people to be His vessels to contain Him, so that He can enter into this group of people to be their life and content. In this way, they can live out God to be God&rsquo;s corporate expression. However, before God had the chance to enter into His created man, the latter became fallen and was corrupted by Satan. Satan injected himself into this man and became the sinful nature within him. Although God&rsquo;s plan was frustrated and damaged, God never gave up on the man He created. He became flesh Himself to carry out salvation. Eventually, He went to the cross and was crucified in the flesh to remove man&rsquo;s sins, terminating the old man and destroying Satan who dwells in man&rsquo;s flesh. Following that, in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit and entered into all those who believe into Him to be their life. From then on, man needs to be one with God, taking Him as his life and person, and putting himself aside. He needs to obey unto death so that God may live out from within him.</p>
<p>In our Christian life, regardless of what kind of circumstances we are in, we must put our self to death. At home, in the church, or among brothers and sisters, we should voluntarily put our self to death so that the life of God can have an opportunity to live out from within us. For this reason, the Bible likens us saved ones to seeds of life (Matt. 13:38). If we do not die, we will not live. Only when the outward shell is broken can the inward life be manifested. Hence, all the work that the Lord is doing on us is to destroy our outward, natural man so that we can live out the life of God within us. This is the deepest thought in the New Testament concerning the life of a Christian. It is not a matter of self-endeavoring through refinement. It is not a removal of evil and a practice of good works. Rather, through death and resurrection, man dies and God lives.</p>
<p>We who have received Christ should be delivered from all kinds of philosophical thoughts. We must be free from the concept of good and evil. Humanly and morally speaking, the concept of good and evil is wonderful. But as far as experiencing God&rsquo;s salvation is concerned, it is a great hindrance. God has no intention for us to do evil, nor does He have the intention for us to do good by ourselves. We should know that both good and evil belong to the same tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They belong to the same source. Only the tree of life, that is, the Christ who is God&rsquo;s embodiment, is what God wants. He has become the Spirit to dwell in us as our life. Now He wants to live out from within us. We only need to know the fact of our crucifixion with the Lord and believe and receive this fact. Through daily bearing the cross, we always put ourselves to death, like a grain that has fallen into the ground and died. In this way, the life of Christ will be lived out from us.</p>
<p>Fourth, the resurrection of Christ is manifested through His death. Where the death of Christ is, there the resurrection of Christ is also manifested. Romans 6 talks about the matter of our baptism. When we were baptized into the Triune God, simultaneously we were baptized into the death of Christ (v. 3). Through baptism into death, we were buried with Him so that we can walk in newness of life (v. 4). When we passed through baptism and rose up from the death waters, we more or less had a sense of newness of life. However, afterwards, through distraction by our own concept of good and evil, we began to care less for the sense of the new life. We began to make up our mind to do good and to endeavor to be a God-pleasing Christian through asceticism and self-denial. Eventually, we fell into the bondage of the indwelling sin in our flesh and became entangled in a war between good and evil, as described in Romans 7. The result was death and frustration. In contrast to this, if we remain in the death Christ accomplished for us, the life of God will continually supply us and will be lived out from within us. Romans 8:13 says, &ldquo;If by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.&rdquo; This shows us that we need to cooperate with the indwelling Spirit and should not try by our own effort to put to death all of the practices apart from the Spirit. In this way the effectiveness of the death of Christ will be applied to us, and the life of God will be lived out from within us.</p>
<p>Fifth, the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection conforms us to His death. The power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is the resurrection life which resurrected Him from among the dead. If we are to know and experience this power of Christ, we need to be joined and conformed to the death of Christ. With Christ, it was first suffering and death, then resurrection. With us, it is first the power of His resurrection and then the fellowship of His sufferings and the conformation to His death. First, we receive the power of His resurrection. Then, through this power, we fellowship in His sufferings and live a crucified life through conformation to His death, that is, through taking the death of Christ as the mold of our living. This is what Christ experienced in His human living when He continually put to death His human life so that He could live by the life of God. If our living is conformed to the shape of this mold of Christ, that is, if we die to our human life and live the life of God, we can experience and manifest the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>

<h1 class="title">TO KNOW THE POWER<br />
OF CHRIST&rsquo;S RESURRECTION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 6:4-5; Gal. 5:24-25; 2 Cor. 4:10-12; Rom. 8:13b</h1>
<h2 class="head1">FIRST DYING, THEN LIVING</h2>
<p>In the New Testament, there are some verses which clearly show us that the death of Christ comes first, followed immediately by the resurrection of Christ. According to the sequence of our experience, the first portion of verses should be Romans 6:4-5. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into death that as Christ was raised from among the dead through the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.&rdquo; Once a person receives the gospel and believes in the Lord, the first thing that happens to him is baptism into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19). At the same time, he is also baptized into the death of Christ (Rom. 6:3). As soon as a person believes into the Lord, he receives the life of God and enters into an organic union with the Triune God; this is the inward salvation. Following that, he still needs a declaration or an acknowledgment outwardly, which declares that through baptism, he has been put into the death of Christ, buried with Him, and is now resurrected with Him, resulting in his walking in newness of life. In this way, the lifelong course of his Christian life begins.</p>
<p>Hence, baptism declares that the Christian life of a believer begins with the death of Christ. This believer also needs to remain in the death of Christ. The chorus of <em>Hymns,</em> #481 says:</p>
<p class="hbody">All the way to Calvary,<br />
Where my Savior went for me,<br />
Help me, Lord, to go with Thee,<br />
All the way to Calvary.</p>
<p class="hbody">&ldquo;All the way to Calvary&rdquo; means remaining in the death of Christ continuously and walking in such a death. This is an extremely profound principle of the Christian life. When we remain in the death of Christ and walk in it, we can enjoy the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection within us. Hence, Romans 6:5 says that if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection. The likeness of His death here is the baptism mentioned in the previous verse, and the likeness of His resurrection is the newness of life. In baptism, we grew together with Him in the likeness of His death. Now through His death, we have grown into His resurrection, where we walk in newness of life.</p>
<p>The second portion is Galatians 5:24-25, which says, &ldquo;But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&rdquo; The cross of Christ has already crucified and terminated our old man and the self (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20); this is an accomplished fact. Our crucifying of the flesh with the passions and lusts is our application and experience of this fact. This application and experience can only be accomplished by the Spirit through His execution of Christ&rsquo;s accomplished crucifixion. Through the cross, our fleshly person is crucified; by the Spirit, we who are of Christ may live. Once again, we see that it is first dying and then living.</p>
<p>The third portion is 2 Corinthians 4:10-12 which says, &ldquo;Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body. For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh. So then death operates in us, but life in you.&rdquo; This portion again shows us that the termination of the cross eventually causes the manifestation of the resurrection life. The putting to death of Jesus destroys the natural man, the outward man, and the flesh, with the result that the inward man is given the opportunity to develop and be renewed to live out the resurrection life. Moreover, when we stay under the termination of the Lord&rsquo;s death, His resurrection life will be dispensed into others through us. The dispensing of life into others is always the result of our receiving the killing of the cross.</p>
<p>There is another portion, Romans 8:13b, which says, &ldquo;But if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.&rdquo; When we cooperate with the indwelling Spirit and take the initiative to put to death the practices of the body, the Spirit will apply the effectiveness of the death of Christ to those practices and will crucify them. In this way, we will live. From this you can see that it is first dying, and then living.</p><h2 class="head1">RECEIVING REVELATION</h2>
<p>This teaching concerning first dying and then living for the experience of the resurrection power is quite deep. There are not many Christians who know these matters. As a result, few people have this kind of experience today. Although the New Testament mentions this matter several times, due to the lack of this kind of concept, people do not see this when they read the Bible. The Chinese especially, who are full of the concept of good and evil, have no idea or feeling concerning the matters of life and death as mentioned in the Bible. When they read them, it is as if there was not such a thing. When I first studied the Bible, I also was unfamiliar with this matter. Later, I gradually received the enlightenment and tried to release the light concerning this matter. I believe that after you have listened to my speaking on this subject for a while, you will know, more or less, how to speak a little. Nevertheless, you still need to receive the light and to have revelation concerning this matter. Only then will this become reality to you.</p>
<p>According to the revelation in the Bible, when Christ was crucified on the cross, He included us all in Him. Then He brought us, who were dead in Him, into His resurrection. We were crucified together with Him, buried with Him, and also resurrected with Him. In resurrection, His divine element, that is, the Spirit and life, was mingled with our humanity. In this way, our resurrected humanity is uplifted in His divinity and is thus transformed and sanctified.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REMAINING IN THE DEATH OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>My burden in this chapter is to show you that for every saved person, the more he loves the Lord, the more he likes to remain in the Lord&rsquo;s death. The Lord Jesus mentioned this in John 12:26: &ldquo;If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there also shall My servant be.&rdquo; The Lord always put Himself in the place of death so that He would lose His soul life. If we want to serve the Lord, we should follow Him to walk on this pathway of losing the soul life and living in His resurrection. If we truly follow the Lord, we will definitely encounter sufferings and persecutions, and there will also be the distraction of the world and the pride of the flesh. Only by remaining in the Lord&rsquo;s death can we overcome these trials and difficulties.</p>
<p>According to my observation, we who serve the Lord have another serious problem. It is our natural affection. To those who fit our taste, we are drawn closer; those who do not fit our taste, we will dislike and even separate ourselves from them. Leviticus 2 says that with all the meal offerings offered to Jehovah, there should not be any honey with leaven; rather, they should be mingled with salt (vv. 11-13). Honey here signifies natural affection, virtues, or excellencies; salt denotes the death of Christ, or the cross. Our natural affection can only bring in corruption and decay, but the death of Christ is effective in killing germs and preserving against decay. In the church life, regardless who treats us well, we should not become sectarian. We should consider all the saints to be the same; all are brothers and sisters in the Lord. The more we love the Lord, the more we need to learn to live in the Lord&rsquo;s death so that we can be delivered from our natural affection, taste, and opinion.</p>
<p>Hence, the basic principle set up by the Bible for us believers is neither self-improvement nor the rejection of evil and the practice of good, but the putting of ourselves into the death of Christ. When we love the Lord and enjoy Him, we abide in Him. As such, His first operation is to put to death all the fleshly things in us. His &ldquo;salt&rdquo; with its germ-killing effectiveness will kill all the &ldquo;germs&rdquo; which come out of our naturalness. Whoever has had the experience can confirm this word. A. B. Simpson, who wrote <em>Hymns,</em> #481, knew this fact. In the second stanza he said,</p>
<p class="hbody">&rsquo;Tis not hard to die with Christ<br />
When His risen life we know;<br />
&rsquo;Tis not hard to share His suff&rsquo;rings<br />
When our hearts with joy o&rsquo;erflow.<br />
In His resurrection power<br />
He has come to dwell in me,<br />
And my heart is gladly going<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way to Calvary.</p>
<p>The more we die with Christ this way, the more His resurrection power will be manifested in us.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE POWER OF THE RESURRECTION LIFE</h2>
<p>In 1932, the Lord raised up the church life in my home town, Chefoo. After one year, Brother Watchman Nee came to visit us, and I took him to my home for hospitality. Sometimes when we ate together, we had fellowship. One time he said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, if you bury a piece of stone in the soil, after one or two years, nothing will happen. However, if you bury a living seed in the soil, whether it be a flower seed or a barley seed, after a period of time, something will grow out of it.&rdquo; Then he continued, saying, &ldquo;We Christians are not a piece of stone, but a seed. If this seed falls into the death soil, it will surely bring forth something of life.&rdquo; At that time, I did not quite understand that word. I seemed to understand, but I did not. Then, over a few decades, I had many experiences. Today, I can say that I understand the meaning of this word. Certainly there is a resurrection life within us. This is the Triune God. It is also the Spirit. If we do not die, this life will not live. But if our natural man is dead, this resurrection life will live.</p>
<p>In the church life, whether in the brothers&rsquo; houses or the sisters&rsquo; houses, if we live by the divine and resurrected life, this life will put to death our natural affection. In this way, we will have the same love toward all the brothers and sisters and will not be close to some and distant from others. If we daily die to our self, to our natural affection and opinions, the power of the resurrection life within will operate, and the divine life and nature will be manifested from within us. As elders, co-workers, and brothers or sisters, when we come among the saints, the first thing we need to do is to die to ourselves, not having our own choice, taste, or desire. Only then will the power of the resurrection life be able to operate within us, and only then will the resurrection life be able to be dispensed into others through us. This was the life that the Lord lived on the earth: dying to the self and living out the Father&rsquo;s life. Today, if we believers are to live Him and follow Him, we need to have the same kind of living. Stanzas three and four of <em>Hymns,</em> #362 say:</p>
<p class="hbody">He lives for me that I may live<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As spotless e&rsquo;en as He;<br />
Savior, to me Thy nature give,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And live Thy life in me.</p>
<p class="hbody">He lives for me that I may give<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His love to hearts that pine;<br />
Let me like Him for others live,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trace His steps divine.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING DEATH<br />
AND ENJOYING RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>I hope that every one of us can see that the One in us is the processed Triune God; He is Christ, the Spirit&mdash;the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. He is also resurrection. The only way that we can allow Him to have a way is for us to die to ourselves. As long as we die to ourselves, He will energize and operate within us. Eventually, He will become the enjoyment within us and the dispensing and manifestation of life in others. This is to experience resurrection. We are not &ldquo;gritting our teeth&rdquo; to be Christians. We are not looking for suffering for ourselves. Rather, we are learning day by day to die to ourselves that the power of resurrection within can have the opportunity to energize and operate.</p>
<p>As we follow the Lord today, it is not a good thing in the long run for us to enjoy outward blessings. But suffering is very good perfecting for us because in the death of Christ and in dying to ourselves, we experience Christ. To follow the Lord and to always take the way of the cross means to always remain in the death of Christ. Then one day, there will be no more pride or humility; there will be no more self-hatred or self-love; there will be no more self-generated evil or self-generated good. In other words, there will be no more self, only Christ. This is God&rsquo;s salvation. Regardless of the kind of circumstances we are in or the kind of situation we encounter, the Triune God within us is the all-inclusive Spirit. Through His bountiful supply, we will eventually be saved (Phil. 1:19). Therefore, we need to pray unceasingly, contact the Lord, enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s love, and remain in the Lord&rsquo;s death so that the power of His resurrection can be manifested. May the Lord be gracious to us!</p>

	</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>All the verses quoted in this chapter are from 1 Corinthians 14. Superficially speaking, 1 Corinthians 14 mentions many things. Actually, it talks about only one thing, which is the encouraging of the saints to learn to prophesy in the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF PROPHESYING</h2>
<p>In the Chinese Union Version of the Bible, this word &ldquo;prophesying&rdquo; is translated &ldquo;prophets giving a teaching.&rdquo; This word is also translated &ldquo;foretellers.&rdquo; In 1 Corinthians 14, the emphasis is not on foretelling, but on speaking for the Lord and speaking forth the Lord. The Union version translates &ldquo;prophesying&rdquo; as &ldquo;the teaching of a prophet.&rdquo; However, as soon as prophets are mentioned, people begin asking themselves whether they are prophets or not. This was not the intention of the Apostle Paul; he had no intention to ask us to be prophets for the purpose of foretelling. Rather, his desire was that every one of the saints would prophesy, that is, to speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DESIRING TO SPEAK FOR THE LORD<br />
AND TO SPEAK FORTH THE LORD</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 14 begins by saying, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy....he who prophesies speaks to men for building up and encouragement and consolation....he who prophesies builds up the church&rdquo; (vv. 1, 3-4). To pursue love is to pursue the growth of life in order to develop the gifts in life. Therefore, the pursuing of love must be matched with the pursuing of the most profitable gift, that is, the gift of prophesying. In the church life, we should not only love one another, but also pursue gifts for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose. Among all the gifts, there is one gift which is the most important, prophesying. The meaning of prophesying is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord.</p>
<p>Since prophesying is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord, it implies supplying Christ to others. This is the most important matter in the church meetings and also the matter we pay the most attention to today. In changing the system through taking the new way, the Lord has fully opened to us the ordained way in the New Testament for believers to meet and to serve. We are now endeavoring very much to advance forward on this way. The most important item in this way is our prophesying in the meetings. Our experience tells us that the success of the practice of the new way from now on will depend entirely on this matter of prophesying in the meetings. If there are prophesyings in the meetings, and they are good and successful, then the new way will have a breakthrough. If the prophesyings in the meetings are lacking, or short, or failing, then the new way will not get through. Therefore, we must exercise ourselves in this most crucial matter.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Greater than Other Gifts<br />
in the Building Up of the Church</h2>
<p>Verse 5 says, &ldquo;Now I desire that you all speak in tongues, but rather that you may prophesy; now greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, that the church may receive building up.&rdquo; This shows us that in the building up of the church, prophesying is greater than other gifts. If we do not prophesy in the church meetings, the building up of the church will suffer a great loss. But if we do prophesy, the building up of the church will receive great benefit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being More Excelling than Other Gifts<br />
in Spiritual Pursuits</h2>
<p>Verse 12 says, &ldquo;So also you, since you are zealots of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the building up of the church.&rdquo; The &ldquo;spiritual gifts&rdquo; here, according to the original text, should be &ldquo;spirits.&rdquo; This shows us that at that time, those Corinthian believers with a Gentile background had confused the unique Holy Spirit, that is God Himself, with the many evil spirits in the matter of their spiritual pursuits. They were not clear nor did they adequately keep the uniqueness of the Holy Spirit. The apostle&rsquo;s word here does not imply an acknowledgment of their confused pursuit, but he was admonishing them, amidst their confusion, to seek to be transcendent in order to excel. The word &ldquo;excel&rdquo; in the original language implies filling, abounding, overflowing, as well as denoting excelling. According to the context, this word here does not refer to overflowing to abound, but to excelling above the ordinary. This implies that the Corinthian believers had confused the Holy Spirit with the evil spirits in their pursuit of spiritual gifts. According to the apostle, this mixed-up pursuit is very base and can cause the pursuers to be considered by others as Gentiles. Therefore, the apostle admonished them not to seek those undiscerned, confused spiritual things for their own enjoyment and exaltation, but to seek to excel, that is to transcend above those base pursuits, for the building up of the church. This is also our need today. For the building up of the church, we need to desire earnestly the excelling gift, that is, to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord in the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having More Manifestation of God<br />
than Other Gifts in Convicting and Judging Others</h2>
<p>Verses 23 through 25 say, &ldquo;If therefore the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak in tongues, and the unlearned or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are insane? But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all; the secrets of his heart become manifest; and so falling on his face, he will worship God, reporting that God is really among you.&rdquo; In the church meetings, if we all would prophesy, speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord, that would convict people and judge people, because this way of speaking has God as the content. It supplies the hearers with God and also leads them to turn to God. In other words, the church meetings should be filled with God, and all the activities in the meetings should transfuse and infuse people with God so that they may be saturated with God. In order to have this, all must prophesy in the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERY BELIEVER BEING ABLE<br />
TO SPEAK FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>Verse 26 says that whenever the whole church comes together, &ldquo;each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.&rdquo; This implies that when we come to the church meetings, we should have something of the Lord to share with others. We may have a hymn for praising the Lord. We may have a teaching of the teacher to supply people with the riches of Christ for edification and nourishment. We may have a revelation of a prophet to show people the vision of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose concerning Christ being the mystery of God and the church being the mystery of Christ. We may have a tongue for the unbelievers as a sign that they may know and receive Christ, or we may have an interpretation to make the tongue concerning Christ and His Body understandable. All these are things we receive from the Lord, things out of the Lord, which we possess before we come to the meetings through our experience of the Lord, our enjoyment of His word, and our fellowship with Him in prayer. These are not instant inspirations, but a regular accumulation; these are not accidental activities, but are acquisitions that come through much learning.</p><h2 class="head2">Needing to Learn the Lord&rsquo;s Word</h2>
<p>The five items listed in this verse, whether it is a psalm, teaching, revelation, tongue, or interpretation, are related to our speaking. For this, we need to learn the Lord&rsquo;s word and have much practice in prophesying. Verse 31 tells us that we &ldquo;can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged.&rdquo; This implies that the speaking of the prophets can cause people to learn and to be encouraged. Of course, the prophet himself has to learn and experience first. He has to learn the Lord&rsquo;s word first; then he can cause others to learn through his speaking for God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Know the Truths</h2>
<p>In order for us to be able to speak for the Lord, not only do we need to learn the Lord&rsquo;s word, but also know the truths (1 Tim. 2:4). The truths denote reality, which refers to all the real things revealed in the Word of God, which are mainly Christ, the embodiment of God, and the church, the Body of Christ. Everyone who wants to speak for the Lord must have a full knowledge and complete understanding of these things.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Have Experience of the Lord</h2>
<p>In the matter of speaking for the Lord, besides learning and knowing the Lord&rsquo;s word, we also need to experience the Lord. We cannot relate to others what we ourselves do not know; neither can we supply others with what we ourselves have not experienced. When we have the objective knowledge plus the subjective experience, we can be equipped to be one who speaks for the Lord and speaks forth the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Practice</h2>
<p>Finally, the only way for us to be one who speaks for the Lord is to practice. We all know that knowledge is one thing and speaking is another. Moreover, if you want to speak well, to speak with revelation and with supply, you need to have much practice and learning. Therefore, from now on not only do you need to learn the Lord&rsquo;s word, know the truths of the Bible, and experience the Lord, you also need to practice speaking the Lord&rsquo;s word in all kinds of meetings and environments. The more you speak, the more you will know how to speak. The more you speak, the more you will be good at speaking. I hope that you can establish such a habit to be a prophesying one. May the Lord be gracious to us!</p>

<h1 class="title">THE FOUR-LEVEL MEANING<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 16:12, 13, 15; Matt. 28:20; Acts 2:42; 2 Cor. 4:1; Eph. 4:4</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE TEACHING OF GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>There are four levels in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. As we all know, the Bible has two sections, the Old Testament and the New Testament. In the Old Testament, the first aspect of God&rsquo;s economy is the law, which is the main body of the Old Testament. Next are the prophets and then the people of God. The Old Testament, generally speaking, is composed of the law, the prophets, and the people of God. In the New Testament, God&rsquo;s economy is the teaching of the apostles. In the Old Testament, Moses brought the law, and the people listened to the law. In the New Testament, there is not one Moses, but many apostles bringing in the teaching of the apostles. In addition, there are the saints. Moses stayed on Mount Sinai for forty days and nights and received God&rsquo;s law. The apostles were with the Lord Jesus for three and a half years and received the teaching of the New Testament economy. But they were only at the initial stage. It was not the stage of completion.</p>
<p>What completed the teaching of the New Testament economy was not the presence of the Lord Jesus, but the presence of the Spirit. The Lord said plainly in John 16, &ldquo;I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality&rdquo; (vv. 12-13). The disciples did not understand it then, since the Spirit of reality had not yet come. Not until the Spirit&rsquo;s presence came did the disciples enter into all reality.</p>
<p>In addition, in the same chapter, the Lord shows us a little clue that the Spirit of reality whom the disciples were to receive was to be the Son who received all that the Father had (16:15). All that the Son has is to the Spirit, and all that the Spirit receives is opened up and disclosed to us. All that the Father has is to the Son, all that the Son has is received by the Spirit, and all that the Spirit receives is all that the Triune God is. Furthermore, the Spirit also opens up and discloses to us all that the Triune God is. This is the truth that the Spirit reveals to us when the Spirit of reality comes. Its content is the Triune God, who has passed through all the processes to be wrought into those who believe in Him, to make them sons of God and the members of Christ, that they may be constituted the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Hymn #501 in <em>Hymns</em> says,</p>
<p class="hbody">All things of the Father are Thine;<br />
All Thou art in Spirit is mine;<br />
The Spirit makes Thee real to me,<br />
That Thou experienced might be.</p>
<p>This verse expresses what the Lord told the disciples while He was on the earth in John 16. Not until the Spirit of reality came could these mysteries be revealed to them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES<br />
BEING GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>The New Testament shows us that these mysteries were mainly revealed to the Apostle Paul. Hence, he said he had received from God a ministry and a commission, that is, to complete the word of God (Col. 1:25b). The teaching of the apostles started in the Gospels, and was developed in Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation. In other words, the teaching of the apostles is the entire New Testament. There is only one law in the Old Testament&mdash;the law of Moses; there is only one teaching in the New Testament&mdash;the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>This teaching started when the Lord Jesus brought up the twelve disciples. Hence, we often see the Lord teaching the disciples in the Gospels. Then in Matthew 28, after the Lord resurrected, He charged the disciples to preach the gospel and to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God, and &ldquo;teaching them to observe all things, whatever I commanded you.&rdquo; Then He said, &ldquo;...I am with you all the days&rdquo; (v. 20). Therefore, the teaching of the apostles started with the Lord Jesus&rsquo; teaching to the disciples, especially to the twelve apostles, and ended with the revelation that John received on the Island of Patmos. Consequently, Revelation says that the revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament has been completed, and none is able to add to nor take away from it (Rev. 22:18-19). Revelation 22 is a closing word. The teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy starts from the Gospel of Matthew through the Gospel of John and continues through Revelation; the whole teaching has already been revealed completely.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR PREACHING OF THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES</h2>
<p>For us to preach the teaching of the apostles today is to preach what the Lord Jesus preached, what the apostles preached, and what Paul and John preached. It violates the teaching of the apostles if we preach anything else. For instance, if someone says that there will be no end to heaven and earth, that they will remain forever, we should find proof in the Bible and tell him that the Bible says there will be an end to heaven and earth. It says in the Gospel of Matthew, &ldquo;Until the heaven and the earth pass away, one iota or one tittle shall by no means pass away from the law until all come to pass&rdquo; (Matt. 5:18). Hebrews also says, &ldquo;They shall perish, but You remain&rdquo; (Heb. 1:11a). Whatever we preach must all be in accordance with the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>Some, such as the Mormons, preach heresies which are different from the teaching of the apostles. In the future, as we go through the whole island to evangelize Taiwan, we will probably meet such preachers. Hence we also need to study them so that we can expose them. In God&rsquo;s economy, the teaching of the apostles has been completed. None can add to or subtract from it. This is the foundation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. In the Old Testament, the foundation is the law of God. In the New Testament, the first layer of the foundation is the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;the teaching of the apostles&rdquo; appears once in the New Testament as a whole phrase and in many places in fragments. Acts 2:42 says, &ldquo;And they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles.&rdquo; This is the foundation of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It is like the Constitution: although it has many articles, it still is only one constitution. God&rsquo;s Old Testament economy has only one law; God&rsquo;s New Testament economy has also only one teaching of the apostles. This is the foundation of God&rsquo;s move and also the foundation of our service.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO RECOVER<br />
THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES</h2>
<p>The church started to digress from the teaching of the apostles from the beginning of the second century. We can find some clues of this in Revelation. Besides the teaching of the apostles, there were the teachings of the Nicolaitans (2:15), of Balaam (2:14), as well as that of Jezebel (2:20). The teaching of the Nicolaitans is just the teaching of clergy and laity, which is outside of the teaching of the apostles. The entire Christianity today, with the exception of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, has the teaching of the Nicolaitans, that is, the teaching of clergy and laity. Consequently, Christianity has become a religious organization. Even some of the brothers and sisters among us are not clear enough concerning this, bringing in the worldly concept that there is a difference in rank between the elders and the saints. This shows us that this religious concept is in our blood. Today&rsquo;s Christianity has deviated from the teaching of the apostles. The most obvious deviation is that they have received the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOUR-LEVEL MEANING<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The First Level&mdash;<br />
the Teaching of the Apostles</h2>
<p>In this message we shall see that only the teaching of the apostles can stand in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, and it will stand unto eternity. We must remember that the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. The law as the main body of the Old Testament was supplemented by the prophets. The main body of the New Testament is the apostles, and the prophets also serve as a supplement. The principle in both is the same. This is the first level of meaning of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p><h2 class="head2">The Second Level&mdash;<br />
the Ministry of the New Testament</h2>
<p>The second level of meaning of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is the ministry of the New Testament. Second Corinthians 4:1 says, &ldquo;Therefore, having this ministry, as we received mercy.&rdquo; The Old Testament ministry is one of death and condemnation, since the Old Testament brings in condemnation and kills (Rom. 5:13, 18, 20, 21). The ministry of the teaching of the apostles brings in justification and gives life (Rom. 5:18). What we all have received is this unique ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Third Level&mdash;the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 4:11-12, Paul says that different gifted persons perfect the saints, unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ. This is the third level of meaning.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fourth Level&mdash;the Churches of God</h2>
<p>The Body of Christ is universal and the churches are expressed in different localities. This is the fourth level of meaning.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVING IN THE ONENESS OF THE FOUR LEVELS</h2>
<p>Today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, our way, our service, our work, and our meetings are all based on these four levels. Furthermore, there is one teaching of the apostles, one ministry of the New Testament, one Body of Christ, and one church. This is the oneness of the four levels. Ephesians 4:4 says that the Body is one. Revelation 1 proves that the church in a locality is also one (v. 11); in each of the seven cities there was only one church (2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14). We in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today need to realize and be clear about this. If today we want to serve the Lord for our entire life, we need to serve in the teaching of the apostles, the New Testament ministry, the Body of Christ, and the churches of God.</p>
<p>The New Testament ministry is building the church of God and the local churches, that is, the Body of Christ today. Therefore, our work is the work of the New Testament ministry. We are not like some Christians who just do odd jobs. The work of the New Testament ministry is the building up of the Body of Christ according to the teaching of the apostles. Therefore, we need to see that our service is in the oneness of the four levels, in the local churches, in the Body of Christ, in the New Testament ministry, and in the teaching of the apostles. Hence, our service cannot be two. It has to be one. The work we do is also one and cannot be more than one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVING ACCORDING<br />
TO THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES</h2>
<p>If tens of thousands of saints in six continents are all doing the one work, who then is taking the lead? It is very mysterious to say that Christ is taking the lead. In practice, the real leader is the teaching of the apostles. We all must serve according to, follow, and be based on the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>Hymn #824 in <em>Hymns</em> says,</p>
<p class="hbody">The Church is Christ&rsquo;s own Body,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Father&rsquo;s dwelling-place,<br />
The gathering of the called ones,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God blended with man&rsquo;s race.</p>
<p>As far as the church being the gathering of the called ones is concerned, there should not be distinctions in who is on top and who is below, or who is high or who is low. But as far as the church being the Lord&rsquo;s Body is concerned, there is the difference between large and small members. One sees this in the human body where the shoulder is larger than the hand.</p>
<p>Today in the local church, we may not be too clear ourselves about what position we should take or what function we should have. But in the Body we become very clear: the hand knows where the foot is, and the nose also knows where the mouth is. Sometimes we may be the running feet. Other times we may be the working hand. Yet at another time we may be the listening ear. While our eyes may see clearly what others&rsquo; functions should be, we ourselves are often not too clear about ourselves. For instance, the sisters who live together in a &ldquo;kingdom house&rdquo; may not be too clear about whether they are older or younger than the others. You will be clear when you look at someone else. You know whether she is older or younger than you. It is best that we do not know too clearly. Whoever is older, I should accept her words. Whoever is younger, I should care for her. We need not ask ourselves whether we are hands or feet. Just as in a hospital, the treatment of ears, nose, and throat all belong to one department. As another illustration, take eight brothers and sisters in one family. You may not be clear about your rank among them, but you know who is the oldest, who is the second oldest and who is the youngest brother. Do not care which position you are in. If someone is older than I, I would receive supply from him; if he is younger than I, I would care for and guide him. This is what we need to see and learn.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LEARNING NEEDED IN THE BODY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not Disputing Who Is Great</h2>
<p>As young people serving the Lord from your youth, you must learn the lesson never to have any ambition to be a leader in God&rsquo;s house. There is an organic arrangement in the Body of Christ. You can see this from our human body. The ears are not for themselves when they grow on the sides of the head, neither are the eyes for themselves when they are in the eye sockets. God&rsquo;s creation is so organic and so wonderful! Although the eyes are in a high position, they are lower than the eyebrows. This is not for the eyes to decide. It is altogether an organic story, a story of the life in the body.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, the disciples all wanted to be great. When the Lord Jesus told the disciples that He would be handed over to man&rsquo;s hands and be killed, not only were the disciples not able to hear it, on the way they were even disputing who should be great and who should sit on the Lord&rsquo;s right hand and left hand. Not until the Lord Jesus had been crucified did they stop disputing (Matt. 20:17-26). Surely we should love the Lord. But, it is a terrible thing to have the ambition to be a leader and a head in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. You should do your best to function as a member in the position that is organically arranged for you in the Lord&rsquo;s Body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">No Opinion</h2>
<p>We need to learn to have no opinion in the Lord&rsquo;s service and work. For example, we all are now here being trained and, of course, we go out in the evenings to knock on doors to preach the gospel. If one day you return to your local church, and you push the preaching of the gospel by door-knocking without caring for the feelings of the brothers and sisters, I am afraid that you might cause problems. Therefore, when you return, it would be best for you to say, &ldquo;Thank the Lord. The Lord has given me grace that I always have the burden to preach the gospel.&rdquo; To say &ldquo;gospel preaching&rdquo; will not cause opinions; for you to say &ldquo;door-knocking&rdquo; probably will. Once opinions come, regulations and methods will also come, and in the end the church will suffer loss. Hence, if you go back to your local church and there are brothers and sisters who do not agree with door-knocking, you should not argue nor should you shout slogans. Rather, you should still go to visit gospel friends and to preach the gospel. In this way the gospel will still go out. So you see that if a thing is spoken inappropriately and understood improperly, it will cause opinions. Therefore, learn not to cause opinions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Seeking Credit, Not Envying,<br />
Not Having One&rsquo;s Own Work</h2>
<p>Besides this, learn not to seek credit for the things you have done. Do not always seek to have a good record or to show that you have some merit. Also, learn not to envy; learn to be glad to see others succeed; be glad to see others do better and more than you; and be glad to help others succeed. These are all lessons that we must learn.</p>
<p>No matter where we go, we must remember that there is no such thing as position in the Lord&rsquo;s church. In one sense each member in the Body has its own position. Yet it is not what the world realizes as position. When Paul wrote 2 Corinthians, he said, &ldquo;Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus...and Timothy the brother&rdquo; (1:2). In 1 Timothy he said, &ldquo;To Timothy, genuine child in faith&rdquo; (1:2). Paul did not exalt himself, thinking that he had a certain status in writing to Timothy. Although they had a great difference in age and Paul indeed could be a teacher to Timothy, Paul still deemed Timothy a brother. In the church there is no office and no position. These must be dropped and forgotten. In addition, in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, do not just do your own work. We must see that we all are doing the same work.</p>
<p>Every point mentioned above is very important to those who are taking the way of serving the Lord. Because of these problems, factions and strivings develop among Christians against one another. If we want to avoid these, we need to realize the four levels of meaning of God&rsquo;s economy according to this message: the teaching of the apostles, the ministry of the New Testament, the Body of Christ, and the local churches. In addition, we must learn in the service not to desire leadership, to have opinions, to envy, to credit ourselves, or to have our own work. If we do this, we will be blessed in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and will be perfected.</p>
<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei, Taiwan on April 19, 1988)</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>

<h1 class="title">A WORD OF CHARGE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 15:39; 1 Cor. 16:12; 2 Tim. 4:14, 15, 10; 1:15; 4:7, 2</h1>
<p>Now that I am clear about the staying behind or leaving from the training of the full-timers next term, I would like to have a word of fellowship with you, or a charge to you before this term of training is over. This morning, while I am still here, I will speak a few words of this kind.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF THE FULL-TIME TRAINING<br />
AND ITS PERFECTING</h2>
<p>First, I think many of you already know that the &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; service which has been among us the last few years is mainly for the saints who have a heart to pursue further. It is especially for the young college graduates. It gives them the opportunity to devote their lives to pursue God, to dive deeply into the truth, and to grow in life. If I remember rightly, I had already felt this way ten years ago when I was having some fellowship with a group of co-workers in the Bay Area in the United States. I hoped that the brothers and sisters in college or graduate school would take some time after their graduation and before their careers to seek after the Lord for at least a year, and preferably two years. During this time of seeking, some training would be given to them to produce some real perfection in truth and life as well as in the gospel and the church service.</p>
<p>The full-time training we have here was originally for this purpose. I know that you all have really gained something in the two years you have passed through, especially those among you who have been trained for four terms. You have not spent your time in vain. You have, to a greater or lesser degree, been affected by the Lord&rsquo;s truths and cultivated by life. You have also learned a few things about preaching the gospel and serving the Lord. Furthermore, you have had a taste of human life. These attainments have laid the foundation and made the preparation for your work ahead.</p>
<p>Not only so, these two years have given you the chance to decide for yourselves whether you should get a job or be full-time for the rest of your lives. It was very difficult in the past to determine whether or not a certain one should be full-time; eventually, we could not find a proper way. If we did not let a brother go full-time, we feared that we might waste good material; if we let him do it, we were not sure whether he would be suited to the full-time work. Now, we have finally found a workable way. Coincidentally, it ties in with the new way practiced three years ago when I first came back. By handling the training this way, we have produced full-time serving ones; at the same time it has provided the personnel needed for the Taiwan evangelization work. These two goals joined together complement and supplement one another very well. In the past two years, what we have done here has exactly met these two needs. Thank the Lord. I feel that we have, to a large degree, reached these two goals.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOING BACK TO A JOB,<br />
YET STILL SERVING THE LORD</h2>
<p>Some of you will probably go back to a job after this term of training. This does not mean that you will have nothing to do with evangelizing Taiwan. I believe that you who have been trained will have a great share in the evangelization work of Taiwan, even though you may not be full-time. The evangelization of Taiwan needs not only a thousand or more full-timers, but also thousands and tens of thousands of saints. Since you have been trained, you have gained something; therefore, you can pass on what you have gained. After you are back in your own locality, if the church formally initiates preaching the gospel, you will be able to cooperate with it. Not very long ago, I mentioned that if two brothers who are trained and have learned to be elders migrate to a place, applying themselves to what they have learned in the training, through prayer, and by relying on and following the leading of the Spirit, the Lord through them should be able to raise up a church of twenty to fifty saints within six months to a year.</p>
<p>You have been trained here. If you go back to your locality, whether you take a job or continue as a full-timer, you can more or less pass on what you have learned in the training to other brothers and sisters. As long as you rely on the Spirit, pray much, follow the leading of the Holy Spirit to serve and work, and not put the Lord aside or offend Him, in two or three years you should be able to raise up a church of at least twenty to thirty people. This was the original intention in having the young brothers and sisters attend a period of full-time training after they graduate from school.</p><h2 class="head1">FULL-TIME FOR ENTIRE LIFE NEEDING TESTING</h2>
<p>Brothers and sisters who have been trained and who hope to serve full-time their entire life still need to have further testing. In other words, even though you may feel to be full-time your entire life, it may not necessarily be so. You can try a few more years and see. Your environment may not allow you, or your folks may not agree. In that case, you could get a job. You should still look to the Lord, because one day He may change the environment and you will be free to be full-time again. On the other hand, if you have been full-time for a while, and it has been manifested that the gift you have received from the Lord does not warrant full-time work for the Lord, it would be proper for you to return to a job and continue to serve the Lord on the side. This is also very good. From this point of view, there is no life-long preacher system, nor does anyone take preaching as a life-time profession.</p>
<p>Let us look at Paul&rsquo;s example. He says in Acts 20:34, &ldquo;You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my needs and to those who are with me.&rdquo; This refers to his profession as a tent maker (Acts 18:3). Paul&rsquo;s reason for making tents was the lack of care from the churches. His making tents with his own two hands provided not only for his own needs, but also for the needs of his companions. Although he had a little job, he did not abandon the ministry which the Lord had committed to him. On the contrary, he was more diligent and more given. If, according to the Lord&rsquo;s gift, you need to fulfill your ministry in a full-time capacity, you should not take up a job; rather, you should serve full-time, circumstances permitting. However, if the church you are in cannot support you, you would still need to support yourself. But this is not to say that you cannot bear the responsibility of the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. I say this so that you would be clear that among us there is no such profession as a life-long minister. I hope you would all understand this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOLLOWING THE LORD&rsquo;S LEADING,<br />
EACH OPERATING IN HIS FUNCTION</h2>
<p>Through my contact with you during the past three or four weeks, I have come to the conclusion that you, as trainees, could be put into four categories. The first category is those who will return to jobs after the training. As I have already said, this category is according to our original intention in conducting the training. When you joined the training, many of you had intended to return to a job after being full-time for one or two years. Hence, when your time is completed, you may leave the training. This is like drafted soldiers being discharged when their service period is fulfilled.</p>
<p>I believe you all have received something, either in truth, life, the gospel, or the church service. You all have made some initial progress. This will affect you for the rest of your Christian lives. An educated person is different from an uneducated one. As long as you have been trained, you are different from those who have not been trained. Nonetheless, you should not be proud of this when you return. You must learn to be humble and to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading in a proper way. Regardless of whether you are welcome or not, you should demonstrate your usefulness in a positive way. You should become a pattern to the saints and an indispensable member of the church. Hence, do not forget the calling and the commission the Lord has given you when you return to a job.</p>
<p>The second category consists of those who will return to their own locality to be full-time. This is also very good. Although we hope that in the overall evangelization work of Taiwan the church in Taipei can first reach a certain degree of success, it is alright to return to your locality if they have a need and wish to have you back. When you return to your localities, you should coordinate with the local saints in humility according to your training and the leading of the Holy Spirit. Then, what you have gained in the training will spontaneously be passed on to the brothers and sisters, and the church will be affected in a positive way. This will afford the Lord a way to go on.</p>
<p>The third category includes those who are willing to stay in Taipei and to serve full-time. The fourth category consists of those who will continue in the full-time training. We may say that these two groups are of great importance to the church in Taipei. Consequently, you must do your best to go forward and to learn further while you are here in Taipei. I hope you will not neglect the pursuit of truth, the growth in life, the training and learning in the gospel preaching, or the church service.</p>
<p>Do not think that since you have been trained you know everything. It is good that you know how to use <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> to preach the gospel, but that alone is not enough. When you go out to preach the gospel in the future, you will discover other needs. Therefore, you must continue to learn. It is the same with respect to conducting home meetings, group meetings and district meetings. You need to do your best to learn. I know that you are not very experienced, and that the training center has not provided you the adequate guidance. Even I myself am still researching. There is much to learn here. In a home meeting, you must learn how to supply life, how to open up the truth, and how to help others to touch the spirit, enjoy the Lord, read the Word, and testify for Him. In the group meeting, you must learn how to lead people to share mutually, care mutually, and learn to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word. In the district meeting, you must learn how to help people to function organically, to prophesy and supply mutually, and to build up one another. All these have their own specific and particular ways. It matters very much whether or not you know these ways. Hence, all of you need to learn properly.</p>
<p>I hope that you will stay in Taipei for at least one or two more years. On the one hand, you can contribute to the evangelization of Taipei. On the other hand, it is a great opportunity for you to learn. If you remain here for two more years, you will be useful whether in this country or in a foreign land.</p><h2 class="head1">FIGHTING IN A WARFARE<br />
WITH STRUGGLING AND STRIVING</h2>
<p>Finally, I would like to share one serious matter with you. I have also been a young man. I know all the young people dream that since they have given themselves to the Lord in a full-time way, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will surely have a bright future. As soon as the army advances, victory will be everywhere and the evangelization of Taiwan will be a great success. On the one hand, the revelation of the Bible tells us that the white horse, representing the gospel, will overcome again and again (Rev. 6:2). Yet, on the other hand, we must go through much warfare. The evangelization of Taiwan will undoubtedly be accomplished, but it will be through much struggling and striving. We must see that in the whole process of the evangelization of Taiwan there are fightings and strivings all the way.</p>
<p>The verses quoted in this message prove to you that Paul&rsquo;s life was a life of struggling. First, in Acts 15 we see that Paul and Barnabas were originally intimate co-workers, often fighting along side one another. They won a victory in Jerusalem for the Lord&rsquo;s truth. Shortly after returning to Antioch, they intended to visit the brothers. Yet, there was a dispute between them concerning whether Mark should be brought along. The dispute was so intense that they each went separate ways (v. 39). This was no small blow to Paul. Then came the difficulty in the church in Corinth in 1 Corinthians 16:12. This difficulty somewhat had to do with Apollos. So, Paul urged Apollos several times to go with the brothers to rectify the situation there. But he was absolutely unwilling to go, and would go only when the opportunity presented itself. This incident really put Paul in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>In 2 Timothy 4:14 and 15, Alexander frequently persecuted Paul and greatly opposed the apostle&rsquo;s words. Paul&rsquo;s co-worker Demas also forsook him, having loved the present world, leaving for Thessalonica (4:10). In the end, even all who were in Asia turned away from Paul, forsaking his ministry and teaching which they received from him (2 Tim. 1:15). These difficulties, persecutions, and forsakings were all a warfare to Paul.</p>
<p>Even though Paul met so many difficulties, persecutions and forsakings, he was all the more strengthened in the grace of Christ. He labored and struggled according to the operation which operated in him in power. By the time he was to depart from the world, he declared, &ldquo;I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:7). Consequently, he could charge Timothy to &ldquo;Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:2). This means that whether the time is convenient or not, whether we are welcome or not, and whether there is opposition or not, we all should be firm and steady, and strive to preach the word.</p>
<p>We should &ldquo;sail on&rdquo; like Columbus who, not fearing storms or difficulties, went straight toward his goal. From this day on, we all must have such determination in the Lord. Regardless of others&rsquo; opposition and criticism, and in spite of others&rsquo; apostasy and backsliding, we will labor and strive in the way the Lord leads us. I believe these words are an inoculation to you against many negative things. Today, before the Lord returns and the kingdom comes upon the earth, there will still be warfare. In Ephesians, the book that reveals the church, Paul says in the conclusion that the church is a corporate warrior for executing God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. At present, the church is waging a war against spiritual enemies, wrestling against the power of darkness. May we all strive and struggle in this war until a full victory is won. I believe that these words will equip you. I hope that you will bring them back and will pray and fellowship about them.</p>
<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei, Taiwan on May 22, 1988)</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">A WORD OF CHARGE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 1:15; 4:10, 14; 2 Cor. 6:8; 4:11; 1 Cor. 16:9; Phil. 2:19-22; Rev. 2:4, 5, 7; Matt. 10:24; 1 Tim. 6:12; 2 Tim. 4:1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 18</h1>
<p>Following the last fellowship, I have some more unfinished words within me for you.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STORMS BEING OFTEN IN THE WAY OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>To begin with, I would like to tell all the trainees, and especially the young brothers and sisters, that man generally has a wrong concept about the Lord&rsquo;s work. He thinks that all works that are of the Lord will definitely prosper. This thought indeed has scriptural support, and in many cases it is indeed so. However, it does not mean that there will be no problem or attack in the process.</p>
<p>Let us first see the Lord Jesus&rsquo; example. He was God; yet He became a man and lived on earth as a man. When He was thirty years of age, He came out to fulfill His ministry and to do God&rsquo;s work. On the one hand, we do see success with Him, but it was not always &ldquo;sunshine without clouds or storms,&rdquo; as most people think. Once He and the disciples got on a boat, and He said to His disciples, &ldquo;Let us go over to the other side of the lake; and they launched out&rdquo; (Luke 8:22). A short time later, a storm came with winds and waves. We know that there were fallen angels in the winds and evil spirits in the waves. The fallen angels in the air and evil spirits in the water worked together to prevent the Lord from going across. It was only a short journey, but the storm was quite fierce. Concerning the Lord&rsquo;s work during His thirty-three and a half years on earth, there were indeed successes, but there were often winds and waves as well. There was hardly a place where there was no storm, and there was hardly a step taken without encountering resistance. The Pharisees were always following Jesus closely, seeking to ensnare Him in His talk and even to conspire against Him.</p>
<p>Eventually, He was betrayed by Judas, one of the twelve disciples. He was handed over to be judged, scourged, mocked, and crucified. When He was on the cross, people still jeered at Him, saying, &ldquo;If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;He saved others; himself he cannot save!&rdquo; (Matt. 27:40, 42). From man&rsquo;s point of view, He failed. Actually, He was victorious. Through death He destroyed the Devil, who had the might of death. Moreover, He resurrected from the dead, overcoming death and Hades.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLES ALSO<br />
MEETING PERSECUTION AND AFFLICTIONS</h2>
<p>After the Lord resurrected and ascended, the apostles continued His ministry and propagated God&rsquo;s work on earth. They won the first battle on the first day, the day of Pentecost. As soon as Peter started preaching the gospel, three thousand were saved and baptized. From that day, the Lord added daily those who should be saved. Nevertheless, the preaching of the apostles was not without difficulties or resistance. Later, James was martyred, and Peter was imprisoned. When Paul came, not only did he suffer much outward affliction and persecution, but he encountered troubles among his co-workers as well. As we have seen, first there was Barnabas, who disputed with Paul and left because of personal matters. Then there was Apollos. Paul advised him to go to Corinth to help when Paul was bearing the burden of the problem in Corinth, yet he absolutely would not go. Finally, in Paul&rsquo;s last Epistle, 2 Timothy, he said that all in Asia had left him and his ministry (1:15). Among those who left Paul was the church in Ephesus, where Paul had worked for three years. Moreover, Alexander the coppersmith did many evil things to him (4:14). His co-worker Demas loved the world and left him as well (4:10).</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s life-long service, just as he said himself, was of glory and dishonor, of evil and good report (2 Cor. 6:8). He was always in the triumphant procession of Christ, spreading the fragrance of Christ everywhere (2:14-15). He was also often delivered unto death and became the ambassador in a chain (4:11; Eph. 6:20). When he was in Ephesus, a great and effective door was opened to him. However, there were many opposers also (1 Cor. 16:9). In his last trip, he was transferred from Jerusalem to Rome as a prisoner. While he was expecting to be martyred for his Master, he wrote 2 Timothy. From man&rsquo;s viewpoint, he was martyred. From God&rsquo;s viewpoint, he was offered to God as a drink offering (4:6).</p><h2 class="head1">TREASURING BEING LIKE-SOULED</h2>
<p>Paul told the saints in Philippi in the second chapter of Philippians, &ldquo;But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be of good cheer, knowing the things concerning you. For I have no one like-souled who will genuinely care for what concerns you; for all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus. But you know his approvedness, that as a child with a father he has served with me in the gospel&rdquo; (vv. 19-22). Among all of Paul&rsquo;s co-workers, it seems that only Timothy was like-souled with Paul, being genuinely concerned with what he was concerned with, the things of the churches. The situation was really trying for Paul. He could not rejoice. We know that in the work of serving the Lord, it is not hard to be like-spirited, but to be like-souled is really difficult. If we pray together in spirit, saying, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; we are immediately like-spirited. But when we turn to discuss the service or other affairs, we right away have different feelings and views. Do not think that since we are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and have been in the training, we can work together like-souled and fight shoulder to shoulder. I have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for more than sixty years, and I was with Brother Nee for as long as eighteen years. In those years, from his experience I realized that it was not an easy matter to work together as co-workers. Some entered into this work and later left. In the coordination of the work, some would always come in while others would leave.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like for you who are present here to be prepared in your heart and to treasure this matter of being like-souled in the Lord&rsquo;s work. I hope that all of you will stay for a long time in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, that no one will leave halfway through, but that all will follow the Lord until the end. I feel joyful for Brother Nee. He was faithful unto death, even death in a prison. To the end he did not forsake his faith. In his whole life he met countless oppositions, attacks, and defamation. Yet none of these moved or changed him. Rather, he became firmer. In the end he was even martyred for the Lord. I speak these things to you to give you an inoculation. The more you follow the Lord, and the more you are used by the Lord, the more the opposition and attacks will come. Even the co-workers may not necessarily be like-souled.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING THE LORD&rsquo;S OVERCOMERS</h2>
<p>We see from Revelation that not every church overcomes all the way. For instance, the church in Ephesus had fallen and lost the Lord&rsquo;s testimony because they had left their first love to the Lord (Rev. 2:4-5). In this degraded situation, the Lord called for overcomers (v. 7). By then, what the Lord cared for was not a group, but individuals. Do not consider that everyone in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is an overcomer. This is not true. We should not think that all the full-timers, co-workers, or elders are overcomers either. It is not necessarily so.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the Lord paid much attention to the testimony of the church. He also paid much attention to the overcoming of individuals. All overcomers mentioned in the New Testament refer to individuals. Overcoming is something that has no companions. Therefore, we all need to learn not to belittle others nor forsake others. We are members one of another in the Body. Nevertheless, we cannot hope that everyone will be overcoming. For this reason, we must have a spirit that insists on this way even when all others forsake it, a kind of spirit that will not deviate even if situations, all the brothers and sisters, or even the whole church change. We have to be an overcomer. This is not a proud spirit, nor a spirit that rejects others. This is rather the overcoming spirit one should have in the way of the Lord, a spirit like that of Caleb and Joshua&rsquo;s.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT FEARING THE STORMS,<br />
STANDING BY AND RELYING ON THE LORD</h2>
<p>The Lord sent us to Taiwan in 1949, and we formally began the work in August of that year. We were as one man in the first few years. The gospel was prevailing everywhere we went. The number of saints was multiplied a hundredfold. However, this wonderful situation lasted only six to seven years. Problems soon came. In the ten years between 1956 and 1966, there was a big storm among us, bringing in no small difficulty and frustration. Then three years of peace came in 1968 through 1970. By then the Lord&rsquo;s recovery had already spread to the Western world. For more than ten years, the churches in both the East and West were quite stable and were in one accord. But the storms have come again in the last two years. This may be considered as the second set of waves since the Lord&rsquo;s recovery moved from mainland China to overseas.</p>
<p>We know that the Lord Jesus and the apostles met storms while fulfilling their ministry on the earth. Furthermore, all who were used by the Lord throughout the ages also had storms along their path. According to history, there is no storm in which the Lord is not in its midst. From what I saw in Brother Nee&rsquo;s life and from my own experience, I realize one thing: everything is under the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign control, and there is nothing to fear. None of these storms can defeat our Lord. Hence, we can say to the enemy who stirs up the wind and waves, &ldquo;All these have been tried on our Pioneer, the Lord Jesus, and they have failed to defeat Him. Now they will not defeat us either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young brothers and sisters, if the Lord delays His coming, your way of serving the Lord is still very long. You are being trained here, so I feel that I should give you this training lesson. You should know that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and the Lord&rsquo;s new way are God&rsquo;s ordained way according to the Bible. Our Lord has passed through it. All the Lord&rsquo;s followers throughout the generations have also walked in it. No one who follows the Lord and who is used by Him to release His ministry can avoid the same storms. &ldquo;A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his lord&rdquo; (Matt. 10:24). From the beginning I have prepared myself this way in my heart. You too should prepare yourselves.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT OF THE FAITH</h2>
<p>I believe that although my words are not so perfect, they can give you a good inoculation. You should be able to apprehend and receive them. I hope that this light will establish the goal in your way and will shine brighter as the days go by. Hence, you should pray more and go onward positively. Paul urged Timothy in 1 Timothy 6:12 to fight the good fight of the faith. Even up to the time of his death, he still charged Timothy&mdash;one he had raised up&mdash;by the Lord&rsquo;s appearing and kingdom to be faithful to fulfill his ministry of the word (2 Tim. 4:1-2, 5). The Lord&rsquo;s appearing is for judgment, to reward every one of us (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12). The Lord&rsquo;s kingdom is for Him to rule with all His overcomers (Rev. 20:4, 6). These two should be our warning, our encouragement, and the aim of our living and work.</p>
<p>Later Paul declared, &ldquo;For I am already being poured out, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:6, 7). And again, &ldquo;The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto His heavenly kingdom&rdquo; (v. 18). This was the reward that Paul gained. It was also the testimony and encouragement he gave to Timothy. I would likewise encourage and equip you with these words. May you be one spirit and one soul, striving together in this way of warfare.</p>
