Ephesus was a church on the decline, so the Lord revealed Himself as One walking in their midst inspecting His churches. He is the unchanging One. Therefore, the church in Ephesus should not change either. Smyrna was a church in tribulation, so the Lord revealed Himself as One who died and rose again, preparing them for martyrdom. Pergamos was a church with heresies, so the Lord spoke to them with a two-edged sword showing His judgment. Sardis was a church in death, so the Lord revealed Himself as the Spirit of life and as the bright shining star. Philadelphia was without blemish, so the Lord opened wide the door of preaching to them that they might have an enlarged work. Laodicea was a worldly church, so the Lord revealed Himself as One kept outside the door. Even though His church failed, He Himself still witnessed faithfully and remained as the One who is above all. Although to each church the Lord revealed one aspect of Himself for the purpose of exhorting and warning them, these revelations were not limited only to the individual church that received the epistle. They also served to reveal His nature in general to all the churches.</P><P>(3) Concerning the meaning of these seven churches, we already know that they represent all churches past and present. Let us now consider further what they represent.</P><P>The word Ephesus means "loose." At the beginning, the church had a very deep love for the Lord, but after a while, this love gradually cooled down. This was the condition of the church after the apostles.</P><P>The word Smyrna means "suffering." This was the stage when the church underwent persecution and suffered martyrdom. Christians underwent countless persecutions under the hands of the Roman emperors. In the church some had forsaken the gospel and joined the Jewish religion.</P><P>The word Pergamos means "high tower." During this time, the Roman emperor Constantine joined Christianity, and the tribulation of the church ended. The real faith was lost, and the church was united with the world!</P><P>The word Thyatira means "her untiring sacrifice." This is the age of Roman Catholicism. During this time, the priests became corrupted and the truth was covered by darkness. Christ's rightful position was usurped, and the church committed fornication.</P><P>The word Sardis means "restoration." After many years of darkness the church had her restoration. This is the time of the reformation. They returned to the Lord Jesus, but they were still weak unto death.</P><P>Philadelphia means "brotherly love." This was the condition of the church during her revival over a century ago. Christians were not divided into sects but were joined by brotherly love. They diligently kept the word of the Bible, the word of God's patience.</P><P>The word Laodicea means "opinions of men." This typifies the church today. She is increased with material goods, fallen in spirituality, becoming neither hot nor cold, and listening to man more than keeping the Lord's command. This is the age of the secularization of the church.</P><P>Prophetically, the conditions of these seven churches match church history perfectly. However, in actuality the confused situations of all seven churches exist at every stage of the church's history, only, at times the condition of one of these seven becomes more prevalent and more obvious than that of the others.</P><P>(4)Concerning their works, in almost every epistle, there is the sentence "I know your works" (2:2, 19; 3:1, 8, 15). The Lord knows every work, whether it be good or evil. Each church must bear her own responsibility-"I know your works." While Ephesus has works but has no love, Thyatira has both works and love, and while Laodicea is completely worldly, Philadelphia is completely godly. The sin of Laodicea is not imputed to Philadelphia. Every church ought to bear her own responsibility. None is accountable for others, and none can escape blame because of others. All will be judged according to their own works. Judgment is based on the individual's works. This judgment has nothing to do with salvation or perdition because here it talks about the matter of works. Works have nothing to do with our salvation (Eph. 2:8-9; Titus 3:5). Concerning the two churches in Smyrna and Pergamos, the Lord did not mention anything about their works, as if they had none. However, just as the Lord "knew" the works of the other churches, He also "knew" the condition of these two. Although they had no other works, the enduring of persecution at Smyrna and the martyrdom at Pergamos were the best works in the Lord's eyes (Rev. 2:9, 13). In these seven epistles, the Lord stated their works, their afflictions, and His view regarding all their works and environments. This was a precursor to the coming judgment seat of Christ. As the Lord judged His churches then, in the same way He will also judge His churches at that day.</P><P>(5)In every epistle there are the Lord's examination and commands. Even in judgment our Lord still exhibited His kindness. Although there were many errors and evils in His churches, He did not conceal their good works. On the one hand, He was just in exposing their sins; on the other hand, He was kind in revealing their merits. Moreover, He did not rebuke their sins right away. Instead, He first praised them as much as possible and then rebuked. Therefore, woe is he who receives no praise from the Lord!</P><P>The judgment of the Lord is just. He did not leave any goodness without praise nor any evil without rebuke. He mentioned the churches' loyalty, tribulation, poverty, faithfulness, works, love, faith, diligence, patience, good works, purity, and endurance (2:6, 9, 13, 19, 24; 3:8, 10). He also spoke of the churches' coldness, heresy, fornication, self-exaltation, worldliness, weakness, imperfection, being alive in name but dead in reality, being neither cold nor hot, wretchedness, misery, poverty, blindness, and nakedness (2:4, 14, 15, 20; 3:1, 2, 15, 16, 17).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 04: The Christian (2) &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
