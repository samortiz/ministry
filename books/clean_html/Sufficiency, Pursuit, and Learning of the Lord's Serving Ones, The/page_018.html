<h2 class="head2">Seeing the Blueprint<br />
of the Building Up of the Church</h2>
<p>In 1940, before the Pacific War broke out, I went to Shanghai again in order to fellowship with Brother Nee. In a private time he told me that the blueprint for the building up of the church was in his hands. These few words gave me a deep impression, and I kept asking myself what was the blueprint. During two months of fellowship with Brother Nee, he gradually showed me the blueprint.</p>
<p>His words were often concise. One time he said that this blueprint is, first, Christ as everything. The only material for the building up of the church is Christ; hence, Christ is everything. Second, this building is expressed in localities. And third, this building should be carried out in coordination.</p>
<p>In 1940 the church in Shanghai established a deacons&rsquo; service, because of the revelation that Brother Nee had related to the administration of a local church. This beginning was for the practice of serving in coordination. Brother Nee set up the deacons&rsquo; service, and he led the deacons to serve. He also led the elders in administrating the church. Brother Nee served as a deacon and as an elder, but he did not replace the deacons or the elders; he led them in their service. At that time, we had a procedure for receiving the saints, and Brother Nee personally took the lead to care for this matter. He handled the receiving of the saints in order to show the deacons and the elders how to receive the saints. He was clear that in order for us to have the practical building up of the church, he needed to be personally involved, and he needed to lead the elders and deacons by serving together with them. During this time, the blueprint was unveiled to me.</p>
<p>In summary, I received two great visions from Brother Nee. First, in 1933 and 1934 I saw that Christ is everything to us and that He is our life. I also saw that in order to experience Christ as everything and as our life, we must experience His death and resurrection. Second, in 1940 I saw the vision of the building up of the church. I returned to northern China in 1940, and from that time onward, the situation in the churches in northern China changed because I practiced the leading I had received. I led the deacons and the elders in their services. I also set up a deacons&rsquo; service so that everyone could learn to serve in coordination in order to carry out the building up. I received these matters from Brother Nee.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeing the Outline of Church History</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Inheriting the Spiritual Riches<br />
of the Past Two Thousand Years</h2>
<p>Furthermore, in my contact with Brother Nee, he also showed me two points that require our attention. First, he gave me an outline of the past two thousand years of church history. Through reading spiritual books, biographies, and church history, he had inherited all the positive things received by the church. Brother Nee was very familiar with the crucial points of the messages, publications, biographies, and history of Christianity, including Catholicism. Even the brothers of the Brethren assemblies were not as clear or well versed in matters concerning the Brethren assemblies as Brother Nee.</p>
<p>Brother Nee had a thorough knowledge of the history of the church. He could clearly say when, where, and why a certain event happened. He could even say in which book an event was recorded. We translated several books into Chinese, such as Madame Guyon&rsquo;s autobiography and also <em>Method of Prayer.</em> We also translated the writings of Francois LaCombe. I received this outline of church history during my first trip to Shanghai while I was a guest at his place.</p>
<p>In January 1934 there was a conference in Shanghai. Brother Nee gave many important and precious messages during that conference. One of the messages was entitled <em>What Are We?</em> In one meeting he stood up and asked, &ldquo;What are we?&rdquo; Then he gave a lengthy message on church history, covering the time from the apostle John to the present. He spoke concerning most of the spiritual matters and people during this period of two thousand years. He related which spiritual persons came forth during a particular time and what was their spiritual worth. He also told us why we took certain points from a person but rejected other points. The co-workers who were present in that meeting were rather young. His speaking amazed us. This was the way that the Lord used Brother Nee to open the spiritual riches from the past two thousand years of church history in order for us to have a clear outline.</p>
<p>During that time we had many long discussions with Brother Nee. We spent almost every day together, and he repeated many points to us. He said that we are not a denomination among the other denominations, but we do not reject everything in the denominations. For example, he said that we are not Baptists, but we practice baptism by immersion; we are not the Holiness Church, but we pay attention to being holy; and we are not Catholics, but we accept spiritual things from Madame Guyon. Through his fellowship, my eyes were opened to the spiritual riches. He also spoke concerning many spiritual people, from Andrew Murray to Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis. Brother Nee explained all the spiritual matters of the past two thousand years, regardless of the sect or group it concerned. This is the first point.</p>
