   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LESSON FORTY SANCTIFICATION THE SECOND STAGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sanctification is another important aspect of God s full salvation, and it becomes a facet of our experience in the enjoyment of God s full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SANCTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 ...ye may put difference between holy and unholy Lev 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The meaning of Sanctification, whether in the Hebrew of the Old Testament or in the Greek of the New Testament, is mainly separation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, to be sanctified to be made holy in the Bible means to be separated from the ordinary and common things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Holiness is the state of God s nature, which is not only sinless and without evil, but also different from all and distinct from the common.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, whenever the Bible mentions God and the things concerning God or belonging to God, it describes them as holy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Any person, thing, or matter that is not rendered unto God or does not belong to God is common.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once it is rendered unto God and belongs to God, it is sanctified, separated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE SECOND STAGE OF SANCTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1 But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified 1 Cor 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It has already been mentioned in Lesson Thirty-seven that, according to the revelation in the Bible, Sanctification in God s salvation is divided into three stages in us: the first is for our repentance, the second is for our justification, and the third is for our transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The verse quoted here refers to the second stage, after washing and before justification.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, this stage of sanctification follows the cleansing away of sins covered in Lesson Thirty-eight and ushers in justification, to be discussed in the next lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before we can be sanctified, we must first be cleansed from our sins; likewise, before we can be justified, we must first be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>POSITIONAL SANCTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1 Receive forgiveness of sins...among those who have been sanctified Acts 26:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the second stage, the sanctification which we receive in God s full salvation is both positional and dispositional.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Positional sanctification is a fact, a sanctified position, which we receive in Christ when we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The sanctification spoken of in this verse is such a positional sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A. Through the One Offering of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>1 We have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all Heb 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This positional sanctification is accomplished through the offering of the body of Christ once for all, as a sin offering, to set us apart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>B. Through the Blood of Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>1 ...Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood Heb 13:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This positional sanctification is obtained by us through Christ s redeeming blood shed on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once we are bought back by the Lord s blood, we are separated from the world, receiving a sanctified position and being made holy unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>C. By Being Called</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>1 Who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints 1 Cor 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This positional sanctification is obtained by us as a result of our being called by God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we are saved and called by God, we are separated by God to be saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a matter of position.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Of course, we also received God s holy life when we were saved and regenerated, but this holy life was not yet lived out to become our experience of sanctification.</S>
