   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE COMMISSION OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to see the commission of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Preaching the gospel is the greatest commission in the Bible, and it is the Lord s greatest charge to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This charge is found in three portions of the New Testament: the last chapter of Matthew, the last chapter of Mark, and the last chapter of Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to these three portions, after the Lord Jesus resurrected, He left us with a commission.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This commission was His final charge.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Matthew 28:19 says, Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Mark 16:15 says, Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to proclaim the gospel not only to all the nations but also to all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Luke 24:47 says, That repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These three verses show that preaching the gospel is the Lord s commission to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After a person is saved, he does not need to be encouraged to preach the gospel, because there is a spontaneous desire within him to preach the gospel to others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When he preaches the gospel, he is full of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Preaching the gospel revives us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are burning within when we preach the gospel to people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The presence of opinions and disputes in the church is proof that the church has lost the burden of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The best way to eliminate opinions is to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we preach the gospel, we are in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Preaching the gospel is truly the Lord s commission.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord lives in us because He wants us to preach the gospel to others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every believer has a desire to lead others to salvation and has the spirit of the gospel within him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Preaching the gospel is the Lord s commission to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul said, I am debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish Rom 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The debt that Paul owed was the debt of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1 Corinthians he said, If I preach the gospel, I have no boast, for necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a stewardship 9:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This shows that we bear responsibility for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This applied to Paul, and it also applies to every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever a believer draws near to the Lord, he has the sense that he owes people the gospel, that he is a debtor of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even though he is not hired, he bears responsibility and feels that he has the debt to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He also feels that it is an offense to the Lord if he does not preach the gospel and that the Lord will judge him for not preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we have a heart for the Lord, we will sense the distress of not preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, if we are willing to preach the gospel, we will receive a reward from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we not only need to receive a commission from the Lord, but we also need to take care of the inner feeling of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Preaching the gospel is our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE ENDEAVOR FOR THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We also need to endeavor in the gospel 1 Cor 9:19-22; Rom 1:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul said to his younger co-worker Timothy, Proclaim the word; be ready in season and out of season; convict, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and teaching 2 Tim 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is wrong for us to say that it is not convenient to preach the gospel or that it is not the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is also wrong for us to excuse ourselves and say that we are too busy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul said that we need to preach the gospel in season and out of season.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE POWER OF THE GOSPEL Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to preach the gospel, we must have the power of the gospel, which comes through prayer Acts 6:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we want to preach the gospel in a fresh, living, effectual, and powerful way, we must pray thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to pray until we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes we are not saved when we go to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are thin-skinned, we need to pray in order to be saved from our shyness and bashfulness when we want to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we preach the gospel in this way, we experience salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For example, we may want to preach the gospel, but we still love the world and are not completely separated from it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Unless we are delivered from the world, it will be difficult for us to preach the gospel with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, we need to pray until we are saved from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here is another example.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Friction is unavoidable between family members.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sometimes there is friction with our parents or with our children or with our spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Such friction makes us unhappy and causes us to blame others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How can we preach the gospel in this condition?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to pray until the Lord saves us from our anger and from blaming others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Here is yet another example.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Suppose a student, who has so much homework that he needs to study during the day and at night, receives a burden to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If he does not pray himself out of his studies, he will be powerless when he preaches the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He will be like a deflated tire.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This does not mean that the students who want to preach the gospel should neglect their studies.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They need to study diligently, but when they go to preach the gospel, they need to pray and be saved from their studies.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Only then can they preach the gospel with power.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Since we are very weak and fragile, even a piece of clothing can occupy us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A sister may feel that she needs to wear something presentable when she goes to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But the more she considers her clothing, the more her spirit sinks.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It may be that her children are naughty and soil her dress.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In this situation the sister needs to pray herself out of being occupied with her clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In order to preach the gospel, we need to be crazy and not care for or be concerned with anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In conclusion, we must pray before we preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need to first pray for our deliverance, not for the salvation of others.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We are able to save others when we pray until we are clear and transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If our condition is not that of a saved person, how can we save others?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In order to preach the gospel, we must not be usurped by any person or thing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We can release others only when we are released.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must not be occupied by any person or thing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Therefore, we need to pray much so that we may be delivered from any form of pre-occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When we are released, we will be able to release others.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When we preach the gospel, we should also pray for people s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, we first need to pray until we are released.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then we need to pray to receive power.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We need to pray for the economical Spirit to fill us and be with us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should pray, Lord, today I apply the economical Spirit that You have poured out upon Your Body.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Clothe me with Yourself as a mantle.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I am going out to speak today.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Open the heart of those whom I speak to, and demolish the stronghold of Satan within them while I am speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We need this kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is better to have thorough prayer before we preach the gospel.</S>
