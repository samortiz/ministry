   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Receiving Love from His Debtors</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From his debtors the moneylender did not receive repayment he received love.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 42 the Lord Jesus asked Simon which of the debtors would love the moneylender more as a result of having been forgiven by him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that love to the Savior is the issue, not the cause, of His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we experience the Lord's gracious forgiveness, we respond with love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, our love may differ in degree, depending on how much we have experienced His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was the reason for the Lord's word to Simon in verse 47: "To whom little is forgiven, he loves little."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The woman's loving much was a proof that her many sins had been forgiven; Simon's loving little testified that he had been forgiven only a little.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Concerning the experience and enjoyment of Christ as a moneylender, we need to pay attention to the three matters of faith, love, and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord's word about love in verse 42 indicates clearly that love is the issue of forgiveness, that love comes after forgiveness instead of preceding it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The cause of the forgiveness of sins is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why the Lord Jesus eventually said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Go in peace" v. 50 . It was the woman's faith that had saved her.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Her sins were forgiven not because of her love but because of her faith.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, faith comes before forgiveness, and love follows faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we believe in the Lord Jesus, our faith becomes the cause of the Lord's forgiveness of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then as a result of having our sins forgiven, we begin to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we love Him, this love issues in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we may walk in peace, which means to live in peace, to have a life of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, when we believe in the Lord, we love Him and live a life of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>46.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was despised and slandered as a low and mean Samaritan John 8:48; 4:9 by the self-exalted and self-justified Pharisees. a. Taking Care of the Fallen and Law-stricken Sinner with Compassion</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jerusalem means "foundation of peace" cf.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Heb 7:2 , and Jericho was a city of curse Josh 6:26; 1 Kings 16:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The words going down indicate falling from the city of the foundation of peace to the city of curse.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The man in this parable was taking the way of such a fall.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The "robbers" signify the legalistic teachers of the Judaic law John 10:1 , who used the law 1 Cor 15:56 to rob the lawkeepers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word stripped signifies the stripping caused by the Judaistic teachers' misuse of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Greek word translated beaten literally means "laid blows on."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This beating signifies the killing by the law Rom 7:9-10 .</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This Samaritan signifies that the Man-Savior, in His lost-one-seeking and sinner-saving ministry journey 19:10 , came down to the place where the wounded victim of the Judaizing robbers was in his miserable and dying condition.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When He saw him, He was moved with compassion in His humanity with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is important to note that 10:33 speaks not of mercy but of compassion.</S>
