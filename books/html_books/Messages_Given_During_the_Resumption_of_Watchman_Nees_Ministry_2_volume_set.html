When the news spread to other places, the churches in the provinces of Fukien and Kwangtung, together with the church in Hong Kong, invited me to visit them. At the same time, co-workers from northern and southern China, together with co-workers from the West, decided to come together in Shanghai the following year for a co-workers' conference and to share the Lord's grace one with another. Consequently, toward the end of 1947 Sister Peace Wang, Rachel Lee, and I first went to Hong Kong. Afterwards we went to Canton, Swatow, and Amoy. Finally, in March the following year we went to Foochow. In all these places we held special revival conferences. After the meetings in Foochow, the two sisters and I went according to our previously-arranged schedule to have some private fellowship with Brother Nee at his home concerning the future of the Lord's recovery. When the news went out, about thirty to forty co-workers around the Foochow area unanimously requested that they be admitted to the fellowship also. Upon Brother Nee's approval, they all attended those meetings. During these meetings, it was brought out one day the need of "handing over" oneself. All agreed enthusiastically to do this. Subsequently, this move brought in the recovery of Brother Nee's ministry. First, Brother Nee took care of the need of the meeting in Foochow. After that, he went with me in April of that year to Shanghai to conduct a nationwide co-workers' conference. Throughout this period, Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi and his wife were in most of the meetings. The content of this book is their brief records of these meetings in various places.</P><P>Of all these meetings throughout this period of the recovery of Brother Nee's ministry, I was present in all except the first two meetings, and I was even helping to conduct the meetings. I sat face to face with our brother and heard these messages with my own ears. The light that was released  was like the shining of the midday sun. Forty-three years have since elapsed. There is indeed the need at present to let its light shine forth once again as the rising sun. Fortunately, under the Lord's sovereignty, we have with us the remaining manuscripts of the brief records by Brother Weigh and his wife. When I read them again, every message was filled with the dawning light. What impressed me the most and rendered me the greatest help are eight things: (1) the knowledge and realization of the Body of Christ, (2) the knowledge and denial of the self, (3) the knowledge of and submission to the authority in the Body of Christ, (4) the knowledge and acceptance by the co-workers of the "line of Jerusalem," (5) the service and coordination of the whole Body of Christ, (6) the need and practice of handing over oneself with all one has, (7) the leading and coordination among the co-workers, and (8) the importance of the Holy Spirit in the service in the Body of Christ. May the Lord grant us the mercy, the grace, and the blessing, that all the above points would be abundantly realized in our work and service of the Lord's recovery.</P><P>Witness Lee<br />Anaheim, California<br />July 19, 1991</P><h1 class="title">FOREWORD</h1><P>This book is a translation from Chinese of a collection of messages taken from brief meeting notes of Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi and his first wife, Lin I-tien. Except for some slight adjustments in sentence structure, the majority of the material is presented as found in the manuscripts. The main speakers of these messages are Brother Watchman Nee and Brother Witness Lee.</P><P>The first section comprises notes of private fellowship between Brother Nee and Brother Weigh in Foochow during September of 1947. The notes are comparatively scanty in content.</P><P>The second section, except for the last chapter, is a record of Brother Witness Lee's first visit to Hong Kong in December, 1947, and the help he rendered to the church there. It includes four conference meetings, four fellowship meetings, one gospel meeting, and one account of private fellowship. The main burdens of these meetings are the believers' living by the life of God and the proper way to serve in the church. The last chapter is Brother Lee's testimony given in Canton.</P><P>The third section is a record of Brother Lee's words given to the church in Swatow in January, 1948. It includes eight conference messages, two Lord's Day morning messages, one open talk, and thirteen private talks with a small number of individuals. The main burden lies in God's way of life and the way to help the whole church to rise up to serve.</P><P>The fourth section comprises fellowship and messages of a nationwide co-workers' conference in Shanghai during April and May of 1948. The first chapter begins on April 9, and the final chapter ends on May 16. In total there are thirty-eight days of meetings and fellowship, covering forty-two chapters. During this period, most of Brother Nee's talks were given in the co-workers' meetings rather than in the church meetings. Only a few times did he speak to the whole church in the church conference meetings. This fellowship is weighty, full of light, sober, and direct. The main burdens are the way of recovery that the church takes on earth today, the recovery of the Body life, the coordination of the co-workers, ministry and authority, the relationship between the local churches and the work, release from the bondage of money, the way to preach the gospel, and the way to arrive at the universal priestly service. The materials covered are precious and invaluable. Due to the size of this work, we have divided the series into two volumes, with chapters one to forty-five as the first volume, and chapters forty-six to seventy-nine as the second volume. May God bless His church through these messages.</P><P>Andrew Yu<br />October, 1991</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE MERCY OF GOD</H1><P>Date:September 5, 1947<br>Place:Foochow, Fukien<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EVERYTHING DEPENDING ON THE MERCY OF GOD</H2><P>When we read Romans 9, we have to pay attention both to its principle and to its application as well. This chapter reveals the principle that everything depends on God's mercy. The apostle applied this principle to the Israelites. He showed us that everything that happened to the Israelites was of God's mercy. Today, not only do we need to pay attention to the application, but we need to pay attention also to the principle behind the application.</P><P>Here it says that "it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy" (Rom. 9:16). Zeal and pursuit are of no use. Neither will the absence of zeal and pursuit be of any use. To wait too long, not to wait long enough, to be too quick, or to be too slow&#151;none of these is of any use. To be in one place or another, to hear much or to hear little&#151;none of these is of any use either. Everything depends on the mercy of God. Only the Holy Spirit is able to lead men to a proper standing. There must be at least one time that a person sees God's mercy. Concerning this matter, your eyes must be opened at least once. Of course, it is good if your eyes can be opened more than once. But there must at least be one time when you see that everything depends on God's mercy. Whether you see this matter all at once, or you realize it through a process, the minute you touch this matter, you touch a fact&#151;not a feeling, but a fact. This fact is that everything depends on God's mercy.</P><P>God's mercy is a fact. A fact is not dependent on feeling. Take the matter of regeneration as an example. We often tell sinners that they must have a one-time definite experience of repentance and believing in the Lord. To the believers, we say that they must have a one-time definite consecration of themselves to the Lord. In principle, it is the same with regard to man's understanding of God's mercy. There must be at least one time when a person definitely touches God's mercy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED TO DEAL WITH<br>THE MIND, THE EMOTION, AND THE WILL&#151;<br>BEING TEMPERED UNDER<br>THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Three kinds of people need God's dealings: those who are strong in their will, those who are strong in their emotion, and those who are strong in their mind. Many people are controlled by these three kinds of conditions. These three things must experience God's breaking. God deals with man's strong points more than He deals with his weak points. Many times, man's strong points hinder him from spiritual progress, more so than his weak points. Unless a man is dealt with in these three areas, he cannot know God's mercy.</P><P>After a man has been dealt with by God, he will be tempered in his spiritual life. In many things, it is inappropriate either to be too much or to be too little. Some people wait for too long, while others do not wait long enough. All these require tempering. Some people are not strong enough in their inner man; their outer man is too strong. This is like a man's head taking up one-fourth of his body or one-sixteenth of his body; neither is proportionate. The right proportion should be one-seventh of the body. Some people are too strong in their mind. Others are too strong in their emotion or their will. Their inner man is not strong enough. These conditions require tempering.</P><P>Once I took a leader of the China Inland Mission to hear Brother T. Austin-Sparks. After the message, others would usually ask about the message just given. But on my way home with this brother, I did not ask him anything. In the end, he opened his mouth. He felt that Mr. Sparks was too strong in his will. I told him that my will was also quite strong. This leader, Mr. Baker, asked, "How then are you able to get along with him?" No doubt those who are outwardly strong in their will do not easily get along with others. But this brother did not realize that we are one because of our inner man; it is not because of our outer will. Today, in order for our inner man to match our outer man, our inner man must grow. When the inner man grows, it can control the outer man.</P><P>Some people are too strong in their minds. Their minds need to come under the control of the inner man. I have read the New Testament a few hundred times. Although I cannot say that I have read it more times than everyone else, I can at least say that I have read it more than many people. I could find over one hundred passages that contradict each other. However, I have not done this because my mind has been under the control of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>If we want our spiritual life to be well-tempered, we need to attune our condition to a proper balance. We must neither be too much nor be too short. This can be compared to shooting a pinball machine; there are pins to the left and to the right, and the balls must be directed at the optimum angle before they can score. There are many pitfalls in our spiritual journey; our mind, emotion, and will can all become our hindrances. If we are too much or too short, we fall into danger.</P><P>Everything depends on God's mercy. Before I was saved, I planned to go to America. Had I left two months earlier, I would not have met Sister Dora Yu, and I might never have been saved. Even if I were given the chance later, I might not have believed. It was God's mercy that I met Miss Dora Yu at that time. It was neither too early nor too late.</P><P>Only God can do things in just the right amount. We are prone to speak either too much or not enough. No one can preach a message that will meet everyone's need. Even the apostle Paul and the apostle Peter faced the same problem. When words come out of a person's mouth, it is difficult for the words to come out just right. This is why it is easy for people to misunderstand words.</P><P>Only God can bring man to a state of true humiliation. Sometimes a little cross and a little dealing make a person proud instead of humble. Only severe crosses and severe dealings will make a person humble.</P><P>Some people are too spiritual; they think that the Lord dwells only in our spirit. But Ephesians 3 says that by faith Christ dwells in our hearts. He dwells not only in our spirit, but in our hearts also. This is something that a person can feel. John 15 says that Christ abides in the believers, but it does not say that Christ abides in our hearts. Only Ephesians 3 mentions Christ dwelling in our hearts. Some people are too spiritual. They think that the heart does not mean much. However, many of the Psalms mention the heart. In order to be tempered in spiritual matters, we need to pay attention not only to the spirit, but to our hearts as well.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY OF THE CHURCH&#151;LOOKING TO GOD'S MERCY</H2><P>The way of the church during the past two thousand years is a way of looking to the mercy of God. Only God's mercy can temper us. I have often told the young people that they may have to wait for five years before they will realize that everything is of God's mercy. On the average, a person has one hundred forty thousand hairs. The Bible says that God has numbered every one of our hairs. He knows us more than we know ourselves. When God wants to save us, we are saved. If God does not show mercy on us, no one can be saved. Once D. L. Moody was preaching the gospel, and a lady was about to be saved. Just then an umbrella fell; it caused a distraction, and in the end the lady was not saved. Whether or not a man can be saved is not the responsibility of the preacher. The responsibility of the preacher is simply to present the way to others. Only God's mercy can put a person on the way. It is God's work that puts a person on the way. It is also God Himself who takes men on, on the way.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ON NOT BEING CAUSED TO STUMBLE</H1><P>Date:The Lord's Day morning, September 7, 1947<br>Place:Foochow, Fukien<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><P>Hymns, #144, stanza one, says:</P><blockquote>Lord of glory, we adore Thee!<br>Christ of God, ascended high!<br>Heart and soul we bow before Thee,<br>Glorious now beyond the sky:<br>Thee we worship, Thee we praise&#151;<br>Excellent in all Thy ways.</blockquote><P>Here the hymn says "Christ of God." We are familiar with the term "Son of God," but we seldom say "the Christ of God." The Christ of God means the One anointed by God and sent by Him to accomplish His work. In the original language, the word for Christ is Christos, and the word for Christians is Christianos, which indicates that Christians are those who belong to Christ.</P><P>Hymns, #38, stanza one, says:</P><blockquote>Of all the gifts Thy love bestows,<br>Thou Giver of all good!<br>E'en heav'n itself no richer knows<br>Than Jesus and His blood.</blockquote><P>Here the hymn tells us the vastness of God's riches. We have to wait until that day before we can fully prove the value of God's love. Some people think that it is good enough for God to give us heaven. However, heaven is not the best thing that a person can have. If a man is satisfied with heaven only, he is limiting God's love. He is in reality limiting God's love to heaven. Some people say that they will be satisfied with just a small corner in heaven. Such people are limiting God's love to a small corner. However, our God is not stingy. His grace is abundant, both in the past and at the present, and in the future as well. God sends the rain and the wind in free and full measure. God does not mind giving us a little more than we need. If God were to exercise restriction, it would be a terrible thing for us. Miss M. E. Barber once wrote a hymn that says:</P><blockquote>There is always something over,<br>When we taste our gracious Lord;<br>Every cup He fills o'erfloweth,<br>Rich supply He doth afford.<br>Nothing narrow, nothing stinted,<br>Ever issued from His store;<br>To His own He gives full measure,<br>Running over, evermore,<br>To His own He gives full measure,<br>Running over, evermore.<br><br>(Hymns, #595, stanza one)</blockquote><P>The water that Christ gives is living water. What man has is only well water. Well water can never be compared to living water. John 4 says that "the well is deep" and that there is "no bucket" (v. 11). Under such circumstances, man continues to be thirsty.</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matthew 11:1-19</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT BEING CAUSED TO STUMBLE BY THE LORD</H2><P>The passage we just read records how men were caused to stumble by the Lord. Here John the Baptist must have been extremely puzzled by Christ. Why would Christ not do something spectacular, such as healing the blind and the lame? Before this time, John the Baptist gave a strong testimony for Jesus, declaring that Christ is the Lamb of God and that He came to take away the sin of the world (John 1:29). A second time he declared, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" (John 1:36). When Christ was baptized, John saw the Holy Spirit descending upon Him (John 1:32). However, here John was caused to stumble by the work of Christ. Formerly he told others that he was not worthy to untie the thong of Christ's sandal (John 1:27). Now he was sending men to Christ and was pressing Him to answer honestly if He was the Christ.</P><P>At the same time, it would have been possible for Christ to be caused to stumble by John the Baptist as well. John was supposed to be Elijah. He was supposed to be very successful. Why is it that he ended up in prison now, and why is it that he failed today? However, the Lord was not caused to stumble by John.</P><P>Today, many people are caused to stumble by the Lord. They are caused to stumble by the way Christ lived. John's food was locusts and wild honey; his clothing was of camel's hair (Matt. 3:4). You cannot find such clothing even in a fur store. Yet when Christ came, He ate and He drank. He was absolutely the opposite of John the Baptist. For this reason, men were caused to stumble by Him. It is easy for a person to have a preconceived idea of what a spiritual man should be, and if anyone does not fit such a pattern, this person would be caused to stumble.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT BEING CAUSED TO STUMBLE<br>BY ANYTHING OR ANYONE</H2><P>Around 1921, there were about fifty students in Trinity College in Foochow. They all became Christians through my preaching. At that time, I was trying to use Miss Barber's baptistry to baptize them. Miss Barber asked who the baptizer would be. I told her that the Bible indicates that whoever preaches to another is qualified to baptize that one. Miss Barber said that it was better to let Leland Wang baptize these ones because he was older than I was. Later I tried to recommend Brother Dan-wu Wu, for he was twelve years older than I was, and he was of course older than Leland Wang. However, Miss Barber insisted that Leland should be the baptizer. When I brought up the matter of age, Miss Barber remained unchanged about her choice. I then said, "Since you had already made up your mind in the first place to have Leland do the baptizing, why did you bring up the matter of age?" In spite of this, I was not caused to stumble.</P><P>Once Miss Barber wrote me a letter and told me definitely not to come to one of her meetings. Nevertheless, when the time of the meeting came, I went, by forcing my way through the door, so to speak. When Miss Barber saw me, she said, "It is so good that you have come. I have many things to talk over with you. I need your help." In this instance, I was not caused to stumble by Miss Barber either.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY TO AVOID BEING CAUSED TO STUMBLE&#151;<br>LAYING ASIDE THE OUTWARD APPEARANCES<br>AND REALIZING THE SPIRITUAL REALITY</H2><P>We have to realize the spiritual reality behind everything that God has arranged. We should not consider merely the superficial outward appearances. There may be a thousand things along the way that could cause you to stumble, but what you have to do is to lay aside all these things and look straight ahead at the spiritual reality, rather than to be affected by the apparent errors.</P><P>In 1926 at White Teeth Lake, one day I saw an article by Mr. Jeffrey in the magazine Witness and Testimony. After Miss Barber saw that same article, she told me that Mr. Jeffrey would soon be separated from us. I did not quite agree with her, and I said to her, "You just like to make big assertions and outlandish remarks. This is your temperament." However, after one or two months, Mr. Jeffrey did indeed separate himself from us. Later, when I was in India, I met him and asked why he left. I told him what Miss Barber had told me. After he heard those words, he resolved to take care of the problem on that very day. Immediately, he bought a ticket and sailed home to England to apologize to Mr. Sparks, because at the time he left the latter, he had spoken something against him. Today, men are easily caused to stumble by small things. We need the grace of the Lord that we will not be caused to stumble by anything or anyone.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S VESSEL<br>SPECIAL CONFERENCE (1)</H1><P>Date:Evening, December 26, 1947<br>Place:Hong Kong<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Phil. 2:12-13; 3:8-10 (note the words "obeyed" and "operates" in 2:12-13)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MAN'S SPECIFIC USE&#151;TO BE FILLED WITH GOD</H2><P>Man is a specific creature. He is created for a specific use. A light bulb can only shine when it is placed in the proper place. If it is not placed in the proper place, it will not shine; if the bulb could speak, it would tell you that it was senseless that it should be there. In the same way, unless a man exists for a specific purpose, that man is empty. Man's specific use is to be filled with God, in the same way that the light bulb is used to shine forth light. In this universe, man should be filled with God and should shine for God. Some people are filled with money, education, family, and position. But after they are filled with these things, they are still empty. Lands and houses are but turmoils and headaches. Man does not live for these things. The specific purpose of man's living is God. Whether a person is young or old, rich or poor, male or female, as soon as a person touches God, he is satisfied.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S PURPOSE IN MAN&#151;<br>FOR MAN TO CONTAIN HIM AND TO EXPRESS HIM</H2><P>Within every one of us, we need God. Without God, we feel empty, unsatisfied, and sad. God needs us also. He needs us more than we need Him. God not only created man; He also sought man out. After Adam fell, God asked him, "Where are you?" When the Lord came, He came to seek and to save the lost sinners. In the story of the prodigal son, we see God's need for man. The father needed the son. Parents need their children more than the children need their parents. Why did God create man, love him, and save him? Some say that God is love, and that He has prepared many places in heaven. They say that if we do not go to heaven, heaven will be empty: "All things are ready; come to the feast"&#151;this is the calling of God's love. But what is the purpose of God's loving us and saving us? God's purpose is to receive glory through man. His purpose is to express His life through us. When a light bulb is connected to the electric current, it shines forth light. This is the meaning of glory. When God enters you and is expressed through you, it is glory. God desires that we be filled with Him within. Every saved believer has God within him. We need to see this before the Lord, and we need to present ourselves to God in this way to be His vessel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONSECRATION NOT FOR GOD'S WORK,<br>BUT TO BE GOD'S VESSEL</H2><P>Many times we want to do this and that kind of work for God. I have been to a number of places in northern and central China, and I have seen some very zealous workers for the Lord. Although they are very zealous, few among them know that they are God's vessels. To them, there is not much difference between being God's vessel and working for God. But I have to say that there is a big difference between being zealous for God and being God's vessel. To those among you who have consecrated yourselves to the Lord, I would like to ask a question: "Why did you consecrate yourselves to the Lord?" God wants us to be His vessels so that He can put Himself inside of us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S WAY&#151;<br>CALLING MAN TO BE HIS VESSELS</H2><P>It is natural for us to work much for God and to save souls. There are over one million people in Hong Kong. If there are ten or twenty brothers and sisters here who are filled with God within, in two to three years, you will definitely see many people saved. But more than that, those who will be saved will be very different from those who are saved today. As long as God fills Hong Kong, blessings will be here. I arrived here on Tuesday (December 23). By now I have been here three to four days already. I have met many brothers and sisters who are very zealous. I would like to ask if among these many brothers and sisters there are some who are God's vessels. Here is an elderly sister. She has been meeting with us from the very beginning. Let me ask, "What are you doing here? Are you here merely to meet, to listen to messages, and to pray?" If that is what you are doing here, God cannot have a way here; He will not be able to spread out from here. This is why in the past there have been so many revival meetings, spiritual conferences, and other meetings, and yet after these meetings are over, no one has changed. In the nineteenth century, there were many conventions, sermons, conferences, and revivals. But these things are not God's way today. Only when some answer God's call will God have a way today. There are those who are zealous for God. There are also those who work for God. But how many are there who will truly answer God's call?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY TO BE GOD'S VESSEL</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Removing Hindrances and<br>Emptying Out Oneself</H2><P>God desires to gain man so that He can put Himself into man. God desires to have such a vessel that can contain Him and express Him here and now. This may sound very simple, but actually it is not simple. To pour water into a glass is simple because the glass has no will, emotion, or inclination of its own. If you want to pour water into it, it will not object. If you do not want to pour water into it, it will not complain. However, if you want to pour water into me, it will not be a simple matter. This is because I am a living creature; I have a will, an emotion, preferences, inclinations, choices, a mind, and imaginations, not to mention the many sinful and evil things that are within me. Even for us who are serving God, there are so many things. In the case of the unbelievers on the street, it is difficult to have God put within them. In the case of us who are serving God, it is likewise difficult to have God put within us. Therefore we must empty ourselves, obey God, and consecrate ourselves to Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Fellowshipping with God<br>and Walking according to the Spirit</H2><P>The meaning of consecrating ourselves to God is not to work for God, but to become God's vessel, and to allow God to fill us up. From morning to evening, are you led by the Holy Spirit in everything you do? Many times, we have good prayers in the morning. But soon after that, we find ourselves doing more than a few things contrary to the leading of the Holy Spirit. If you measure these things according to the letter of the Bible, these things may not constitute very serious mistakes, but your conscience will condemn you. A voice within will tell you that you have not turned to God enough, that you have not been godly enough, and that you have not obeyed Him enough. If you want to love the Lord, there is no need for you to beg, to fast, or to pray for three days. The simple thing to do is to receive the Lord into you. We are not Christians in an outward way. We are Christians in an inward way. We are not Christians according to the biblical teachings and doctrines. We are Christians according to our inner feeling. If we are such Christians, we will surely touch God all the time. If you fellowship with God, you will become God's vessel. All the time, God will fill you up and will shine His light through you. No doctrine can be our way. The most important thing for us to do is to be a vessel of God. All that God wants is to gain some people who will live before Him. Zeal, love, and emotional sentiments are useless. Only one thing is useful: to take care of the feeling within moment by moment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Not a Result of Teaching,<br>but a Result of Living</H2><P>For example, Brother Hwang may hit Brother Hsu on the face one day. Perhaps Brother Hsu does not strike back. If you ask him why, he may tell you that the Bible teaches him not to do that. If he says this, he is not a first-class Christian. We should be Christians not by teaching, but by living. Confucius taught people to honor their parents and to love others, but that kind of honoring and love comes out of teaching. Today, we do not eat because others teach us to eat, but because we have a taste for eating. For you to eat rice today is not a decree of the government, but a choice based on your taste. If you ask me why I am speaking on this subject tonight, I will tell you that it is not the Bible that tells me to speak this way, but the inner feeling that tells me to speak this way. The more I speak this matter, the more I feel happy. In the New Testament, there are many passages with the little word "in" in them. Many outsiders do not understand what this word means. I only wish I could go to the streets and shout to people, "I have God in me! Do not touch me, for I have God in me!"</P><P>Man is God's vessel. God's work today is to put Himself into man. This is God's purpose.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ALLOWING GOD<br>TO LIVE HIMSELF OUT OF US</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SPECIAL CONFERENCE (2)</H1><P>Date:Evening, December 27, 1947<br>Place:Hong Kong<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Phil. 2:12-13; 3:8-10</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S PURPOSE IN MAN&#151;WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</H2><P>If we read through the Old and the New Testament, we will see that God has one specific purpose in man. Whether in creating man or in redeeming man, God desires to achieve this purpose. This purpose can be considered the center of the universe. If a man does not meet this purpose while he lives on earth, he will feel empty. Even a Christian who does not see this purpose will feel that his life is meaningless. God has shown us in many ways through His word what this purpose is. God's purpose is to work Himself into man. At the end of Revelation we are told that in the new heaven and new earth, when God's work is completed, He will have worked Himself completely into man. By that time, God will be fully in man, and man will be fully in God. God and man will become one. We may think that we were destined for perdition and hell. After we are saved, we may think that now, as a saved person, we are satisfied as long as we can go to heaven. However, this is not the highest purpose of God, His ultimate purpose. God's highest purpose, His ultimate purpose, is to work Himself into man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SALVATION BEING GOD ADDED INTO MAN</H2><P>God created man according to His image (Gen. 1:26). What is the meaning of an image? When you see a picture, you recognize the person represented by the picture. There are many great men in this world; it is difficult for us to meet them face to face. However, we can recognize them from their pictures. Man is God's picture. At the time of creation, man had only God's image; he did not have God's life. At that time, man bore only God's outward appearance. After he is saved, he possesses God's life as well (2 Pet. 1:3). Salvation means that God comes into us. By this, we become a man with God, having received nothing other than God and nothing less than God Himself. Salvation is not a matter of turning an evil man into a good man, or turning a filthy man into a clean man. No matter how much man cleanses himself, he is still only a man. The meaning of salvation is God added into man. Man's number is seven, and seven is three plus four. Four is the number of the creatures, and three is the number of God. Three plus four means God added into man.</P><P>In 1932, I was meeting in the denominations. There were many people in my denomination, and not a few were saved. One older gentleman was a professional man in the law. Although he was old, he was very healthy. I noticed him in the services, but I had never had a chance to talk to him. One day I met him on the street, and I asked him, "Have you believed in the Lord?" He told me happily that he had. I asked, "Are you saved?" He said that he was. I then asked, "How do you know that you are saved?" He said, "I know I am saved because God and I have become one." This word was marvelous. Even if you were to give the whole world to me, I would still be one individual person, an empty person. But one day I was saved, and God entered into me. From that time on, the two became one. This is like an electric light. Before the switch is turned on, the light does not shine. But once the switch is turned on and the electricity comes, the light comes on. When we are saved, God is added into us. The two have become one. This is not something for the future, but something that is for the present. What does this mean? It means that God is added into man. In the future, who will the perishing ones be? The perishing ones will be those who are empty, those who do not have God inside them. Who are the saved ones? They are the filled-up ones, those who have God inside them. On the day of salvation, God entered into us. Many times, I considered myself an evil person. Sometimes I have even hit myself. But then I would remember that the God within me is marvelous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PROPER LIVING<br>OF THE BELIEVERS AFTER SALVATION&#151;<br>ALLOWING GOD TO LIVE HIMSELF OUT</H2><P>After a person is saved, all his spiritual experiences consist of allowing God to gain the proper ground within him. They consist of allowing God to live Himself out of him. Let me illustrate this in another way. Suppose there is an empty glass here. This depicts the condition of man before he is saved; he is empty within. After he is saved, he is filled within, in the same way that the glass would be filled with water. Do not say that salvation is to bring us into heaven. Salvation is to put God into us. The Lord washes us with His own blood for the purpose of putting Himself into us.</P><P>Some of us had bad tempers before we were saved. Now that we are saved, we have a "housekeeper" within us. You will discover that there are now two persons within you, one on the outside, and the other in the inside. This can be compared to putting on our clothes; we are the clothes, and God puts Himself inside of us. When I sit down, my clothes sit down with me. When I come here, my clothes come with me. When I go home, my clothes go home with me. Sometimes, we may be afraid outwardly but not inwardly; we may be confused outwardly, but we are clear inwardly. We may feel pressed outwardly, but we are at ease inwardly. This is because God is living within us. For God to live out of us is true spirituality; this is growth, and this is the true spiritual reality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY TO ALLOW GOD<br>TO LIVE HIMSELF OUT OF US</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Taking Care of the Inner Feeling</H2><P>Brothers and sisters, I look to the Lord to gain a group of people in Hong Kong who will answer God's calling to allow Him to live Himself out of them. How can God gain ground in us? How can we live out God? When God operates in us, He gives us feelings. You need to take care of these feelings. You have to take care of every feeling from God. Brothers and sisters, if you neglect these feelings, you will not grow even if you read your Bible all year round. This is because God does not have any ground within you; He cannot live out from you. God desires to mingle His nature, desires, thoughts, inclinations, and will into man. However, Satan tries to usurp man with his own devices also. Some people are fully occupied in their mind, desires, and emotions with fashions, position, fame, parents, children, or marriage. This is the reason the Lord calls us to deny our children, wife, parents, houses, and lands (Matt. 19:29). You have been attending revival meetings and spiritual conferences for many years. But you are still the same you; you have not changed. No wonder you do not grow. The reason you do not grow is that you have ignored the inner feelings. You have only added to yourselves some outward practices, doctrines, and knowledge. I do not believe that the teaching tonight will help you. Brothers and sisters, if God grants mercy to you, and He touches you or visits you, you will begin to take care of every inner feeling.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Giving Oneself to God</H2><P>How many people here tonight would like to take care of their inner feelings? You need to go to God in a specific way, to set aside a time. It may be midnight tonight, but do not wait until tomorrow. Give yourself to God. I do not say consecrate yourself. I say give yourself to God. Say to God, "Lord, from now on, I would take care of every feeling from You. Mingle Your inclinations, emotions, desires, and thoughts into me." If you would give yourself to God in this way, and if tomorrow morning while you are putting on your clothes, the Lord says to you, "Don't put on this piece of clothing," what will you do? This is an important matter. We all look very zealous; we are busy running to and fro. But when God puts a demand on us, many times we will not obey it. If you are such a Christian, how can you grow? Not only are you deceiving God; you are deceiving even yourself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Having an Ambition to Obey God Absolutely</H2><P>Many Christians walk according to their own tastes. This is like those who have a sweet tooth devouring sweet things when they see them and rejecting spicy things that are served to them. A person can be fussy with food, but he cannot be a Christian in this way. A person can be a "pew-Christian," a "Sunday-going Christian," but such a one will never afford God the way to go on. You may say that you are willing and that you hope the Lord will help your weakness. God will surely not listen to such a prayer because by praying in this way you have opened a back door already; you have made provision for yourself to disobey already. You should have the ambition to say, "Lord! I do not need Your help. As long as You give me a feeling, I will obey."</P><P>The gospel has been preached in Hong Kong for over a hundred years. Here are over a million people. But too few people are saved. Even among us tonight, we have only one to two hundred people. What is the reason for this slow increase? It is a small thing for you to answer my question today, but how would you answer the Lord that day at the judgment seat? There is no need to wait for that day; even today, it is hard for us to give an answer to ourselves. There is no need for those who do not obey their inner feelings to vindicate themselves; there is no need for them to tell God that they are serving Him. There are many who have proclaimed themselves to be believers, and it is not necessary for you to tell others that you are zealous. However, if you truly give yourselves to the Lord, you will see many people saved through you. If you want to love the Lord, love Him in an absolute way. If you want to love the world, love it all the way. A man can only be one person at a time; he cannot be two persons at the same time. He cannot love the Lord and love the world at the same time. Some people are eight different persons all at one time; their hearts are in eight different places. One place may be their children. Another place may be their money. It is better for these people to put their hearts in one place and to love God with a single heart.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Being Simple, Not Analyzing,<br>and Walking Step by Step<br>according to the Feelings of the Spirit</H2><P>In order to be a Christian, a person must be simple. As soon as a feeling comes, we should obey. As soon as another feeling comes, we should obey again. This is the Christian way. You do not need to worry if this or that is wrong. Even if you are wrong, you need not be afraid. As long as you feel peaceful in your heart, you can go on. As long as you remain simple, and as long as you are for God and are pure toward Him, you do not need to analyze too much. You have to realize that sometimes God gives us uneasy feelings within; He also makes us uncomfortable. Whenever you feel uncomfortable about something, do not do it. If you practice this, after a while, your emotions, desires, and thoughts will become one with God, and spontaneously God will fill you up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Studying the Bible<br>to Allow God's Word to Check<br>the Feeling in Your Spirit</H2><P>At the same time, you must study the Bible thoroughly. This allows the Holy Spirit to have a chance to enlighten you. The Bible confirms our feelings and tells us whether they are right or wrong. To be a Christian, a person must not only walk according to the teachings of the Bible, but walk according to the inner feeling. A weighty and proper Christian is one who reads the Bible, on the one hand, and walks according to the inner feelings, on the other hand. If you do not walk according to your feelings, you are merely a dead Christian. We must all learn to take care of this crucial matter: to go along with the inner feeling.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE INDWELLING OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SPECIAL CONFERENCE (3)</H1><P>Date:December 29, 1947<br>Place:Hong Kong<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:20; John 15:5; Eph. 3:17; Phil. 2:12-13; Rom. 8:26-27</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHERE IS THE LORD JESUS TODAY?</H2><P>Where is the Lord Jesus today? This is a very interesting question. Some say that the Lord Jesus is at the right hand of the Father in heaven. Others say that He is in our hearts. Let us consider what the Bible says.</P><P>There are four Gospels in the New Testament. Where was the Lord Jesus in the book of Matthew? Where was He in the book of John? In Matthew 26, He was betrayed. In chapter twenty-seven, He was crucified, and in chapter twenty-eight, He resurrected. I remember that when I was in Nanking a brother answered me promptly that in Matthew, the Lord Jesus is in ascension, whereas in John, the Lord Jesus is in the Father.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Being with Us</H2><P>The end of Matthew tells us that the Lord Jesus is "with you all the days until the consummation of the age" (Matt. 28:20). In the book of Matthew, we see two names, Jesus and Emmanuel. Emmanuel means God with man. No doubt God is God, yet He is now with man. It is true that He incarnated, grew up, worked, was betrayed, was crucified, and has resurrected. But today He is still with man. Today the Lord is here with us. He is with us by being within us. Suppose we have two hundred fifty people here today. Our physical eyes do not see the Lord. Today the Lord is not in our midst; He is not the two-hundred-fifty-first person. He is with us by being in us. He is not mingled among us, but He is within us. Outwardly speaking, men see us. But inwardly speaking, there is the Lord. In every age, wherever the Lord's disciples are, the Lord is there. Wherever there are believers, the Lord is there.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Being in Us</H2><P>Where has the Lord gone in the Gospel of John? He has come into us. John does not have chapter twenty-two. In chapter twenty, He was resurrected. Originally, He was God, coming in the flesh and living among men. Now through the Holy Spirit, He enters into man. Today, we do not merely have Jesus among us, but we have Jesus within us. Outwardly we are a man, but inwardly we have God. God was once in Jesus the Nazarene. Today He is in us. The Scriptures reveal to us that God in Christ has come into man. Oh, what a glorious fact! As a little man, I have God living within me. Today I have become a great man. Do you know who I am? I am "great." I am greater than the king of England. This is so much higher than the forgiveness of sins! I wish I could shout. Do you know who I am? The Jesus who is the King is now living in me. The One who is the eternal life has come to live in me. On the one hand, He is in me as life. On the other hand, He is ruling as the King. When I am sad, He comforts me. When I am confused, He enlightens me. When I am in darkness, He shines on me. When I rebel, He disciplines me. Today He is within me.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE INDWELLING CHRIST</H2><P>Whether or not you are a proper Christian, and whether or not you carry some spiritual weight with you depends on the way you take care of the Lord. If you take care of Him properly, you will be a proper Christian. If you do not take care of Him properly, you will not be a proper Christian. To be a Christian is fully a matter of your relationship with the Christ who is within you. It is not a matter of how much work you do or how much love you have. It is a matter of having the proper relationship with the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FELLOWSHIPPING WITH THE LORD,<br>ALLOWING HIS ELEMENTS TO OCCUPY<br>AND REPLACE US</H2><P>Suppose you treat a person well and render him much help. Can you say that this is spiritual? Outwardly speaking, this is very spiritual. Actually, it may not necessarily be spiritual. How then can something be considered spiritual? While you are fellowshipping with the Lord, He may tell you to help a certain person. If you obey His word to help this one, this is spiritual. Furthermore, while you are helping such a one, you do so by trusting in the strength of the Lord all the time and acting according to the inner feeling. You are not only performing what is after His heart; you are also acting according to His feelings and His thoughts, and you are taking Him as your content and as everything to you. Day by day, you will have more of the Lord, and gradually your thoughts and your natural disposition will decrease. Up to a certain point, your own elements will disappear, and the Lord will occupy your whole being. Finally, you will be able to say that it is no longer you, but Christ the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PURPOSE AND PRINCIPLE OF GOD'S WORK&#151;<br>WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</H2><P>When you have God's life, nature, thoughts, and love within you, and when you are filled with Him, God's desire will be accomplished. God desires to mingle Himself with man. God has taken on man's form. Now He wants man to take on His form. He has put on humanity, and He has ascended to heaven with His humanity. He is the God-man, and He is the Man-God. He desires to see that man has God, in the same way that He as God desires to put on man. God can now say, "O man! I now have the human nature." Man can also say, "O God, our great God! I now have Your nature." This is God's eternal purpose. It is for this purpose alone that God created man, redeemed him, forgives his sins, regenerates him, and lives in him. God desires to work Himself into man. What is God's work? God's work is to work Himself into you. This is God's principle, and it is God's law.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLE<br>OF A CHRISTIAN'S LIFE AND WORK</H2><P>All our living and works have to be measured by this rule. Only then will they be up to standard. For example, here may be a brother who is very capable in leading the hymns. If he has never allowed God to pass through him, and if God has never worked on him before, his leading of the hymns will not carry much weight. But if God is added to him, his hymn-leading will carry much more weight. A person can save a large number of souls without allowing God to pass through him and without much mingling with God at all. A person can do many good works, help others, and visit many people. But the question is whether or not he has allowed God to pass through him. The same is true even with the reading of the Bible and praying. Many readings of the Bible end up being without God. If you study the Bible much, yet you do not fellowship with God in your studying, your Bible study cannot be considered spiritual; it can only be considered mental. It is useless to study diligently the letter of the Bible without having any fellowship with God. A proper Bible reading is one in which a person fellowships with the Lord through his reading. This kind of reading becomes a kind of "gold plating," in which God is "plated" onto you. This will not be mere knowledge, but will become life.</P><P>Sometimes even our prayers can take God away from us. At the beginning of the prayer, we may still be fellowshipping with the Lord. But after a while, the presence of the Lord is gone. Prayers that are merely in the mind or in the flesh, that have no spirit in them, are useless. No wonder so many prayers are not answered. If a person is not proper, even his prayers will not be answered. The real problem is with the person himself. In reading the Bible, in praying, and in working for the Lord, the most important thing is that the person has to be right. A person cannot pray according to the mind. Whatever he feels within, he should pray according to that feeling. If he has only a few words, or if he feels to pray for a certain particular person, he should go ahead and pray accordingly. This is prayer in the spirit. The important thing is not that your prayer be beautiful, but that while you pray, God has one more chance to pass through you. In the end, not only will you have your prayers answered, but by praying you will become like God. Your view will be like God's view. Through prayer, you will allow God to work Himself into you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ALLOWING THE LORD<br>TO BE THE HEAD OVER ALL THINGS</H2><P>All those who have a heart for the Lord and who will answer His call will realize in eternity that what we are talking about during these meetings is something very precious. Do not be concerned whether a thing is good, bad, right, or wrong. Instead pay attention to what lies behind the thing itself, to whether or not in doing such a thing, you are allowing the Lord to be the Head.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE GRACE OF GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SPECIAL CONFERENCE (4)</H1><P>Date:Evening, December 30, 1947<br>Place:Hong Kong<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 1:16-17; Rom. 5:21; 6:14; 1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 12:9; Phil. 4:23</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S GRACE NOT BEING OUTWARD THINGS</H2><P>In this message we want to consider what God's grace is. Many times we hear people say, "Thank God for His grace, that I have not had any accident." These people think that God's grace is to keep them from having an accident. Others think that to make a few thousand dollars is grace. Still others think that for a person's whole family to be free from illness and calamities is grace. Some people ask God for a lovely little baby, or a good husband, a good wife, or good children. They think that these are grace. They think that God's grace being sufficient means that they will lack no food or clothing. Still others say that joy, peace, and power are God's grace. All these concepts are not necessarily correct.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S GRACE BEING HIMSELF RECEIVED BY US</H2><P>God's grace is God putting Himself into us. To receive grace is to receive something that we do not deserve to have. It is to receive something without a price, something free from God (Rom. 4:4-5). Receiving God is better than receiving everything else. Nothing else is worth much, for all things are vanity of vanities. A bad husband is surely vanity, but a good husband is also vanity. Good children and many riches are all vanities. We must never think that grace is success and accomplishment in our work. If God were to give us things of vanity as grace, He would be deceiving us indeed. When God gives us grace, He is actually giving us Himself. Paul forsook everything for the sake of gaining the priceless treasure (Phil. 3:8). When a person has God, he has the best treasure. This is why the Bible tells us that grace is not some thing. Rather, it is God Himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Grace Enabling Paul to Labor More Exceedingly</H2><P>Do not consider grace as a thing or a matter. Paul became the leading apostle, and he became a diligent and laboring person. He became such a one through grace. It was through such a living person that he was able to do what others could not do and suffer what others could not suffer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Grace Being God as Life and Power in Us</H2><P>Those who do not have God within surely do not have grace. When they encounter difficulties, they shed tears easily, and it is easy for them to be sorrowful and in distress. Those who have God within them may appear sorrowful outwardly, but they can rejoice inwardly because of God. All the money in the world could not buy the strength they have. Good children are not grace. Could you still say "hallelujah!" if your child were to die one day? Neither is it grace to have a fortune. If your business were to close down one day, what would you say? Others may hang themselves, or kill themselves by drowning in the sea. What about you? Could you still praise the Lord? To have peace is not necessarily to have grace. If you were to have a car accident one day, could you still thank the Lord? True grace is the inward power to overcome what others cannot overcome.</P><P>Do you have this grace? I can tell you that I have it. Everyone who does not live by this grace is living in vanity. If you have God within you, if you live by God, and if God becomes your life and your strength, and He comforts you, supports you, and is with you all the time, you are experiencing God's grace. Never pay too much attention to the things and the works. Even if the whole world were given to you, it would all become vanity after a few decades. All those who know God, the One by whom we live, are persons who know grace and are blessed persons.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ALL SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES AND VIRTUES BEING<br>A MATTER OF GOD WORKING IN MAN</H2><P>God's grace is God given to us. The principle of the Christian life and of spiritual experiences is a matter of living by God. Never think that solving the problems of others is a spiritual experience. Spiritual experience is to live by God and to fellowship with God. Through these experiences, you derive strength from God to help others. In this way, God will come in and come out of us. When God is in us, and when He comes out through us, this is spiritual experience.</P><P>What is prayer? Prayer is to allow God to come into us and to allow Him to come out of us. We should not pray according to the mind, the memory, or our experiences. Instead we should allow the Spirit of God to operate, and we should pray according to His operation. What is faith? Faith is God coming into us and coming out of us. What is humility? What is love? Humility and love are also God coming into us and coming out of us. Both humility and love are God's nature. When God is added into us, we will match God's nature, and we will have humility and love.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LIVING ACCORDING TO THE GRACE OF GOD</H2><P>What will you mothers do if your sons stir up your temper? What will you do if your husbands come home tonight with a big temper? Are you going to bear it by the grace of the Lord?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IN THE LORD</H2><P>Many times, we say that Christians should live "by" the Lord. Actually, the Bible says that we should do things "in" the Lord. We do not rejoice "by" the Lord but "in" the Lord. Consider the example of riding on a bus. Do you come here riding "by" the bus or riding "in" the bus? If you come riding "by" the bus, you would be outside the bus trying your best to hold onto it, and if you were not careful, you would fall down. But if you come riding "in" the bus, then whether or not you hold onto it, and whether or not your hands let go, or you sit down or stand up, the bus will carry you here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO NEED FOR RESOLUTIONS AND STRUGGLING,<br>BUT MERELY FULFILLING THE CONDITION<br>FOR GRACE TO OPERATE</H2><P>At one time, I was just the same as you are. When the children misbehaved, I wanted to lose my temper. I would pray, beseech the Lord, and trust in Him. However, in the end, I lost my temper just the same. It is natural for me to breathe. I breathe without being conscious of breathing. In the same way, as long as you are in the Lord, your victory will come in a spontaneous way. Suppose you are going to eat, and you pray, "Lord, help me to digest the food; I trust in you for my digestion." I am afraid the more you pray, the more you will not be able to digest your food; you have spent too much energy in this matter. Digestion is something spontaneous. When some sisters lose their temper with their husbands, the husbands may say "Praise the Lord" with clenched jaws. If the wives rebuke them some more, they may try to say "Praise the Lord" again. But sooner or later, they will not be able to hold back and will lose their temper with their wives also. Life is spontaneous; you cannot imitate life. Here is an orange tree. If you pray for it, it will bear oranges. If you do not pray for it, it will still bear oranges. This is because the life it has enables it to bear fruit. The tree does not bear fruit through resolutions and prayers. To be a Christian is a simple thing. When you were born, you measured a little over a foot. But now you are over five feet tall. When did you grow to this height? You do not know, for you do not bear the responsibility for your own growth. All you have to do is to fulfill the conditions for growth. Crucifixion is something that others execute upon you; you cannot crucify yourself. A man can commit suicide, but he cannot crucify himself. You can nail your right hand with your left hand, or you can nail your left hand with your right hand. But in the end you still cannot nail both hands by yourself. This is the reason that after twenty years you still have not been able to crucify yourself.</P><P>Hence, you do not have to worry about how much you have grown. All you have to take care of is hygiene, normal restrictions, exercise, and proper food. Spontaneously, you will grow. If you love God and fellowship with Him, this is all that is needed. Everything else is taken care of by God. You do not have to reckon, to beg, to crucify yourself, or even to trust. All you have to do is to praise. Is this not very simple?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S GRACE BEING RESPONSIBLE<br>FOR EVERYTHING</H2><P>I know what I am speaking, and I know that this is the right way. If you ask me, "Brother Lee, what do you do when your children stir up your temper?" My answer is, "Don't do anything." This does not mean that I do not know what to do. Nor does it mean that I just let the things go, ignoring them and overlooking them. Rather, it means that I have the grace within, and I let grace take over the responsibility. The life within will spontaneously react to the situation. God's grace is my strength. I am afraid that after listening to my messages in these days, some brothers and sisters would think, "Brother Lee is telling us not to lose our temper. Lord! from today on, cause me not to lose my temper. Please help me." If you are such a Christian, you are indeed under a curse. You will not experience any blessing. All those who make resolutions by themselves have fallen from grace (Gal. 5:4). You are saved now, and God is within you. You can experience His blessing without struggling, striving, or making resolutions. In the end, you will be able to say, "By the grace of God I am what I am" (1 Cor. 15:10). Paul was able to overcome all trials gracefully and calmly because he was not the one who was responsible for the overcoming, but God was responsible for it.</P><P>To live in grace is like breathing. When a person does this, whatever temptation comes upon him will be calmly dealt with. In the end, such a one will live in God's grace and will be full of God's taste. When others touch such a one, they will touch God, for such a person is full of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>KNOWING THE ALL-SUFFICIENT GRACE OF GOD</H2><P>When you encounter difficulties, you have to know God's grace. You do not have to pray, because the Lord's Word says, "My grace is sufficient for you" (2 Cor. 12:9). No wonder the prayer or blessing that comes at the end of each Epistle mentions God's grace and His life. We must realize that God's power and His grace are simply God Himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>KNOWING, EXPERIENCING, AND ENJOYING<br>GOD AS OUR GRACE</H2><P>You have to learn to realize how powerful is the God within you. A Christian should be one who lives under such a condition. Ultimately, God will be mingled with you, and all the life, power, light, and every spiritual virtue will be here. May God open our eyes to see that God Himself is our grace, and may we enjoy everything in this grace.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S SATISFACTION<br>AND MAN'S SATISFACTION</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOSPEL MESSAGE</H1><P>Date:10:30 a.m., The Lord's Day, December 28, 1947<br>Place:Hong Kong<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 4:3-35</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A THIRSTY UNIVERSE</H2><P>This passage of the Scriptures tells us of a conversation between our Lord, while He was on earth, and a Samaritan woman. Here the question of water was brought up. Water is something to satisfy man's thirst. A person can live without food for a day. But if he does not have water for a day, he will become very desperate. Without water, man will be unsatisfied. Here was a woman who was thirsty and unsatisfied within. The Lord came and asked her for water to drink. This shows that the Lord was also thirsty and unsatisfied. If He had not been thirsty, He would not have asked for a drink. Both the woman and the Savior were thirsty.</P><P>Friends, do you realize that the world today is a thirsty place? Who among us can say that he lacks nothing? You may have much education and money, but you still feel that you lack something. Although you may not know what it is that you lack, you somehow feel that there is something missing in your life. The reason man seeks for entertainment and amusement is that he is bored and depressed, and he has no interest or taste for anything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD BEING MAN'S SATISFACTION</H2><P>When a man is thirsty, you will not solve his problem by giving him gold. Husbands, wives, children, parents, money&#151;none of these things can satisfy man's thirst. Only God can solve this problem of man. A wife cannot satisfy a person's heart. Money cannot satisfy a person's heart. But when you come to the Lord with an empty heart, you will be filled. God is man's real need and real joy. A person can have fine clothing, good food, nice houses, an enormous amount of savings in the bank, high position, or great knowledge, but he will still not be happy within. What he needs within is simply a glass of water. This water is God. Without God, man is not satisfied. God is man's satisfaction. Whenever man has God, he is happy, and he is satisfied.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BOTH GOD AND MAN SATISFIED BY EACH OTHER</H2><P>Not only are the sinners thirsty; even God is thirsty. Man thirsts because he does not have God, and God thirsts because He does not have man. God is man's satisfaction, and man is God's satisfaction.</P><P>The Lord Jesus is a sinless Man. Yet He is also thirsty. Today what He wants is you. He is asking water from you. Whenever the Savior meets a sinner, that sinner will thirst no more. Whenever the Savior gains a sinner, the Savior will also be satisfied. You are drawing water, and the Lord is asking you for water. Man is thirsting on earth, and God is thirsting in heaven.</P><P>Satan is working on earth today to frustrate man from having God. What we are doing on earth today is to have man gain God and to have God gain man, so that both God and man can be satisfied. This is why both heaven and earth rejoice when a sinner is saved (Luke 15:8-10, 23-24). Both heaven and earth rejoice because both God and man are satisfied.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD AND MAN RESTING IN ONE ANOTHER</H2><P>Not only was the Samaritan woman thirsty; she was also restless. In the same way, not only was the Lord thirsty; He was also restless. He came to earth to seek the sinners. The Lord is not at rest yet because He has not yet gained you. He said that He did not have a place to lay His head (Matt. 8:20). He wants to come into your heart. At the same time, you also do not have rest. You are laden with heavy burdens. There is the burden of your family; there is also the burden of your job. You may have the best bed there is, but within you, you cannot rest in peace. You are tired. You do not have rest. This is because you do not have the Lord. The Savior is not at rest, and you are not at rest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD AND MAN BEING FOOD TO EACH OTHER</H2><P>Here is not only a question of thirst and restlessness, but also a question of hunger. What is hunger? Hunger means that a person needs food within him. The Lord's food is the sinner, who is you. Our food is the Lord. The Lord is not only the water of life, but the bread of life (John 6:35). Only He can satisfy our thirst and fill our hunger. Only He can remove our restlessness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONDITION FOR RECEIVING GOD&#151;CONFESSION</H2><P>By that time, the Samaritan woman realized her need. She began to ask the Lord for the living water. The minute she began asking, something happened. She asked for the living water, but the Lord asked her for her husband. Why did the Lord ask her for her husband? The matter of her husband speaks of the life she lived in private. She told the Lord that she did not have a husband. This was only a half-truth. She was lying by telling the truth. The husband here also signifies sin. Her husband signifies her sins. The Lord wanted her husband. This means that the Lord wanted her to confess her sins. Do you want the living water? The first thing you have to do is to confess your sins. Although a man may not know what kind of sins he has, the Lord nevertheless knows. Cheating, evil thoughts, craftiness in the heart, and lying are all sins. If you do not take your sins to the Lord, you will not have the living water. Have you told lies? If there is one thing you have done that you have never told anyone about, including your parents, your husband, or your wife, you have at least one thing that is not upright. This is sin. The Lord wants to have an exchange with you. He wants you to give Him the husband, while He gives you the living water. You hand over to Him your sins, and the Lord gives to you His salvation. You do not have to tell me or anyone else what your sins are. The Lord is not trying to give you a hard time. But you have to tell Him everything. Concerning this matter, you must have a proper confession before the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WORSHIP BEING IN SPIRIT AND IN REALITY</H2><P>When the Samaritan woman saw that the Lord had exposed everything about her private life, she changed the subject of the conversation. She began to talk about the worship of God. The Lord answered her that one must worship with the spirit and in reality. There is no need to worry about the place. The important thing is for one to worship in spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A TESTIMONY OF GOD BECOMING MAN'S SATISFACTION</H2><P>In 1940, while I was preaching the gospel in Chefoo, a certain person came every day to listen to my preaching. One day he asked to have a time with me. At that time, this person was working in the Customs Department. I told him that it is a very simple thing to be saved. All that a person has to do is to receive Him as the Lord from the heart and to confess his sins to Him. If he does that, he will be saved. This one asked me to pray with him. After I prayed for him, he prayed, "Lord Jesus, save me. I am a sinner." I told him that when he went home, he should stop whatever he was doing to pray and confess to the Lord alone in his own room. After he did this, he slept peacefully. He was indeed saved. After he was saved, immediately he bore a strong testimony. Formerly, he smoked every day. But after he was saved, he was completely freed from cigarettes. He had two colleagues at work. When these two persons offered him cigarettes, he refused them. His colleagues said, "We have tried to quit smoking but could not cut down to less than twenty cigarettes a day. How can you stand not having even one cigarette?" Nevertheless, from that day on, he stopped smoking. Besides this, he also stopped many other evil habits. Many of his colleagues were touched by his testimony.</P><P>Friends, God is waiting for you today. He is waiting for you to accept Him. When you accept Him, you will experience a change in your whole being. Please do not refuse today, and accept Him now.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SPIRITUAL REALITY AND<br>OBEYING THE LEADING<br>OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FELLOWSHIP MEETING (1)</H1><P>Date:10:00 a.m., December 26, 1947<br>Place:Hong Kong<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SPIRITUAL REALITY&#151;<br>THE LIFE WITHIN BECOMING THE LIVING WITHOUT</H2><P>Brother Weigh asked: What is the relationship between spiritual knowledge and our practical living?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Unique Goal Being to Work<br>Himself into Man</H2><P>Brother Lee answered: Every saved person should be very clear that he has God's life within him. Spiritual reality is nothing other than the inward life becoming the outward living. We must have the basic understanding that God has only one goal, which is to work Himself into man. The significance of salvation is that God has entered into man. This is not merely the forgiveness of sins or deliverance from hell, but the entrance of God into man. When we say that we have received life into us, it means that God has entered into us. If we are clear concerning this point, the rest will be simple. God has put Himself into you in the same way that electricity has been transmitted into the light bulb and has become the shining of the bulb.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Obeying the Operation of God Within</H2><P>God is living and omnipotent. He is living now. You may not be very impressed by this word, because, although He may be living, to you He may be sleeping. In the Bible, there is a difference between "living" and "being." To "live" is active; the Lord is not merely "being" in you, but He is "living" in you. He is moving and working, and He is very purposeful. Since the day you were saved, God has been living within you (John 15:4). What you have to do now is to go along with this moving within. Suppose a person easily loses his temper with his wife. At the time he is saved, he may not know that God is in Him. Right after he is saved, when he comes home from the meeting, his wife may provoke him again. At that instant, he would surely have a certain feeling. If he goes along with that feeling, he will be all right. However, if he does not go along with that feeling and instead loses his temper, he will feel depressed. The next time, when a similar incident occurs, he will not dare to go against that feeling again. The matter of going along with one's inner feeling may be a small thing, but it is difficult to find one person in a thousand who knows to obey it.</P><P>There were two people who were always at odds with each other. Both of them were Christians. One day, both came to me and asked for advice. I turned the question back to them and asked them if they knew what the problem was. They said that they seemed to know, yet they were not clear. In the past, when I encountered such problems, I would try my best to answer them and to list the answers one by one. I would even open up the Bible and explain to others with it. Actually, the ones that asked the questions knew the answers already. In recent years, I do not do this kind of thing any longer. When others ask me a number of questions, I would only answer, "What is your feeling within?"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Paying the Price to Obey</H2><P>The Lord says in the Bible, "Or do you not know...?" (1 Cor. 6:9, 16). This means that we ought to know such things already, because a living God is living within us. You have to learn to follow closely the inner leading. If God tells you to give up certain things and to forsake them, you should say, "Lord, for the sake of loving You, I would forsake them." Christians today like to listen to teachings. Very few of them listen to the voice within them. I would like to ask the brothers and sisters who are sitting here if there is anyone who has been obeying God from morning until evening today in every matter. If you have a genuine desire to take care of God's word, He will only have to speak once. If you do not have this desire, even if He were to speak many times, it would still be useless to you. If there is a group of people here who are willing to give themselves completely to God, in a year's time this place will have a complete turnaround. But if there is not such a group of people, then even if someone were to preach to the people the whole year round, it would still not be of much use. Every time we want to obey the inner feeling, we have to pay a price, because to do such a thing would cause pain to our self and would inflict loss on us. This will show how much you really love God. If you are not willing to obey, even if you listen to a hundred more messages, it will still not do you any good.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Obeying in a Simple Way</H2><P>If there is a small number of brothers and sisters who will obey God, His blessing will be brought in through them. Only when we learn to live in the reality of the spiritual things can we have real spiritual progress. This is the only thing that will cause us to live before God and in His light. Our inner feeling and guidance is our spiritual restriction. When we go along with this feeling, we go along with the spiritual restriction. God's way is always simple. If it is complicated, it is because we have made it so.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OBEYING THE LEADING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</H2><P>Question: We may know the leading and the restriction of the Holy Spirit. But why is it that we are not able to obey this leading and restriction?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not a Question of Being Able,<br>but a Question of Being Willing</H2><P>Brother Lee answered: Actually, the issue is not one of being able or not able, but of being willing or not willing to obey. It is not a question of ability, but a question of willingness. When you are willing, God will manifest His strength upon you. We were all paralyzed and were unable to walk. But when we obey, strength will come upon us. When the Lord called the paralyzed person to stand up and walk, he was able to stand up and walk (Mark 2:10-12). If God says yes, you have to say yes. When God says to put your feet down, you have to put your feet down. The water of the Jordan will spontaneously be divided (Josh. 3:8, 13-16). Your eyes should never be fixed on the water. If you look at the water, you will say, "The Lord must divide the water first before I can put my feet down." If you do that, the water will never be divided.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Secret of "Willingness"&#151;<br>Being Drawn by the Love of God</H2><P>How can you become willing? The secret of willingness is to be drawn by the love of God. It is a matter of how much you love the Lord. If you do not love enough, you will feel that you cannot do anything. If you love enough, you will be able to obey what others cannot obey, and you will be able to do what others cannot do. Only those who love the Lord with a single heart can go on in this way. Hence, it is not a question of whether or not you are able, but a question of whether or not you are willing. In order to be willing, you have to love the Lord, and you have to be constrained by the Lord's love.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>HOW TO ABIDE IN CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FELLOWSHIP MEETING (2)</H1><P>Date:Morning, December 27, 1947<br>Place:Hong Kong<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW TO ABIDE IN CHRIST</H2><P>Brother Shen asked: How can we abide in the Lord?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Knowing the Teaching of the Anointing</H2><P>Brother Lee answered: First John 2:27 mentions the anointing: "The anointing which you have received from Him...." In Greek, the word anointing is a gerund; it is not a simple noun. The anointing as a gerund denotes a moving and an application of an ointment. Within us we have the teaching of the anointing, and we do not need any teaching from man. This anointing is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught us, we should abide in Him. God abides in us, and we abide in Him. Although these appear to be two different things, yet in fact they are not two things, but one thing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Lord's Abiding in Us Being Based<br>on Our Abiding in Him</H2><P>In the New Testament, there is a difference between the two phrases "in the Lord" and "abiding in the Lord." To be in the Lord refers to being saved, whereas to abide in the Lord refers to living an overcoming life, one that is in fellowship with the Lord. To abide in the Lord is to have fellowship with Him. The Lord's abiding in us is based upon our abiding in Him, while our abiding in Him is based upon our being in Him. When electricity is installed to a lamp, it can be considered as being "in" the lamp. But when the switch is turned on and electricity is applied, then the electricity is "abiding" in the lamp. Some people abide in sin, the flesh, and the world. Although such a one may be a person in Christ, he does not abide in Him at all. You may be a person who belongs to Christ, yet you never abide in Him. Some have asked if a person who is abiding in Christ can move out again. Actually, in our experience, we can move in and out more than a dozen times within a day. The fact of our being in Christ is once for all and can never change. But our abiding in the Lord and the Lord's abiding in us is something relative. In the entire New Testament, you cannot find one incident where it says that He will abide in us without us abiding in Him first; these two things are linked together. Romans 8 mentions the Holy Spirit abiding in us. Every saved person has the Holy Spirit in him, but this does not mean that every one has the Holy Spirit abiding in him. The Holy Spirit does not have the complete authority over every one yet. God's abiding in us is based on our abiding in Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Abiding in the Lord according to<br>the Teaching of the Anointing</H2><P>How do we abide in God? We abide in Him according to the teaching of the anointing. The Holy Spirit operates in us. This operation is the application of the ointment. Suppose you want to joke with Brother Shen, but there is an inner restriction that tells you not to do it. If you disobey it and keep on joking, you will lose the peace. You will be cut off from the Lord and will not be able to continue in the fellowship. This disruption in fellowship can last for a whole day. Only after you confess your sin will this fellowship with God be resumed. Consider again the example of the sisters scolding their children or their servants. A sister does not need someone outside of her to tell her that this is wrong. Instead, the operation inside of her will restrict her. The greatest punishment to a Christian is not outward sufferings, but being cut off from his fellowship with the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Anointing Bringing with It a Feeling</H2><P>A few times I found myself arguing with rickshaw drivers. When I argued, the Lord was gone. There is a difference between what we know and what we feel. You may know that a certain medicine is bitter, but it is only after you put the medicine into your mouth that you feel its bitterness. When God anoints us, this anointing comes with a feeling. If I touch Brother Weigh's forehead, surely he will feel something. Whenever we ignore our feeling, we are cut off from the fellowship. This is very real, and it is very simple. It all depends on whether or not you are willing and whether or not you want to have this experience.</P><P>All other kinds of teachings are dispensable, but this matter is indispensable. There is no teaching that can cause something to happen: No matter how proper, neat, clean, and blameless you are as a person, as long as you are living outside of the Lord, you are not worth anything in God's eyes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Walking according to the Sense of Peace</H2><P>It is true that every genuine Christian has the anointing in him. The Lord is not stingy, but neither is He sloppy. He means business with us. Some sisters may want to buy some bargain fabrics. There is nothing wrong with this, yet the Lord may not want them to do it. For the price to be cheap is one thing. For someone to buy the items is another thing. In the end, when the sisters go ahead and make the purchase, they lose their peace and are unable to pray for a few days. Only when others buy those fabrics from them are they able to gain back their peace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Depth of Our Experience Depending<br>on the Degree of Our Obeying the Inner Feelings</H2><P>I have been a Christian for twenty-two and a half years. During the first ten or more years, I did not know anything about this way. During the last few years, the Lord has granted me mercy to discover this way. The more you go along with your inner feelings, the more your spirit will be enlightened, and the more demands you will experience. These demands will become more and more severe, and you will be more and more restricted by the Lord. Up to a certain point, you will lose the freedom to speak, act, laugh, or cry. You will be restricted in everything. The more we reason, the more the Lord is gone. Only by accepting all adverse conditions willingly and giving up all reasonings will the Lord have a way. The anointing teaches us in everything. This anointing is true and is not a lie. The question is whether or not we are willing to obey.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br>THE FEELING OF THE SPIRIT AND<br>THE FEELING OF THE CONSCIENCE</H2><P>Brother Ho asked: How can we tell the difference between the feeling of the spirit and the feeling of the conscience? Can our conscience be wrong sometimes, since Satan disguises himself as an angel of light at times? (2 Cor. 11:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Taking Care of the Inner Feeling<br>in Everything</H2><P>Brother Lee answered: The initial work of the Holy Spirit is to recover the function of the conscience and to point out man's mistakes. After the function of the conscience is recovered, the Holy Spirit can go on to recover man's spirit. Once man's spirit is recovered, surely it will have feelings. A person has to take care of the inner feelings. If he does not have peace about something, he should stop doing it. Only when he is at peace should he proceed with anything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. No Need for Too Much Analyzing&#151;<br>Rather, Exercising Much and<br>Walking in Peace in a Faithful Way</H2><P>In the Gospels, after a person is saved, many times the Lord says, "Go in peace" (Mark 5:34; Luke 7:50). Romans 8:6 says that "the mind set on the spirit is life and peace." After the Ethiopian eunuch was baptized, he went on his way rejoicing (Acts 8:32-39). In taking this way, there is no need to analyze too much. In the course of our experience, spontaneously we will be able to differentiate between the conscience, the spirit, and the flesh. We will develop a feeling for all these things. Sometimes we may make mistakes, but we should not be discouraged. If we are wrong, we can exercise more until we become right. This is like practicing riding a bicycle or practicing penmanship. This way is surely the right way, and as long as our hearts are clean, as long as we are faithful, and as long as we have a heart for God, our feelings will become more and more sensitive.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PROPER PERSON</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SPECIAL FELLOWSHIP MEETING</H1><p>Date:1:30 p.m., December 28, 1947<br>Place:Hong Kong<br>Speaker:Witness Lee<br>Remark:A meeting for those who are burdened for the affairs of God's house, concerning matters related to God's house. Attendance, about forty or more.</p><P>Brother Hsu asked:How should elders serve in the house of God?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PERSON BEING GOD'S METHOD AND WAY</H2><P>Brother Lee answered:The service of the elders has to do with the person of the elder. It does not depend on the method, but on the person. In the New Testament it is very difficult to find out what is the method or way to serve. Some places seem to speak about the method or the way, but actually the emphasis is still the person himself. The person is the way, and the person is the Lord's work. If God does not gain a person, He will have no work, and He will have no way. A way is a course that a person takes. If God does not gain man, He will have no course to take. Man thinks that the most important thing to do is to find a good way. However, God's work does not involve giving us the ways, but is a matter of gaining the persons. If God can gain two or three brothers here, He will have a way. Even if I present to you the best way to be an elder, it will be useless if the person is wrong. We, the person, should be gained by God. We have to learn to be the proper person more than to learn to do the proper things. It is meaningless for things to be done properly without the person being a proper one. What you are is what you do. You cannot serve God beyond what you are as a person. Hudson Taylor said in his book Union and Communion that what we are is more important than what we do. This word left a deep impression on me. We should know how to help the brothers and sisters properly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING DEALT WITH BY GOD TO SERVE HIM</H2><P>What God cares for is whether or not you have been touched by Him. The measure we yield ourselves to the Lord determines the measure we are able to serve Him. If you have been dealt with in your temper, you can help others with their temper. If you have been dealt with in the way you dress, you will be able to help others in the way they dress. The church is not a worldly society. The church is a body (Eph. 1:23). A body is a matter of life. If we can only do the proper things in the church and nothing else, we are failures. It is true that we need to learn the proper lessons with regard to many things, including money and the way we deal with our family. However, in the church, business affairs do not take priority. Rather, life takes priority. Life can meet man's present need. This should cause every servant of God to come before God again. Otherwise, the more right things we do, the more man-made works there are, and the more the church will become a human society or community; it will become something merely human, with nothing other than a common belief and a common philosophy!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING DEALT WITH IN LIFE<br>TO BRING IN THE AUTHORITY</H2><P>In order to have such a proper life, we need to be restricted in everything and to apply ourselves in a practical way to learn the lessons. The main thing we have to learn is the matter of authority. A person who has authority has life; he is like the budding rod of Aaron (Num. 17:1-10). If you submit to him, you will have life. If you do not submit to him, you will touch death. However, such a person does not put on an air. When the apostle spoke about the elders, he spoke very little about what they do. Mainly he spoke about the kind of persons they should be (1 Tim. 3:1-5). In a degraded church, people pay much attention to the office of the elders and the deacons. A person can be very clever and capable, but he may not be dealt with in the matter of life. Whenever someone brings his knowledge and diplomacy into the church, it is like putting a hole into a ship. Soon the whole ship will be filled with sea water; the world will invade and take over the church. Just because a person has the knowledge does not mean that he can therefore interpret the Bible. When a person engages in visitation work or other affairs, what is needed is not merely to have things done properly, nor to gain others' admiration, but to be a proper person. A proper person has the authority with him. Even if he is not a responsible one, the authority is still with him. Wherever there is life, there is authority. Life is authority. If God can gain one brother here in an absolute way, the saints in this place will be able to advance in great strides.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DOCTRINES BEING USELESS</H2><P>Doctrines are useless. If doctrines are to give us a way at all, then there is only one way that is useful, which is the way to God. The only way that is useful is the way that brings us to God. The Christians here are spoiled by revival meetings already. This can be compared to putting rice in a cooker and cooking it for a while. Before the rice is cooked, the fire is turned off, and the rice is left half-cooked; nothing more can be done to the rice. If a man has not been dealt with in a practical way in his daily life, what good will doctrines do for him? I wish that there would be no more revival meetings in this place. Every child of God who loves Him faithfully must be broken by Him. How many are captured by God in this way here? We have to realize that the person is God's way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S WAY BEING TO TOUCH THE PERSON</H2><P>During the five or six years between 1938 and 1944, I spent all my time in Chefoo. In 1937 I travelled to other places often. The Pentecostals always tell people that they need the power. I told the brothers and sisters once, "Let them seek for the power. See where they will be after a few years." In Chefoo there were twelve or thirteen denominational churches. At least three or four of them could seat over a thousand people, but their combined attendance did not match our attendance. We did not have pastors, preachers, or seminary students. Although I cannot say that every one among us was touched by the Lord in an absolute way, I can surely testify that some were indeed touched by the Lord. The Communists opposed us very much. But during the New Year, we still preached the gospel in a daring way. One time we baptized one hundred two persons at the same time. The next time after that, we baptized a few dozen. For a city with only a few hundred thousand people, this was quite an outstanding achievement. One village chief warned a Communist cadet not to touch us, because he said that the Communists would not be able to deal with us.</P><P>If your heart is attracted by the Lord's love, you will be willing to give yourselves to the Lord. This is a very simple and direct word. The degree you can render others help is determined by the degree you have advanced yourself; it is also determined by the amount of learning you have picked up. If only one-fourth of those among us are used by God in this way, in a few years, the church will increase from one or two hundred people to one or two thousand, and the quality of the people gained will surpass the one or two hundred people that we have today. It is not our ground or our doctrines that will bring in God's blessing. The basic question is the person himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A GOOD TREE PRODUCING GOOD FRUIT,<br>A CORRUPT TREE PRODUCING EVIL FRUIT</H2><P>I do not believe that there is anything that is more real than the things in the spiritual realm. A person cannot cheat God. He cannot cheat himself, and he cannot cheat the saints. In two years' time, you will see the effect of my words today. The kind of person you are determines the kind of children you produce. Those who love the world will produce Christians who love the world. Those brothers and sisters who seek after modern fashions, if they can bring others to salvation at all, will bring in ones who are flippant and shallow. Those who have a hot temper will surely bring in Christians with a bad temper. A good tree produces good fruit, and a corrupt tree produces evil fruit (Matt. 7:17-18). The kind of person we are determines the kind of fruit we produce.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S LIFE COMING INTO MAN<br>THROUGH THE PROCESS OF BREAKING</H2><P>In order for God's life to enter into man at all, there must first be the breaking. This is like giving people an injection: the skin must first be punctured before the needle can go in.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PAYING THE PRICE TO GIVE GOD THE WAY</H2><P>What this place needs is not doctrine, or zeal, or the so-called power of the Holy Spirit. What this place needs is neither excitement nor stirring up. What this place needs is people who are willing to pay the price. If there are some who would do this, God will have a way here. Brothers and sisters, we must be willing to suffer loss, so that God could have a way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONSECRATION OF OUR WILL</H2><P>With regard to the work of the Holy Spirit, the main thing on our part is not whether or not we are able, but whether or not we are willing. Are you willing to allow God to do great things in you? This requires the consecration of the will. Sometimes we have to say to God with tears, "Lord, I am willing." When we do this, though our heart may at times be in pain, our spirit can rise up to praise Him.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ELEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>OBEYING THE INNER FEELING</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FELLOWSHIP MEETING (3)</H1><P>Date:10:00 a.m., December 29, 1947<br>Place:Hong Kong<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OBEYING THE INNER FEELING</H2><P>Brother Shen asked: As far as the inner feeling is concerned, I realize that we should do something only when we have the peace, and we should stop when we lose the peace. Suppose we are engaged in a business. At the beginning, we did not have the peace. Consequently, we did not proceed with it. But after two weeks, we felt peaceful again. What then should we do?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Walking Only according<br>to the Inner Sense of Peace</H2><P>Brother Lee answered: First John 3:19-21 tells us that a Christian should not find his heart blaming him. In your business engagement, you were held back at the beginning because you did not have the peace. Two weeks later you had the peace again. Your question is whether or not you should proceed. The answer lies in whether or not your heart blames you. If by going to hell you can have the peace, it is all right for you to go there. Romans 3:17 says, "And the way of peace they have not known." Isaiah 57:21 says that there is no peace to the wicked. The Lord says that peace He leaves with us (John 14:27). The Lord charged his disciples to bless others with peace (Luke 10:5). After He healed someone, He charged that one to go in peace (Mark 5:34). For Christians, peace is something within. If you are seeking for outward peace, you will never be able to be a proper Christian. It is also a very dangerous thing to do. As Christians, we have to be those who have peace within us. If the Spirit of God is not at ease within us, we will not have peace. Others' criticisms, attacks, praises, or debasements can all be ignored. What we need to pay attention to is our inner feeling. The apostle Paul said, "Because of this I also exercise myself to always have a conscience without offense toward God and men" (Acts 24:16). This is a person who fears God and who lives in His presence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not in the Letter, but in the Spirit</H2><P>The only place to be a Christian is in your spirit and your conscience. There is no other place and no other way to be a Christian. Only by being in spirit and in the conscience can a person be a genuine Christian. To practice being a Christian according to the conscience is like shooting in archery; the first time a person may miss. The second time, the third time, and even the tenth time he may miss also. But eventually, he will hit the mark. If you have a lawyer sit down and write out all the laws, you may find yourself blameless according to the laws. But this does not mean that you are a proper Christian. It is possible that you have done the right things, but that you as a person are wrong. If you compare yourself with the Bible, you may find yourself one hundred percent right according to it, yet in fact you as a person may still be off. Do not misunderstand me. I am not saying that I do not agree with the Bible. The Bible says that we have to love others as we love ourselves. If you merely act according to the letter of this word, even if you were to achieve it, you would still be off. If you touch God this morning, you will feel that you have to care for others. You will not only give your coat to others; you will be willing to give even your skin to others. Outwardly speaking, this kind of caring for others appears to be the same as the kind of love mentioned earlier. But in reality, there is a great difference between being a Christian according to the letter and one according to the spirit. Similarly, the humility spoken of in the Bible is not one which bows ninety degrees to others. This will only make your body pliable; what you need is a pliable inner sense. Your inner being needs to be soft. If it is slightly hardened, you will feel uneasy. Those Christians who behave in an outward way feel uneasy only when they lose their face. To be sorry because of an outward mistake is worthless. This is like a thief feeling sorry because he is caught, rather than because he has committed the crime of stealing. If a person feels sorry only because he is caught by others, this kind of sorrow is worthless.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Paying the Price to Forsake Everything</H2><P>Many preachers tell others that if a person believes in the Lord he will be blessed. They tell others that the Lord is the blessing, and that with Him there is the blessing. Actually, to be a Christian costs one's life. A Christian is one who is blind, who gives up money and position, and who would rather have his own feeling hurt than offend the Lord's feeling. He is one who is willing to give up everything to gain the Lord. All those who are not willing to go on in this way are merely "pew-Christians." All "pew-Christians" are Christians who will not go on in the Lord's way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR HUMAN LIVING BEING<br>A MATTER OF GOD WORKING IN MAN</H2><P>Mrs. Chow asked:Should we obey our parents if they charge us to do something contrary to the Lord? If we disobey them, are we dishonoring them?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Allowing God to Touch Us<br>in Our Human Relationships</H2><P>Brother Lee answered:Do not be an analyzing Christian or a rehearsing Christian. You do not need to analyze or rehearse. Whatever your inner feeling, you should simply act accordingly. If the feeling inside tells you that you cannot obey your parents, you should not obey them. In the Old Testament, God ordered Abraham to kill his son, and the Levites to kill their brothers. They would not have committed a sin if they killed those God ordered them to kill.</P><P>If you go along with God's feeling, you are pleasing God. However, it is not God's intention for you merely to please Him, but it is His intention to mingle His life with yours. God's emphasis is not that we work for God. Whether or not we do the right thing is immaterial. What God is after is that in our obeying of Him, He gains the ground in us. He wants to transmit the "electricity" to you. His intention is to put some "gold" on you. God has no intention for us to be rebellious children or submissive children. He has no intention for us to be evil persons or good persons. What God wants is that we allow Him to touch us in our human relationships, in the relationship between parents and children, and between husbands and wives. He wants to put Himself into us in the same way that gold is coated onto an object through a plating process.</P><P>Mrs. Chow asked:If my mother-in-law asks me to buy a joss stick for her, should I do it?</P><P>Brother Lee answered:If you do not feel peaceful within, you should not buy it. There is always a price to pay. If you do not pay this price, you will feel sorry for a week.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Allowing God's Element to Increase<br>in Our Daily Living</H2><P>If you take every opportunity to learn the lesson, in the end you will become a person who is saturated with God. You will become a person who lives out God. God has put you in various positions, within your family and in your job. He does so in order that you would allow Him to touch you. God does not care for the success of your career. What He cares for is that through everything He would gain the proper ground. If you have been a good wife for five years, yet God has never increased in you, but has instead decreased in you, you are worth nothing in His eyes. During the five years that you have been a wife, daily you should have allowed God time and time again to anoint you with His desire, His heart, and even Himself, so that you would have His element within, and that this element would increase all the time. This is what God is after.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Everything Being Arranged<br>for the Purpose of God Mingling Himself into Us</H2><P>The mind of today's Christian is too far away from God's heart. We should not obey the inner feeling merely for the sake of being a proper man or to please God, but we should do it to allow God to mingle Himself with us. God is exercising His multifarious wisdom to work Himself into us. God loves us. This is why He arranges everything, and He uses our husbands, wives, and children as the means to mingle Himself into us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Real Grace Being to Possess God</H2><P>One sister said that God loved her so much that He gave her a lovely little baby. After fifteen years, the lovely baby became a sore mischief. God's greatest love in the universe is His giving Himself to us. Children are not the real grace. Money is not the real grace. The Bible says that everything is vanity, and it is dung. If God gives us these vain things as grace, is He not deceiving us? Some have said that God has blessed them and has given them so much money at the end of the year: what immense grace God has bestowed upon them. How can anyone say that it is grace when his hands are filled with so much dung? The real grace is God. Jesus is the real grace. True grace is when a person gains more of God through his relationship with his wife and when he gains more knowledge about God through his job.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not a Question of Good and Evil,<br>but a Question of God Working Himself into Man</H2><P>Luke 14:26 says, "If anyone...does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters...." This shows us that God wants us to hate. He has a heart to hate. How many people have you ever hated? Have you ever hated your daughter-in-law? Have you ever hated your sons? God cannot come into you because you have loved your sons too much. If you would hate a little, God would come in. Your hatred will allow God to gain something in you. In order for God to come into man, it is right sometimes even to hate.</P><P>God created everything. He spoke, and things came into being. How beautiful are the flowers in the field. Man does not need to add anything to them. Man can only produce artificial flowers. I am not speaking heresy here. Nor am I joking here. I know what I am saying. The New Jerusalem in eternity does not come out all of a sudden. It is the cumulative masterpiece of God throughout the ages. By nature we are clay. But after God has passed through us, we become gold, pearl, and precious stones. God's presence is within us. His element is in our minds and our emotions. Today, our Savior in heaven still bears His humanity. When the Word became flesh, He brought in a mingling of God with man. Now as the flesh becoming the Word again, He mingled man with God. The result of this is gold and precious stones. If I merely teach others to be good wives and good husbands, my work is surely wood, grass, and stubble. Gold signifies God's nature. Precious stones signify God's glorious image. God is doing only one thing today: to cause the man of clay to become gold and precious stones. God does not try to teach man to be good, in the same way that He does not try to teach man to be evil. All these things belong to the tree of good and evil; they do not belong to the tree of life. To honor one's parents is the good of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and to dishonor one's parents is the evil of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. To love is the good of that tree, and to hate is the evil of that tree. The fruit of the date tree is good, but the branches have offensive thorns. The dates can be compared to the good, and the thorns can be compared to the evil; they all come from the same tree. God is not pleased with either good or evil. From the day that we are saved, God begins to work in us. He continues to work in us all the way until we are glorified and raptured. By that time we will not see our good, in the same way that we will not see our evil. By that time we will see only the gold and the precious stones, which are simply God Himself.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWELVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A FELLOWSHIP</H1><P>Date:December 30, 1947<br>Place:Chanticleer Restaurant, Hong Kong<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GRACE BEING THE UNIQUE REALITY</H2><P>The Lord Jesus is the grace. John 1:17 says, "Grace and reality came through Jesus Christ." This chapter shows us that reality is something that can be seen, and grace is something that can be received. Grace is the unique reality in the universe. Other than grace, nothing is real. Even the heaven and the earth will pass away one day. This is why we say that the earth and everything that can be seen will not last forever, and they are therefore not real.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED FOR THE LIFE WITHIN TO GROW</H2><P>The identifying death mentioned in Romans 6 can only be experienced and lived out in the Holy Spirit in chapter eight. Hence, it is useless to "reckon" alone. In the same way, the sin in Romans 5 is lived out in chapter seven. When a baby is born, sin is there already. But it is only when he grows up that sin is manifested. The same principle applies to God's life within us. When we are regenerated, we have life already. But this life needs to grow before its fullness is expressed.</P><P>Between 1938 and 1942, I saw this truth. In 1943, I was put into prison. One month after I came out of the prison, I became sick, and I was in bed for a whole year. During this period of time, this truth appeared clearer and clearer to me.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD'S DEATH AND HIS LIFE</H2><P>Ephesians 1 and 2 cannot be separated from each other. In fact, the end of chapter one is joined to the beginning of chapter two. Chapter two should not begin with a capital letter.</P><P>The death of the Lord Jesus contains two elements: death and life. The two combined together also give life. The Lord gives life to us out of His death. This can be likened to some medicine that kills germs, on one hand, and imparts life, on the other hand. Everything mentioned after chapter two confirms these two facts, that is, the fact of the Lord's death and the fact of His life. To sin, the world, human relationships, and the flesh, we are dead; whereas to God, we are living.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A TESTIMONY</H1><P>Date:January 2, 1948<br>Place: Canton<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><P>The year before last, the Communists entered the city of Chefoo, but the brothers and sisters in the local church still continued to meet. We did not register ourselves with the government, nor did we hand ourselves over to them. The brothers and sisters continued to preach the gospel. The denominations used to be quite zealous in preaching the gospel, and they were critical of the local church, saying that we were narrow-minded and that we cared only for our own people and would not fellowship with others, nor would we preach the gospel in the rural villages. However, together with the brothers and sisters, we paid attention only to the matter of life and spiritual matters, and we were not affected by their criticisms. One day, when the time came, all the brothers and sisters rose up to preach the gospel, and we baptized one hundred two people. After that time, we had more baptisms. There were twelve or thirteen denominations in our city that met on Sunday, but their total number did not match the attendance of the local church. Three or four of these denominational churches could seat over a thousand people, yet their numbers were still less than ours.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD GAINING MAN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONFERENCE (1)</H1><p>Date:Evening, January 7, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee<br>Attendance:200-300 people</p><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S PRINCIPLE IN HIS WORK</H2><P>In coming here this time, I do not expect to hold large conferences or to do any great works. My hope is to fellowship with the brothers and sisters, and especially with those who are involved with the Lord's service. We see that both in the Old Testament and the New Testament, God's principle in His work is the same, and that is to gain an individual or a few individuals from every place. When He gains an individual or a few individuals, He has a way to go on. Many people neglect this point. They like to stir up others and to rally others around them. But merely stirring people up and rallying them around oneself will not afford God a way. In every place, God needs to gain some people; without this God cannot do anything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MEN GOD IS AFTER&#151;<br>THOSE WHO ARE PURE, POOR IN SPIRIT, SIMPLE,<br>TRANSPARENT, AND SINGLE-HEARTED TOWARD GOD</H2><P>During the past twenty years, there were big conference meetings and  big revival meetings everywhere. But God did not have a way because not many people were gained by the Lord. Today, we are not merely hoping to see many people saved and revived; what we hope to see is not that kind of work of the Holy Spirit. We only hope to see a small number of people rising up, those who are pure in heart, who are poor in spirit, and who can drop everything within them to seek after God single-heartedly.</P><P>Today, I hope that you will not be busy taking care of others, or waiting for others to come to this conference. I hope that we would go to the Lord in a quiet way. Please do not misunderstand what I am saying, but things such as your work, your church, the saving of souls, and so forth, have no place in my heart. I only wish to see us turning to the Lord in a pure, direct, and simple way, so that we can touch the Lord in a definite way and can know the way He wants to go on in us. Only one thing is crucial: to be taken hold of by the Lord. When that happens, God will have a way, and He will be able to flow out of us, and others will receive the blessing. Otherwise, we will not be able to render others any real blessing. We hope that we can meet God here, or that God can meet us and occupy us. Within us, we do not have to pray for others, or to pray for this meeting, and we do not have to pray for the Lord to bless this meeting. I do not expect the Lord to "bless" this meeting. I only hope that there will be a group of brothers and sisters who will fellowship with the Lord in a quiet, pure, unperturbed, and unencumbered way. I hope to see a group of brothers and sisters who are as transparent as glass. If there are such ones, we will see great blessings in this place.</P><P>We have to learn to turn to the Lord in a simple way. You do not have to pray for me, and I do not expect to see too many people here. Sometimes, when there are too many people, God does not have a way to go on. For example, Zaccheus was hindered from seeing Jesus because there were too many people. We have to be like Zaccheus, climbing higher than others. If we do this, we will see, and our lives will change. Too often people hinder us from seeing the Lord. Here we need to transcend, to rise above the crowd, and leave others under our feet. In the whole universe, there is only you and God; everything is under God. In this way, blessing will come. In Swatow, if there are two or three brothers who are touched by God in this way, He will have a broad and free way to go on. This is the only way to bring in a revival in Swatow.</P><P>Many people will advise you to fast or to pray without sleeping. But I say today: you do not need to pray that much. Of course, I am not saying that you should be lazy. What I mean is that your heart has to be pure and simple. We should not be unresponsive or passive. But neither should we be over-zealous or aggressive. Those who are not zealous will receive nothing, and those who are over-zealous will also receive nothing. Many times, God has no way to help the zealous ones, and He has no way to help the over-hungry ones.</P><P>During the past ten years or more, there were some very zealous ones in northern China. I have not seen another group of people more zealous than they were. They could fast for a few days, pray continuously for a few hours, or keep themselves awake a few nights without sleeping. When I met these people, I had no way to help them. I only wished that I could pull them back and have them sit down to rest. May the Lord be merciful to us. Here we do not have any excitement, and we do not have the flesh. We only hope to be simple, pure, and restful. In this way, we will touch God.</P><P>Many times, when we say we are turning to God, our turning does not cause us to obtain mercy. I see many people in the church who are like black chimneys; they are full of black smoke. No matter how strong the light is, a man cannot see anything through a cloud of black smoke. Many brothers and sisters cannot allow light to pass through them because of their flesh and their natural life. They are not transparent. A piece of glass is not like that; it is transparent, and light can pass through. Some people are too hungry, too unworldly, too much for the Lord, and too zealous. As a result, they become misguided. I am not saying this in a light way. We should pray before the Lord, and in our prayer we should ask the Lord to make us more simple and more clear. May the Lord be merciful to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A PRAYER</H2><P>Prayer: Lord, we ask for mercy before You. We commit this word into Your hand. Cause us to be pure. Cleanse us, that we can meet You within us, and that our inner being can be turned to You in a real way. We need Your precious blood to cleanse us in many ways, so that our heart will not condemn us. May we turn to You from the depths of our being, and may we feel Your presence. May we come before You as coming before the throne. We pray this in the Lord's name, amen.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>IMAGE AND THE TREE OF LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONFERENCE (2)</H1><p>Date:January 8, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</p><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:27</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IMAGE AND THE TREE OF LIFE</H2><P>Genesis 1:27 mentions the word image. This word is very crucial. The Bible mentions image many times. The main thing this word reveals to us is the relationship between God and man. When many people think about salvation, they think about forgiveness of sins, the receiving of blessings, and so forth. But God did not create man just for him to receive blessings and to be forgiven of his sins. The first thought God has with man is that He wants man to be like Him. The first time the Bible mentions man and the creation of man, it mentions him having the image of God.</P><P>Genesis 2 mentions the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The first chapter mentions image, and the second chapter mentions the tree of life. I hope that you will circle the words image and the tree of life with a red pen. Image is something outside, whereas life is something inside. First it speaks of the outside, and then it speaks of the inside. This is like saying that you have the image of a Chinese outside, and you have the life of a Chinese inside. Without having God's life inside him, man cannot have God's image. Life is the content, and in this life there is God's nature. When this life is expressed, we have God's image.</P><P>I want to ask the brothers and sisters a question: Why do you believe in Jesus? Many people answer that it is because they have sinned, or that they were poor and suffering, and they needed something to depend on. All of these are right answers, but this kind of understanding is too shallow and elementary.</P><P>In God's creation, the earth is the center of the heavens, and the garden of Eden is the center of the earth. In the midst of the garden, there was the tree of life. God put man in the center of the center. He did not put man in the heavens, nor did He put man on the fringes. Rather, He put man in the center. In this center, there was man, and there were the two trees. Both trees speak of food. The tree of life is a matter of food, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is also a matter of food. We know that when food gets into a man, it becomes a part of him. I hope that tonight we will put aside matters such as heaven, hell, blessings, and sufferings. Let us set our hearts on two things: image and the tree of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TREE OF LIFE BRINGING IN LIFE, WHEREAS<br>THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL<br>BRINGING IN DEATH</H2><P>In Hebrew, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is composed of three words: knowledge, good, and evil. Life is simply life; it is unique. But God cannot say that evil is good, or that good is evil. Other than knowledge, good, and evil, there is still another thing, which is death. Good and evil bring in death. Today, in order to gain God, we have to be pure. The meaning of being pure is to have one thing only. What we take into us is life, and what is lived out of us is the image. If it is life for us all the way from the beginning to the end and we have nothing besides life, we are being pure. When man joins himself to the knowledge of good and evil, he falls into death, and he becomes complicated. The tree of knowledge can be called the tree of good, and it can also be called the tree of evil. Humanly speaking, the tree of good and the tree of knowledge sound very nice, and the tree of evil and the tree of death sound very bad. But in the whole universe, nothing other than life is according to God's will. Everything outside of life is in the realm of knowledge, good, evil, and death. Today, man thinks that good is life, and evil is death. When man touches evil, he touches death. But when he touches good, does he not touch death also? When he touches knowledge, does he not touch death also? I have to shout loudly that the result of good and knowledge is also death.</P><P>If someone hates you, or he is proud, this is to be evil. But if he loves you, and he is humble, this is to be good. On the one hand, the Bible teaches us to love our parents and our brothers and sisters. But on the other hand, Luke 14 tells us to hate our parents and our brothers and sisters. God's intention has nothing to do with good and evil; it has to do with life. God has no intention for us to do evil, and He has no intention for us to do good. You cannot please God by doing evil, and you cannot please God by doing good, because both good and evil come from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Whether you are proud or humble, the source is the same, and the end is death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD, THE DEVIL, AND MAN</H2><P>What is life? John 1:4 says that in Him is life. First John says that he who has the Son has life (5:12). Whenever we come into contact with God, we have life. Life is versus death, in the same way that God is versus the devil. In the whole Bible, there are only these three things: God, the devil, and man. These three things stand as three separate entities. When man contacts God, there is life. When man contacts the devil, there is death. Everything with God is real, and nothing is false. Everything with Satan is unreal; he pretends to be good, and he pretends to give knowledge. A man may be touching something that he considers good, but within that something is death.</P><P>What did man touch in the garden of Eden? He touched the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The result was that he received Satan into his being, and he became fallen. Satan is the evil one, the one who holds the power of death. The meaning of the fall is that Satan entered into man. The meaning of salvation is that Satan is driven out and God has entered in. Ephesians 2 says that within the unbelievers there is the operation of the evil spirits. Christ said once that we were of our father, and our father was Satan. This is why some people say that those who gamble are "gambling-demons," and those who take opium are "opium-demons." When a man sins many times, eventually the devil is lived out of that man. When you go into the casino, the people you see do not look like human beings; everyone looks like a devil. Before a man is saved, it is the devil that is living in him. Such ones may be honest on the outside, but they are deceitful on the inside. Who is inside of them? It is the devil who is inside of them. Many times, a person cannot control himself. This is because Satan is living within him. Man has been mingled with the devil.</P><P>Now man has become very complicated. Within us, it seems that there are three persons: God, Satan, and man. You are like a little garden of Eden, and you are standing before two trees. We are saying all these things to show you that today the garden of Eden is within you. These two trees are within you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THREE KINDS OF LIVING</H2><P>What is your attitude toward the knowledge of good and evil today? Christianity today has degraded. All that the ones there know is that evil is death; they do not know that good is also death. They do not know these two trees.</P><P>For example, a brother may become angry with his wife in the evening, and he may beat his wife. If you see this, you will say that he is an evil person. The next morning, he may become humble, and you will say that he is a good man. In the afternoon, he may fellowship with the Lord and live in His presence. When you see him, you will sense that he is neither an evil man nor a good man, but a God-man. Why do you have such a sense? It is because with him, there is the taste of God. This man has allowed God to rule over him and to live out of him.</P><P>I hate two kinds of people. The first is the proud ones, and the second is the falsely humble ones. Perhaps the second kind is worse than the first kind. Notwithstanding, whether a person is humble or proud, our question is this: Which tree is his source? In God's eyes, knowledge, good, and evil are all death. Very few people can discern this matter.</P><P>With some people, a person does not sense any good or evil in them. He only senses the taste of God in them. They are persons living in God. They do not know what is good and what is evil. They do not know what it is to be proud and what it is to be humble. They are people who live in life. Suppose you see a brother loving others, and you ask him why he loves. If he says that the Bible tells us to do so, it is wrong. If he says that God tells him to do so, it is right. The question today is whether we are living in God's tree of life, or in something else.</P><P>Prayer: May the Lord work into our being the words released tonight, so that we become enlightened within, and so that the eyes of our heart may be opened.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TWO TREES, TWO PRINCIPLES,<br>AND TWO RESULTS</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (1)</H1><p>Date:Morning, January 9, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHAT GOD WANTS BEING WORKS OF LIFE</H2><P>The words of Confucius and Mencius are different from the words of life. We are not trying to make the cold brothers and sisters excited and the disorderly ones orderly. We are not doing a mortician's job here, improving men's outward appearance a little and eventually burying them in the ground. We have to ask what kind of work we are doing today. If we are merely putting some cosmetics on dead people, adding some plaster to thin cheeks and some color to pale faces, we are doing a work of death. What God wants is a work of life.</P><P>If we compare Genesis 1 and 2 with the last two chapters of Revelation, we will discover that at the end of Revelation there is no longer the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The result of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is death. Hence, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil eventually ends in the lake of fire. Satan is the constituent of death, whereas God is the source of life. Throughout the ages, God has been showing us one thing, which is that everything that has to do with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil eventually ends in death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RIVER OF WATER AND THE RIVER OF FIRE</H2><P>The Bible talks about the river of water and the river of fire. Daniel 7:10 mentions the stream of fire. Whenever we touch the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, fire comes. Genesis 3 mentions the flaming sword. Whenever we touch the tree of life, there is the river of life. Once the tree of life appeared, the river of life was produced. This river produced gold, bdellium, and onyx stone (Gen. 2:9-12). Gold signifies God's nature. Once this gold passes through you, you will be "plated" with gold. The bdellium is pearl, which is produced from a grain of sand. When the sand gets into an oyster, the secretion of the oyster produces the pearl. In the same way, when we believe in the Lord, we enter into Him. From that day on, God's nature is continually dispensed into us to turn us into pearls. This pearl in the end becomes the precious stones. Revelation 4 also mentions the precious stones. Precious stones refer to God's manifested glory. The New Jerusalem was constituted with gold, pearl, and precious stones. There the river refers to the Lord's life. Jeremiah 17:7 and 8 say that those who trust in the Lord are like a tree planted by the waters. Jeremiah 2:13 also says that when we forsake God, we are forsaking the fountain of living waters. Psalm 46:4 says that there is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God. Psalm 36:7 and 8 say that God makes us to drink of the river of His pleasures. On the one hand, we eat the fruit of the tree of life. On the other hand, we drink of the river of His pleasures. According to the footnote in Darby's Bible, the word pleasures here is of the same root as the word for Eden. Ezekiel 47 also mentions the river. This river is the river of life.</P><P>The river of fire signifies God's judgment. This river begins from the flaming sword in Genesis 3, and it flows all the way to the lake of fire at the end of Revelation. The lake of fire is the culmination of all the rivers of fire. When all the rivers of fire flow together, they become a lake.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TWO PRINCIPLES OF LIVING AND TWO RESULTS</H2><P>Our burden is to show the brothers and sisters that to touch the tree of life is to touch God, and that to touch the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is to touch fire and death. Hence, in order to learn to serve God and to work for Him, a Christian must learn to stay away from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Suppose a brother or a sister is very meek, submissive to his or her parents, and full of all kinds of virtues. Outwardly speaking, these are very good things. Actually, they are all things that belong to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Of course, we do not want to see people fighting, sinning, or falling into the flesh. But neither do we like to see people remaining in the good of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. For example, a couple may be arguing. Our natural concept is to exhort them to be reconciled with each other. But if we know the principle of the tree of life, we will not exhort them to be patient or humble. If we are clear about the principle of the tree of life, we will lead this couple into life. Only those who touch the tree of life will see their life and work remaining in the New Jerusalem. Those who are sinful will go into the lake of fire. Those who are moral will also go into the lake of fire. Today, we are not saying that we do not need love or humility. Within the tree of life, there is surely love and humility. But the love and humility that issue from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil will result in the lake of fire. Only the virtues that issue from the tree of life will last unto eternity.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE FOUR LAWS</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONFERENCE (3)</H1><p>Date:Evening, January 9, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</p><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 7:21-25; 8:1-2<br>(Please note the words "law," "good," and "evil" in 7:21, the words "the law of God," "law of my mind," and "law of sin" in 7:22-23.<br>Verses 22 and 23 give a total of three laws in two verses.<br>Verse 24 is a groaning for deliverance from the body of this death.<br>Verse 25 says that the mind serves the law of God, while the flesh serves the law of sin.<br>8:1 and 2 again mention the law twice: "the law of the Spirit of life," and "the law of sin and of death.")</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHAT IS A LAW</H2><P>Before I come to my subject tonight, I will first ask the brothers and sisters to forget everything that you have heard before and come as if you know nothing about God's word and you are starting all over from the beginning.</P><P>Tonight we will look at Romans 7 and 8. These two chapters mention many things concerning the laws. Last night we spoke of some basic matters. Tonight we will speak concerning an even more basic matter. This basic matter is the law. In order for a Christian to know God, he has to understand the laws. May the Lord open our eyes to see what a law is.</P><P>Paul mentioned a number of laws in Romans 7 and 8. When I was saved more than twenty years ago, I came across this passage, and I did not know what a law was. After more than ten years, I still did not understand what it was. Romans 7 and 8 mention the laws repeatedly. Bible students all agree that the book of Romans occupies a very important place in the Bible. It can be considered one of the most important books of the New Testament. In this book, the most important chapters are chapters five to eight. With chapters five to eight, the key word is "law." If a man does not know what a law is, his spiritual life will be confused.</P><P>A law is a natural force. For example, if I throw a book up in the air, it will surely fall down. I do not have to worry about whether or not it will fall down, and I do not have to help it fall down. There is a law that controls it and compels it to fall down. Every life has its natural ability. I dare not say that every law is a life, but I can say that every life is a law. If I plant a chrysanthemum seed in the ground, I do not have to pray, fast, or worry; what grows up will surely be a chrysanthemum flower. Are we breathing, speaking, and sleeping today? Breathing, speaking, and sleeping are the laws of the body. I do not have to exercise my will to breathe a certain number of times a minute, or to exercise my mind to consider if I have digested the food I have eaten. These things do not require the intervention of my mind and will. The more I exercise my will to digest, the more I become nervous, and the less I will be able to digest. Digestion is a law of life, a natural ability. If I hit you in the eye with my hand, your eyelids will spontaneously close; this is a law.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LAWS IN ROMANS 7 AND 8</H2><P>The laws that we are speaking about are not the laws known to the lawyers. In Romans 7 there are three kinds of laws. In chapter eight there is another law, which makes four laws altogether.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Law of God</H2><P>First, there is the law of God. Everything that God created has its laws. For example, the rising and setting of the sun and the four seasons all have their specific laws. The farmers have to sow and reap according to these laws. God has also placed specific laws upon man. He forbids man to sin and teaches him to do good. If a man wants to live, he has to obey God's law. Once a man disobeys God's law, he will be condemned by it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Law of Good in the Mind</H2><P>Second, there is the law of the mind. The outward visible part of a person is his body. The inward invisible part is his spirit. Between the body and the spirit, there is the soul. Man is divided into three parts, which are, from the inside to the outside: the spirit, the soul, and the body. The soul includes the personality, the mind, the emotion, and the will. After man fell, the mind became the biggest part of the soul. From Romans 7:23 we see that the law of the mind is good. There, the law of the members wars with the law of the mind. These two laws are against one another. If they are complementary to one another, they will only be companions. But if they are against one another, it proves that one is good and the other is evil. The law of the mind is good. God created man a good man, and, as such, his mind must be good. Sometimes we are not very accurate in our preaching of the gospel. We tell others that there is no good thing within man. A few years ago, I followed others to say the same thing. Later, I reconsidered and felt that this is not right, because even an unsaved person has good inclinations, such as honoring the parents, helping others, and doing good. The Chinese sages said that within every person there is a heart of sympathy. It is true that the Bible tells us that within our flesh nothing good dwells, but this does not mean that within my whole being there is absolutely no good whatsoever. If that were true, there could not have been the warring mentioned in these verses. There is warring because the body wants to sin, while the mind wants to do good, and in making up one's mind to do good, there is the conflict. The reasoning faculty is a part of the soul, and for the most part the reason chooses the good. Within man there is a natural law that urges man to do good. This is because man is created by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Law of Sin in the Members</H2><P>Third, there is the law in the members. The members here refer to the different parts of the body. The law of the members is the law of the body. This is not a good law. The law of sin in verse 25 is another name for the law in the members. According to the law of the mind, man wants to do good. But according to the law of the body, he feels that evil is present with him. Here it mentions "to will" (7:18), which is a question of the will. It also mentions to "delight" (7:22), which is a question of the emotion, and "to do the good" (7:21), which is a function of the mind. To will, to delight in, and to do good are all functions of the law of the soul. However, man is not strong enough to overcome. On the contrary, he is defeated and is carried away to obey the law of the members. This is why there is the sighing, "Wretched man that I am!" This man's mind, will, and emotion all desire to do good. But he fails, and he is not able to overcome the law of the body. Here, man discovers that within him there is present a law of evil.</P><P>Before man fell, there was the law of good, because at the time God created man, man was good and he was pure. After man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he took Satan into his body. The name of Satan is "the evil one." This word is the same in Greek as the word "evil" in Romans 7. Within every unbeliever, there are two laws, the law of good and the law of evil. The law of good is in man's mind, whereas the law of evil is in man's flesh. The Chinese have the so-called "conflict between reason and lust." The "reason" there is the law of good in the created life, and the "lust" there is the law of evil in the body. The conflict between reason and lust as described by the Chinese is similar to the conflict described in Romans 7.</P><P>For an opium smoker, his reason tells him that he should not take opium. Although he may make up his mind not to take any more opium, his body is addicted to it. Although his mind, emotion, and will agree that he should not take it, his body has been addicted to opium, and the addiction takes over his hands, feet, and his entire body, and it drags his body to the opium parlor. Although the law of the mind tells him not to take opium, once the opium-burner is lighted, he begins to take the opium again.</P><P>The same is true with losing our temper. The law of the mind tells a person not to lose his temper. But when the temper comes, a person cannot hold it down. His temper has taken him captive. Many times, after husbands lose their temper with their wives, they hit themselves in remorse. But then when they are stirred up again, their faces turn red, and they are led to do things against their will again. According to the law of the mind in their soul, they do not want to lose their temper. But when the law of evil in their body is activated, they lose their temper again, and the reason is once more overcome by the lust. In the end, they discover that their reason is weak, and their lust is strong.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Law of the Spirit of Life</H2><P>Fourth, there is the law of the Spirit of life. This law comes into us at the time we believe in the Lord. With which part do we receive the Lord? We receive Him with our spirit. Hence, the law of the Spirit of life is in our spirit. With every saved person, there is the law of good, the law of evil, and the law of life. The law of good is in the soul, and the law of evil is in the body, whereas the law of life is in the spirit. All the three parts of man, the spirit, the soul, and the body, have their own laws.</P><P>Suppose a brother becomes angry with his wife in the evening, and he begins to beat her. This is the operation of the law of evil in the body. The next morning his reason takes over, and he changes his attitude, and he becomes polite to his wife. This is the operation of the law of reason in his soul. In the afternoon when he fellowships with God and is filled with Him, he begins to bear a spiritual taste, and this is the operation of the law of the Spirit of life. The law of good in the soul desires to obey the law of God and to please Him. But the law of evil in the body frustrates it and causes a person to sin and to rebel against God's law, and to come under judgment. Thanks be to God. Here is the law of the Spirit of life to be man's salvation. It delivers man from the law of evil and good, and it causes man to transcend, to rise above good to satisfy God's law and to more than conquer all things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED FOR A CHRISTIAN TO LIVE BY<br>THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</H2><P>Today, we should not be a Christian according to the first, second, or third law. Rather, we should be a Christian according to the fourth law. If someone on the street hits you, why would you not hit him back? Some say that it is because the Bible tells us not to do so. If you say this, you are acting according to the first law. When a wife submits to her husband, and children submit to their parents, these submissions may be something according to the first law. To be a Christian in this way is wrong.</P><P>Perhaps some would say that they want to be a good man and that they have made up their mind to be good. This is to live according to the second law. Then there are those who say that if others hit them, they would surely retaliate, and they would retaliate in a stronger way than they were hit. This is to fall into the third law, the law of evil in the body. It is wrong to live according to the first, the second, or the third law. If I do not retaliate, it should be because my spirit feels not to retaliate, and because to retaliate would make me feel uncomfortable and cause my spirit to protest. If a wife submits to her husband, it should be because her spirit is telling her to submit. If we do this, we are living according to the fourth law. If we live according to the fourth law, we will be able to say, "Hallelujah!" Only by being this kind of Christian will we have peace, and only then will we be at ease.</P><P>In Shanghai someone asked me once, "Why can't I smoke?" I said, "If you can smoke in peace, go ahead and smoke more." If you can hit your wife in peace, and if by hitting her, you can be brought to God, go ahead and hit her some more. On the other hand, if by loving your wife you can gain the peace and can bring God into you, you should go ahead and love her more. If your love does not bring you peace, this kind of love is appalling. We should be fellowshipping with the Lord within us all the time. If we have peace to do something, we should go ahead and do it. If we do not have the peace, we should not do it. We should be a comfortable, peaceful, happy, and joyful Christian. We should not deceive ourselves or others. Only such Christians will meet God, and only they will see the blessing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A PRAYER</H2><P>Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi prayed: May the Lord lead men to God through His servant's words. May the words open man's understanding and enlighten man's inner being, so that the brothers and sisters would have a pure heart toward the Lord and would not become Christians who live according to morality or by resolutions, but would become Christians who live out their life in a spontaneous way. Grant Your children's conscience, spirit, and intuition to have sensitive responses. Amen.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br>AND MAN-MADE WORKS</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (2)</H1><p>Date:Morning, January 10, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</H1><P>Prayer: May the Lord deliver us from quick minds and curious thoughts. We admit that it is very difficult for the Lord's word to come into our heart. May the Lord cause the words that we hear to lead us to the presence of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MAN-MADE WORKS BEING<br>COUNTERFEITS AND BEING ARTIFICIAL</H2><P>In Christianity, preachers always try to impress others with the importance and goodness of a truth. At the end, they would point out how one can obtain such truth, what one should do first, and what he should do next. The listeners may be impressed and may try to practice accordingly when they go home. But in the end, they always find out that the teachings do not work. In the Bible, the apostles did not do this kind of work. Spiritual things do not come through our strivings, strugglings, or resolutions. They are a direct result of God's light. Saul on the way to Damascus did not hear any special message, but he saw the revelation of Christ. In preaching the Lord's word, we have to look to the work of the Holy Spirit, and our being has to go out with the release of the Lord's word. This is the way to put the word into others' being. Some preaching gives others the revelation, whereas other preaching only presents the methods in a clear way. In the latter case, the listeners may be touched, but when they try to practice the methods, their endeavors are but man-made works. Man-made works are counterfeit works. When the Japanese occupied China, there was the so-called puppet government. The puppet government is a counterfeit government. Many so-called spiritual virtues are actually like artificial flowers. They are like the fruit on the Christmas trees, which do not grow out of the trees, but are put there by hand. Artificial goodness is man-made goodness. This kind of goodness is a result of the work of the preachers. A man can have any kind of outward performance; he can act like a seminary student, walking slowly with the Bible in his hands and with his eyes fixed to heaven. But this kind of acting accomplishes nothing. He can come to the meeting with bowed head and silent prayers, and he can nod his head continually while listening to the message. He can pray silently after the message to show that he is touched by the words. But after the meeting, on his way home his eyes will catch some attractive things, and his true self will be exposed again. No wonder there are so many hypocrites today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN CONFUCIUS' TEACHING<br>AND GOD'S TEACHING</H2><P>It is good that the evangelists are helping people to be saved. Many of the truths passed on to such ones after their salvation are counterfeit teachings. What many so-called great pastors and evangelists are preaching is but Confucian teachings, or godly teachings. Man likes to hear these godly teachings. But ninety-nine percent of these teachings are on counterfeit goodness. Exhortations to be godly and to be just are things that a person uses to teach others; they are not things that a person lives out in his life. We have to forget about all these things. On the one hand, we should not be lawless. On the other hand, we should not bind ourselves; everything should be done in a spontaneous way. We would rather not do something than to do it in pretension. To do something in pretension damages a person more than not doing anything. If someone is somewhat loose, we should not feel sad. If someone is somewhat meek, we should not feel happy. Humanly speaking, to be meek is surely better than to be rough. But before God, there is not much difference between meekness and roughness. Spiritual matters are not accomplished through outward strivings. Paul received the light on the way to Damascus, not through his own pursuits or strivings, but through God's taking hold of him. You may say that if this is the case, we might as well give up. But while you may give up, God will not give up; He will take hold of you. The thing I fear the most is for a person to live by himself merely according to ethics. This kind of conduct is the work of producing artificial flowers. Of course, we have to admit that, humanly speaking, Confucius' teachings are good. The Chinese say that humility brings profit whereas arrogance brings loss. For thousands of years, we have upheld the Confucian teachings. Humanly speaking, they are good teachings. But the New Testament is not on human ethics, but on divine ethics. The New Testament says that we have to hate our parents, brothers and sisters, and children. It is not teaching us to be humanistic, but to live God and to follow Him. The teachings in Christianity tell people what to do, and the teachings in other religions also tell people what to do. But none of these teachings are of any value.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOLD, SILVER, AND PRECIOUS STONES<br>VERSUS WOOD, GRASS, AND STUBBLE</H2><P>First Corinthians 3 says that with some people, their works will be burned up by fire. It does not mean that they have sinned or have lost their temper, and so forth. It means that the nature of their works will be tested, and their works will be found not to be built on the foundation of Christ. All works that originate from the self are wood, grass, and stubble; and everything that comes from God is gold, silver, and precious stones. Gold is versus wood. Gold signifies God's nature, whereas wood signifies the human nature. Silver signifies redemption, whereas grass signifies the flesh. Stubble is earthly, and it is versus the precious stones. The precious stones speak not only of God's image, but of the heavenly glory as well. What God wants to gain in us today is gold, silver, and precious stones, and not wood, grass, and stubble.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINETEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THREE KINDS OF LIVES<br>AND THREE KINDS OF LIVING</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONFERENCE (4)</H1><p>Date:Evening, January 10, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</p><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THREE KINDS OF LIVES</H2><P>Last night we saw the four laws in Romans 7 and 8. Tonight, we will go on to see the three kinds of histories that go on within a saved person. First, man is a created being. Later man fell, and he became a fallen being. After he is saved, he becomes a saved person. When man was created, he had the created life. After the fall, he inherited the satanic life. After he is saved, he received God's life.</P><P>The human life is created by God, and it is good. Hence, the law within man is good. After man fell, the life he inherited came from the evil one. Hence, the law that came with it is an evil law. After man is saved, the life he received came from God. As a result, the law that came with that life is also of God. Now, man has become a complicated mixture. If I ask who you are, it will be difficult for you to answer. If you ask who I am, it will be difficult for me to answer also. Within me there is God, there is the devil, and there is also man. Within man there are three elements: the element of God, the element of the devil, and the element of man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THREE KINDS OF LIVING</H2><P>When some hear us saying that within man is the devil, they do not feel comfortable. But I have to ask this: Is there hatred in man? If there is, this hatred is surely not created by God. Surely hatred comes from the devil. We know that it is not good to lose our temper, but we lose our temper involuntarily. What is sin? The sin mentioned in Romans 5 to 8 does not refer to the acts of sins, but to a living entity. There it says that sin dwells in man. A lifeless thing cannot dwell in man. It also says that sin reigns and takes hold of us to do what we do not want to do. What we do is not of our own will, but is done by the sin that dwells within us. This proves that sin is a living thing. When Satan entered into man's life, it became sin. In the Old Testament, after the Israelites were bitten by the fiery serpents, they became poisoned with the serpents' poison. In the same way, after man fell, he inherited Satan's life.</P><P>The question today is this: By which life are we going to live? Are we going to live by the original life, the satanic evil life, or the life of God? To be a Christian is not to be an evil person, nor to be a good person. The Christian standard is not good or evil. To take good and evil as the standard is to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THREE KINDS OF GOOD</H2><P>The Bible mentions three kinds of good. The first kind is the good that was there when man was created. The life that man received at the time of creation was a good life. Hence, the law within that life is also good. The second kind of good is the good of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The life that Satan put within man causes him to sin, on the one hand, and to do good, on the other hand. A fallen man can also be humble. A proud man offends God, but a humble man offends God even more. To honor one's parents is good, but Satan instigates man to oppose God and ignore God through his honoring of his parents. This good therefore comes from the satanic life. The third kind of good is that which is produced by the life of God. This kind of good transcends man's original good. Many people cannot distinguish between these three kinds of good in the New Testament. The good works described in Ephesians 2 are different from the good which one wills to do in Romans 7. The good in Romans 7 refers to the good that was there when we were created. The good works in Ephesians 2 refer to the good that is God's life living through the Christians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LIVING BY THE TASTE OF GOD'S LIFE</H2><P>A Christian should not take good itself as the standard. He has to take God's life as the standard. Whether a Christian should or should not do something is based upon whether or not that thing fits his taste. This is like whether or not a man drinks a certain kind of soup having nothing to do with whether or not he is glorifying God; it is a matter of his taste. We must not only exhort others not to beat their wives; we must also ask based on what does a man not beat his wife. A Christian does not smoke, not because smoking will not glorify God, but because smoking is contrary to his taste within. God's law is written in us, because God's life is within us. Whether or not we like something is based on the law of a taste within us. This law gives us a certain taste. A five-month-old baby cannot write or speak; his mind and reason are not fully developed. He cannot argue with you. But if you put ginger in his mouth, he will not swallow it. You do not have to teach him not to swallow it; it is not a question of mental knowledge, but a question of life-taste. When God created man, He put this law of life within the sense of life already. It is not up to the mind to decide whether a person wants something or not. It is up to the inner sense to decide it. If you put ginger in a baby's mouth, he will not swallow it. But if you put chocolate in his mouth, he will take it and will want more. He may not be able to speak with his mouth. He may not even be able to distinguish clearly with his eyes. But he can tell the difference between good food and food that is not good. This illustration is a most appropriate one.</P><P>Within every Christian, there is the life of God. We know how to reject everything that is contrary to the taste of God's life. In the New Testament, two passages tell us that a saved person can know God without others teaching him. These two passages are in Hebrews 8 and 1 John 2. We have to repeat a hundred times that a Christian who has life does not need others to teach him anything.</P><P>In Chefoo a brother once asked me at a dinner if he could do something. I pointed my finger at his heart and asked, "How does that part feel?" He said, "I know. I know." But soon after, he came and asked me again concerning another matter. I smiled and pointed my finger at his heart again, saying, "How does that part feel?" He said again, "I know. I know." I then responded, "If you know already, why do you come to ask me?" The third time he came and asked the same thing again, and I answered him the same way. Today, within us, all of us know. If you say that you do not know, you are lying. The real problem is not that we do not know, but that we are not willing to pay the price. If you have life, you will surely have the taste, and once you have the taste, you will surely have the feeling. Whether a thing smells good or bad is not determined by our teaching, but by our feeling.</P><P>Twenty-six years ago, I saw a child eating a rice dumpling. He should have added sugar to it, but someone added salt to it instead. Although the child could not distinguish between salt and sugar with his eyes, when he ate it, his taste told him the difference. Some food makes a person feel right, whereas other food makes a person feel wrong. Outwardly, things may look the same. But the taste tells the difference. This is the "law of the Spirit of life" spoken of in Romans 8 and referred to in Hebrews 8. This law has a taste. We reject anything that is contrary to this taste, and we accept anything that matches this taste. Every genuinely saved Christian has this taste. Unfortunately, many Christians neglect this inner taste. They live according to the outward standard of good and evil, and not according to the inner sense, taste, and law. What we need is not teachings, but the sense of life.</P><P>Eight or ten years ago, if you asked me some questions, I could give you many ways. But today, I will tell you that the answer to all the questions is found in the taste of our inner life.</P><P>There was a story in The Christian magazine which said that once, after Moody preached the gospel, a lady told him, "I am a Christian. But I am not like you. I have children, and I am married. My husband often takes me to the theater to watch the plays. Should I go or not?" Moody asked the lady, "Have I ever mentioned in my pulpit anything about whether or not one can go to the theater?" The lady said, "No." Moody then said, "What I preach is all published in the newspapers. Can you find in any of the articles anything I have said about this matter?" The lady again answered, "No," but she added, "Although nothing was said, I imagine you would not like to see Christians going to the theater." One afternoon, the lady again went with her husband to watch a play. The minute she entered the theater, she did not have the peace within, and she left. The husband said, "You have become crazy through listening to Mr. Moody's preaching." She answered, "No. I am not crazy. The taste within me has changed. I do not have the taste for this any longer." Hence, we see that it is not a matter of outward teaching, but a matter of an inward taste of life.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LORD'S DAY MORNING MESSAGE (1)</H1><p>Date:January 11, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</p><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:10; 3:17-20</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S CENTRAL GOAL&#151;<br>WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</H2><P>Throughout the ages, God has only one work, and that is to work Himself into man. I hope that everyone sitting here can listen carefully to this. Why did God create the universe? Why did He create man? Why did He create you? What is God trying to accomplish? This is an important question. If God wants to do something, and you do not know about it, your Christian life is meaningless. You may think that God's intention is for you to have joy and peace. It is true that God wants you to have joy and peace, but these things are not God's center. God is not merely giving you peace, blessings, forgiveness, eternal life, and so forth; His central thought is to work Himself into man. What is the ultimate goal of God in the old creation as well as in the new? It is to work Himself into man. This is God's goal. God's redemption is for this goal. He created the universe in order to put man in it, and the purpose for Him to have man is to work Himself into him. I cannot tell you why God wants to do this. But I do know that this is His desire; He wants to work Himself into man.</P><P>A light bulb is very good to look at. But if you ask the designer who designed it, he will tell you that the bulb is not made just to be good to look at. It has one specific goal, and that is to transmit electricity. If electricity is not transmitted into it, all the electric wires and electric poles will be useless. What is the function of the electric wires and poles? They are there to transmit electricity to the light bulb. Everyone, whether male or female, young or old, honorable or lowly, exists for his three meals a day only. He eats so that he can work, and he works so that he can eat. Some say that they live for society or for their country. These are lies; they are but beautiful words. The best liars are the social reformers and the politicians. This world is a chaos; it has been put into disarray by the great politicians and by the so-called reformers. For a person to be a high officer or the head of a state will not necessarily bring blessing to humanity. Even if a man gains the whole world, what he ultimately gets is but a coffin. None of these are the meaning of human existence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PURPOSE OF MAN&#151;TO BE GOD'S VESSEL,<br>CONTAINING GOD AND EXPRESSING HIM</H2><P>Man is God's vessel. He is God's "bulb." God wants to put His life and light into man. He wants to live inside of man. What is the meaning of your existence? Is it for your family, children, or business? You have attended school for many years, and you have filled your mind with knowledge, but is this the meaning of your human life? Some people hope to have good children. But as their sons are growing up, the fathers themselves are dwindling down.</P><P>Other people say that they want to serve God and to keep His will; they want to please God, to work for Him, and to zealously do His will. Are these thoughts correct? Again there are those who hope to receive answers to prayers, to receive blessings, and to witness for God. Christianity today has been degraded by man to a pitiful level. To have blessings and peace is not the purpose of man. What then is the purpose of man?</P><P>Romans 9:20 and 21 say that man is a piece of clay. This piece of clay is not made to be God's servant or His maid. It is made to be a vessel. Any vessel, whether it is a cup or a bowl, exists for the purpose of containing something. A vessel is different from a tool. God has no intention to make you into a tool. It would be terrible if God were to make you into a tool. He has no intention to make you into a hammer and use you to hit others. He only wants to put Himself into you, so that His life can flow out of you.</P><P>The real way to serve God, glorify Him, and keep His will is to put yourself in the hand of God and to allow Him to fill you up. In this way, God will shine out and flow out from within you. This is to serve God. It is not a matter of your working for the Lord, but of God's working Himself into you. It is a great blasphemy to think that a man can do anything for the Lord. God is the Creator. He does not need you to work for Him; He only needs you to allow Him to work in you. Ephesians 2 says that we are God's workmanship. We are not His workers. If the whole of Swatow would rise up to work, I can predict that soon these ones will argue one with another. But if here is a small group of people who would tell the Lord that they are not here to work for Him, but to be worked on by Him, God will have a way here. God does not need you to be His tool. He wants you to be His vessel to contain Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR LIVING AND WORKING<br>BEING FOR GOD TO WORK HIMSELF INTO US</H2><P>The problem today is that no one is willing to contain God. Our eyes need to be opened. If there is such a group of people, God will have a way here in this place, and man will receive the blessing. God has no intention for you to love your wife or to hate your wife. God has no intention for the wife to submit to the husband or to rebel against the husband. God has only one intention, and that is to work Himself into man.</P><P>If Brother Chow keeps walking around, it will be difficult for me to pour water on his head. But if he sits down, it will be easy for me to pour water on him. It may seem that he is doing something for me when he walks around. Actually, I can do nothing with him.</P><P>If by hating your wife you can have more of God in you, you can go ahead and hate your wife as much as you like. In facing an issue, the question is how much of God will pass through you, and how much He will gain in you. Why did God give you parents, husbands, wives, and children? He gave you these things in order that He can work Himself into you through these things. If the more I speak, the more God is added into you, this will achieve God's goal. I did not come to Swatow to give teachings. I have come to have God worked into you. Why should the sisters manage their homes well? Is it to make better homes? No. It is to have more of God added into you. The more we manage our homes, the more God should be added into us. If you do this, after three or five years, you will have more of God. Your homes may still be the same, but God will have increased within you.</P><P>Some have asked me if they can quit their job to serve the Lord full-time. I told them bluntly that it does not mean anything for them to remain in their jobs, and it does not mean anything for them to quit their jobs and be a preacher. The question is not whether or not one should be a preacher, but whether or not one will allow the Lord to work in him. God's work in the old creation is outside of man. His work in the new creation is within man. One day, the work of the old creation will pass away. But the work of the new creation will remain until the New Jerusalem; it will never pass away but will have eternal value.</P><P>Every time we do something, we should not ask if that thing is right or wrong, or if it is according to God's will. In doing something, the question is this: Is it we who are doing it, or is it God? What we should ask is not what we do, but who is doing it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S LEADING AND OVERSEEING<br>BEING FOR THE PURPOSE<br>OF WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</H2><P>Today, many people talk about God's leading. The word leading has been much misused by men. You may say that God is leading you to preach the gospel today, or that He is leading you to take care of your home tomorrow. The issue is not this or that kind of leading. The question is this: In such leadings, what do you do? By whom are you doing these things? God has not asked you only to be a steward and to manage your household well. He has not asked you only to preach the gospel and to preach it well. God's goal is to go through you and be constituted in you. Some manage their homes well. But by doing so, God is put aside. The same is true in one's management of the church. Some are led to manage the church. But the question is this: By what way is this one managing the church? For him to be led to take up the management of the church is one thing, but the way he manages the church is another thing. With some sisters, the more they manage their homes, the worse their homes become. Yet all the while, God is worked into them. Before they try to manage their homes, they do not have God. But after they start managing them, they are filled with God, even though their homes are still not well-managed. God is managing them through their home management. In their managing of their homes, God passes through them. Some may ask, "If a person has God, will she not manage her home well?" Consider the world; it is true that the world is under God's management. But is the world good? Seemingly, the world is not managed very well. Out of this world, however, God gains a group of people that will allow Him to work Himself into them. This is God's goal. Even when you save the whole county, if God cannot be worked into you, His plan in man is still defeated. If God can only be preached to people, without being preached into people, His will is still not accomplished.</P><P>We have to remember all the time that the need today is for God to work Himself into us, rather than for us to work for God. All those who will only work for God without allowing God to work in them will eventually be rejected. Only those who allow God to work in them through various circumstances, people, matters, and events will be blessed by Him.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CENTER OF GOD'S TRUTH</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (3)</H1><p>Date:January 11 to 12, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</p><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TALK AFTER DINNER ON JANUARY 11</H2><P>Brother Lee: Men beget children according to a law. As long as a person fulfills that law, he will beget children, whether or not the begetting is a legal one. In the same way, saving people through the gospel is a law. As long as there are those who preach the gospel, there are those who will be saved. This will happen spontaneously. But the question today is not one of being saved or not being saved. Rather, it is a question of the method we use, of whether or not the methods are up to the standard of God's desire.</P><P>Many of God's children have been spoiled by Christianity today. They are like a piece of material, which is best left alone to itself, because once it has been touched and has been made into some kind of vessel, one can never change it anymore. It is better to leave a piece of fabric alone than to cut it into something. Once it has been cut into something, nothing can any longer be done to it. The same is true with Christianity's work on some people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TALK AFTER BREAKFAST ON JANUARY 12</H2><P>God is going onward all the time; He never goes backward. In every age, He raised up men who would afford Him a way to go on, men like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, and so forth. God's works are different for different people. God would never raise up another David, and He would never raise up another one like George Muller to do a similar work. Of course, these people can give us some principles of conduct. But this does not mean that we have to imitate them and be the same as they were. In northern China, a few people tried to imitate Madame Guyon. At the beginning I dared not say much, but in the end I realized that this would not work.</P><P>Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi asked: In 1934, Brother Nee spoke concerning Christ as the centrality of God. Brother Sparks also emphasized this same thing. Is this the same as what Brother Lee is speaking this time, that is, God working Himself into man, and man being filled with God? Or is what Brother Lee is speaking another aspect of God's centrality?</P><P>Brother Lee answered: There is no difference between these two things; they are the same thing. No other truth is more crucial than this truth today. Christ is God's centrality; this is the overall center. At the same time, the center of God's creation of man is His working Himself into man. This is for the purpose of establishing Christ as the centrality of all things. The Bible shows us this fact in a clear way.</P><P>Concerning the question of the Triune God, we can say that "God" is the personal name of the Triune God, that "Christ" is the official name of the Triune God, and that the "Holy Spirit" is the administrative name of the Triune God. It is better for us to say the Triune God than to say the Trinity. The end of Matthew mentions the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This name is singular. The relationship between the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit can be illustrated by the sun, the sunlight, and the heat. It can also be illustrated by the water, the ice, and the vapor.</P><P>Sister Pearl Wang: Christ is the embodiment of God, whereas the Holy Spirit is the embodiment of Christ.</P><P>Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi: Brother Nee said before in Canton that the Holy Spirit is the second coming of Christ.</P><P>Brother Lee: Darby was a great teacher. But he did one thing wrong, and that was to excommunicate Newton. Newton believed that all believers will have to pass through the great tribulation before they will be raptured.</P><P>Two hundred years ago, the Brethren released many biblical truths, but they did not touch the center. Instead, they only paid attention to the study of biblical teachings.</P><P>In God's eyes, all His works are done in a corporate way. His salvation is a corporate salvation. In the Old Testament, salvation for Noah was directed toward his whole household. Salvation also came to the whole house of Israel. Although God's work in the church today has its individual aspects, it is all for the whole Body. God never saves people individually.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONFERENCE (5)</H1><p>Date:Evening, January 12, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</p><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:10; 3:16-19</H1><P>Prayer: May the Lord cause the word to come out of us tonight, and may You cause others to receive these words into them. Although there is not much outward stimulation or excitement, may these words give others the freedom and the light as they enter into them. We admit our darkness and our foolishness. We admit that we have not given You the proper ground. We pray that You would have more ground in us tonight.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GOAL OF GOD'S WORK&#151;<br>WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</H2><P>Many people think that God's will is to make the proud person humble and the violent person meek. In other words, they think that God's will is to make the bad persons into good ones. But God's central work in man is not to do these things. He is not turning an evil man so that he becomes a good one. What is the goal of God's work? All the words and teachings will pass away. God has to open our eyes to see that throughout the ages, His work is to work Himself into man. Although this word is simple, most people have never thought of this matter before.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SALVATION BEING GOD WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</H2><P>We will start from the very beginning. What is it to be saved? Before we answer this question, we have to ask why do men have to believe in Jesus? Men believe in Jesus because there are sufferings in the world and because they want to receive blessings. Man has sicknesses and sins, and this is why he needs Jesus. It is true that this is the gospel. But this is not the center of the gospel. I have to ask this: If man needs to believe in Jesus because he has sinned, would he need Jesus if he does not have sins?</P><P>One brother said that the gospel is for us to receive Christ. But why do we have to receive Christ? Today, many people can speak some spiritual terms, but they do not know what those terms mean. For example, to many people justification and sanctification are but terminologies only. What is it to receive Christ? To receive Christ is to receive Jesus. But what is the meaning of receiving Jesus? To receive Jesus is not merely for the purpose of being delivered from sin, suffering, and hell. It is right that a man is saved to receive Christ. Actually, salvation itself is simply Christ. For a man to be saved is for him to have Christ. Salvation is not merely for us to be delivered from sin and suffering. After a man has received the Lord, surely he will be delivered from these things. But God's work in man is to work Himself into man. Salvation is God entering into man. To receive Christ is to receive God Himself. Christ is God, and God is Christ. The Bible never tells us that there are three Gods. When He is in heaven, God is the Father. One day, when He came among men and was seen and touched by men, He was the Son. John 1 shows us that the Son is the Father manifested. The Father is the hidden God; He is the source. This is the meaning of the word father. One end of the Son is the Father, and the other end of the Father is the Son. When God is in heaven, He is the Father. When He walks on earth, He is the Son. One day, when He comes into man, He is the Holy Spirit. This is our God. He proceeds from the Father, passing through the Son, and becomes the Spirit. In John 14 the Lord Jesus said that His going is the Comforter's coming, and the Comforter's coming is His going. Not only was He dwelling among us; He wanted to dwell within us. The Son is the manifestation of God. His entry is the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is the entry of the Lord, God, and Christ. God was originally in heaven, and man was on earth; there was a great distance between the two. But through the Lord Jesus, man can now come to know God. However, although the Lord was among men, many did not know the Lord. This is why there is the need of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the entry of the Lord. Through the Holy Spirit, man can now know the Lord.</P><P>When I was in Hong Kong, someone asked me where Christ has gone according to Matthew. If we take the Gospel of Matthew to a place where people have never heard the gospel, they will never say that Christ has ascended to heaven. It is because Matthew never says this. This is the result of the teaching in Christianity.</P><P>Matthew did not mention the ascension of Christ. If it had twenty-nine chapters, it would have said that Christ has entered into us. His name is Emmanuel, which means God with us. How is He being with us? He is with us by being in us. This is what the Chinese mean by "the shadow following the person all the way."</P><P>To be saved is not merely to be delivered from perdition and death, and to be forgiven of our sins. These are the necessary results of salvation, but they are not the center of salvation. The center of salvation is God working Himself into man. Salvation cannot be separated from the Savior. Suppose someone gives you a gift. It is wrong to accept the gift while rejecting the giver of the gift.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GRACE BEING GOD GAINED AND EXPERIENCED BY US</H2><P>Many people talk much about God's grace. They think that making a fortune, having good children, and being free from calamities is God's grace. But the Gospel of John tells us that grace comes from Jesus. What did Jesus give to us? Did He give us money, houses, or palaces? The apostle Paul counted these things as dung. If you give dung to me, I will consider this an insult to me. God has given us Christ. Grace and truth are simply God Himself. If one day your son has died, or you have gone bankrupt in your business, yet you have an unspeakable power within you to allow you to say "hallelujah," that is God's grace. A man experiences grace in sufferings. It is not while we possess riches and houses that the Lord's grace is sufficient for us. It is while we suffer losses and are sick that the Lord's grace is sufficient for us. Health and children are not grace. Grace is when we experience and gain the Lord in adverse circumstances.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SPIRITUAL WORK BEING THE TRANSFORMATION<br>OF GOD'S LIFE WITHIN MAN</H2><P>A few years ago, I heard others speaking about the smooth stones David used in his fight with Goliath. They said that God's intention is for us to be the smooth stones. I have heard this kind of message before, and I have even preached such messages myself. But today, I have to say that this kind of teaching is nonsense. God has no intention for us to be smooth stones. His intention is to transform us. Suppose a few people meet together in a new place. At the beginning they are all hot in their tempers, and they often rub against each other. Gradually, as time goes on, they become "smooth." After a few years, when they meet together, they may still say things that offend one another. But they do not argue any longer. When the time comes for them to express their views, they may even agree fully with their mouths. But this is just to be outwardly refined. God has no intention for us to be "smooth." His intention is to work Himself into us. He is only doing one thing. He does not correct your mistakes, and He is not taking away your temper; He is only adding Himself into you.</P><P>Four or five years ago, I suffered great trials. For about two and a half years I had to lie on my bed to rest. At the beginning I thought that I had done something wrong, and I began to confess my sins in a thorough way. I thought that after I had confessed all my sins, God would heal me. I held to God's word in Psalm 103:3, which says, "Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases." I thought it was first the forgiving of the iniquities, and then the healing of my sickness, and for that reason I did my best to confess my sins. But the more I confessed, the more serious my illness became. Up to a point, I became tired of confession; yet I felt bad if I did not confess. After a long period of time, I gradually came to realize that God does not punish our mistakes with chastisements. Although I did not have much wrong, neither did I have much God. During those two years, God showed me that His purpose is to work Himself into me.</P><P>Suppose an opium smoker comes to us. How should we exhort him to believe in the Lord? Should we first ask him to stop taking opium before he can believe in the Lord? Surely we do not do this. We would surely exhort him first to believe in the Lord Jesus, and then the opium will automatically leave him. His problem is not the presence of opium, but the absence of God. When a man has God, he has life, and the law of life will chase out the opium. To exhort men to rid themselves of opium is the work of the anti-opium societies. Our work is to put God into people. If someone asks you if he can drink the water from the gutter, you do not have to tell him whether he can drink it. You only need to tell him to taste it a little. True spiritual work is not outward improvements, but an inward change in life. The work of life is a work of metabolism. God is not removing your sharp corners from within you, nor is He trying to make you a smooth stone; He is changing the stones into pearls.</P><P>Brother Mak can put on all kinds of clothing. He can put on a beggar's clothing, or he can put on a very nice suit. But Brother Mak is still Brother Mak; he does not change merely by changing his outward clothing. You may lose your temper at home, or you may be smiling and rejoicing at home. You may improve a little or worsen a little. But you are still you. Basically, your person has not changed, and your nature has not changed.</P><P>Once a man had a dream. In his dream he saw a worker of the Lord cutting hair for others. After he woke up from the dream, he interpreted his own dream and told others that his dream is a picture of the preachers' work today. Their work is to cut others' hair and shave others' faces. If someone is getting married, they would exhort the wife to be submissive and the husband to love. This kind of outward work is like cutting people's hair. After they cut it once, the hair will grow back after a while. This kind of preaching is doomed to fail.</P><P>No matter how much you grind a stone, it will still be a stone; its elements will not change. God's work is to produce an organic process in the stone, so that not only are the corners removed, but its nature is changed, and the stone is changed to pearl.</P><P>God has no intention that you merely preach the gospel or manage a church. God's intention is to work Himself into you through your preaching of the gospel and your managing of the church. His intention is to make Himself your inward elements. God is wise. By doing this, He kills two birds with one stone. On the one hand, He can accomplish the work, spread the gospel, and take care of the church through you. At the same time, through these works, He can have Himself added into you. God has no intention to correct your mistakes. His only intention is to work Himself into you and to fill you up, so that day by day and year by year He would become ripened within you.</P><P>I hope that you will not take my words as a mere teaching. I am showing you something here. I am pointing out to you a way. I do not expect these words to give you some excitement or stimulation. I only hope that those who have a heart for the Lord would receive the blessing here.</P><P>Prayer: Lord, we look to You from the depths of our being. Be merciful to us, that we would touch You from our depths. Work in man's heart, and accomplish what man cannot accomplish. We cannot enter into man's heart. Only You can enter man's heart and accomplish what You are after.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHURCH</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (4)</H1><p>Date:Morning, January 13, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</p><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>REMOVING THE VEIL AND HAVING A PURE HEART</H2><P>The veil mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3 refers to anything that hinders us from seeing the glory of the Lord. Anything that frustrates us from beholding the glory of the Lord is in principle a veil. Our husbands, wives, children, fame, the world, and riches can all become veils. Anything that causes us not to see the Lord's glory is a veil. To turn our hearts to the Lord means to have a pure heart for the Lord; only people with such a heart do not have veils. The Lord says that the pure in heart are blessed, for they shall see God (Matt. 5:8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WORK OF LIFE</H2><P>The Christian living and work issue from life. An artificial flower looks much the same as a real flower. But the artificial flower cannot withstand the scorching of the sun or the beating down of the rain, whereas a real flower can withstand them. If a Christian's living and work do not issue from life, they are like artificial flowers and will not be of much use.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>There are four categories of work in Shanghai. The first is the gospel work, the second is the children's work, the third is migration, and the fourth is the work of visitation.</P><P>Brother Sparks emphasizes a personal ministry today. But our work today is to maintain a testimony of the church, which is why we have to build up everything at the same time.</P><P>The co-workers should do their best to transfer the work to the local brothers and sisters. Our work should produce more apprentices, instead of just producing the products.</P><P>In the coming days, we need to put out three kinds of hymnals. The first is the general hymnal, which only Brother Nee himself can be responsible for. The second is the gospel songs, which I will be responsible for. The third is the children's songs, which Sister Ruth Lee and others will be responsible for.</P><P>There is one kind of work which only Brother Nee can do, and for which no other person can substitute for him.</P><P>In the future, the work in central China and southern China should have more fellowship.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S CENTRAL WORK</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONFERENCE (6)</H1><p>Date:Evening, January 13, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</p><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:19b, 20</H1><P>Prayer: May the Lord prevent anyone from having a wrong understanding of these messages. If anyone is to understand these messages, may their understanding be correct. For this we need the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S CENTRAL WORK&#151;<br>WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</H2><P>Ephesians 3:19 speaks of the fullness of God. This fullness is the content. God's intention is to fill us with this content. Verse 20 shows us how God accomplishes this, that is, how He fills us with His fullness. The main work of God today is to work Himself into man. Unless our living, our walk, and our work are linked up with God's center, they will all pass away. Even the so-called blessings and peace will pass away. The only thing that will remain is God's work within us. I know that many will think that I am saying the wrong thing, and I know that many will misunderstand my words. But if a man loves the Lord with a pure heart, he will see the revelation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S WORK IN TIME<br>BEING TO WORK HIMSELF INTO MAN</H2><P>Everything that does not belong to God Himself, even if it has been created by Him, will all pass away. The heavens, the earth, and all things, even we ourselves, will all pass away, because the heavens, the earth, and all things, including ourselves, are not God Himself. That is why they will all pass away. No matter how good you are, and how nice and how clean you look, all these things will pass away. Of course, humanly speaking, it is always better to do good than to do evil. But the good and evil that come from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are the same before God. Everything that is not of God will pass away. The Chinese have a saying, "Humility brings profit, while arrogance brings loss." But both of these things will also pass away. Today, we are not evaluating matters from a temporary point of view. Rather, we are evaluating matters from an eternal point of view. Many things may appear to be good in time, but they cannot endure for eternity. Good is something that exists in time; it cannot be brought into eternity. To do good is the goal of those in the world, but a Christian's goal belongs to eternity. In eternity, there are only things that belong to God. Only God's things are eternal. It is true that God's things pass through time, yet they proceed from eternity and extend through eternity. Everything that God accomplishes in time and in the world is for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose, which is to work Himself into man. Only when God is worked into man can God's eternal purpose be fulfilled. God passes through time in order that He can work Himself into man, that is, in order for Him to mingle Himself into man.</P><P>For a man to do good apart from God is as worthless as it is for him to commit sin apart from God. Of course, within the span of time, all virtues are better than evil. But in eternity, both are worthless. Time is in God's hand, and God puts the man He gained into this "furnace" with the purpose of working Himself into man, so that man can be in God and God can be in man. A glazed vessel must go through the firing in a furnace before the flowers painted on it can become one with the vessel. After the vessel has been fired, the flowers and the vessel can never again be separated. If the vessel breaks, the flowers on it will also break. God's intention today is to fill our inclinations and our character with God's nature and character. In the end, God will become our content, and His fullness will be mingled with us. God's life will have a "chemical reaction" with our life. This is God's work all the way from the beginning to the end. His purpose is for man to be like Him. He has no intention to merely improve us a little. This is man's natural concept. The human ethical mind thinks that all a person needs to do is to change the wrongs and make them right. But God's thought is not concerning good and evil, but concerning His working Himself into us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE BEING<br>GOD'S WORKING HIMSELF INTO US</H2><P>A Christian should not think that as long as something is good, he can do it, and that as long as something is not good, he should not do it. God does not care for right or wrong. What He cares for is to work Himself into us through the things that we encounter.</P><P>We can consider the experience of Jacob. He passed through many experiences from his youth to his old age. He did many evil things; he deceived his father, his father-in-law, his brother, and his wives. After so much experience and so many dealings from the Lord, we can say that there were not many things in his life that he had done right. Nearly everything he did was wrong. But the one precious thing is that God had worked Himself into Jacob. This is why in his old age his name was changed to Israel. By that time, he was no longer a man only, but a man filled with God. He became the prince of God, God's Israel. Maturity is not to change from being an evil man to being a good man. It is to be filled with God through His many and prolonged dealings.</P><P>Today the material, the method, the goal, and the power of our work is simply God Himself. If a carpenter makes a table and it is short of a leg, he would not use his own leg to be the material. But when God created man, He used Himself as the material. When God gives you power, He is actually giving you Himself. Power is simply God Himself. The material with which God works is simply God Himself. Suppose you do not have love, and you ask God for love. He does not give you a bag of love. Rather, He gives you Himself. Many people pray to God like beggars begging money from a rich man. When they have the money, they turn away from the giver. Many people think that once they have the love and the power, they can put God aside. We have to realize that love, humility, patience, and holiness are all God Himself. Anyone who does not allow God to work in him will not have lasting humility. Perhaps he has a temporal humility, but it is not an eternal humility. All the spiritual virtues, such as faith, love, and holiness, are simply God Himself. The same is true with prayer. Only when a man allows God to work Himself into him will he have real prayers. All the virtues, love, and goodness are not individual items of things. When God comes in and comes out of a man, that is love, that is goodness, and that is virtue. What is faith? Some say that faith is just to believe in God's word and His promises. But I have to tell you that faith is simply God Himself. When God comes in and out of you, that is faith. What is patience? When God comes in and out of you, that is patience. What is prayer? Many people say that prayer is to talk to God. But the real prayer is for God to come in and out of us. Our real prayer is one that allows God to pass through us. All those who do not allow God to pass through them do not have genuine, worthwhile prayer. What then is real prayer? Real prayer is simply God praying to God. Andrew Murray said that real prayer is the Christ in us praying to the Christ on the throne. This means that the God in you prays to the God in the heavens. Real spiritual power is a matter of God passing through us. His passing through is the power. The wife's submission, the husband's love, and all other virtues are a matter of God passing through us. This passing through will fill us with God's fullness, and in the end God will become our content.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, I can tell you that there are many people who know the Bible and who understand its teachings. But there are few people who have God's fullness in their mind, their character, and their nature. The way many people understand the teachings of the Bible is like wearing gold rings on their fingers without having gold in their heart. You may be serving God, building up churches, helping the brothers and sisters, and bearing some responsibilities in the church. But the key to all these works is to allow God to work Himself into you. When a man builds a chapel, he needs to use many kinds of materials, such as bricks, stone, and iron. Today, we are building the church of God. As such, the material must be God Himself.</P><P>Many times we hear people say, "So-and-so is a good brother. He loves his wife, and he is never angry with her." I would say, "Oh, no! I am afraid that this brother has never allowed God to pass through his love toward his wife. He may never have lost his temper with his wife, but God's element has not increased in him either." After a brother has been saved for five years, if he grows spiritually, it would be like building a wall two feet high. If he continues to allow God to pass through him, the wall will become four feet high. But if he only exercises himself to be a good man, it would be like adding more mud beside the two-foot wall. The wall will become thicker, but it will not become higher.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WORK OF LIFE</H2><P>After a brother is saved, he may become clearer concerning all kinds of scriptural knowledge from Genesis to Revelation. He may be able to compose better prayers, and his prayers may begin to sound very nice. Actually, these are all mud; they are all put onto the side of the wall and are not added on top of the wall. These are works of men. Because of this, after five years, the wall will remain two feet high, and God's life will not have grown in that brother.</P><P>On the other hand, suppose this brother beats his wife at home. What should we say to him? When many pastors, elders, and workers hear this, they will probably pray for this brother in private, and they will discuss how they should help him to read Ephesians 5. After this they may pray together, saying, "Lord, we are going to visit this brother. Please go with us, and make this brother open to our exhortations." Later they may go to this brother's house, and they may say, "You are wrong as a husband." They may also say to the wife, "You are also wrong as a wife." After much speaking, the brother may confess that he is wrong, and he may agree that he will no longer lose his temper with his wife. The preacher may go on, praying, "Thank the Lord. This brother is now open to our exhortation. We now commit him to the Lord's hand, and we pray that the Lord will cause him not to lose his temper anymore." Outwardly speaking, this way seems to work. But actually, what they are doing is but the work of a barber. They may cut a person's hair today, but soon afterward, that person's hair will grow back, and they will have to give him another haircut. This is the work of Confucius' disciples. This kind of teaching is the teaching of the Chinese ethical classics. No wonder when Christianity came to China, the disciples of Confucius said that Confucius' teachings are much better than those of this foreign religion. Therefore, if we take the Bible as a means for teaching others or improving others, we are taking the Bible as mere teachings only.</P><P>A wife once came to me and said, "My husband beats me. Don't you know that he is your brother? Your brother always loses his temper at home." She went on with tears, "Yesterday he beat me again." What should I do? Ordinarily, when a man hears such a word, he would go to exhort the husband, with the hope that the husband would change his ways. You may say, "If I do not exhort him to change his ways, what should I ask him to do?" You can only do such a thing because you are a person who is given to exhorting others and helping others to improve themselves. This is all you can do. If you do not do this, you will be out of a job. Please do not misunderstand me. Although I will pray for such a husband, my prayer will be different from your prayer. If this brother comes to me, I will say to him, "How do you feel when you beat your wife?" He may say, "After I beat my wife, I feel terrible inside for a week." I will then tell him, "If you feel that you will feel comfortable inside by beating your wife, you can go ahead and beat her some more." I will not tell him not to beat his wife. Instead, I will ask him how he feels inside. If this brother is touched by God, he will feel deep within that he has offended God.</P><P>You can teach others from the Bible, and you can exhort others with your theology. But if you do this, you are not the disciple of Christ; you are the disciple of Confucius instead. By so doing, you will never convey God's life to people. This is a pitiful work.</P><P>If you buy a pen and a piece of paper, you can draw a beautiful chrysanthemum flower. But if I take a chrysanthemum seed, plant it in the ground, water it regularly, and then go to sleep, soon what the chrysanthemum seed produces will be more beautiful than what I draw on the paper. Today, our work is not to teach others according to the Bible, but to plant God's life contained in the Bible into others. The material, goal, and design of God's work are simply God Himself, and this work is to work God into us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD AND MAN MINGLED AS ONE</H2><P>Do you want to know how to be a real husband or wife? The way to be a real husband is not to be a husband. The real way to be a wife is not to be a wife. Do not think that loving your husband means to do many things for him. To love your husband does not mean that you buy some fabric and make some clothing for him. The real love is for you not to do anything and for God to do everything. God is not doing many things for man; He is working Himself into man. The reason God was incarnated was to put Himself into man. This is real love. The real love is for you not to be yourself, but to be the other party. The highest point of God's love is for Him to lay aside Himself; He would no longer be God. Instead, He would be a man and be the same as man.</P><P>Today we have to pray, "God, although I am a man, I would give up being a man. Hallelujah! I will accept You and allow You to work Yourself into me." This is the sweetest thought. In eternity God will say, "O man, you have God's nature," while you can say, "O God, the majestic God, You also have our nature, the human nature." This is the picture in eternity. Christ bears our human nature. In heaven He is God, yet He still bears our human nature. What is His work today? It is to work Himself into man. One day, when eternity comes, man will say joyfully, "God is like man," and God will say joyfully, "Man is like God."</P><P>In Shanghai I met a couple who had been married for many years. The two were similar in their minds and in the way they thought and acted. They had loved each other for many years. As a result, the male was like the female, and the female was like the male. Why were they so similar? It is because the male no longer lived as the male, and the female no longer lived as the female. The male lived as the female, and the female lived as the male. In the end, the two had become more or less the same. This is the relationship between God and man. God is our spiritual Husband. Because He loves us, He lives in the likeness of a man. If we love God, we should also live in the likeness of God. In the end, God will be in man, and man will be in God.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>HOW TO FOLLOW THE INNER LEADING</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONFERENCE (7)</H1><p>Date:Evening, January 14, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</p><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:6; 1 John 3:19-21; 2 Cor. 3:16; Matt. 5:8; 6:21-23</H1><P>Prayer: May the Lord give us the light not only while we are listening, but may the light be as the dawning of the day that shines more and more unto the perfect day. Raise up a group of people who would be touched by You in a genuine way, and whose hearts are genuinely opened up by You. Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SENSE IN THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Tonight we want to consider how we can follow the inner leading. This way appears to be a simple one. In our experience we all know that the Lord lives in us. The result of our going along with the operation of the Spirit of life is surely peace. Romans 8:6 tells us that to walk according to spirit is life and peace. If you ask me what it is to walk according to spirit, I will tell you that to walk according to spirit is to follow the peace within. If you have peace, you can go on, and if you do not have peace, you should stop. If you truly love the Lord and are willing to cooperate with Him, you have to take care of the peace within. When you feel peaceful inside, you can go on. When you do not feel peaceful inside, you should stop.</P><P>To be a Christian is not a question of mental exercise and analyzing in the mind; it is a question of the peace within and of the sense in our spirit. This is to follow the Lord. If we want to follow the Lord, we have to follow the sense He gives to us in our spirit.</P><P>A co-worker sister once went to a fabric store to buy some fabric. She saw some bargain items in the store. On the one hand, she felt within her that she should not buy the fabric. But on the other hand, she felt that the bargain was too good to miss. She went along with her mind and bought the fabric. When she returned home, she was bothered within and could not fellowship with the Lord, nor read the Bible or pray properly. Later, a brother needed that piece of fabric, and the sister sold it to him and spent the money. Her peace then came back. Hence, we should not analyze with our mind. Only the sense in our spirit is trustworthy.</P><P>Once a child dipped his rice dumpling into salt instead of sugar. His eyes may not have been very discerning, but when he took the dumpling, his feeling within told him that it was salt. We should walk according to the operation of the Lord's life within us. The mind expresses itself in analyzing, reasoning, and studying. A Christian who is in his mind is one who remains in the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The sense in our spirit is very sensitive, and we have to walk according to this inner sense. The source of this inner sense is the tree of life. The tree of life is very simple; it does not require us to think or to analyze. Nothing can be more simple than the tree of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S WILL NOT BEING DETERMINED<br>BY SUCCESS OR FAILURE,<br>GOOD OR BAD ENVIRONMENTS</H2><P>The result of following the Lord's leading may not be success in our work. God's work in us will not necessarily cause us to succeed in what we do. What He is doing is to work Himself into us through the many things. In order to work Himself into us, He may cause us to suffer many blows and to encounter many hardships. When these things come upon us, they may cause us to doubt Him. But God leads us this way in order that we would submit to Him.</P><P>When a piece of porcelain is being fired in the furnace, if it could speak, it would surely say that it is in the wrong place. Actually, to be in the furnace is the porcelain's fate. God does not necessarily lead believers into successes. Of course, He has no intention to lead them to failures either. What He is doing is to work Himself into them through all kinds of environments.</P><P>Suppose a brother and a sister are preparing to be engaged. The more they pray, the more they are clear that they should be engaged. When they do become engaged, they feel strongly that they have the Lord's leading to do it. Later they are married. After their marriage, they begin to find out many shortcomings in each other. By that time, they may think that their initial leading was wrong. But we have to realize that God's leading is to cause us to gain God, not to gain a wife. One day, when the brother learns this lesson, he will praise God when he looks at his wife, not because his wife is good, but because he will have gained God.</P><P>A brother may feel led to start a business. While he is praying, he may feel the Lord's leading in the matter. But when he is engaged in the business, he may suffer great loss. By that time, he may think that his initial leading was wrong. Man considers something as God's will or not God's will by the success of that matter. But God's intention is to work Himself into us. In the first two centuries, it cost a person much to be a Christian; there was no outward peace. But the Christians at that time did not count it a loss to sacrifice their lives. When we read church history, we realize that some people even prayed for an opportunity to be martyred.</P><P>Many people cannot be clear about God's leading because they take their own self as the goal. If we take God as our goal, He will surely give us the proper leading. Many people walk according to their inner sense, but they end up encountering failures. They may think that the leading they have received is wrong. But as long as our walking according to the inner sense draws us closer to God and to love Him more, our sense is right. God's leading is to give us peace. Although outwardly there may be sufferings and darkness, these do not mean that we are not walking according to God's leading. All successes, failures, sweet experiences, and bitter experiences are for the accomplishment of God's goal, which is to work Himself into us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GUARDING AGAINST<br>COUNTERFEIT PEACE IN THE MIND</H2><P>In order for us to be a Christian who lives according to the peace within, we have to realize that the greatest enemy is our mind. Suppose something ought not to be done. But in order to go ahead and do it in peace, we give all kinds of explanations and reasonings. This kind of peace is not a natural one. When a Bible is laid flat on the table, it is level. When a person puts something under it, it will still remain level and will not fall. But this is not a natural peace. Rather, it is an artificial peace. The minute we fall into our mind, we will lose our fellowship with God. We can go against anything, but we can never afford to be cut off from our fellowship with God. Many sisters' dresses give them no peace. However, they find many excuses in their mind. This kind of peace is man-made. When is God glorified in us? It is when God is expressed from us that He is glorified. Anything great or small, as long as we do not have the peace within, we should not do it. Before the Lord, we should only walk according to the inner sense. If we do this, day by day God's content and His fullness will fill us up, and we will have God's nature within and His image without. If we do not have peace within, we should not do anything, however good or beneficial such a thing may be. A Christian is a person who has forsaken the world. He is one who has forsaken any kind of profit as his goal and has taken up Christ as his goal. He should be one who seeks after Christ Himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DEALING WITH THE CONSCIENCE</H2><P>The growth of a Christian depends on his dealing with his conscience. In one's pursuit of the Lord, if he does not take care of his conscience, he will never grow.</P><P>A man may have been saved last night. He may be sitting on a chair today. If half of the money that went into the purchase of that chair was stolen from others, this person will surely not have peace. This means that after a person is saved, he will be enlightened, and his conscience will show him that what he did before was wrong and unrighteous. His conscience will require him to return that half of the money to others. We have to learn to deal with our conscience to the extent that our conscience becomes blameless. If a person has not taken care of his conscience to such an extent, he may be reading his Bible, meeting, and praying all year round, yet he will not grow.</P><P>Today, there are many saved ones, but there are few grown-up ones. The reason for this is that among the saved ones, very few are willing to deal with their conscience. It is true that after we have believed in the Lord, the blood cleanses us from our sins, and the Lord's grace is sufficient for us. But if we want to know the Lord's way within us, we must take care of our conscience. Otherwise, we will not grow before the Lord. We must not do anything that the conscience condemns. Anything that should be dropped must be dropped. If a man does not deal with his conscience, it is useless to talk to such a one about spiritual matters. Although the dealing with the conscience cannot be considered as something directly spiritual, it is a bridge to the spiritual matters. Brothers and sisters, has your conscience been examined? Today, many people hush their conscience and suppress it. They come to listen to messages, to act like Christians, to read the Bible, and to pray, but they are the same all year round. We must allow our conscience to condemn us, to speak to us. Only those who go along with their conscience will receive the blessing. If we do not deal with the things which our conscience condemns us of, we will lose all spiritual light.</P><P>If a man wants to pursue the Lord, he has to deal with his conscience in a serious way. After I was saved, for a period of three to four years the Lord was teaching me this lesson, and I had to deal severely with my conscience. Once I was staying in a room with another brother. While I was washing my face, a drop of water fell on his bed, and my conscience was bothered. When that brother returned home, I made a confession to him. He told me that it was all right. Not long after this, I stepped on his sheet with my feet, and I had to make another confession to him. Still some time afterwards, I dropped his pencil on the floor, and I had to make another confession. Within one day, I found myself confessing to him quite a few times.</P><P>Perhaps you will think that these are small things and that they do not matter much. But to my conscience, they were great matters. I really wished that I did not have to stay in the same room that he did. But both of us were guests there, and there was no way that we could stay in separate rooms. Later, that brother realized that it was too troublesome for me to make confessions to him all the time, and he said, "The worst kind of people do not confess their mistakes. The best kind of people have no mistakes to confess. Those who are neither good nor bad make confessions all the time." At that time, I thought that I would never be the worst kind, and I could not be the best kind; I always made mistakes, and therefore I had to make confessions all the time. Now I can laugh at what I did. But at that time, I could not laugh.</P><P>Many people's consciences are like the soles of those who walk around barefoot; their soles have become thickened and have lost all feelings. Although their consciences have not died, they have lost all feelings. A good Christian and one who is really growing is one who takes care of his conscience. I am afraid many people cannot withstand the examination of their conscience today. Can you say that your conscience is blameless before God and men? Can you say that your bank account, your houses, your clothing, and everything in your houses are clean and righteous? I am afraid that many things are unrighteous in nature. It is true that your record of sin before God has been erased by the precious blood of Christ. But in your home you may still have many evidences of sins. It is like a man who has committed a murder; his case may have been cleared in the court, but the corpse may still be at his house. No other way is as serious and clear as the way of following the Lord. The question is whether or not we are willing to pay the price. Zeal is useless, and listening to messages and attending services are useless. The question is whether or not we are willing to pay the price to follow the Lord.</P><P>In Chefoo some criticized my speaking. I told the criticizing ones that unless every dollar of theirs has been measured by God, they are not qualified to criticize me. I know what I am speaking about. In the first fall, man fell from God's direct rule to the conscience's rule. Later he fell from the conscience's rule to the human rule. It was because the conscience could no longer rule over the people that they needed others to rule over them. Before man fell, God ruled over man. After the fall, the conscience ruled over man. Still later, the conscience could no longer rule over man, and others had to rule over him. Today, if a Christian needs the government, the court, any institution, school, or his family to rule over him, it proves that he is still deep in the fall. If a wife or a son needs someone else to rule over him or her, it proves that he or she is deep in the fall. The conscience can no longer rule over such a one, and God can no longer rule over such a one. This is why there is the need for someone else to rule over them. The steps of man's fall are these: from God's rule to the conscience's rule, and from the conscience's rule to man's rule. Finally, it becomes self-rule. If a place does not have any law or police, that place will surely be full of robbers and criminals. We should find our way back to God through the recovery of the feeling in our conscience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HEART TURNING TO THE LORD</H2><P>Let me ask the brothers and sisters: Is the light within you bright today? Whether or not the light within us is bright depends on whether or not we love the Lord. Second Corinthians 3 says that whenever our hearts are turned to the Lord, the veil is taken away. Those whose hearts are for the Lord and who desire the Lord will see the light. If a man does not have light, it is because his heart is not turned to the Lord. Matthew says that the pure in heart are blessed, for they shall see God. Only those who are after the Lord with a single heart will see Him. God is light. Matthew 6 says that where our treasure is, there our heart is also. Whatever our hearts are inclined toward, that is where our hearts will be. If our hearts are right, we will see the light. Do you love the Lord? If you love the Lord and your heart is turned to Him, you will surely have light within, and you will surely be clear. Whenever a feeling comes along to urge you to deal with something, you will surely do it. As a result, you will be able to live in the Lord.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S ULTIMATE GOAL AND<br>HIS PRESENT NEED</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (5)</H1><p>Date:Morning, January 15, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</p><P>Prayer: May the Lord cause us to speak the things that we ought to speak, and may You cause the listeners to hear what they ought to hear. We confess that we are not godly enough and do not have the adequate knowledge. We need You to open up our eyes within. Every time we come together, we need Your precious blood to cleanse us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BASIC PROBLEM</H2><P>We may be a proper Christian, and we may manage a church well, but this is not enough to meet the need of this age. We need to understand our basic problem before we can consider the question of methodology. What God wants to do is to work Himself into us. There is no problem with God in this matter. But with man there is a big problem.</P><P>If we want to put water into a bottle, we can do it any time. We do not have to preach to the bottle or have the bottle's consent. But man is not so simple; he is living. I do not know how many people there are who are willing to be filled with God as a result of these few evenings' meetings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF GOD'S SALVATION&#151;<br>WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</H2><P>The man whom God wants to gain is a person fully endowed with a free will. God's mind is higher than man's mind. But man's mind is nevertheless very complicated. In addition, he is full of emotion. For this reason, if man wants to be filled, his will must first be put under subjection. It is hard to chop a piece of wood with uneven grain because it is too complicated. Only wood with even grain is good for chopping. God picked up us, the complicated pieces of wood, for the purpose of manifesting His power. He is able to clear up and to subdue our will and emotion. Although God has redeemed us, has given us eternal life and the forgiveness of sins, and has lived inside of us, His ultimate purpose is to work Himself into us. God's ultimate work is to have the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is made of gold, precious stones, and pearls. In it are the throne of God, His light, and the river of water of life with the tree of life, and so forth. Gold signifies the divine nature, and pearl signifies the result of the transformation of God's life within man. The precious stones speak of the glory as a result of the work of God. The tree of life, the water of life, and the fruit of life all refer to God Himself. God's masterpiece is the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is God with man. Everything else will pass away, and the heavens and the earth will be burned. Everything apart from God cannot be joined to God. Only that which comes out of God can be joined to God. Our eyes need to be opened, and we need a deliverance. Once we see this matter, we will no longer do what we did before.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EVERYTHING NOT OF GOD'S LIFE BEING BURNED</H2><P>Genesis 2 is a picture. There we see the river of life. In chapter three we see the river of fire. The flame signifies God's holiness, and the sword signifies God's righteousness. As far as God's holiness and righteousness are concerned, we should die. All those who will not allow the river of life to flow through them will have the river of fire flowing through them. Everything that will not give way to the flow of the river of life will eventually pass through the burning of the river of fire. A Christian's life, work, family, and business must all be put under the river of life. In the Bible, many places mention fire. Some people have told us that when the atomic bomb was dropped in Hiroshima, Japan, even the iron and steel were melted. Today, God's river of fire of judgment will melt away anything that is not of Himself. Only by allowing the river of life to flow through us will there be the gold, the pearl, and the precious stones. Otherwise, everything else is wood, grass, stubble, and dung. Not only will our work pass away; even God's own heaven and earth will be burned one day. Of course, our own work, those things that do not belong to God, will be burned away also. Only God's life will remain forever. Everything that is not of life will be burned. Although these things may be created by God, they do not have the life of God. As such, they will be burned away also.</P><P>A carpenter takes a piece of wood and makes a beautiful table out of it. The table is placed in the sitting room, and the remaining chaff and odd pieces are taken to the stove in the kitchen. The stove represents the lake of fire. At the end of Revelation, on the one hand, there is the city of water. On the other hand, there is the lake of fire. The city of water signifies God's life and His holiness. The lake of fire signifies God's righteousness. God's glory speaks of God Himself, whereas God's holiness tells us that everything not of God and not according to His nature will be thrown into the lake of fire. This is our basic problem. We may do the right things and may manage the church well. But these things are not the gold, the pearl, and the precious stones, because God's life has not passed through these things. The fire does not remove defilements; it only removes that which is not holy, and that which does not belong to God.</P><P>God's fire not only burns away everything bad; it also burns away everything that is not according to God's nature. In man's mind, there is only good and bad. When a house is burned, no matter how beautiful the wood outside looks, it will all be burned away. The only thing that will be left will be the steel and the concrete. The fire separates and tests things out. Everything that is not of God, no matter how good it is, will be burned away. Wood is very good, but it will be burned away. I do not know if you can take my words. If you can take them, your whole being will be turned, and you will not dare to walk according to your own will any longer.</P><P>Suppose I am about to visit a person. I should not ask if this is God's will and if I should do it. Rather, I should ask if God is going with me. What we are afraid of is not doing the wrong thing, but doing things apart from God. If we have God with us, not only will we do the right thing, but God will pass through us. Formerly, our only fear was that we would do the wrong thing. Today, our fear is that we would do things by ourselves. Even if what we do is right outwardly, as long as there is the self-element, we will not please God. The real work is one in which God works alongside of us. Everything that comes out of the mind and the will are rejected by God. God only wants something that comes out of Himself.</P><P>Today, between the river of water and the river of fire, there is still a river of blood. What should have been consumed by the river of fire is merged into the river of water by passing through the river of blood. We have the river of blood to take care of everything that is of ourselves. On the one hand, we need to examine ourselves. On the other hand, after we have examined ourselves, we need to trust in the blood of the Lord. In this way, we will be saved from the river of fire into the river of water.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THREE PERIODS OF THE CHURCH OF CHRIST IN CHINA</H2><P>Christianity has been in China for over a hundred years. Of course, before that time there were the Nestorians in the Tang Dynasty, which cannot be considered as part of God's work. In the Ming Dynasty, the Catholics were here also, which also cannot be considered as part of God's work. The coming of Protestantism began with Robert Morrison, which began only a little over a hundred years ago. During these one hundred years or so, Christianity in China can be divided into three periods.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Period of the Gospel</H2><P>The first period is the period of the gospel, which lasted from the Ching Dynasty to the beginning of the Chinese Republic. During this period, the Western missionaries could only do some rudimentary works in China, such as running elementary schools in the villages. What they preached was at most Jesus as the Savior, and heaven and hell.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Period of Revival</H2><P>From the beginning of the Chinese Republic to the end of the Second World War, there was a period of twenty to thirty years. This was the revival period. The change from the previous period to this one can be likened to a change from an elementary school to a high school. Not only was there the gospel, but there were the revivals also. Many people began to live for the Lord and to be zealous for the gospel. In both northern and southern China, many people were raised up to work for the Lord. During this period, there were Dora Yu, Ding Li-mei, John Sung, and others. These revival meetings were widely publicized. From 1922 to 1941, many people lived for the Lord and consecrated themselves. Sister Pearl Wang, who is sitting among us today, was also an evangelist in 1925. All these were God's works. But the work of revival ceased by 1941.</P><P>Sister Pearl Wang interrupted: During 1940, I was working in Southeast Asia, and I felt something was wrong; I felt empty inside. All my past works became history behind me. Many places invited me to go at that time, but I felt that I could not meet the need. I had no assurance how I should help the believers, and I felt that I could not meet God's demand in this age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Period of Life</H2><P>Brother Lee continued: The third period is the period of life. God's work during this period is to deal with all the human elements and to remove them from our heart through the cross. Mrs. Penn-Lewis once said that spiritual experience is of three levels. The first is the level of salvation, the second is the level of revival, and the third is the level of the way of the cross. In principle, this corresponds to the three periods of the church in China. Of course, the third period includes the things covered in the first two periods, in the same way that the university includes the things covered in the elementary school and the high school. But the elementary school and the high school are not the goal; they are there to prepare a person to get into the goal, which is the university. We are not saying that we do not need the elementary school or even the kindergarten. But it is wrong to be running a kindergarten all the time. If a student remains in the kindergarten all the time, even up to twenty or thirty years of age, there is something wrong. Today, the revival movement is no longer so prevailing. Many revivalists have been put aside, or they have died. Throughout the ages, God never repeats His own work. It does not mean that the former works were not good; it merely means that they cannot meet the demand of this age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S PRESENT NEED&#151;A BODY TESTIMONY</H2><P>Today's need can no longer be met by revivals. Man's need today speaks of God's need. If all I have been speaking during the past seven nights were but revival messages, I believe the speaking would not satisfy men.</P><P>What is needed today is the work of a university. Of course, the elementary school and the high school are preparatory institutions. These preparatory institutions are there to prepare a person for the university. The so-called seminaries and revival conferences are but "crash courses"; it is difficult for those who graduate from "crash courses" to get into the universities. A high school is there only to meet the need of society; it is not the goal. Today, we do not preach the gospel to bring people to heaven. The gospel preaching is for a higher goal. As long as a man can breathe, he has to be a proper person. As long as he is a proper person, he has to love the Lord. But if a person only loves the Lord without living in life, this will not meet God's need. Today, God wants us to go into the university. The standard of this university is quite high. Although it is not the graduate school, its standard is still very high.</P><P>We must never despise God's spiritual blessings to China. Other than China and England, I am afraid there is no other country which has experienced so much of God's blessings. Even places like America and Denmark have to admit that God is blessing these two countries. May the Lord be merciful to us, that our work will match God's need in this age. I feel that the most shameful thing is to send a group of people to America to study in the seminaries and then through them to raise some funds for China. What China needs is not the U. S. dollars. What China needs is every drop of our spiritual blood. Today, we will never barter men's souls for U. S. dollars. During 1926 and 1927, there was a strong anti-Christian and anti-foreigner movement. Since that time, Chinese [indigenous] churches began to appear in China. They did a better work than the Western missionaries did. I am afraid that the influence of the U. S. dollars is a frustration to the work in China.</P><P>Today, in the third period, God does not need spiritual giants any longer. What He needs is the Body testimony. Today, we only need to be the members. A small member is a member, and a big member is also a member. No member can be the whole Body. When the whole church rises up to preach the gospel, others will only say it is the church that has saved them; they will not say that it is Dr. So-and-so who has saved them. Today, whether it is the gospel, the revival, or life, everything is for this goal. Today is not the time for the co-workers to serve the Lord by themselves, but the time for the whole church to rise up to serve Him together.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FREE FELLOWSHIP ON THE AFTERNOON<br>OF JANUARY 15&#151;<br>FOUR KINDS OF WORKERS</H2><P>Today there are four kinds of workers. The first are the co-workers who match the need of the ministry of God in the present age. This is a small group of people who have been dealt with by the Lord and who are in one accord. The second kind are the younger co-workers. They are willing to receive the direction and to come under the coordination of the older co-workers, and they are willing to follow and to learn in humility. The third kind are those who are unwilling to submit to the senior co-workers, who do not belong to the denominations, yet who are happy to remain in fellowship with us. The fourth kind are the preachers and free evangelists among the denominations. What we need today are the first and the second kind of co-workers.</P><P>When a co-worker is in a certain place, he has to cooperate with the local church in that place. The work and the church cannot be separated one from the other. When a co-worker is working in a certain place, he is at the same time one of the local brothers. When the church assigns work to the saints, the co-workers should stand on the same ground as the local brothers and should accept assignments in the same way.</P><P>Concerning the third and the fourth kind of co-workers, we can only let them choose their own pathway. With some people, God has not assigned them to take the same way as we do, and we dare not say anything to them. Whatever the situation may be, we are here to do the work that God has committed to us. We cannot interfere with others' work, and we are not here tearing down others' work.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING THE WAY OF LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>OPEN TALKS</H1><p>Date:Evening, January 15, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</p><P>Tonight, first of all, we will make an announcement regarding the nature of this meeting. In this meeting, we hope to discuss the problems we face in the way of life. On the one hand, we do not want to be loose; on the other hand, we do not want to be restricted. We will only talk about problems related to the way of life. Anything apart from the way of life will not be discussed here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LEADING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br>AND THE PROVISION IN THE ENVIRONMENT</H2><P>Question: I know that as long as I have the peace within, I can proceed with what I want to do. But do I also have to wait for the proper provision in the environment?</P><P>Brother Lee answered: Terms such as "provision in the environment" and the "leading of the Holy Spirit" have all been used in a loose way in Christianity. For this reason, we do not like to use these terms. Those who truly know God will not question about provisions in the environment. If there is a leading within them to do something, they can ignore all favorable or unfavorable environments. Sometimes a favorable environment will turn out to be a frustration to God's work. In the Bible, you find very few cases of people getting clear about God's will through going along with environmental provisions. The most important thing is the heart, and not the environment. God's leadings for Christians are all in the spirit. If a person is right before the Lord, almost everything he does is right.</P><P>From Paul's life we can see that his environments were mostly contradicting ones. In Acts 16, we see that he wanted to go to a certain place, but the Holy Spirit forbade him to do so. In his spirit he realized that it was God's forbidding. He did not act according to the provision in the environment, but according to the leading of the Holy Spirit. Do not think that God's leading will direct us to success. He is not for our being successful or failing. The main thing He is doing is to testify of Himself.</P><P>Sometimes we do not have to be too clear about anything. When we are too clear, we may end up being wrong. There was a brother who told me once that he had prayed and was clear that God wanted him to go home and give his wife a good beating. This kind of leading is not reliable.</P><P>The relationship between the leading of the Holy Spirit and the provision in the environment can be illustrated by the riding of a bicycle. On the one hand, we need to tread the pedal. On the other hand, we need the brake. We need to aggressively follow the leading of the Holy Spirit, but at the same time we also need to accept the limitations in the environment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PAYING THE PRICE TO DEAL WITH THE CONSCIENCE</H2><P>With some people, right after they are saved, they begin to deal with their conscience before God in a thorough way. I was saved in 1925. From 1932 to 1935, I learned to deal with my conscience in a severe way. During those few years, it seemed as if I learned no other lesson except to deal with my conscience. By 1935, I could say that my conscience was clean. If a man wants to go to a place by train, he has to buy his ticket at the station, and he has to board the train. If he does not buy his ticket and does not board the train, but instead walks day and night in the countryside, it will be difficult for him to arrive at his destination. In the same way, if a man wants to go on in God's way, he must obey the Lord. A person can preach the gospel, work, manage a church, and study the Bible, but if he does not obey the Lord, he has not taken a single step forward in God's way. If a person truly obeys the Lord, the Lord will give him feelings within. Once he deals with one feeling, a second feeling will come. What we need to find today is the way, and not the doctrine.</P><P>Let me ask if there are any among us here who have thoroughly dealt with their conscience. If there are, please raise up your hand. Today, there are many preachers, evangelists, and students of the Bible. But there are very few people who seriously deal with their conscience. Many Christians act according to the way their mind analyzes matters. If a thing suits their taste, they will accept it. If it does not suit their taste, they will reject it. But we have to learn to be a person who walks according to the inner feeling and the peace within. Only this kind of person will know God. Today, we have to be delivered from man's rule into God's rule. Ephesians 4:19 says that some have cast off all feelings. We cannot cast off our feelings. You can give me two billion dollars. But if my conscience will not give me peace about it, I would rather not take it.</P><P>A little chicken does not need us to help it to come out of its shell. If we try to help it, the little chicken will surely not survive well. Only those chickens that come out by themselves will be strong. Today, in order to follow the Lord we have to pay the price. It is difficult for those who will not pay the price to know God. What is it to pay the price? The real price is to cut off our heads. It does not take much of a price to listen to a message. The real price demands that we have our heads taken off. Today, we cannot know God with our head; we have to know Him with our heart. Suppose a child sits in the snow with no clothes on. Others may criticize and study how to clothe the child. But when the mother of the child sees the situation, she will run over and cover him with her own clothing. This is the difference between studying in the mind and paying the price in a real way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S CENTRAL WORK</H2><P>Today, we have to see what God's work is, and we have to know what is God's central work in man. We must be led to see the way to receive God's life. After we receive this life, we should know how to live in this life, so that God can have a way among us. This is God's central work.</P><P>Many people today like to be the peanut shells. Some are worse; they cannot even be compared to the peanut leaves. May the Lord be merciful to us that many of us would be raised up to be the peanut seeds who supply life to others. Only the peanut seeds will grow peanuts when they are planted in the earth. If a person plants the shell or the leaves in the earth, they will never bear peanuts. What we need today is not peripheral works, but God's central work.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOSPEL, REVIVAL, AND LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (6)</H1><P>Date:Morning, January 16, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><P>Prayer: May the Lord cause all of us to realize that spiritual matters are not loose or vague. May the Lord's word not only be spoken through man, but may every one of the words spoken be filled with light, and may they shine within man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WORK GOD IS AFTER TODAY</H2><P>Our need today is to do only the work that God wants us to do. This work includes three things: first is the preaching of the gospel, second is to lead the new believers, in particular, the young people, to love the Lord, and the third is to usher the saints into God's life and into the riches of His life. These three things need to be developed in a balanced way, and neither of the three should be given less emphasis than the others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Preaching of the Gospel</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Doing Our Best to Preach</H2><P>Concerning the preaching of the gospel, we have to do it frequently, do it well, do it in a widespread way, and do it in a weighty manner. If a church does not increase in number, it is because it has slackened in the matter of the preaching of the gospel. If the whole population in China does not produce any children in fifty years, we will not need foreigners to come in with the cannons and the gunboats to conquer us; we can give up our whole country that way. In the same way, if no new ones are added into the church in thirty years, the church can close its doors. The Lord's command is that we go to the whole world to preach the gospel. Many people want to imitate Madame Guyon, but they all end up being barren. Wherever there are "Madame Guyons," there must be the accompanying preaching of the gospel. If some are saved and they begin to love the Lord, we have to encourage them, and especially the young ones among them, to rise up to preach the gospel. Every church should saturate the city where it is with the gospel and should distribute gospel tracts to every household, every street, and every lane. It should send out gospel teams to spread the gospel in the open air and to put up gospel posters. All the schools, homes, and institutions should be filled with gospel posters, and we should all beget many spiritual children. It seems to me that Swatow has not come up with any spiritually distinguished ones yet. The brothers and sisters have all become set in their ways. Some have been cared for by others for ten years already, but they are still the same today as before. Today we should realize that the young ones have great potential. We have to encourage the young ones to rise up to preach the gospel. The more they beget, the better it is. Even if some new ones appear to be false ones, it is still all right. It is like a factory manufacturing goods; some products are of the top grade, whereas others are of a poorer grade. When the number of saved ones increases, some among them would surely not be that much up-to-standard. This is all right. It is always better for a family to beget children than to be barren. I myself had ten children. Three of them died, and seven are still left. Of course, in preaching the gospel and in begetting spiritual children, it is better that none die. But whatever a person does, if a church continues to have only a few dozen people meeting year after year for decades and there are no spiritual children produced, no matter how good its teachings are, it is not a normal church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Secret Being to Be Thick-skinned</H2><P>The secret to preaching the gospel is to be thick-skinned. In preaching the gospel, all we have to do is to go. There is no need to worry about whether or not we are in the flesh. If a sister would pass out tracts on the street, and while she is doing that, if she would kneel down on the sidewalk to pray, surely some will repent. A gospel preacher must be one who is full of emotion, who can cry, laugh, and jump. Dr. John Sung was a good example. Lot's daughters committed incest with their father and produced Moab and Ammon. Of course, this is a shameful thing. But we have to realize that even the flesh of the Lord Jesus has Moabite blood in it. Therefore, in preaching the gospel we do not have to analyze too much.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Not Being Selective about Whom to Preach To</H2><P>Once a person asked D. L. Moody if all saved ones were predestinated by God. Moody answered yes. That man then asked what would he do if a person who was not predestinated by God became saved through his preaching. Moody answered, "Dear brother, it does not matter. If a person is saved, surely he was predestinated by God already. All you have to do is to preach, and the predestinated ones will spontaneously be saved."</P><P>If a person is fleshly, he will be fleshly whether or not he preaches the gospel. If that is the case, it is better for him to preach than not to preach. If he preaches, at least God can use such a one to bring some to salvation. If among a thousand people who are saved, four hundred go back to their sins, still we have six hundred people left. The other four hundred may fall into sin, but they are at least saved. At any rate, if you do not save them, they would have been in their sins anyway. For this reason, we should not limit the gospel. In preaching the gospel, there is no need to exercise discernment; you only need to preach blindly. The management of the church, the care of business affairs, and the receiving of believers&#151;all these require the proper discernment. But in preaching the gospel, all we have to do is to preach. If a person casts his net into the sea and the fish come, all he has to do is to draw the net. A gospel preacher does not have to worry about too many things, and he cannot exercise too much discernment. Leave the discerning to the ones who are sorting the fish; the ones who are drawing the net do not need to exercise any discernment. Only the ones sorting the fish need to have the concern; the ones drawing the net need not have any concern.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Testimony in Chefoo<br>of the Church Preaching the Gospel</H2><P>In 1941, our number in Chefoo doubled within half a year. Every month some people were baptized. Of course, not every one of them was good, but we can say that most of them were good. In April, we had only about a hundred people. By the end of the year, we had about six hundred people. We printed two hundred thousand gospel tracts for the two hundred thousand people living in Chefoo. On every street we put up large posters. The brothers' and sisters' homes were filled with more posters. Some even rented wall spaces to put up posters. In the evening, some went out with lanterns, others with accordions in their arms, to preach the gospel in coordination. Some would sing, while others would pass out gospel tracts. Some even knelt by the sidewalk to preach the gospel. During the last few days of the Chinese calendar year, the whole church would fast and pray. In 1943, within a few days twelve hundred people were saved. All the brothers and sisters offered up their possessions, houses, and even land deeds. From January 1, the whole church rose up to preach the gospel, and at least eighty percent of the saints were mobilized. None of them would celebrate the New Year. Some would pray, while others would go out to invite friends. Every year, we had at least a few hundred saved this way, and among them at least a hundred would be baptized. After baptism we would distribute the names of the new ones to the brothers and sisters and ask them to go to visit these new ones. After the visitations, the saints would come back and report to us about the new ones' conditions. Every year we sowed the seed at the beginning of the year, after which we began to reap, and the reaping continued until the fall season. The Chinese celebrate their New Year by having fellowship with demons; during the New Year, they put out idols and worship them. When we preached the gospel during the New Year, we had to fight a spiritual battle with the devil. The people in the world indulged themselves in eating and drinking during the New Year, but our brothers and sisters only took simple meals. Later, after the Communists took over Chefoo, our brothers and sisters were still bold to preach the gospel just as before.</P><P>The gospel preaching in Chefoo in 1943 experienced the greatest blessing from the Lord. During that time, I only preached twenty minutes. While everyone was singing the song "Vanity, vanity," the Holy Spirit was already working, and when the call was made for all the ones who wanted to believe to stand up, the whole congregation stood up.</P><P>One lady in high-heeled shoes came to listen to the preaching. At random, I pointed my finger to her and said, "Your husband did not have much money, but you still wanted him to buy you this and that." After that meeting, that lady asked a sister, "How come Mr. Lee knows so much about me? I was just the kind of person he was talking about." Later she believed in the Lord.</P><P>Another time when we were preaching the gospel, again at random I pointed my finger to a young boy, and I said, "You have stolen a piece of chalk from the school, and you have taken it home to draw circles." That boy happened to have stolen a piece of chalk from his school and was indeed using it to draw circles at home. He said in his heart, "What does it matter?" Immediately after that, I said on the platform, "You are still saying in your heart, `What does it matter?'" When the boy heard it, right away he believed in the Lord. During that period of time, every time I went up to the platform I was filled by the Lord, and people were saved.</P><P>Once I was preaching the gospel in a place which was a hall with an adjoining small room. During the meeting, both the hall and the adjoining room were filled with people. But the strange thing was that every time I preached, some from the hall would be saved, but no one from the small room would be saved. During one meeting, I purposely directed my speaking to the small room, but still no one stood up there. I then said, "This room has demons in it. We have to pull these demons out." Soon after that, a mother and her daughter came to the meeting and sat in the small room. The daughter held back the mother and would not allow her to stand up to accept the Lord. I then pointed my finger at them and said, "Today, there are demons here trying to stop people from believing in the Lord." The daughter became afraid and dared not stop her mother any longer. Later both the mother and the daughter were saved.</P><P>The more we preach the gospel, the more new ones will be added to us. Once new ones are added to us, the old ones will come alive.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Revival</H2><P>The second thing is the work of revival. After people have believed, we have to lead them, old and young, to love the Lord and to have concrete expressions of love. Our money, time, and energy should all be used for the Lord. The few years when we were in Chefoo, the number of saved ones increased, and we began to have many home meetings. The brothers and sisters paid much attention to the work of visitation. Later when the revival came, all the brothers and sisters offered up everything they had and gave up their material possessions, to the extent that this kind of consecration went on from morning until midnight. Even the offering boxes became too small to take care of the offerings. After the revival in 1943, over a hundred people migrated to northwest China for the spread of the gospel. We conducted revival meetings for over three and a half months. Up to a certain point, the brothers and sisters dared not even open up their chests in their homes, or touch their clothes in their closets. The minute they touched their possessions, a voice within would say, "Consecrate!" During that period of time, many miracles and wonderful things happened among us.</P><P>One sister was over thirty years old. Her husband's name was Wang, and he was a rich man in Chefoo. In the villages, they also owned many houses. But he was not zealous at all, and he did not come to the meetings often. During the first month that we conducted our revival meetings, the husband dropped in a few times. Once when he came, I purposely asked him to give a testimony. That day, we happened to be reading Isaiah 1 and Jeremiah 8, which say that the ass knows his owner, but that God's people do not know Him, and that the birds in the air know the season, but His people do not know the judgment of the Lord. I did not know that before the meeting this Brother Wang had already made an agreement with his wife and was about to offer up his land and house deeds to the Lord. The wife thought that I would not normally call out people to testify during the meetings, and she thought that if I would do that to her husband, it would prove that the consecration was of the Lord. The Lord's leading was wonderful. On that day, I invited her husband to testify.</P><P>Before the meeting that day one young brother was at home reading the same passages from Isaiah 1 and Jeremiah 8, and he felt the words quite meaningful that man would be worse than the ass and the birds. Later this brother came to the meeting hall and heard me speaking on these two passages, and he thought that I was directing my speaking to him.</P><P>If a church is not revived, all the teachings it has are dead. If we want to love the Lord and to consecrate ourselves to Him, we have to do it until it hurts. During that period in Chefoo, we met every day from ten in the morning until six at night, and time was still too short for us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Entering the Life of God</H2><P>The third part of the work is to know God's life. When we preach the gospel, we have to know where we are bringing people. We are bringing people into God's life. The gospel preaching is for the revival, and the revival is for ushering people into the life of God. If a man loves money or his career, he cannot be ushered into God's life. The way to be ushered into God's life is first through the gospel, and then through revivals. Revivals mainly cause a person to love the Lord, but there are many revivals that only stir up an exciting atmosphere. I have been a Christian for twenty-two years, and I have never seen a revival as strong as the one in Chefoo in 1943. During that period of time, many times in the meetings nothing was said, yet many were in tears, and many were convicted of keeping back the Lord's grace and of saying that they were living for the Lord while in reality loving themselves. Today we need to have the gospel, and we need to have revivals. Without the gospel and without the revivals, there is no way for us to be ushered into God's life.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONFESSION AND FELLOWSHIP</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (7)</H1><P>Date:Evening, January 17, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONFESSION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Purpose of Confession</H2><P>A Christian makes confession in order to keep his conscience in peace. This kind of confession has nothing to do with salvation and has nothing to do with the removal of sin before God. Confession is an acknowledgment before man. When a man believes in the Lord Jesus, his sins are forgiven before God, but these sins may not be forgiven before man. This is why there is the need for confession. The purpose of confession is to be reconciled with men; it is not a demand of God's law, but a step we take to clear our conscience of all blame and to have a good testimony before men. The Bible gives many examples of men bearing fruits of repentance after they have believed. Zaccheus is one such example. The Lord Jesus also tells us that when a man wants to make a sacrifice on the altar, and he remembers that his brother has wronged him, he should first go and be reconciled to his brother. Confession has to do with men, but the result of confession keeps us in good fellowship with God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Extent of Confession</H2><P>The extent of our confession goes as far as the feeling of our conscience. The amount of light we receive determines the amount of confession we need to make. Today, we are not asking you to deal with your sins, but to have fellowship with the Lord. If you have fellowship with the Lord, God's life will work in you, and when the light comes, your conscience will be bothered, and it will urge you to deal with your sins. There is a difference between dealing with the conscience and dealing with sin. Dealing with the conscience depends on our fellowship with the Lord. The more the Lord enlightens us, the more we deal with our conscience. Dealing with sin is the result of dealing with the conscience. When our conscience points out our sins, we deal with them accordingly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Necessity of Confession</H2><P>We have to know that our God is a God who means business with us. He is not loose. The teaching of confession can be covered easily. But once we are saved, God will bother us and trouble us within day by day. The more we love the Lord, the more trouble He will give to us. Man thinks that as long as he loves God, God will be lenient toward him. Actually, the more God loves us, the more He troubles us. God allows those who do not love Him to go their own ways. The ways of such ones are broad and the gates wide. But if a man loves the Lord, God will come to him and bother him.</P><P>In the matter of paying tax in Matthew 17, we see how the Lord bothers people. Strictly speaking, there was no need for the Lord to pay the tax. But since Peter made his proposal too quickly, the Lord wanted him to learn some lessons. Peter wanted to argue with the Lord and to find out from Him whether or not one should pay the tax. The Lord had a better way to deal with Peter; He asked him to walk a long distance to fish. This shows us that the more God wants to train us, the more He would bother us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Principle of Confession</H2><P>Concerning the principle of confession, we have to realize that the conscience deals only with unrighteous things. In dealing with our conscience, we need God to give us the wisdom so that we take care of matters in a proper way. The principle of dealing with our conscience is that in our dealings God would gain the glory, others would receive the benefit, and we would be edified. We need wisdom especially in dealing with matters related to adultery. There are some things which cannot be dealt with, and we can only ask God for His forgiveness. We must not pursue peace in our conscience to the extent that it would cause damage to others. There are certain things that cannot be dealt with, and we should not try to deal with them. These matters are over once they have been put under the blood. It is true that we have to be faithful in dealing with the conscience. But sometimes we can go too far. When we realize that we have gone too far, we should stop. Sometimes, it is not God who is telling us to deal with the matters, but Satan who is telling us to do it. The principle of Satan is to hold us back initially and to keep us from advancing. When he cannot hold us back any longer, he will try to push us forward and make us go to the extreme. Sometimes, in the matter of confession, time is a big factor. With some matters, it is wrong to deal with them too early, and it is wrong to deal with them too late. In all these matters, we need the Lord to grant us the wisdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Confession Needed Especially for Our Speaking</H2><P>One area that we have to make confessions in all the time is in the matter of speaking inaccurate words. This is particularly true with us who are speaking for the Lord. We do not know how many times we have to make confessions in this matter. We have to ask God to send His angels to guard our mouths. Psalm 19:14 says, "Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord." For a long time, this was my daily prayer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING SENSITIVE IN OUR RESPONSE TO THE LORD</H2><P>In order to maintain our fellowship with the Lord, we have to be sensitive to His calling. Sometimes the Lord calls us to fellowship with Him. If we do not come to Him, and if we wait until it is too late, we may find that the Lord has left. This kind of people will suffer the punishment of being cut off from the fellowship with the Lord. They have to suffer much punishment before they can come to Him again and meet Him once more. In the matter of fellowship, the Lord is not under our control. This is why we have to be sensitive in our response to Him.</P><P>The Lord shows us in the Gospel of John that He is never under man's control. In John 4, the Lord asked the disciples to buy food, but when the food came, He did not eat it. In chapter six, the Lord Jesus knew very well how to take care of the crowd, yet He asked the disciples what to do. In chapter seven, the Lord's brothers wanted to go to Jerusalem, but He would not go. After a while, He Himself went. In chapter eleven, Lazarus was sick, and Jesus remained in the same place for another two days. After Lazarus died, He went. When there was hope, He would not go. When the hope was gone, He went. In all these cases in John, the Lord's intention was to train the disciples to know that the Lord had His timings; He wanted the disciples to know His timings. In chapter eleven, when the Lord came late, although Martha did not blame Him, she did murmur. She did not realize that the Lord had His own timing. What the Lord wants us to learn is to accept His timing in all things, to allow Him to be the Lord, and to fellowship with Him. Even when something appears to be unreasonable outwardly, He wants us to submit to Him. Only by doing this will we be able to go on with the Lord.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S SPEAKING AND<br>MAN'S SATISFACTION AND REST</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LORD'S DAY MORNING MESSAGE (2)</H1><P>Date:Morning, January 18, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: S.S. 1:6-7; Psa. 27:8; Hosea 2:14; Rom. 8:6b<br>(In Psa. 27:8, the first part was the psalmist's heart speaking on God's behalf: "Seek ye my face," and the second part was the psalmist's reply in his heart: "Thy face, Lord, will I seek."<br>In Hosea 2:14, God will "speak comfortably unto her." This word is the Lord's word to our heart.)</H1><P>Prayer: May we receive grace from God, and may the brothers and sisters meet You, and may the eyes of their hearts be opened. May the words we speak this morning be released, and may others receive the help from these words.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TWO KINDS OF GOD'S WORDS&#151;<br>THE HOLY BIBLE AND THE HOLY SPIRIT</H2><P>Today in fallen Christianity, men pay too much attention to God's word outside of them. Many people think that the words in the Bible are God's words. It is true that they are God's words, but we have to know that other than the words of the Bible, there is also the word spoken by the Holy Spirit within man. The words God speaks to us in the Holy Spirit are just as important as His words to us in the Bible. When the Israelites were in the wilderness, God led them by day and by night with the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire. These two symbols are actually one thing. In the daytime, it is easy to see the pillar of cloud. In the night, a person cannot see the pillar of cloud, and there is the need for the pillar of fire. The pillar of cloud signifies the Holy Spirit, and the pillar of fire signifies the Holy Bible. Both are God's word, but the way they are manifested is different. The pillar of cloud is the Holy Spirit speaking to us, and the pillar of fire is the Holy Bible speaking to us.</P><P>When the Holy Spirit leads us in a clear and bright way, it is like the speaking of the pillar of cloud. But we are not that clear twenty-four hours of the day. Sometimes we will fall into darkness. All those who have been through spiritual experiences know this kind of story. Sometimes a person may have been clear the night before, but he becomes unclear after a night's sleep. You may think that you have become blind. Actually, it is not that you have become blind, but that the sun has gone down. The same is true with our spiritual experience. Sometimes we have the daytime, and sometimes we have the night. In the daytime, we need the pillar of cloud, whereas at night we need the pillar of fire. When we are clear, we follow the Holy Spirit. But when we are not clear, we follow the Holy Bible. During the day, the Israelites did not need the pillar of fire; they only needed it during the night. In the same way, when we are clear, we can trust in the Holy Spirit. But when we are not clear, we can trust in the Bible. The two are equally important. We need both the word within us and the word outside of us before we can become clear concerning God's voice.</P><P>God gives to us these two kinds of words. Outside of us, we have the Bible, and inside of us we have the Holy Spirit. In the wilderness, the pillar of cloud was there in the night also, but the Israelites did not see it. When they did not feel the presence of the pillar of cloud, they had to go on with the pillar of fire. If a man is not clear about the leading of the Holy Spirit, he should compare himself with the Bible. But if a man only walks according to the Bible, his living and working will be merely according to the letter; they will be lifeless and will not be worth much. We should fellowship with God in our spirit. When the Spirit of God speaks to us, we should act accordingly. On the other hand, God is afraid that man would make mistakes, and therefore He gave to man the Bible as the yardstick, so that man can compare himself with the Bible. In this way the leading he receives will be accurate. We must always learn to do one thing, which is to follow the leading of the Bible, on the one hand, and to learn to know God's speaking and to hear His voice within us, on the other hand.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPEAKING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br>WITHIN US BEING MORE PRECIOUS</H2><P>One older brother has been a Christian ever since he was a student in school. But for all the years that he had been a Christian, he never knew that God could speak within man. One day he wanted to buy something, but a voice within him said, "Do not buy it." Later, he discovered that the thing he wanted to buy was booty stolen from others. Had he bought it, he would have trespassed the law. This brother told his pastor about this story and told the pastor that God was speaking within him. The pastor told him, "It is enough for God to speak to you from the Bible. There is no need for Him to speak again within you."</P><P>We have to know that God still speaks to man through the Holy Spirit today. The Holy Spirit is speaking on God's behalf within man. On the one hand, those who follow the Lord today cannot act contrary to the Bible or go beyond it. But the more precious fact is that God speaks to man within him. God's speaking within man will never be contrary to the Bible. If a man has never learned to follow God's speaking within him, his living and work will not be of much worth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FEELING OF GOD SPEAKING WITHIN MAN</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Thirst and Dissatisfaction Being<br>God's Calling for Man to Fellowship with Him</H2><P>What kind of feeling does God give to man when He speaks within man? The best proof of God's speaking is our feeling of dissatisfaction. If you ask others if they are satisfied, most people will tell you that they neither feel satisfied nor feel dissatisfied. Those who say this prove that they have not allowed God to work within them. If a man does not have God's word within him, he will feel neither hungry nor satisfied. If a man feels thirsty and dissatisfied, as if he lacks something, it proves that God is working within such a person already. If a man feels empty and lacking in something, this lacking is God's speaking within him. It speaks of a need. It proves that God is working in him to empty him out. This is like when a man feels hungry, it is his stomach speaking on behalf of water and food.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Satisfaction Being the Result<br>of Fellowship with God</H2><P>If your meeting, praying, and study of the Bible do not satisfy you, it means that God is speaking to you and beckoning you to seek after Him and to have more fellowship with Him. Once you fellowship with God, you will be satisfied. You will be filled like a hungry man having taken a meal. When God speaks within man, man becomes hungry. When man meets God, he becomes satisfied. The Lord Jesus says that those who hunger and thirst after righteousness are blessed. Also He says that whoever thirsts can come to the Lord to drink. Only the thirsty ones will come to the Lord, and only the thirsty ones will be satisfied. If we receive grace to have fellowship with God, the result will surely be satisfaction. I ate last night, and this morning I am hungry again. This hunger is my stomach speaking for food. When a man is hungry, even if you give him gold and jewels, he will not be satisfied. On the contrary, it will increase his sufferings. There is only one way to solve man's hunger, and that is to bring him to the food. Only two kinds of people are not hungry, the dead ones and the critically ill ones. After a person has died, all year round he will not be hungry. If you do not have the sense of hunger within, I am afraid you have not been regenerated and have not been enlivened yet.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Increase of Hunger and Thirst<br>Being an Indicator of the Growth in Life</H2><P>The more a person grows, the more hungry he becomes, and the more food he needs. A newborn babe only needs his mother's milk. But after he takes the milk, he becomes hungry very soon. As he grows, he will need more food; he will need to have the rice, the vegetables, and the meat before his hunger can be satisfied. When a man is first saved, he may think that the pastor's preaching is very good. But after three or five years, he will feel that the pastor's preaching does not satisfy his inner need any longer. This does not mean that the preacher's speaking is not good, or that it is wrong. It is the same pastor. But the growth in life within a man causes him to have higher and deeper needs. Hence, the hunger within man speaks of the degree of growth he has. Today, your need is God's need. Outwardly, it seems to be man's own need. But actually it is God's need. Man's need speaks of God's need. Man's dissatisfaction speaks of God's dissatisfaction. It is like the prodigal son having no rest away from home; it speaks of the father having no rest at home. Only when the father has rest will the son have rest. The rest the father has and the rest the son has are the same rest. The two rests are joined together and are related to one another. Frequently, we tell people that the Samaritan woman was thirsty. But the Lord was even more thirsty. The woman's food was the Lord, whereas the Lord's food was the woman. When the Savior meets the sinner, He is satisfied, and when the sinner meets the Savior, he is also satisfied.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Daily Hungry and Daily Satisfied&#151;<br>the Normal Experience of One<br>Who Is in Fellowship with the Lord</H2><P>The Christian experience is one where we are daily hungry and are daily satisfied. I had a meal this morning. But by this afternoon and this evening, I will be hungry again. This is like a person having fellowship with the Lord in the morning; he feels sweet and satisfied. But in the afternoon, he needs to come to Him again. This is God speaking in Him. Many Christians do not pay attention to this. They do not realize that every time they are hungry, they have to contact God. Every time we do not follow the Holy Spirit, we will lose the sense of hunger. This sense of hunger is the sense of life.</P><P>The Song of Songs says that God's leading directs us to the place of peace and rest. If we do not have rest, this proves that God is speaking to us. In the Song of Songs we see a person working for God, yet one who did not fellowship with Him. She was busy with her work, yet she was hungry within. She asked where the Lord fed His flock, because she wanted to be satisfied, and she asked where the sheep could find rest. She asked these questions because she herself did not have rest. This sense of hunger and restlessness is God's speaking. The purpose of this speaking is to turn us to seek after the Lord. The result of the Lord's leading is to bring men to Him. At the end of chapter one of the Song of Songs, we see the result of the Lord's leading, which is the seeker sitting at the table with the Lord. In chapters two, three, and four she was repeatedly hungry and restless. Every time she was hungry and restless, it was God's speaking to her for the purpose of drawing her to the Lord. In this way, she was kept constantly in a state of seeking after God. There is no other way to take care of man's hunger and restlessness except by coming to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ALL SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES BEING<br>GOD PASSING THROUGH US</H2><P>Some people study the Bible and pray, but they are not satisfied. The reason for this is that they need to have the sense of the Holy Spirit within them. When we pray, we cannot pray according to our mind or our memory; we have to pray according to our inner feeling. If we pray according to our inner feeling, the more we pray, the more we will touch God. This kind of prayer is like our eating; it satisfies us.</P><P>Some people pray according to their memory. They pray for their husbands, and they pray for their sons, from the first one to the last one, and ask God to protect them from car accidents. But the more such ones pray this kind of prayer, the emptier they become. After the prayer, when such ones see their children, they lose their temper again. What is the real prayer? The real prayer is the Christ within praying to the Christ in heaven. The real prayer is God passing through you and praying out of you. All spiritual experiences are a matter of God coming in and going out of you. The real prayer is not a matter of kneeling down or saying the right words, but of praying according to the inner feeling. If the Lord wants you to pray, you should pray. You should pray to the extent that you are filled with God and that God passes through you. This is the real prayer. It is right that we pray for the brothers and sisters, and sometimes God does give us the burden to pray for others; the more we pray that kind of prayer, the more burden we will have. But many times when others ask me to pray for them, I would not answer anything. It does not mean that it is wrong for others to ask me to pray for them. It means that I have to go before God and see what His mind is. We are not praying according to man's need, but according to the inner feeling. In other words, we pray according to God's need.</P><P>The same is true with our reading of the Bible. For example, when we read Matthew 1, we should not right away look up the meaning of the word Abraham. Rather, whenever we come to some words that we are touched with, we should immediately pray. In this way, our reading of the Word will cause us to touch God and be filled with Him.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SERVICE IN THE BODY<br>AND<br>LISTENING TO OTHERS</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (8)</H1><P>Date:Morning, January 19, 1948<br>Place:Brother Cheng's home, Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF SPIRITUAL THINGS</H2><P>Man always pays attention to methods and ways. Actually, a way is just a law. God has no intention for us to know the methods, but He intends for us to have the knowledge of the spiritual things. At present, our knowledge concerning spiritual matters, such as loving the Lord or consecration of material things, is not genuine enough. It is not sufficient for a person merely to know that there is air and light; he has to have a genuine realization of what air and light are. In the past seven or eight years, many times we have probed for ways; we hoped to find out the proper way to do things. But what God is after is our genuine knowledge concerning Him and concerning spiritual matters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE BODY LIFE</H2><P>Service is not an individual matter; it is a corporate matter. The Bible uses the body as an illustration of this matter (1 Cor. 12:12-27). Any time a member is isolated, it becomes useless. The minute we mention the members, we think of their functions. As far as our function is concerned, we are the members, not the sons, the workers, or the brothers and sisters. We can be God's workers individually, and we can be brothers and sisters or children of God individually. But we cannot be members individually. The Bible mentions the Body in at least three places. They are 1 Corinthians 12, Romans 12, and Ephesians 4.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Will Being the Body of Christ</H2><P>Romans 12 first mentions consecration (v. 1). Next, it speaks of knowing the will of God (v. 2). After this, it speaks of the Body (vv. 4-5). Today, many people talk about Romans 12, verses 1 and 2, but they separate these verses from the Body mentioned in the following verses. The period after verse 2 should be removed, because verse 3 is connected to verse 2. Verse 2 mentions the will of God, and in verse 4 we see that God's will is the Body of Christ. Chapters one through eight of Romans speak of God's work, and chapters nine through eleven speak of God's mercy and selection. Based on His work and selection, we should consecrate ourselves to Him, and the goal is the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Coordination in the Body of Christ</H2><P>First Corinthians 12 speaks of the coordination in the church. Here we do not see individual members; we see only the Body. Paul used many words to explain this fact.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Every Member Coordinated in the Body</H2><P>Ephesians 4 also speaks of the Body. There we see that all the brothers and sisters need to coordinate together. For example, the mouth may be very useful, but it can only fulfill its function when it is coordinated in the body. A member is not the whole body. Some people may be "first-class" members, great members, but they are nevertheless members only. On the other hand, other people may be small members, but they can never be so small that they cease to be members. There is much that we can say about this. You can ask a medical doctor, and he will tell you that if the coordination in the body is out of order by a little, the body will be sick. Someone has once said that sickness is caused by the malfunction of the coordination in the body. Every member has to learn to coordinate with other members. This may cause one member to feel uncomfortable, or it may cause another member to feel uncomfortable. However, even if it involves bringing discomfort to ourselves, we must nevertheless not care only for ourselves. Almost all the mistakes committed by Christians are on this point. Once the Body is not comfortable, the supply will be gone. If we want to be coordinated together, we must ensure that the Body feels comfortable.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUBMITTING TO THE AUTHORITY<br>IN THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Submission Bringing In Benefits</H2><P>The first thing we have to see concerning coordination is God's arrangement in the church (see 1 Cor. 12). In 1 Corinthians 12, coordination is a Body matter. If you hit me with your hands, you are offending my head. For anyone to offend the Body of the Lord is to offend the Lord. We have to realize that those brothers and sisters ahead of us have their authority. We should know and realize this authority. If we know this, we will see that nothing is more serious than offending God's authorities on earth. A brother who causes such an offense can never serve the Lord. One member cannot become angry with another member or be separated from another member. If one member is separated from the other members, and if he refuses to receive the supply from others, he will become isolated. Some older brothers and sisters are ahead of us; they have much more knowledge concerning the Lord than we do. The other members should therefore receive their supply from these ones. But many people feel that to submit to them is very difficult. However, you have to realize that they are a help to you. They render you the supply and enable you to fulfill your ministry. The arm receives blood for the hand. The members ahead of us receive supply for the benefit of the other members. The work may be done by the hand, but the supply comes from the arm. The Body is not merely an illustration, but a fact. If the arm is gone, the hand cannot work even if it has the capacity to do so. The arms should not try to be the hands, and the hands should not try to be the arms. Here we see the Body in its many different levels, with each member having its own work that it ought to do. This is not an organization. Rather, this is something organic.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Submission Being<br>without Any Choice of Your Own</H2><P>If I hit you or kick you, who is it that is hitting or kicking you? Is it my members that are doing it, or am I the one who is doing it? For my members to do it is for my whole body to do it. Consider the action of sweeping the floor; it is not the work of one member, but the work of the whole body. The blood in my whole body supplies the member that is doing the work. The body is organic. When the hands, the feet, or the face is in motion, the blood in the whole body directs its supply to these working members. There is the need on the one hand to submit to authority, and on the other hand for others to submit to you. It is difficult to submit to authority. It is more difficult to have others submit to you. You must first be dealt with yourself, and you must first learn to listen to others, before others will listen to you and submit to you. Those who are rebellious cannot expect others to listen to them. I know one sister who has changed maids twelve times. Every time she changed maids, it was because she could not tolerate the maid. What this sister has done was a proof that she has never learned the lesson of listening to others. I am afraid that when such people come to serve in the church, they will cause problems. This is like your mother asking you to buy her some sugar and ginger, and you keep the sugar, while giving her only the ginger. This is the way many people obey God; their obedience is a selective obedience. If I receive the order to buy ginger, I only need to obey and to buy it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Obedience and Listening to Others<br>Bringing In Blessing</H2><P>Let me ask you: if it is not enough that we listen only to the Lord's word, how then should we listen to man's word? Whose word should we listen to? Perhaps you will say that we should listen to those whom we trust and love. But this is wrong. We should not be selective in our listening.</P><P>If there is a group of people here who are willing to listen, this place will experience a big change; Swatow will see thousands of people saved. If the window is open, the sunshine will come in. There may be clouds today. But tomorrow or the day after, blessing will come. Here the older ones listen to the younger ones, and the younger ones listen to the older ones. To listen to others means to be related together in the Body. If we talk about mutuality day after day, yet never listen to others, the coordination of the Body will be but an empty term. We may not be fighting with one another, but neither are we coordinated together. Men on the streets do not fight with each other day after day, yet there is absolutely no coordination or relatedness among them. The book of Acts shows us that there is no such thing as serving the Lord alone. Service is something in the Body. In Acts Paul charged Timothy to come and go; he did not leave any ground for Timothy to pray or to seek for God's will. Many people are very capable in the church, yet this is not necessarily a good thing. In the coordination of the Body, we need to work by listening to others. If you want to open the window, you have to check first with the responsible brothers. If you want to close the window, you also have to check with the responsible brothers. A good work is one that is done through fellowship and in coordination.</P><P>In the church in Shanghai, we have an elders' meeting once a week. Everything is decided by the elders. I admit that during the past year, many things were first proposed by me. But when it comes to making a decision in one accord, I also put myself as one among those who are under orders. This is how we handle everything, including affairs such as the service office record-keeping, and the receiving of saints for fellowship. Here we see no dictatorship or usurpation of authority. All the brothers and sisters can put forth their views and suggestions, and all can go on in the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEARNING TO LISTEN TO OTHERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Listening to Others Being<br>the Requirement for Service</H2><P>In the meeting hall in Chefoo, there is a fixed place for everything, including the rags, the toilet paper, the pencils, and the nails. Nothing can be placed at random. There is a person in charge of every matter and every article. After a person is finished using any article, there are definite rules as to where the article should go. Sometimes we change the arrangements a few times a month. The purpose of this is to train the brothers and sisters to listen to others. Today, many people have never learned to listen to others. If we want to serve together, we have to fulfill this requirement in service. Once we are loose, we become "Sunday-Christians." To serve the Lord is different from doing any other piece of work. If you want to be a proper brother or sister, you have to declare that we who serve the Lord are people who would listen. We cannot work according to our own ways. Our own ways must be dropped. They must be dropped absolutely. When a decision has been made by the elders concerning ushering, none of the brothers can act any longer according to his own wish. A brother cannot come for a week and not come for another week. Once, in a certain church some chairs were moved. When I heard about it, I asked who had moved them. The one who gave the order said that the chairs were in the wrong place. I said, "It is not a question of the right place or the wrong place, but a question of who is giving the order." Later, the matter was decided in the elders' meeting. If you can neither take orders nor give orders, then you can only be one that takes candies; you can only do what you like to do. I can testify that during the past year, I have been exercising myself in Shanghai in this way; I put myself under the direction of the "little" brothers and yield myself to the brothers' arrangement to take a turn to serve in the fifteen districts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Listening to Others Being Listening to the Lord</H2><P>The church is not a place of dictatorship. Here we all learn to listen to others. The Lord is the Word. Hence, for us to listen to others' words is actually for us to listen to the Lord. This is why we have to learn to listen to others' words. There should be some persons responsible for every item of service in the church. There are responsible ones for the cleaning service, the ushering service, and the visitation service. There should be someone in charge of every item of service. This will make things easy to handle. In this way, those who practice submission will experience the joy and presence of the Lord.</P><P>In the church in Chefoo, the floors are cleaned by the brothers and sisters themselves. While the brothers and sisters were cleaning, they would pray that those who put their feet on that floor would be saved. Those who clean the chairs would also pray that those who sit on those chairs would be saved. All the brothers and sisters have a heart for the church, and everything was done for the Lord. Every item of service in the church was carried out through love for the Lord. Once a man passed by the meeting hall on a bicycle. When he saw the posted time for the meeting, he stopped and prayed. Afterwards, he went away. Later when we asked people to sign up for baptism, he came and asked to be baptized. He testified that he came to believe because he noticed how responsible the brothers and sisters were toward the church, and how they did everything for the Lord. He was touched by this and consequently asked to be baptized.</P><P>There was another sister whose husband had an unbelieving friend. The friend once had a dream in which he saw this sister in the meeting telling him that if he wanted to go to heaven he should follow her, and that if he would not follow, he would go to hell. He also saw that this sister's husband was not in hell. Some time after that dream, the church had a gospel meeting, and this sister's husband invited this friend to go to the meeting. When the friend stepped into the meeting hall, what he saw was exactly the same as what he experienced in his dream. As a result of this, he came to believe in the Lord.</P><P>On the one hand, the elders have to put matters before the Lord and consider the way to make the decisions. On the other hand, they have to learn to stir up the brothers and sisters to participate in the services.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Need for the Church to Be Filled<br>with Men Who Would Listen</H2><P>Some brothers have asked me, "What is the requirement for me to come to the church in Shanghai?" The requirement is to listen to others. If you are not told to say something, do not say it. It is not a question of whether or not a thing should be said, but a question of learning to listen to others. One brother by the name of Geh was a college student. He had had some experience of working for others. He stayed in Shanghai for a number of days, and the church assigned him some work to do. Every morning he had to come from ten o'clock until twelve o'clock to transcribe messages. He could not be even one minute late. This was an exercise and a restriction for him. None of us is an expert. It is through serving that we become skillful. There is the need for the church to be filled with people who would listen to others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Listening to Others Saves Much Trouble</H2><P>Whenever the different denominations in Chefoo came together, they would argue with each other. Among us, we did not have a large number at the beginning. After some trainings, the number increased to eight hundred or one thousand. Yet there was very little opinion or criticism, and we made very few mistakes. We must cultivate this atmosphere in the church. We do not like to see many people making proposals concerning a matter. The brothers have a lot to say; the sisters have even more to say. Sometimes the sisters would even persuade the brothers to agree with them that something ought not be done. If there is the talking, it is better that we do not do anything. If we are to do anything, it is better that we stop the talking and start listening. We have to learn to do the works without having the talking. No one in Chefoo can move the chairs around at will. It is not a matter of why, but a matter of who gives the orders. Everything must be done by first checking with others. This is not being troublesome. Rather, this saves trouble. In the baptismal service, once we baptized one hundred twenty people in one hour and twenty minutes. Another time in Shanghai, we baptized one hundred thirty people in a little over an hour; it took only one minute to baptize each one. It took each one only fifteen minutes for the whole procedure, including the time to change clothes; after fifteen minutes the baptized ones were back in their seats already.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THINGS THAT ELDERS SHOULD LEARN</H2><P>The church is different from the home. What the responsible ones discuss in their meetings cannot be taken outside the meetings. If anyone wants to know anything, he should first ask the elders. Those in the world are used to meetings without discussions, and discussions without decisions, and decisions without actions. But the church should not be like this. Once there is a decision, we have to take action. After the elders make the decision, they should assign someone to execute the decision. Any decision that is made must not be announced independently. A brother cannot even tell his wife about the decision. After the meeting is over, the matter should not be discussed any further. Before an announcement is made, no one should pass on the news privately. One time, words about a decision went out to the brothers and sisters. When I tried to trace the person who spread the word, I found out that the source was a certain wife. When I asked the wife about it, she told me that a responsible brother had told her about it. Later I asked that responsible brother, and he admitted that he had said it through an oversight.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Exercising to Be Dealt With in the Flesh,<br>Being in One Accord,<br>Having the Lord as the Center</H2><P>It is not a matter of doing the right thing, but a matter of having the proper exercise. If a person's flesh is not dealt with, he is not qualified to touch God's work. He can be a "pew-member" or a "Sunday-goer" in the church. He can even be a good brother. But he cannot be a member of the Body. In order for the church to be built up in every aspect, both the human affairs and the things of God as well have to be up to the standard. Here we need God to remove our presumptuousness and our looseness as well. When a brother or a sister moves to another locality, he or she should not go there to assume any headship or to disrupt the order of the church. Human organization is different from the church. A human organization works by voting and by the consensus of the majority. But spiritual oneness is something spontaneous. The secret to all the blessings in the church is to be in one accord and to take the Lord as the center in everything.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SERVING BY THE WHOLE BODY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONFERENCE (8)</H1><P>Date:Evening, January 19, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading:Phil. 1</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PREACHING THE GOSPEL IN COORDINATION,<br>WITH EVERYONE FUNCTIONING</H2><P>Gospel preaching is not an individual matter, but a corporate matter. It is quite a demanding work, and we cannot consider it lightly. I can testify that before every gospel meeting, I have to speak to the brothers and sisters at least twice, to let every one enter the burden of the gospel before we actually preach to the outsiders. Today the gospel is preached by the church, and everyone has a part in it; everyone can give themselves to this work. Of course, this does not mean that everyone can deliver a message on the podium. Yet in the work of gospel preaching, the delivering of the message occupies only a small part of the various responsibilities. The other responsibilities rest with the brothers and sisters. This kind of gospel preaching will not put the burden on the shoulders of one person only.</P><P>There is a big difference between a gospel preaching that is done in coordination and one that is done individually. Every time, before I deliver a gospel message, all the brothers and sisters first do their part in inviting their friends and making all the preparations. I am like one who sits on a sedan chair; there is no need for me to do much. After the message, everything is handled by the brothers and sisters also. I can go home and rest. This kind of coordination does not put the burden on the shoulders of one person alone. Instead, it becomes the church preaching the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHURCH PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br>IN ONE ACCORD</H2><P>In Chefoo, during the New Year, none of the brothers and sisters would celebrate the festival. Everyone prepares only simple meals. Some brothers and sisters only cook once in the morning and eat leftovers for lunch and dinner. Some who come from distant localities bring their own food with them, while the church provides only water and tea for them. Other brothers and sisters would invite gospel friends to eat at their homes. The Chinese New Year festival is very much related to superstitious practices and idol worshipping. In addition, during the New Year season, all the illegal and sinful things are done in the open. In this demonic festival, theatrical groups would be set up in front of the idol temples and would sing to the idols. In spite of all these activities, every time we preach the gospel, we gain many people.</P><P>In preaching the gospel, as long as we are one, we will see many people saved. In Tsingtao, our number was originally quite small, about one hundred thirty brothers and sisters. After I worked there for two months, from April 15 to June 15, we had an increase of two hundred people. Originally we did not have a baptistry. Later a baptistry was built in a brother's home, and the church began baptizing people every month.</P><P>Here in Swatow, you have about three hundred brothers and sisters. If you are in one accord, by the end of this year you should have one thousand saints. But if you argue with one another and divide yourselves into five or six groups, the number will surely decrease.</P><P>I have a burden in my heart, which is that the church here should preach the gospel in one accord. In the matter of gospel preaching, I hope that the church would learn to mobilize everyone. The main emphasis is not merely the saving of the sinners, but the oneness among the saints. If you do this, the number of saved ones will increase all the time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A CHURCH LIFE IN WHICH EVERYONE SERVES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Passing On the Burden<br>to Every Brother and Sister</H2><P>When a co-worker goes out to work and to build up a church, he should pass on all his work to the brothers and sisters. In the beginning he may come with a burden. But gradually, the burden should be passed on to the shoulders of the brothers and sisters. Suppose here is a brother. First, you would hold his hand and work together with him. Gradually, you would pass on your work to him, while you stand beside him to help him. Up to a certain point, you can let go completely and transfer everything to his hand. If you do this, when you leave, you will not need to go through any transfer procedure, for all the things will have been passed on to him already. In 1943, on April 12, I became ill. Immediately, I conferred with the responsible brothers and made arrangements for the Lord's Day meeting. After this, I lay down on my bed and began to rest. All the services were taken over by the brothers and sisters immediately. The church at that time had many areas of service. Offerings alone were classified under seven or eight categories. There were many other kinds of work besides. At that time, we had about a thousand brothers and sisters, and business affairs were complicated. Yet all the saints divided up the work and proceeded in an orderly way. This lasts until today. A few years have elapsed, but today the brothers and sisters are still serving in the same way as they did then.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Example of the Church in Chefoo</H2><P>Here is how we divided up the services among the brothers and sisters in the church in Chefoo: one brother who was a postman was responsible for mopping the floor. He would come every Saturday to mop the floor, and he would find out in detail from the responsible brothers how to mop it. After he had found out the way from the responsible brothers, he would go about doing his work quietly. When he completed his work, he would leave. In the same way, all the brothers and sisters learned to listen and to work without talking. This is the best kind of service. One brother who worked in an insurance company was assigned to clean the windows. At home, he had his own maid, and at work, he had people working for him. But when he came to the meeting hall, he did everything with his own hands. We have to learn to start with the small chores. At the beginning, I washed the toilets. Later, other brothers and sisters joined me. One sister was responsible just for putting clean rags in a bin. Every Saturday, some serving ones would come and pick up the rags for cleaning. After they finished their service, this sister would pick up the rags and bring them to be washed. Some sisters in Shanghai are doing the same thing with the hospitality linens.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Replacing, but Perfecting the Saints</H2><P>When I first came to Nanking, some brothers and sisters thought that I came to "run" the church. I told them that I did not come to "run" the church. Instead, I came to give them trouble. I came to generate work for them. It is true that I came with a burden, but this burden had to be passed on to the brothers and sisters. Do not think that because Brother Lee has come, everyone is now free. The same is true in the church in Shanghai. This time, when I left Shanghai, I did it in such a way that I do not have to go back anymore, because all the responsibilities have been transferred over to the local saints. When the Western missionaries came to China, they came to "run" churches. They monopolized everything. They even solicited foreign money for them to "run" their churches. This is not our way. We are here to help the brothers and sisters to fulfill their functions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>No More "Pew-members" and Nominal Christians</H2><P>We should not have the concept of coming on Sunday to a so-called service. When the brothers and sisters come together on the Lord's Day, they do not come for a "service"; rather, they come with their hearts prepared to hear the Lord's word. In the afternoon, they should go out to preach the gospel. It is not a matter of listening to a sermon, but a matter of striving together in oneness for the gospel. In the evening, they should come together to remember the Lord, to fellowship with Him and to worship Him. The prayer meeting is the time when we bring our problems and needs to the Lord. If we do all these, we will receive the Lord's blessing. We should never be "Sunday-service Christians." If you want to be a "Sunday-service Christian," you should go to the denominations. If you think that this is not the right place for you, you can go to some other place, some Christian organization. If we are merely "running" churches, organizing Sunday services, and producing "pew-members," we might as well close our doors.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Concerning the Ushering Service</H2><P>Concerning the ushering service, the ushering brothers and sisters should stand in an orderly way in the meeting hall before the meeting begins. Once the meeting has begun, they should not move around or make gestures anymore. This will frustrate the brother giving the message. The late ones should find their own seats. If the ushers stand up again, then you have one more person moving around. The ushers should also help the saints to take up the front rows first, and every row should have some brothers and sisters, so that new ones can be cared for.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Everyone Serving in Oneness,<br>Submitting to One Another</H2><P>If the brothers and sisters would take up all the services in oneness, they will realize the sweetness in serving the Lord. The church belongs to everyone; it does not belong to the preachers. Hence, in serving the Lord we need grace on both sides, on the side of the brothers and sisters, and on the side of the responsible ones, the elders. The co-workers and the elders should always be concerned that the number of serving ones would not be too few. They have to do their best to invite others to join the service. At the same time, all the brothers and sisters should learn to listen to others and to submit to one another.</P><P>In degraded Christianity, a person "runs" a church; a pastor is hired, a Sunday service is held, and everyone comes to listen to a sermon and attend a service. But this is not our way. When we come together, everyone puts in his portion, and we all serve the Lord together. This is what the Lord is after today.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE WAY TO PERFECT A PERSON</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (9)</H1><P>Date:Morning, January 20, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><P>Prayer: Lord, we are gathered here before You. Enlighten us concerning Your word, and may we touch You from deep within. Lord, show us that Your word is life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD CARING FOR THE PERSON<br>MORE THAN FOR THE THINGS</H2><P>In the church the most important thing is the person. The importance of the person far exceeds that of any work. In the world it is just the opposite; there, the work is more important than the person. But for us the person is more important. Time stands between the two eternities; both creation and redemption are within the span of time. During the span of time, God does many works. God's main goal, however, is not the works, but to gain persons through the works. God does not work for the sake of working, but for the sake of gaining men through His works. God is not here merely to accomplish a work, but to use His work to gain some people. Hence, our views have to be changed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Heart Being Proper<br>toward God</H2><P>God pays much attention to man's heart. The Lord told the Israelites once that "this people draws near with their mouth, and with their lips they honor Me, yet they remove their heart far from Me" (Isa. 29:13). From this, we see that what God cares for is man's heart. Although many words about the heart are from the Old Testament, we find the Lord quoting them in the New Testament: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind" (Matt. 22:37). "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God" (Matt. 5:8). "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Matt. 6:21). "But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away" (2 Cor. 3:16). For this reason, a man's heart must be right and proper toward God.</P><P>It is of course right that we love the brothers. But if we do this without having our hearts aimed at God, such love is not proper. When the Gentiles do the right things, they are right only with respect to the things themselves; they are not right with respect to God. Matthew 7 describes a group of people who have done many things for God, but their hearts are not right toward God. For that reason, they are considered lawless ones (v. 23). If you ask how it could be that a person whose heart is not right can cast out demons, I will tell you that it is indeed possible. Even the Gentiles can cast out demons. As long as a person fulfills the natural law, he can get the expected result. If a man opens the window, air will naturally come in. If a man and a woman are married, naturally they will bear children. Even Lot's daughters who committed incest with their father were able to bear children. If a man is not right in his heart, he can still preach and can still perform miracles. As long as he goes along with the law, it will work. Hence, we cannot judge anything by its outward results. The important thing is where the heart is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Heart Being Attached to God</H2><P>Sometimes, troubles arise among the brothers and sisters because some have an improper heart. Some people are caused to stumble because their hearts are not right. Some people become disappointed because their hearts are not right. Among a thousand brothers and sisters, it is difficult to find one or two whose hearts are near to God. If you suffer loss in your business, and your heart is attached to your business, you will be hurt. Out of the heart are the issues of life (Prov. 4:23). Man's heart is like sticky paper; it attaches itself to whatever it touches. A person who loves the Lord will not be moved by anything good or bad, or by any changes in the human life, because his heart is attached to God. Those who have a proper heart will not put blame on others; they will not condemn others. They will not treat others well when others treat them well, and treat others in an evil way when others treat them in an evil way. We are all hard-to-deal-with people. If someone is a proper person, he will not be overly subjective toward many things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Heart after God's Will</H2><P>A person who has learned the lessons is one who is always fearful of God and who always fears Him in everything. Whether or not a man fears God depends mainly on whether or not he does things by himself or by the life of God. To love God is a matter of the heart. To fear God is a matter of life. If the heart is right before God, it is all right even if the things are done a little bit off. Sometimes I hear people say that we should pray more about such-and-such a thing. When I hear this, I do not feel at peace about it. It does not mean that the words are wrong, but the person who says the words is not a proper person. Solomon said that it is ugly to put a golden ring on the nose of a pig (Prov. 11:22). The golden ring is surely good, but some people are like the nose of the pig; their hearts are not right, and they do not have a proper kind of life. Can a person love a pig just because it has a golden ring on it? If you take away the ring, nobody will want the pig any longer. As long as a person is after God's will, this person is a right person. A handsome person is handsome even if he puts on pig's skin. Many people talk about God's will, but they are not proper persons. Such persons can never really know God's will. God can never reveal His will to an improper person. To have the blessing is one thing. To have the blessing does not mean that you are a proper person. Our God is not stingy. God blesses even those whose hearts are not right. Our hearts must be calibrated on God, in the same way that the needle of a meter should be calibrated to the scale.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>First a Proper Heart, Then a Proper Person</H2><P>If a person's heart is right, that person is right. Even if he does the wrong things, he will not veer off very much. Even when he makes a mistake, he will not go too far off. Whether or not you can become a blessing to others depends on your heart. If you are a proper person, wherever you go, you will become a blessing there. If a person's heart is not right, even if he were to accomplish monumental works, others will still not receive the blessing. Some people have become a problem to us, not because of what they have done, but because of their person. With the conscience, it is a question of righteousness. With the heart, it is different; the heart only deals with the question of being for God or not for God. The heart must be set on God, instead of set on the works. Many things in the church life, such as the persons, the things, the events, the relationships one with another, the love toward the church and the brothers and sisters&#151;all these can turn man's heart away from the Lord. A sinner is saved by turning his heart to God. He is not saved through having something to do with any person, things, or events.</P><P>If a robber comes to you and tells you that he will treat you well, you should not believe in him. The reason for this is that the person himself is not a proper one. One story goes that a yellow fox was once paying a New Year's visit to a chicken. The heart of the fox was not right, for after the visit he intended to swallow the chicken down into his stomach. The chicken would not believe in the fox, because the fox's heart was not right. In serving the Lord, we have to pay attention to the person, and not merely to doing the right things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR WORK BEING TO PERFECT OTHERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Producing Apprentices and Developing Talents</H2><P>Our work does not depend on the achieving of the job, but on the perfecting of men. We have to produce apprentices and develop the personnel. In order for a company to expand, it must discover the talents. During the past few years, our church life did experience some shortages. In all the churches, the attendance is high, and those who come to listen to messages are many, but you cannot find the suitable persons. To do a work is easy, but to produce some apprentices is hard. If we are to preach the gospel and save sinners, we have to do it in such a way that some men are perfected in our work before God. For someone to be able to do something himself is not so extraordinary. To be extraordinary, a person has to be able to cause others to do the same thing that he is doing, and even to do it better than he does. A person does not have to be a scholar himself, but he has to be able to produce an apprentice who is a scholar. In the same way, a person does not have to be a performer himself, but he has to be able to train others to become performers. Some can only do a good job if they are to do it themselves. This is like some people who cannot tolerate having an amah, a servant, not because they are ill-tempered or they are unkind, but because they always think that they alone can do the job well; nobody else can. To them, no amah is suitable. They have to make their own dumplings. If the amah were to make the dumplings for them, they would think that the dumplings are not right. Actually, they may be making dumplings that are clumsy and ugly. Yet they still think that they are the only ones who can do it, and that no one else can do it. There is a fallen concept within man; people always think that what they do is better than what others can do. Actually, if you are truly good at doing something, you can pass on the skill to others and can help others to become just as good. If others do not do it right, you can ask them to do it again, until they become as good as you are. If you would do this, it shows that you are one who has learned the lessons and has been dealt with by the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Allowing Everyone to Have<br>the Full Opportunity to Serve the Lord</H2><P>One responsible brother once assigned some sisters to make some tablecloths. After the sisters tried for a few times, the brother was still not satisfied. In the end, when he asked other sisters to help, no one dared to try it anymore. Yet this brother could not do the work himself. His disposition was too strong, and he had frightened others away. If he would repent of his way, he may be able to gain one or two hundred brothers and sisters. The Lord has been very much restricted by us. We have offended the Lord within us. We should afford all the brothers and sisters full opportunity to serve the Lord, to offer up their possessions, and to give up everything they have for the Lord. Everything should be consecrated, whether it is the person or the things. If we do this, the church will become the Lord's blessing to others.</P><P>If you assign a brother to do something, you have to first pray and consider much. Moreover, when you speak concerning it, your words have to be accurate. The matter should first be discussed among a few people, and then presented to the brothers. In helping a brother, you should try your best to utilize his strong points. To perfect a person, we have to do it slowly.</P><P>Hong Kong is a gold mine, not in the literal sense, but as far as talents are concerned. If someone would work there diligently, it would affect the whole of southern China. We should pray that the Lord would use us. Shanghai is the center of the whole of China. Swatow is the center for Singapore and Ceylon. Hong Kong is the international center. Our work today cannot be like that of traditional Christianity; we cannot have a pastor to take over everything any longer. Instead, we should have every brother and sister rising up to work and to preach the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Perfecting Men for the Migration</H2><P>Concerning migration, the brothers and sisters in Hong Kong can migrate to Southeast Asia. In the church in Chefoo, once over sixty people migrated west from Chefoo to Inner Mongolia and the Ningsia regions. Their traveling expenses were all taken care of by the church. May the Lord change our view so that we can see clearly the things of God. At the same time, if we are not proper ourselves, there is no way that we can perfect others. If some have passed through some serious dealings in the basic matters, the work ahead will have a free course. Some works experience periodic revivals. But after the revivals, everything subsides again. Time and time again there are consecrations, but no essential personnel are produced. If we do not produce fresh recruits, mere revivals are useless. From this, you can see the crucial need of perfecting others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD THE DENOMINATIONS</H2><P>We left the denominations not only because they are wrong, but because they have not come up to God's standard. If there were the possibility of joining or uniting with them, there would not have been the need for another group. There is an absolute difference, rather than a relative difference, between them and us. Some have asked if we can help the denominations. My answer is that we are like a shopkeeper. If others ask the shopkeeper for help, he would say that he does not have the time. He works every day from eight in the morning until night. Brothers and sisters, we do not need to ask how the elders should deal with the denominations. Those who help others to work do so because they have no work of their own. Our work today is not a scattered work. The question is not whether or not we can cooperate with others or help others. The question is whether or not we know what we are doing. A person who does a scattered work is one who does not know what kind of ground he stands on or what work he is doing. Those who are engaged in serious work will not walk into another's office asking for help, for they know that others are busy also.</P><P>You may say that the work of sweeping the streets and hauling fertilizer is low, but some people are doing this work also. I would not criticize others' work, nor would I oppose others' labor. However, I know what my own responsibility is. There are always people who will sweep the streets, and there are always people who will pick up the trash. Today I cannot do something merely because it is a good thing to do. Others may say that this is good and that is good. It is true that street-sweeping is good and that hauling fertilizer is not bad. There is the need for both. But the question is this: what does God want you to do? Already I do not have enough time to speak what the Lord wants me to speak. How can I find the time to oppose others' work? It is not a question of opposing or cooperating, but a question of what we are doing here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING THE APPOINTING OF ELDERS</H2><P>The elders are produced mainly not through appointment but through manifestation. It is a matter of the growth in life. If a person can do many things only after he has been appointed to be an elder and will not do anything if he is not appointed, something is wrong. Can I appoint Mrs. Chow to be the mother of her four sons? And can I remove her from being a mother after a while? If you appoint her, she is a mother. If you do not appoint her, she is still a mother. Her being a mother is not due to your appointment, but to her relationship in life. Who is an elderly person? This is something relative. If a certain brother is the most elderly among us and another person comes along who is thirteen years older than this one, naturally this second one is the more elderly one. There is no question about this. The same is true with respect to spiritual maturity. If you have maturity, you have it, and maturity will manifest itself. It is best for the work of appointing the elders to be done by the co-workers. The same is true with the appointment of the deacons. To serve the Lord is not a question of a profession. The main thing is that we put ourselves in the church. The most necessary thing for a servant of the Lord to have is absoluteness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ON BEING A GENUINE PERSON<br>IN ORDER TO SERVE THE LORD</H2><P>I know people in the same way that Brother Cheng knows his trade&#151;silk embroidery. The minute he touches a fabric, he knows what kind of material it is made of. We have to be a genuine person. You may have a hot temper, or a bad disposition. But even if you oppose and criticize, you have to be genuine. We must be a genuine person if we are to serve the Lord.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>MIGRATION</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (10)</H1><P>Date:January 21, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><P>Prayer: Lord, do not allow us to walk in darkness. Give us the light, and make our light shine as the dawning of the day until midday. Lord, we believe that our prayers will be heard and answered. Lord, make us healthy within and without. When we preach the gospel tonight, may others receive mercy through seeing the love that the brothers and sisters express toward You. Lord, may our future be clear, and may all those who grope in darkness see the light. Forgive us for limiting Your ways.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WHOLE BODY<br>VOLUNTARILY RISING UP TO SERVE</H2><P>It is a difficult thing to help the brothers and sisters to become useful before the Lord. It is easy for us to go to various places to preach the gospel and to give a few messages. But to remain in a place to serve the Lord properly, be coordinated together, and fulfill the function of each one, is a very difficult thing. This is something that the co-workers must pay attention to in the future. If this matter is carried out properly, God will have an oracle and a mouthpiece here. It is not right for the co-workers to see results only when they themselves are working, but not to see results when they are not working. A local church must be something organic; it must be on the move all the time. The co-workers must have an adequate amount of spiritual life, and they must have a proper view to promote this matter. When the elders and the co-workers are not there, the brothers and sisters should still continue to work. When that happens, the co-workers are free to go to work in another place. A built-up church is one that mobilizes by itself and that functions by itself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WORKING IN ONE ACCORD,<br>SETTING THE MIND ON THE THINGS OF THE LORD</H2><P>We should not consider our own house more than we consider God's house. Rather, we should set our minds on the things of the Lord. We are not here to do a scattered work. Today, we have to work in one accord. Only then will the Lord have a way among us. The co-workers and the elders have to help one another, for the co-workers may be away from a locality at times, and the elders have to fill in the gap at those times.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEARNING TO BE A PROPER PERSON<br>THROUGH DOING THE WORK</H2><P>We have to learn to be a proper person. In serving the Lord, the main thing is not our work, but to learn to be a proper person through doing the work. One of the basic trainings in serving the Lord is to learn to be a proper person through doing the work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING MIGRATION</H2><P>Question: What is God doing in China today? What should be our emphasis? What are the steps we have to take? It seems that these matters are not so clear to us yet.</P><P>Brother Lee answered: In the past, we have laid quite a foundation for our work already. But the way to go on is indeed a problem. First, let us consider the question of migration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's People Being Sojourners on Earth</H2><P>God's spiritual people are a group of people who are constantly on the move on earth. This was the way with the Israelites in the Old Testament. They were not settled in a fixed place. Rather, they moved around. We are a people who are called by a heavenly calling (Heb. 3:1, 9); we do not belong to the earth. Today, God has called us. We are but sojourners on the earth. The Bible says that we are the heavenly citizens. Our commonwealth exists in the heavens (Phil. 3:20). In the Old Testament, Abraham was called to leave Ur of Chaldea to go to the place that God had prepared for him and to serve Him there. He moved from one place to another, and he was a sojourner on earth (Heb. 11:8-9). A sojourner is a person whose heart is always on the move; he has no heart to settle down. This is like the co-workers who travel and work in various places; everywhere they go, they may be served with good food, comfortable lodging, and warm hospitality. Yet after they stay in a place for a while, they have to leave. This is how Christians should be&#151;they should be like the Israelites.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Calling, the Beginning,<br>and the Revival of the Church</H2><P>The word "church" is ekklesia in the original language. It should be translated "assembly." The "assembly" is a group of people who have received a heavenly calling. They are but sojourners on earth. At the beginning, both the apostles and the saints as well were moving people. In Acts, the scattered saints went everywhere to preach the gospel. Not only were the co-workers moving; the saints were also moving (Acts 8:4). The way of the gospel is composed of the going out of the apostles and the going out of the saints. Before Acts 13, there was the going out of the saints. After Acts 13, there was the going out of the apostles. Later, both lines ceased. Two hundred years ago, there was the great Moravian revival in Bohemia. As a result of that revival, many people went out from that place to North America, the Pacific regions, and the Atlantic regions. This move was lost when the church became degraded. When the church is revived, the gospel goes out, and many workers go out also.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Christian Way Being to "Go"</H2><P>Today, however, how many saints are going? What God wants us to do is something that has not been done before, and that is migration. For people to move because of the war is something they did against their will. During our war with the Japanese, many people moved to Kunming, but after the Japanese were defeated, these people moved back to their original places. This should not be the case with those who are moving for the gospel. The Bible shows us that we "come" to receive grace, and we "go" to serve. In the Bible, there are many "comings." Many of us should circle these "comings" with a red pen. But the Bible also speaks of "going." The last chapter of Matthew speaks of "going." The first chapter of Acts also speaks of "going." By Acts 28, the "going" had only gone as far as Rome; it was not completed yet. Acts is an unfinished book. In heaven, there may be two hundred chapters to Acts by now. The gospel went from Rome to Europe, then across the Pacific, and finally to the east coast of China.</P><P>Although the gospel has come to the East, it was difficult for the Westerners to spread the gospel to the interior of China. The Chinese do not like to move, and hence the gospel stopped at the east coast of China. This is the case with the church and the saints today. Man likes to settle in a place. Some families have been living here in Swatow for over a century. Their living revolves around this place. Their children are born here, they die here, and they are buried here. Everything is set. I hope that some would go to Tibet for the Lord's sake. When we "come," we drop the earth. When we "go," we take up heaven. This is the way of the Christian.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Testimony of Migration in Chefoo</H2><P>During the revival in Chefoo, of the eight hundred or more brothers and sisters, almost ninety percent of them consecrated everything. The Holy Spirit was working, and everyone was enlightened to repent in tears and to vow that they would never hold back the gospel again. Many of the saints consecrated their families, their jobs, and everything they had to the Lord. When we met together, there was a time when we had only tears before the Lord. During those days, no one preached much, and it is hard to describe the atmosphere of the meetings. Once a person stepped into the meeting, he would feel the Lord's presence. The brothers and sisters consecrated all that they had. Some saints dared not open up their closets when they went home, for when they did, a voice within would say, "Consecrate!"</P><P>One brother who was a judge observed the consecration of the brothers and sisters, and he remarked that what happened then was even more than what happened at Pentecost. What he said may be too much, but this brother did not say things lightly. He could say such a word because God's work was really prevailing then. At that time, there was a brother in his fifties who at one time saw the Lord Himself standing on the podium. When the brother was giving the message, the Lord was standing beside him. What he saw was something real, not an illusion.</P><P>During one of the meetings, I lifted up my hands to pray for about half an hour. The words just kept coming unceasingly. There was no need for me to think about what to pray; the words flowed out spontaneously. If you ask me to repeat what I prayed then, I cannot do it. At the end, when I lifted up my two arms, one brother sitting in front of me lifted his hands also to hold up my arms. After this, two groups of brothers and sisters migrated out. The first group consisted of over seventy people, among whom over sixty of them had their traveling expenses taken care of by the church. Later another thirty or more saints migrated to Manchuria. Today, the Lord is still blessing them.</P><P>From that time on, many people began to pay attention to us. But we did not know what power it was that was upholding us. At that time, our meeting on Fourth Street became the subject of conversation for many people, and some rumored that we had a sack of gold. After the Japanese came, they spent two and a half months to investigate me.</P><P>After the first group migrated out, we were going to send out the second group; the second group consisted of professionals, such as doctors and merchants. Not long after that, the Japanese arrested me. I was put into prison for a month. When I came out, I contracted a serious illness. After a year, I left Chefoo and have not returned since. The ones who migrated went to Inner Mongolia, Sinkiang, and Ningsia.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Migration Being to Live for the Gospel</H2><P>There is some problem about settling in a place for too long. Some people were poor at the beginning. After they believed in the Lord, they took care of their businesses well and made profits from them. As a result, they offer more. But although they offer larger amounts, the percentage of offering compared with their profits becomes less and less. For example, they may have made a thousand dollars in the first year, and they spent only a few hundred dollars. The offering was fifty percent of their profit. After their business grew to a few hundreds of thousands of dollars, or tens of millions of dollars, they began to keep more for their own use, and they offer less percentage-wise. Although they are clear in their prayer, they become confused in practice. When others come around and persuade them, they invest in real estate again or start more partnerships. When opportunity comes and other businesses relocate elsewhere, they would buy the others' properties. In this way, they become settled, and the heavenly people become rooted on the earth. Their roots embrace the earth, and they have "colonized" themselves on the earth. All the churches begin to take root this way. In the meetings, everyone agrees that we should not love the world. But in practice, it becomes entirely different. When material wealth increases, offerings in the church increase, but so do the luxuries in the saints' homes. Without realizing it, the church has become worldly and secular. Migration is an uprooting in which a person sells all he has and moves to another place to live for the gospel.</P><P>One doctor by the name of Wu once talked with me, and I told him that if he sold everything he had and moved to a certain place, he could practice medicine during the week, preach the gospel on the Lord's Day morning, and have a Bible study in the afternoon. His wife could be a "sister-preacher." In a year's time, he could very well bring a hundred people to the Lord. If he would do this, after a few years, he could move to another place and do the same thing again. After a year in the second place, if he could not save a hundred people again, he could come to see me. If you sell all you have and get only three billion dollars for a five billion dollar business, outwardly it seems that you have lost two billion dollars. Actually, you have gained your soul. In Acts 1, after the Lord's resurrection, the disciples were interested in the question of the kingdom; they were not enthusiastic about going out. In the end, the Lord had to send a fire to burn Jerusalem and force them out in that way (Acts 8:1-4). The Lord's word says that the gospel would be preached from Jerusalem, through Judea, unto the remotest part of the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Need for a Revived Living</H2><P>God's children should be a "moving" people; they should not be a "staying" people. They should go to the frontier lands. Man cares for human relationships, and he is reluctant to move. But God wants man to move. In the past God has gained some good vessels in China. If we will not do this for the Lord, who else will do it? In order to practice this, first we must recover the preaching of the gospel, and we must have a revived living. After this, we should migrate out. The Japanese may have been defeated, but something else may come. In Chefoo, we had the blessing because we sent people out. At present, there are over thirty places with the Lord's table in Sui-yuan province already. These brothers moved out from Chang-chia-kou, station after station, and went all the way from Chefoo to Sui-yuan province.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Migration Being Likened to a Relay Race</H2><P>At present, over a hundred brothers and sisters in Shanghai have signed up already. Whenever the Lord gives us the leading, and whenever there is the opportunity, these ones would migrate out. Today, we need a group of pioneers. When a person moves out, he is really dropping everything. In Shanghai we have about a thousand brothers and sisters. We should have over fifty million dollars in offerings every month. In Chefoo, the more the saints migrated, the more people we saw added to the church. In preaching the gospel, there is the need of stations. This is like a relay race. The Westerners have sent the gospel to the coastal regions of China. Today, we have to carry the gospel from the coastal regions to the interior regions. The Westerners cannot open the door of the gospel in the interior regions. Today, however, God will open this door through us.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LIVING BY THE LORD</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (11)</H1><P>Date:January 22, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><P>Prayer: Lord, what we need is not some passing excitement, stirring up, or exhortation, but the remaining work of the Holy Spirit within us. We do not want to be ahead of You, nor do we want to be behind You. May we be filled with You within.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LIVING BY THE LORD'S LIFE</H2><P>What we need today is not merely that we do not live for ourselves, but that we do not live ourselves. We have to work not by ourselves, but by the Lord who lives within us. If we do not realize this, we will still trust in our own strength, and we will work according to our own preference. All works should be initiated by the Lord. No human efforts are of the Lord. After we are saved, the Lord's love revives us and causes us to live for the Lord and to consecrate ourselves to Him. This is the beginning of our spiritual revival. Ultimately, however, what the Spirit does is to lead us to know the life within us and to live by this life. On the one hand, our hearts must love the Lord, and we must be in fellowship with Him. On the other hand, we should act promptly according to the sense we have within. We should not work according to outward circumstances. Rather, we should work according to the inner sense we have received from God. After we are revived, we will surely take God's work as our center. But God must work on us to the extent that we realize that it is not enough to do the right thing. We must also ask by what strength we are doing the work and whether or not God's life is our strength. After a man is revived and sees God's work and His needs, he will try to do something hastily. However, God must eventually bring him to a place where he works by God alone. Outwardly, there does not seem to be very much difference between the two things, but only those who do not know God would think that the difference is an insignificant one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE KEY TO MINISTERING TO OTHERS BEING<br>TO HELP THEM TO KNOW AND EXPERIENCE LIFE</H2><P>In matters concerning God's life, there is a question of degree of depth. Experientially, a person can go through three stages: (1) salvation, (2) revival, and (3) life. Only those who have passed through these three stages of experiences can help others in these areas. The basis of the help we render to others is our experience. We must work according to our experience. Only when we are taking the lead in the front will others follow us at the back. Many like to hear teaching concerning revival, but few like to hear the teaching concerning life. In the past, many people thought that the teaching of life is the teaching of revival. Most likely, these people know about the knowledge and experience of life in terminology only. Most people think that what God wants is excitement. What God did in China in the past was mainly gospel work and revival work. There is a world of difference between revival and life; this difference is greater than the difference between high school and college. Revival is only a means; it is not the goal. It is only the procedure; the goal is life. The more we fellowship with the Lord, live according to the sense of life, and go along with this sense, the more we will be initiated into God's life. The help we render to others all revolves around these three things. If others ask, "How should such-and-such a passage of the Scriptures be expounded?" you should answer, "If you want to know about Bible exposition, go to the seminaries." If others ask about such things as baptism and head covering, you should return the question to them by asking if they have believed in the Lord, and if they have been fellowshipping with the Lord. You should ask if they are under any authority, and if they have the sense of life. If others ask whether this meeting is better or that meeting is better, you should tell them that everything depends on whether or not a person can meet God in a meeting, and whether or not a meeting can satisfy a person's inner need. What we care for is how many people are living by the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>KNOWING NOTHING BUT LIFE</H2><P>Brother Mak, if others oppose you or criticize you, you do not need to require them to come to you and explain to you what they are doing. Do not be carried away by others' questions. You have to take the initiative, and you should never be passive. There are thousands of ways to answer a question, but I know only one thing, and that is to turn back to life. Helping others to know life is like a doctor feeling the pulse of a patient; as soon as a person comes to you, you should be able to give a diagnosis and to discern the spiritual condition of that person. You can only minister to others what you have. Life is not knowledge. When a person comes to us to ask all sorts of questions, we should not give him answers to the questions. Instead, we should give him the Lord's life. When others come to you, you should not give him many ways to work. You should only give him the Lord. Do not carry him away into work. In the case of those who criticize you, you should try to turn them to life. You do not need to ask the reason for their criticisms, nor do you need to give explanations for yourself. Much less do you need to bring someone else along to vindicate or justify yourself. You only need to check the spiritual condition of such a one and ask him to pray with you. If you do this, you will see that you do not have to do anything; the Lord has done everything for you already. Such a person will say, "Thank you. You are truly a messenger from heaven." You do not know anything on the earth. You do not know any misunderstanding, any criticisms, or any agreement or disagreement. You only know life. There is nothing but life.</P><P>In Galatians 6:15, Paul told the Galatians that it was not a question of circumcision or uncircumcision, but a question of being a new creation. Following that, he said, "As many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy" (Gal. 6:16). If we practice this, all the blessings will follow.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING MINGLED WITH THE LORD AND<br>WITH THE SAINTS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Need to Deal<br>with the Peculiar Characteristics</H2><P>We have to mingle ourselves with the Lord. All the peculiar characteristics, the unaccommodating attitudes, and the odd dispositions have to be broken. If we do not do this, we will not be able to mingle with other Christians, and we will only be an individual Christian. Some people are like a drop of oil in water. Among the brothers and sisters, they are a drop of oil, whereas others are like a glass of water. Such a one cannot mingle himself with the others. When a drop of water falls into a glass of water, immediately it becomes one with the water in the glass. This should be the way with us as Christians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Need to Deal with Individualism</H2><P>Cement, water, and stones are the elements that make up concrete. The Holy Spirit is like the water, the Lord is like the cement, and we are like the stones. In order for the three things to be mingled together, the stones must first be cleaned. If the stones are not clean, even if there is water and cement, the three will not mix together. The stones must first be cleaned. When they are clean, they can be mingled together with other stones in the water and the cement. Many people can serve God, but they cannot serve men. They can love God, but they cannot love the brothers and sisters. They can submit to God's authority, but they cannot submit to men's authority. They can confess their sins before God, but they cannot confess their sins before men. They can fellowship with God alone, but they cannot fellowship with the brothers and sisters. These people are like individual stones; they cannot come together with the other stones.</P><P>For some people, some part of their skin is too old and is not functioning properly. There is the need to remove the old skin and to graft in new skin. When the new skin is grafted in, what is grafted in must be fresh and new. In the process of grafting, such a one must endure pain for the old skin to be removed and the new skin to grow together with the other parts. Many brothers and sisters are too old. They have to experience some cutting before they can be joined together with others. Are you able to withstand such cutting? This is where the crux of the matter lies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PERFECTING OF ALL THE SAINTS</H2><P>In our serving together with the brothers and sisters, we have to spend time with them to learn together and to practice together with them. Moreover, we have to learn to pass on everything to the saints in a systematic way. We should be a person who is living before the Lord, and we should produce men instead of merely producing works. The church is like a hospital; not only should the sick ones receive treatment there, but the hospital itself should perfect the doctors and nurses. The church is also like a school, where not only students receive their education, but teachers are perfected. The church is also like a factory. Not only does it manufacture goods, but it produces apprentices as well. Again, the church is like a family. Under the love of the family, the children are nurtured, taught, and caused to grow. In this way, the saints are raised up and educated in the church, and eventually they will graduate to become "doctors" to take care of others. By that time, when God gives the leading and the direction, some will be able to go to migrate for the gospel's sake. This will put everything and everyone into use. Since we are clear about the Lord's way, we should go on faithfully today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INNER SENSE</H2><P>Concerning the inner sense, what we have to pay attention to is not the sense itself, but to have our hearts turn to the Lord, to love Him, and to look to Him. Whatever the first feeling is, we should go along with it and should not analyze. When I talk with others, I am bothered when their eyeballs begin to turn. This means that such a person is turning things around in his mind. Do not analyze the feelings. If you consciously try to remember which foot you should put forward first when you walk, you will never walk. God's life is living. We need to reject all outside voices and the so-called lights, and we should pay attention to the inner feeling and the anointing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MINISTRY AND GIFT</H2><P>We have to be clear concerning the difference between ministry and gift. Ministry is the result of life, and gift is something that the Holy Spirit gives spontaneously. First Corinthians speaks of the service that comes by the gifts, whereas 2 Corinthians speaks of the service that comes by the ministry of life. The gospel, revival, and life&#151;all these three things are for the producing of the ministry. George Muller, Mrs. Penn-Lewis, and many others have an obvious portion of supply. Hence, they have the ministry.</P><P>Our work is the result of our fellowship with the Lord. If we experience life, we will produce the works. There is only one life of Christ, but its expressions are varied. There is only one life in the body, but there are the eyes, the ears, and the different organs. There is only one circulation of blood in the body, but when this same blood flows to all the different members, the functions manifested in the members are different. Today, it seems that God is no longer raising up spiritual giants. Instead, He is raising up every brother and sister to do the work. During the past years, among us the number of full-time serving ones has not increased. On the contrary, some have dropped out. At the same time that this is happening, we see many saints serving the Lord faithfully in their jobs. This is like building a house; in order to build a house, there is the need, on the one hand, for foremen and architects, and there is the need, on the other hand, for all kinds of materials to be assembled together.</P><P>If I pass on these things to you as mere teachings, I would be very pitiful indeed. What I am doing here is to show you a way. To those who want to go on in this way, this is reality. To those who do not want to go on, this is dead teaching.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT LEAVING THE FIRST LOVE</H2><P>One of the most serious things mentioned in the seven epistles in Revelation is the leaving of the first love. This was the starting point of the church's degradation. When we come to the last church, the Lord was shut outside its door. Between these two points, many things took place; the main lesson they teach us is that the church's attention was drawn to the things and the works instead of to the Lord. Among the many things, some involved errors in doctrines, whereas others involved sins. But the real failure underlying all these things is that the heart has departed from the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FOLLOWING THE FLOW OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>God's way is forever onward. Although men may frustrate Him, they will not be able to stop Him from going on. In every age, He does a unique work that is not repeated in other ages. He is always going on. There can be only one George Muller in history, and there can be only one D. L. Moody. Even if others try to imitate what these ones did, they cannot do it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TOUCHING THE FOUNTAIN OF LIVING WATER</H2><P>What we need to do today is to touch the living fountain. Once we touch the fountain, we will never exhaust our speaking. I used to love to read writings of men from the past. But when I took their sermons and repeated them, it took only a few times before I would exhaust the subject. Later I was connected to the fountain of life. From then on, my speaking became exhaustless. The teachings of many Western missionaries are like the sofa chair; they are comfortable to sit on, but they are too soft. Some brothers are like a concrete wall; when you meet them, they make you feel uncomfortable, yet they render much help to you.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>HOW TO BUILD UP THE SERVICES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (12)</H1><P>Date:January 23, 1948<br>Place:Brother Chia's home, Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MAN COOPERATING WITH GOD,<br>ALLOWING GOD TO HAVE A WAY IN THE CHURCH</H2><P>Today, man must give God adequate cooperation before He can have a way in the church. The channels must be cut deep before the water can flow to all the places. In the same way, a person must pass through deep digging before God's grace can have the opportunity to flow into the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ARRANGEMENTS IN THE SERVICES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>First Learning,<br>Then Making Careful Arrangements</H2><P>Concerning assignments for the work in the church, we should allow the brothers and sisters to begin by first learning to serve in one or two specific areas of service, such as gospel preaching. After this, three or four elders can discuss among themselves to see which of the saints are more worthy of trust. These ones should then be invited to a fellowship. If they have some proper suggestions, they should be taken. Once a person has been invited to take up some assignment, we should not easily remove him. There is no need for everyone to answer to everyone else. Once the way is made clear to all, everyone can concentrate on his own work.</P><P>Sister Pearl Wang: For example, in the church in Shanghai, every aspect of the hospitality service has its specific assignments. There are people responsible for the linens, people responsible for the laundry, for patching, for the storage, and for the housekeeping. Everyone has his own duty, and there is no confusion.</P><P>Brother Lee: In the matter of service, we are not afraid of being slow. The only thing we want to avoid is confusion. We are not afraid of being not aggressive. We only want to avoid being too hasty. Once we are confused and hasty, we will not do a good job. At least a year will be needed before the various areas of services in the church in Swatow will have some direction. Other than the work that absolutely requires hiring someone to do it, all the rest should be done by the brothers and sisters themselves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>In the Matter of Service,<br>Learning to Touch God from Within</H2><P>Of course, the most basic thing in the service is to learn to know God and to touch Him from within.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Considering the Saints' Outward Condition</H2><P>Surely there are some difficulties in selecting the right persons to serve. Some who are so-called unpromising should not necessarily be rejected, and some who are promising should not necessarily be taken. To be weak or to be strong does not mean much.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Elders First Working Alongside the Saints,<br>Then Entrusting the Work to Them Completely</H2><P>If a work is assigned to an inexperienced one, the elders should first work with such a one alongside him. Up to a certain point, they can entrust the work completely to such a one and allow him to do it on his own.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ON BEING A PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (13)</H1><P>Date:Evening, January 24, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VAIN DOCTRINES AND PRACTICAL WAYS</H2><P>Today, what many people receive is but doctrines. These doctrines do not render much benefit to the practical Christian living. Many spiritual terminologies are but terms only. For example, to say that a certain person is fleshly or spiritual is but empty spiritual terms to some people. The foreigners spread the gospel to the East, but what many of them preached was but doctrines. In the end, the ones who preached gave nothing but doctrines, and the ones who listened heard nothing but doctrines, and neither knew what the words spoken meant. This is like some people who have never seen snow, yet they keep talking about snow. The pastors in Christianity study in the seminaries and pick up a lot of doctrines. For example, one pastor has a wonderful plan; he has prepared fifty-two sermons, one for each week of the year. With this preparation, he has no fear of running out of sermons. This serves well for his congregation also, who think that by doing this, they will not be out of food or lacking in sermons all year round. But this kind of listening will only make a person big in his head. Today, many people know only the terms and have no idea what they really mean. The reason for this is that they have never properly experienced the things themselves.</P><P>What is to love the Lord? What is to be humble? What is to follow the Lord? What is it for God to be glorified? What is to be led? And what is to love the brothers? I am not here trying to give you a hard time. I am not asking if you understand these doctrines. It is easy to understand the doctrine of love. As long as a person takes a cross-reference Bible, he can prepare a message on loving the Lord. But he does not necessarily have the thing "love" itself. This is the condition of Christianity today. In Christianity everybody says what everybody else is saying, and men only pay attention to the study of doctrines and the attendance of Sunday worship services.</P><P>What is humility? Is it to hold the Bible in your arm and to walk slowly, looking at heaven every few steps? Is this humility? This kind of behavior is false humility. When people who behave this way lose their temper, they will yell and bang on the tables. We should not merely be those who come to attend worship services or to listen to sermons. We need to have fellowship with the brothers and sisters. Today the flavor of Christianity is too strong among us. When someone comes to our city, we hope to receive some help, and we expect the visitor to come with an abundance of grace. But I can hardly believe that a person can receive any help under such circumstances. If you receive any help, it is some other kind of help; what you have received is but beautiful thoughts. Some Christians have large heads, small bodies, and almost no legs. Some saints are experts in criticizing others. They are good at listening to messages. They are good at reading books, and they like to listen to famous speakers. They are like the professional opera-goers. This kind of people is terrible. Sooner or later, they will become tired of listening to messages or of attending services. I am speaking contrary words today. I do not expect you to understand my words. On the contrary, I expect you not to understand my words. Today it is not a question of understanding or not understanding. Today it is a question of whether or not we are willing to be a practical Christian.</P><P>Christianity today is filled with fallen conditions. Here we need a real revolution, a revolution that revolutionizes a person. In a group of seven or eight hundred people, how many are there who are serious about going on? Many people like to attend revival meetings. But the question is this: Will these meetings help a person to go on in the way of following the Lord? I do not like people coming to me telling me that they have received help from me. I do not know you that well. If I did, I would ask you, "What kind of help have you received? Did you receive help from me in expounding the Bible? Or did you receive help from me in knowing the doctrines?" Doctrines will only give people something to talk about. There is a difference between doctrine and a way. A way affords a person a path to follow, whereas doctrines can only afford a person something to listen to and to talk about. I am not here helping you to know more about doctrines or to have a bigger head. Do not ask me how a portion of the Scripture should be interpreted. We need to be a practical person, living a practical life. In Shanghai some young people came to me and asked me about the second coming of Christ. I told them that whether or not the Lord will come soon is not their concern. What they have to do is to preach the gospel and to learn to love the Lord more.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRACTICAL LIVING OF A CHRISTIAN</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Concerning the Reading of the Bible</H2><P>Today I will ask you some practical questions. Are you a Christian in a practical way? Is your reading of the Bible a practical one? You may say that you do read the Bible. But I have to ask you, how much of the Bible have you read? I will ask the sisters if they have read the Gospel of Matthew once. What do Matthew 2, 3, and 4 talk about? Can you tell me the main points in each chapter? The young people should familiarize themselves with every chapter of the New Testament and should be able to tell others the main points in each chapter. How many chapters are there in each book of the New Testament? Some brothers and sisters cannot answer me right away. If I were to ask how many coats they have at home, or how many buttons on their dress, they would be able to tell me right away. One brother has been a believer for three years already. When I asked him what is the first book of the New Testament, he first said that it is the Gospel of John and then corrected himself and said that it is the Gospel of Matthew. I asked him, "Brother, do you ever get confused about your surname? If you can remember your surname, you should know what the first book of the New Testament is."</P><P>I know that I am giving you a hard time here tonight. I am doing this to revolutionize you. If you can answer my question, I will pray for you. If you cannot answer my question, I will not pray for you. Even if I were to pray for you, my prayer would be useless. Some people are too muddled. If you tell them that there are twenty-three chapters in the Gospel of John, they will say, "That is right." If you tell them that hell is in heaven, they will readily believe it. Such people are too muddled. In order for you to understand the things of God, first you have to study the Bible well. You do not have to try to understand, and you do not have to look up the reference books. All you have to do is to study thoroughly. One elderly brother does not know how many books there are in the Old Testament. He has been a Christian for many years, but still does not know the number of books in the Old Testament. This is really a shame. If a man does not want to study the Bible properly, but desires only to be zealous and to listen to messages, whatever he does will be useless.</P><P>Tomorrow I will leave Swatow. You do not have to go to see me off. If you do not know the Bible well, everything else is useless. The Lord willing, I will come back again. When I come back again, the first thing I will ask you is how many times you have read through the Bible. I will not ask if you understand what you are reading. I will ask how many times you have read through the Bible. Perhaps I will write to Brother Mak and ask him how many times have the brothers and sisters read through the Bible. Perhaps I will ask one of you brothers to write me a letter three months from now and tell me how you are doing in your reading of the Bible. I can pay for the stamps. If you do not write to me, I will write to Brother Mak. I do not want to offend you, and that is why I am talking to you in a smiling way. Actually, my words are like a knife sticking into you. What I am saying to you is very polite already. In Tsingtao I was not so polite when I spoke with the brothers and sisters. I could speak to them in not so polite a way because they were begotten of me, and I treated them as my own children. Today we have to be a practical person. We cannot be lazy, and we cannot gloss over matters. Otherwise, we can listen to message after message, and it still will do us no good.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Concerning the Dealing with Our Conscience</H2><P>Has our conscience been thoroughly dealt with? Some brothers answered that they have not thoroughly dealt with their conscience. If we have not thoroughly dealt with our conscience, what is the use of coming and listening to more messages? Do you know God's will? I am not here giving you some beautiful thoughts; rather, I am here giving you "hot ginger soup." I am your brother. That is why I am talking to you like talking to the family. Please do not be angry with me. I am giving you such a hard time in order that you may gain the pearl. When the Lord comes back, He will ask you the same questions. By that time, it will be a greater suffering and a greater loss of face to you. If you need to repent, it is better for you to repent today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Concerning the Preaching of the Gospel</H2><P>Are we serious about the preaching of the gospel? In Swatow you have three hundred people meeting here. If everyone would bring one person to the Lord per year, in ten years there will be one hundred fifty thousand people saved. This means that in ten years the whole of Swatow will be saved. Our gospel work is wrong today. We need the Lord's mercy. It is difficult for an old tree to bear new fruit. The older a tree becomes, the thicker its bark is. But a young tree can bear much fruit. Among us, the new ones grow much faster than the old ones. This exposes our unfaithfulness. How many gospel tracts have we passed out today? How many people have you invited to the gospel meetings? In the matter of gospel preaching, we cannot be a person who only talks but who does not do anything.</P><P>You may say that you have preached the gospel. But how many times have you passed out gospel tracts? How many times have you posted gospel posters, and how many times have you preached in the open? How many times have you given books away to people? How many times have you written letters to others exhorting them to believe in the Lord? Do not say that you are concerned about having false believers. Even if they believe in a false way, you can still bring them in. We have to have a love for the sinners. Only this love is the real love.</P><P>Once Moody was standing in the rain without an umbrella. Others thought that he was crazy, but he told them, "I am doing this to show you something. You say that I am foolish. Actually you are more foolish than I am. One day when God's judgment comes, the fire from heaven will shower down. If you do not believe in the Lord, one day you will suffer punishment." Moody also told others that he preached to at least one person a day. One night, he was in his bed already and remembered that he had not preached to anyone that day. Immediately, he got up and went out to the street. There he met a policeman, and he preached to him. The next day the policeman asked around and found out that the one who was preaching to him was Moody. Later he visited Moody and was saved through him. Today we have to drive out fallen Christianity, and we have to chase away the dead pulpits. The real work today is one that revolutionizes a person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Concerning Material Offerings</H2><P>How much have we done with respect to the matter of material offerings? Do we offer according to a budget? What is our budget every week? If you walk on the street today, you can see many advertisements, but you do not find one gospel advertisement. The reason for this is that men have not offered up themselves thoroughly enough. When a person comes to the meeting hall, he comes only to attend a service, and there is no real consecration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Concerning Supplications</H2><P>In the matter of making supplications for others, how many times have you dealt seriously with the Lord? How many of your prayers have been answered? How many times have you prayed for the servants of God? How many times have you visited the sick? How many poor brothers have received your help?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Concerning the Services</H2><P>In the matter of the services, have we taken them up in a serious way. Have you ever mopped the floor of the meeting hall? Have you ever cleaned the windows, the doors, and the chairs of the meeting hall? You cannot expect the angels to come and do these things for you. Many jobs require the brothers and sisters to do them together. Do not be so spiritual. We have to learn the proper lessons in the practical services before we can learn the lessons in the spiritual matters. I wish that we did not have any hired laborers here, and that every work would be taken up by the brothers and sisters themselves. This is more precious in the eyes of the Lord. The brothers and sisters in Chefoo all gave themselves to serve this way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Concerning Knowing<br>the Brothers and Sisters</H2><P>Do we have a definite understanding about the condition of the brothers and sisters? Do the brothers and sisters know each other? One brother has been in the church for two months, but this Brother Cheng, who has been in the church for three years, still does not know that one's first name; he only knows that his surname is Chen. We are saying that brothers and sisters should have fellowship one with another. But if we do not even know the names of one another, how can we have fellowship? Can you tell me twelve names of brothers and sisters who are here? Paul could remember so many names in Romans 16. I do not mean that you have to know everything about the brothers and sisters, but at least you have to know their names. If you do not know their names, it is too vague to say that you are practicing the brotherly love.</P><P>Today I have no message to give to you. I have come to bother you. If you want me to give you messages, I can give them to you every day for three months, and I will still not exhaust the messages. However, what I am doing here today is not giving you messages.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Concerning Our Testimony<br>in Our Daily Life</H2><P>Do we have a real testimony at home? Have we lost our temper at home? Have we preached to the members of our own family? Have we prayed for them? Have you ever prayed with a few brothers in private for others, for your colleagues, your classmates? If you have not done these things, you are not living a solid Christian life. Let me ask you: Do you agree with what I am saying?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EXPERIENCING THE LORD IN A PRACTICAL WAY,<br>AND BEING A PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN</H2><P>If we want to follow the Lord, we have to be a practical Christian. Only by experiencing the Lord in such a practical way will we know what humility is and what it is to serve the Lord. Our message meetings in the future do not need too much doctrine. We only need to check if others are willing to go on. May the Lord be merciful to us and give us a thorough repentance, so that we would no more be just a Chinese, but be another kind of person, one with a pure heart and clean hands.</P><P>[Editor's note: After Brother Lee's words, the brothers and sisters prayed a little. Then everyone sang "Just as I Am," the last two stanzas. Four or five more prayed. Brother Mak wept, and other sisters wept. After this, the brothers and sisters all agreed that Brother Lee should speak ten or even one hundred times more severely than he did, and everyone raised their hands to show that they would take these words.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCLUDING PRAYER</H2><P>Concluding prayer at 11 p.m.: Lord, be merciful to us. For many years we have had only the outward works and zeal. Others may have thought that we were quite good, and we ourselves have thought that we were quite good. But this time you have enlightened us, and now we realize that we have nothing. All our works are wood, grass, and stubble, and they cannot stand the fire. We confess that we love the world, that we indulge ourselves in the flesh, that we do not have love, and that we have sinned much. O Lord, wash us with the precious blood of Jesus Christ. Preserve us and strengthen us in the days ahead. In the name of the Lord Jesus, we pray. Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FELLOWSHIP WITH BROTHER WEIGH KWANG-HSI</H2><P>[Editor's note: conversation between Brother Lee and Brother Weigh after the meeting.]</P><P>Brother Lee: It is hard for you to handle the work in Hong Kong, Canton, and Swatow all by yourself.</P><P>Brother Weigh: It would be best if some co-workers can come from Shanghai and work in these three places, which can serve as stations. When these three stations are strengthened, there can be further spreading out.</P><P>Brother Lee: When I was in Shanghai, I talked with Brother Yu concerning the matter of the inner life, and we both have the same feelings. Sometimes even the examples are similar. In the future, the way to build up the church is by the three things: the gospel, the revival, and life. All three things have to go on at the same time. Concerning this, everyone feels the same. I thought that I was the only one to use the term "migration," but I found out that Brother Nee also used this term.</P><P>Brother Weigh: Concerning Brother Nee, he felt that there are some things that are hard for him to do. He has received no commission to do what you are doing now, but neither can his burden be released among the ordinary brothers and sisters. This time when you go to Amoy and Foochow, perhaps you can have more talks with the brothers and sisters who are really for the Lord. Hopefully, there can be more fellowship with the co-workers and the elders.</P><P>Brother Lee: At present, there is practically no testimony in Canton. Outwardly things look good, but inwardly it is empty. These few places need some serious work done in them. May the Lord be merciful. God has no intention for us to keep His will in an outward way. This time in Swatow, I have not expected others to understand my words. I only hope that some would receive light before the Lord in a genuine way.</P><P>[The fellowship lasted until midnight.]</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SERVICE OF THE PRIESTHOOD</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CHURCH CONFERENCE (1)</H1><P>Date:7:30 p.m., Friday, April 9, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 2:5; Rom. 12:1, 11; Luke 19:11-17</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ALL THE SAVED ONES BEING THE PRIESTS, AND<br>BEING THOSE WHO SHOULD SERVE GOD</H2><P>I have not been standing on this platform for over four months. What I will speak to you tonight will not be related to anything spoken before or afterwards. The first thing I would like to speak to you is that every redeemed person is part of a holy priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5). Here in 1 Peter it does not say a clean priesthood, but a holy priesthood. To be holy means to be separated, to be set apart.</P><P>Second, the spiritual sacrifice mentioned in Romans 12 refers to our bodies. The first thing that the priests have to offer is their bodies. Such a sacrifice is reasonable. Not only is it a reasonable sacrifice, but it is one that makes you feel comfortable. The life that a person receives from his mother's womb, the first life, has its needs. When a person eats, drinks, or exercises, he feels happy. In the same way, the life that a person receives at regeneration, the second life, also has its definite needs. It needs to serve the Lord. If a person has to mop the floor, the mopping nevertheless makes him feel happy within. Even if he is to clean the toilet, he would do it happily. Any service that would make a person feel happy is definitely a reasonable service.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>UNDERSTANDING THE MEANING OF THE SERVICE</H2><P>Among all the spiritual things that the Holy Spirit has led us to know, do we know this one particular thing&#151;the service? We have been taught concerning how to save souls and how to help others to be delivered from sins. But do we know what is the meaning of service?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Priestly in Nature</H2><P>The service in the church is not prophetic in nature, but priestly in nature. If the service in the church is prophetic in nature, then all the brothers and sisters would have to be prophets. In the Old Testament, the service of the priests consisted of putting forth the showbread, lighting and dressing the lamps, burning the incense, and slaughtering the bulls and goats for others. Today's service in the church consists of living before God, speaking for Him, and ministering unto Him in the many small and miscellaneous affairs. In the denominations, only the pastor gives the message. The janitors are only the menial laborers. But the service in the church is composed of the speakers, plus the piano players, plus the janitors, plus the window cleaners, and so forth. Our work today is to bring in the church service. The church service is not prophetic in nature, but priestly in nature. The speaking occupies only a small portion of the work, and the speaker is but one of the members.</P><P>The service of the priests included the emptying out of the animal refuse. In principle, it includes cooking for others, doing the laundry, and so forth. All these are the work of the priests. The priestly services have to do with miscellaneous works.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Consecrating Oneself to Be a Living Sacrifice<br>for the Satisfaction of Both God and Man</H2><P>To offer up sacrifices is to offer up food for God. What is God's food? God needs to eat and to drink; He has His food in this universe. In every age, God desires to gain some men who would consecrate themselves to Him. If no one would consecrate himself to God, God would be hungry. If no one would pour Himself out to God, God would be thirsty and unsatisfied. Many revival meetings use Romans 12:1 to exhort people to offer up themselves, and at the end of the exhortation they would add the words, "Be a preacher!" But after a person has become a preacher, God may be even more hungry and thirsty. Only sacrifices satisfy God. The demand within us is God's demand; our inner man represents God. When we serve God, we are satisfying God. What is the meaning of a living sacrifice? A sacrifice should be one that is dead, but a living sacrifice means sacrifices that are offered up to do some works. While you serve and work, your spirit will become enlivened through your working.</P><P>Our service to the Lord is expressed in the smallest matters. The Lord asked Peter to fish. This was a small matter, but the principle involved is the same, and that is to satisfy man. The Lord turned the water into wine and fed the five thousand with loaves, both of which are small matters. The goal of these works is not to satisfy the physical life, but to satisfy man's spirit. If a man is hungry, he can eat later. Even if he does not eat, it is still all right. The question is not one of outward eating, but one of the Lord's being satisfied and man's being satisfied through the small matters. This is the principle of service. In itself, service is a small matter, but it satisfies both God and man.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE WAY OF OUR SERVICE TODAY<br>AND ITS CRUCIAL POINTS</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (1)</H1><P>Date:3:00 p.m., April 9, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><P>Brother Witness Lee: How should we go on in the Lord's service in the coming days? What are the crucial points? What are the things that we should pay attention to in this age?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>UNDERSTANDING THE TWO ASPECTS<br>OF THE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>Brother Watchman Nee: First we have to see the condition of the church in this age. Concerning this matter, there are generally two schools of opinion. One group says that the church is always advancing. In every age, there are different recoveries of the truths, such as the truth concerning justification by faith, the truth of sanctification. The other group, represented by brothers such as J. N. Darby, says that the present church is in a state of desolation. If you consider the church life of the first century, the absolute consecration seen in Acts 2 and 4, the keeping of the apostles' teaching, and the perfecting of the saints unto the fullness of the Body of Christ in Ephesians 4, and compare such conditions with the condition of the church today, there is undoubtedly a vast difference between the two pictures. Once when I was in England, I was invited by Brother T. Austin-Sparks to have afternoon tea at his house. He asked me my opinion concerning Ephesians 4 and when this chapter would be fulfilled. Humanly speaking, the condition of the church today is too far from that described in Ephesians 4.</P><P>If we read the final Epistles of Paul, we will see that the church had degraded at that time. In 2 Timothy, he said that "all who are in Asia turned away from me" (2 Tim. 1:15). Peter's description in 2 Peter of the situation at his time was the same. In the end, the apostle John also declared that antichrist has come, and he warned the believers to be watchful (1 John 2:18; 4:3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CATCHING UP WITH GOD'S PRESENT WORK<br>TO MAINTAIN THE TESTIMONY OF THE BODY</H2><P>Both of these views are true, and they are based on facts. However, what God wants today is to gain a group of people who will stand on God's side under these two contradictory conditions, who will maintain God's testimony, and who will uphold such a testimony of overcomers together with God. In every age, God has His work, and the purpose of such work is to maintain His testimony.</P><P>The book of Kings says that at the time Solomon's temple was being built, there was no noise heard. All the materials for the building of the temple, all the stones and the wood, were measured and cut according to size in the mountains, before they were ever sent to Solomon. Every stone and piece of wood was properly coordinated together already. This was why at the time of the building of the temple, "there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house" (1 Kings 6:7). God is doing the same work on earth today.</P><P>The book of Acts is an unfinished book. In the whole Bible, only this book does not have an ending; all the other books have an ending. The Pentateuch, the Gospel of Matthew, and the book of Revelation all have their endings. But the Acts of the Apostles is different. Many questions are left unanswered and unsolved. What happened to Paul later? How did his work end? These things are not recorded in Acts. The reason for their absence is that the Holy Spirit is still working today. In the church today, there is still the work of the Holy Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Submitting to Authority and<br>Receiving the Riches of the Members</H2><P>God's work today is the recovery of the testimony of the Body. This Body testimony is not a doctrine, but a reality. In this Body, there is the perfecting ministry (Eph. 4:12), and there is spiritual authority. A close relationship exists between ministry and authority. Where there is ministry, there is authority. In fact, ministry is authority. In Ephesians 4, we see that the Body requires all kinds of gifts, the goal of which is the perfecting of all the saints. In order for the members to be perfected, there is the need to submit to authority. To submit to authority is to submit to the Head. Today, the sisters cover their heads with respect to the brothers. Actually, everyone should cover his head with respect to Christ. We do not have individual heads; only Christ is the Head. Those who want to retain their heads are trying to practice individualism. Those who promote individualism in the Body are troublemakers. Only Christ is the Head; on the other hand, Christ covers His head before God. Although my hands and my feet are far away from my head, they are still under the direction of the head. Hence, for us to submit to the members is in reality for us to submit to the Head.</P><P>The mouth may be very important, but it still needs help from the other members. Without the eyes and the ears, the mouth alone will be useless. This is why I do not believe in the so-called personal revelation. In the Bible, there are such things as individuals receiving grace from the Lord, and there are such things as individuals being sanctified. Yet at the same time, there is the aspect of our relationship with the other members. What do we have today that is not received from others? The greatest heresies in the world came from those who received so-called direct revelations from the Lord. If an individual can receive revelation alone, then a person needs only to be a Christian individually; there is no need for us to come together to meet any longer, and all the "one another's," the "we's," and the "they's" in the Bible can be cut out. A man has to humble himself and has to receive what others have already received. When a person has received something, it is much easier for another to receive from this one. For example, twenty years ago, it was difficult to find a person who was clear about his salvation. But after we met one person like that, it became easier to meet more. This is true with the understanding of the truth of salvation. It is equally true with the understanding of all the other truths.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A STANDARD CHRISTIAN BEING<br>ONE WHO BEARS THE BODY TESTIMONY</H2><P>The Bible reveals one great truth: the kind of Christian God wants is one who is after a Body testimony. In other words, He wants Christians who will act as members of the one Body of Christ. What we need today are standard Christians. What does it mean to be a standard Christian? A standard Christian is one in whom others can detect certain characteristics. For example, when you sit down with a Presbyterian, he will tell you about God's predestination and will tell you that our salvation, regeneration, and justification are all based on God's predestination. However, if you sit down with a Methodist, he will tell you that everyone has to work out his own salvation, that repentance is an act of one's free will, that salvation is a result of one's willingness to be saved. Everything depends on ourselves; if we do not do anything, we cannot even be saved. Among certain kinds of Christians, you can find certain kinds of characteristics.</P><P>Christians today are not standard. They lack a few basic characteristics, such as selling their possessions, consecrating themselves, repentance and confession of sins, and experiences of deliverance from the power of sin. In addition, there is one characteristic that is lacking the most among them, which is the realization of the Body of Christ. We have to help the believers to experience these things as soon as we can. A newly saved person will do whatever you tell him to do at the initial stage of salvation. If he is allowed to go on for too long, he will become set, and it will become difficult to deal with him. Hence, we have to speak to the believers some of these truths as soon as possible. Everybody likes to be nice and to say nice words; everyone likes to be polite to one another. But a person cannot be an up-to-standard Christian this way. In the future we have to spend much time to study how to be a standard Christian, so that our next generation can become a brand-new breed of Christians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Having the Reality of the Body of Christ<br>and Experiencing It</H2><P>The Body is not a doctrine, but a spiritual fact. If a spiritual matter is recovered, and it is real, it will surely be felt by others. This was the case with the release of the kingdom truth by Evan Roberts. He was sick for a long time. Later he began to realize the truth concerning the kingdom. When he stood up to speak, the message may have been only fifteen minutes long, but there was something real in what he said. Before him, there were people who had spoken about the truth of the kingdom, but the reality was not there. The same is true today with regard to the truth concerning the Body. Many people are able to speak about the Body, but they do not have the Body itself. Before Darby, many people preached this truth, but they did not have the thing itself. When Darby came, it was different; not only did he speak about the truth, but he presented before men the real thing itself that is conveyed by the truth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Believer Dropping What He Is Holding,<br>and Experiencing What<br>He Has Received Positionally</H2><P>Does this mean that God is restricted by man? Of course not. If God wants to work, He will not be restricted. What a Christian receives on the day of salvation is the most that he will receive. What happens afterwards is that these riches are gradually lost. Why are they lost? It is because along the pathway of being a Christian, such a one picks up many other things. Both his hands are full, and he has no more capacity to receive anything more. This is the case with an individual, but the same is true with the church as a whole. The book of Ephesians describes the height of the attainment of the church. After that, things began to fall below that standard.</P><P>What a believer has received initially is something positional only. Afterwards, he begins to receive something experiential. However, in order for him to receive something experiential, he must first drop some other things. We must drop what we have in our hands before we can gain something more in our experience. When we leave this world one day, we will be able to say that all our losses are actually gains. Today, a believer must catch up with God's work and must go on with Him, and he should not be one who is falling back.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FORTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE RECOVERY OF THE BODY<br>AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE MINISTRY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (2)</H1><p>Date:9:00 a.m., April 10, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</p><P>Question One:Do we first know the individual life and then the Body life? Is the basis of the Body life the individual life?</P><P>Question Two:Is individualism a hindrance to the Body?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING THE TRUTH</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Arranging the Sequence of Truth<br>according to One's Personal Experience</H2><P>Brother Nee:At the time of the Reformation, Luther emphasized justification by faith. That was, of course, a recovery of the truth. However, at that time, men only saw that faith before God is needed, rather than work. Luther was supposed to have recovered the truth of justification by faith. Actually, he only emphasized faith; he did not fully realize what justification is. It was not until men like J. N. Darby were raised up in the last century that justification was covered. However, though the word "justification" was used, they had not touched the reality of justification. They did not know what, in fact, is justification. In spite of this, they spoke much on the truth of justification.</P><P>In the last century, some people began also to talk about the doctrine of regeneration. But what is the relationship between regeneration and justification? It is difficult to say which one comes first and which one comes later. There was a brother who once preached the doctrine of justification unceasingly; he had never heard of the doctrine of regeneration. After three years, he began to hear about the doctrine of regeneration, and he realized that he was regenerated. From that time on, whenever he preached the gospel, he would always tell others that a man is first justified and then regenerated. Not only was he preaching this, all the people around him began to preach the same thing. Actually, for a person to say that justification always comes first and regeneration afterwards is making too definite and too subjective a distinction.</P><P>A person who has no experience cannot preach God's word. But a person who trusts in his experience only cannot preach God's word either. A person who preaches God's word must be free from the limitation of his own experience. It is possible for a person to experience certain truths according to a certain sequence in time. But he must never think that the order of the truth is necessarily according to the way he experiences them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Two Sides of the Truth</H2><P>There are two sides to the truth. Many times, some doctrines only cover one side of the truth. For example, we know that there are two aspects to the result of the cross. On the one hand, it removes our sins (Col. 2:14). On the other hand, it justifies us (Rom. 8:3-4). But you cannot say that the cross is clearly divided into these two things. They are actually two aspects of the one thing. We are actually justified from sin through the cross. We who are dead have been freed from sin and justified from sin. This does not mean that to be delivered from sin is one thing and to be free is another thing. Neither does it mean that to be delivered from sin is one thing and justification is another thing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Sacrificing God's Word<br>on account of Our Own Experience</H2><P>Many times, we sacrifice God's word on account of our personal experiences. Because our individual experiences are partial and fragmentary, we do not have a complete, overall view of God's word. Men think that the sun comes out in the day and the moon comes out at night. They think that the moon only appears at night and disappears in the daytime. Actually, the moon is there both in the daytime and at night as well. When a person comes to God, he often makes judgments based on his own experiences. Most people like to arrange the truths in a sequence, such as putting justification first and sanctification afterwards. Yet the Bible puts sanctification before justification (1 Cor. 6:11). Actually, justification and sanctification are two sides of one truth.</P><P>Hence, we need to be delivered from human weaknesses. One cannot affect or sacrifice God's word on account of human weaknesses. Not only should we be delivered from doubting God's word; we must also be delivered from jeopardizing God's word. Under God's ordering, our knowledge of the individual life and our knowledge of the Body life should happen at the same time; we should not say which one comes first and which one comes later.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Taking What We See Today as the Whole Truth</H2><P>We cannot judge God's word by what we see in this age. What we see today is still limited. Perhaps fifty years from now, other brothers will rise up to say that we are in darkness. We only wish we could climb higher than we are to see God's word. Just as we are not saved and then regenerated, in the same way we do not first receive an individual life and then come to realize the Body life. Just as salvation and regeneration happen at the same time, in the same way the realization of the individual life and that of the Body life happen at the same time (Acts 9:17-18). In every age, there are truths of that age. There are also errors of that age. We cannot make the truth of an age become an error just because we do not have enough knowledge about that truth. Take again the example of baptism and the laying on of hands. The two things should happen at the same time. After a person is baptized, immediately he should experience the laying on of hands, and immediately he should be brought to see the coordination, the Body, and to be joined to the brothers and sisters. Due to the fact that some truths were recovered first and some later, men set a sequence to the order of the truth. This is wrong. This is why we cannot consider what we have seen today as the whole truth, nor can we judge God's word by our own experience. Never forget that we are ministers of God's word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Need for a Clear Vision of the Body of Christ</H2><P>The oneness of the Body is based on the knowledge of the life of the Body. First we have to see that we have received the same life. After this seeing, we become one in this life. Without this seeing, we have a big lack. A person who has not seen the Body will feel that he is not much different from a person who has seen the Body. But a person who has seen the Body will realize that with those who have not seen the Body, there is a big lack. This is like an unsaved person considering a saved person more or less the same as he is. Yet the saved person sees in the unsaved person a big lack.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING THE PRACTICE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Finding the Ones to Submit To</H2><P>After we have such a realization, we come to the second step. The first step has to do with God's word. The second step has to do with us. First we must have God's word. Then this word must be applied to us. In the Body, the first thing we have to learn is to find out who are those whom we have to submit ourselves to. We must know who are those who are ahead of us. All the authorities in the Bible are deputy authorities and not direct authorities. What we have to learn is not to have others submit to us, but to have ourselves submit to others. When I go to work, I do not first ask who my subordinates are. Rather, I must first ask who my superior is. If you go to another person's house to be the maid, you do not first ask who the children are, but who the lady of the house is. If we allow the inner life to operate freely, we will find out who are the ones we have to submit to. We may think that submission will make us unhappy. Actually, the opposite is true; submission makes a happy person, and insubordination makes an unhappy person. Only when we submit to one another will there be coordination one with another. This kind of coordination is most pleasant. The real submission is not one that is imposed from without, but one that comes as a result of the operation of the life within. It is wrong to submit to anyone because of his high position or material riches. To do so would make us no different from the political organizations of today. Our submission is not brought about by any outward factors, but by the demand of the life within.</P><P>This kind of submission may bring us tears. Yet, at the same time it brings us joy. We may feel that we are suffering, but we are at the same time rejoicing. Sometimes the ones whom you submit yourselves to may give you a hard time, but you can still say "amen." This is true submission. A true submission is one which neither makes a person suffer, nor causes him to feel happy. However, it draws an "amen" from his spirit and gives him peace in his spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Fellowshipping and Coordinating Together</H2><P>If you see the Body of Christ, you will see the matter of fellowship. The life that we received from the Lord makes us pliable and enables us to coordinate together. In this coordination, there is no friction, and there is no murmuring. To have such things in the Body would make us no different from the political organizations in the world.</P><P>In the Bible, many times the Lord did not speak to men directly. On the one hand, the New Testament does say that a man can know God from within. On the other hand, however, we have to see that after the Lord met Saul, He did not speak to him again directly. Instead, He asked Ananias to go to speak to Saul (Acts 9:6). On the one hand, the life that is seen in the New Testament is a very personal one. On the other hand, the Epistle of John also says that "you also may have fellowship with us" (1 John 1:3). This fellowship is mutual. On the one hand, we come to God individually by the blood and through the veil. On the other hand, we work together, walk together, coordinate together, and serve together. Here, there are those who serve and there are those who are served. From the records concerning Paul, Luke, Timothy, and others, we see that among them there was coordination. Whatever Paul suggested, the others would agree and would carry it out right away. Timothy was a good brother. He could have written a letter to Paul, saying, "Brother Paul, I have believed in the Lord for many years. I can pray, and I can seek after the Lord. Please give me some liberty!" But Timothy did not do this. On the one hand, every person comes to God independently and is individually responsible to God. On the other hand, no one can be independent, and no one can be free. If you are not coordinated with others, you do not have to tell others; within you, you know it yourself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Delivered from the Self</H2><P>A man's mouth may be very clever, but his mouth does not necessarily represent his person. Sometimes, a person may say yes with his mouth, yet disagree within. Some brothers and sisters only bring their mouths to the meetings; they themselves are not in the meetings. One sister once came to me to discuss the question of submission in the family. Her mouth was saying that she wanted me to handle the matter. But I knew clearly within me that her mouth and her ears had come, but her being had not come. Once a person has given up his personal opinions, though he may not readily consent with his mouth, within him he will acknowledge that this is the right thing to do.</P><P>We have to learn to be persons who are delivered from our selves. If fifty radios are receiving the same signal from a station, and my radio has a different signal from the same station, my radio is definitely not functioning properly. Although we live under the New Testament, and although we have the Lord within us, we are at the same time living in the Body. As such there is the need for us to be joined to the other members. In the coordination of the Body, we have to learn to care for the feeling of the other members of the Body. Only then can we have good coordination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Being Individualistic</H2><P>The body is the most beautiful thing there is on earth. Yet the body can also become the most ugly thing on earth. A man looks very fine if he stands here with all his members attached. But if all I see is isolated members detached one from the other, this would be the most ugly sight. If I come into this house and I see two feet at the door, a pair of ears in the room, and a pair of arms at the stairs, how horrible a sight this would be. I will surely run away at once. In the same way, if a person acts independently and is not joined to the Body, he will become a most ugly member. It is one thing for a person to acknowledge that he is a member. It is another thing for this person to be coordinated as a member. Independent actions in the Body are the most ugly thing there is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Submission to the Authority of the Ministry</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Ministry Being the Authority</H2><P>Authority is related to the Head. Authority is also related to ministry. Please remember that all the members have their special gifts. The ear, the eye, the mouth, the hands, and the feet all have their gifts. These gifts are the ministries. As long as there is the ministry, there is authority. Why does the ministry have the authority? It is because each one receives different ministries. The difference in ministries produces the authority. At the same time, with the authority in the ministry there are the limitations. God may grant grace to me to be an ear and to enable me to hear. On the one hand, He intends that I serve the Body with my hearing. On the other hand, He intends that I accept my own limitations. If I want to see, I have to ask the eyes to help me. The problem today is that those who cannot hear insist that they want to hear, those who cannot speak insist that they have to speak, and those who cannot run insist that they have to run. You have to realize that for others to do something is equal to your doing that same thing. Your gift is their gift. At the same time, you have to learn to be limited and to realize that the church is a Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Need to See One's Limitations</H2><P>Some people simply do not know how to study the Bible or to teach the Bible. Yet they insist that they have to do it, and the result is many problems. If the Lord is gracious to you and He makes you a hand, you can raise up this hand as high as you want. But if you say that in addition to being a hand, you want to see also, you will not succeed even if you try it as long as you live. We should pray, "Lord, cause me to see my limitations." If you are all-inclusive, then you become the whole Body. The acceptance of our own limitations is a principle of coordination, and it is also the greatest test. Those who realize their own limitations will fellowship in everything and will seek help and counsel in everything.</P><P>We must realize that authority is in the ministry. The ear has a ministry of hearing. Hence, the ear has the authority of hearing. If you do not see your own limitations, you will not be able to submit to authority even if you want to. Only those who have seen their own limitations can coordinate with other members.</P><P>Some brothers think that they can expound the Bible. They think that they are Bible expositors. Actually, they do not know how to expound the Bible. Yet they insist that they have to do it. The result is many strange teachings. With a Christian, there is not much difference between the self and the individual life.</P><P>Some people never understand what Paul meant when he said that "all are yours" (1 Cor. 3:22). We have to realize that we are born into a rich family. You can rejoice because you are rich. Within you, there is always the feeling that you should accept authority. Your inner man always wants to submit and to accept the authority of the ministry. On the one hand, we have to see our limitations. On the other hand, we have to see that whatever the Lord has established is an authority. It is the Lord who gives some the ability to do something. That ability is that person's authority.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Submission to the Ministry Being<br>Submission to God</H2><P>While we are learning to submit to the ministry, we are submitting to God. A person cannot say that he will only submit to God directly. Of all the authorities that God has established on this earth, ninety-nine percent of them, that is, the overwhelming majority of them, are deputy authorities. The Bible says that we have to submit to our husband and our rulers, and the younger ones have to submit to the older ones. Other than one or two instances, all the cases of submission are submission to deputy authorities. Those who cannot submit to deputy authorities cannot submit to God. Although the eyes see, it is actually the head that is causing the eyes to see. If the eyes are separated from the head, they will be finished. What you touch may be the eyes, but behind the eyes is the head. If a person sees the Head behind the gifts, it will not be difficult for him to submit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Submission Being a Joyful Matter</H2><P>The teachings in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew are not there to cause us to feel uncomfortable. Rather, they are there to make us happy. If you walk with others for a mile, it may make you feel uncomfortable. But if you walk with them the second mile, it will make you happy. The word "blessed" there can be translated as "joyous." Submission is a joyful matter. The life that the Lord gave us is a joyful life. The Head gives the ministry. Where there is the ministry, there is authority. When we submit to authority, we feel happy and joyful within.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Pursuing Submission</H2><P>In the work of the Lord, we should find out who is ahead of us, and we have to seek for the opportunity to submit. I do not believe that there is any brother who is not under some other brothers. Something within you will demand that you find out who is the object of your submission. When the sisters cover their heads, they cannot do so with the hair that grows naturally from them; they have to find a handkerchief and cover their heads. The finding of the handkerchief means that a person has to pursue submission. Why should we not pursue submission in the same way that we pursue love or knowledge? Why would men not pay attention to submission in the same way that they pay attention to work? Why would we not love submission in the same way that we love the preaching of the gospel? A person has to learn to come under one or more authorities in the church. Let me repeat, where there is no ministry, there is no authority. Where ministry is, there is authority.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Honoring the Authority that<br>God Has Established</H2><P>In a local church, not only is there spiritual authority, but there is positional authority as well. Paul charged Titus and Timothy to appoint elders. These elders have positional authority. If you do not have the spiritual discernment and you appoint three elders, and after three years you find out that four other people are more advanced than these three, what should you do? Should you replace the old ones with the new ones? Should you ask the old ones to resign? We should honor all the authorities that God has established according to His will.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Submission Perfecting Ourselves and Others</H2><P>I can testify that God has His arrangements in the church. If you go along with these arrangements, these arrangements will perfect you. Ministry is authority. When you submit to the authority of the ministry, you will be perfected. One sister was very capable of assuming headship. She came to see me because she wanted to submit to her husband. She told me that she could not submit to her husband, because her husband was too indecisive in everything. I answered, "Nevertheless, simply submit. Go and ask him everything. He cannot tell you every time that he does not know. By asking, you will force him to go to the Lord. You should learn to be godly and to fear God. When you submit, you are not debasing yourself. Rather, by so doing you are helping your husband. God has assigned you to be one who submits to others. If you would submit, you will help others." There is a reason for our being chosen: we are chosen to submit to others.</P><P>Paul could boldly say "my gospel" (Rom. 2:16; 16:25). He could also remind Timothy to know "from which ones you have learned" (2 Tim. 3:14). The reason he could say this is that he was a proper apostle, and he had the greatest ministry and the greatest gifts. Hence, he had the authority to remind others concerning his gospel, his ministry, and his teachings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Submission Bringing In the Building<br>of the Church</H2><P>A person must put himself under a few persons and must submit to them. In this way, not only will he receive the benefit individually, but the church will also receive the benefit. A member in the Body is like a stone in the temple. The temple was built up because there were suitable stones that were coordinated and built up together. Building means that one stone is laid on top of another, and desolation means that no stone is laid on top of another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY OF THE WORK TODAY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Going On with the Lord</H2><P>The Lord is going on. What we considered as life yesterday may be death today. We must go on, and we must not stop at the past experiences. I believe that the Lord is doing a greater and richer work today than yesterday. All those who have their eyes opened will see that we are living in the richest age. Yet these riches are accumulated amidst desolation. On the one hand, the church is advancing and is progressing. On the other hand, the church is in an age of desolation. Some only see the desolation of the church and do not see the advance of the church. Others only see the advance of the church and do not see the desolation of the church. From the view of the Lord's work today, we can say that the Lord is advancing. But at the same time, when we consider everything around us, we can also say that the church is desolate.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Testimony of the Local Church<br>in an Age of Desolation</H2><P>What God is doing today is to raise up the testimony of the local church in the midst of desolation, to answer God's call in an age of desolation with the local church, and to recover the church out of its desolation through the testimony of the local church. Christianity has been deformed and has fallen into desolation. For this reason, Christians today are not typical any longer. They have not come up to God's standard. A typical Christian is not only one who is a Christian individually, but one who is involved in the testimony of the church. Only the testimony of the church can bring the church back from desolation to abundance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Maintaining the Lord's Testimony<br>with the Ministry of the Church</H2><P>The Lord says, "My Father is working until now, and I also am working" (John 5:17). The Father is always working; He never stops. For this reason we are also working today. Our work today is to secure for the Lord a testimony of the local church. Our ministry today is the ministry of the church, which is one that brings in a testimony of the church for the Lord.</P><P>Today the church is in a state of desolation. According to typology, the church has been captured to Babylon. The thriving condition of the church as seen by Paul in the first century was lost soon afterwards. From that time on, the church fell into a state of captivity, which continued until the time of Thyatira. After Thyatira, there was Sardis, where God began His work. Thyatira typifies Roman Catholicism, and Sardis typifies Protestantism. It was at the time of Sardis that God began His recovery work. Although the truths were buried for such a long time, when they were recovered, they immediately became actualities. When Paul spoke concerning the truth in the first century, those truths were spiritual realities, yet they were not actualities. For example, when he spoke about the church, it was a reality, but the actual church had not appeared yet. After the Reformation, not only were the truths recovered, but the actual things themselves were recovered. For example, justification by faith is no longer a truth only, but it has become an actual thing. If the Lord delays His coming, the church will never exhort men to be justified by works any longer. The actual matter of justification by faith has been recovered in the church.</P><P>What the church needs today is to raise up a ministry that will maintain the Lord's testimony. The problem with all the places today is that we only maintain a local church without maintaining a ministry that is for the Lord's testimony. Today's ministry must match God's work today. We cannot merely have a so-called ministry. We must have a ministry that is a proper testimony. Our ministry must be the ministry of the church, a ministry that is a testimony of the church.</P><P>God's ministry today is in the local church and is for the local church. The work of the ministry is to recover the proper testimony of the church. This is the real recovery. The unique ministry is for the unique testimony, and the content of the unique testimony is fulfilled in the local church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Expressing the Reality of Christ's Body<br>in the Local Church</H2><P>These are not ordinary days. Our works today are not ordinary works. The way today is the way of the church. In this way, we must not act presumptuously or carelessly. Once we act carelessly, the Lord will have no way to go on. The Body described in 1 Corinthians 12 is a testimony that a local church should have; it is the testimony of the Body. In this Body, the eyes cannot say to the hands, "I have no need of you," nor can the head say to the feet, "I have no need of you" (1 Cor. 12:21). Every part must be in coordination. Ephesians 4 reveals to us the reality between the Head and the Body. The local church today must be a testimony that expresses the reality of this Body. It must be a practical and actual Body expressed in a locality.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE WAY OF THE CHURCH</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (3)</H1><P>Date:The Lord's Day afternoon, April 11, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Tabernacle and the Temple<br>Typifying Two Aspects of the Church</H2><P>Concerning the question of the desolation of the church, we must first consider the way of the church on earth. The way of the church on earth can be seen from the history of the tabernacle in the Old Testament. The tabernacle in the Old Testament was set up by God. The purpose of the tabernacle was for God to dwell with His people Israel (Exo. 25:8). There are many basic differences between the temple and the tabernacle. At the beginning, God dwelt in the tabernacle. After the temple was finished, God began to dwell in the temple (1 Kings 9:3). Both the tabernacle and the temple typify God's dwelling among men. The two appear to be a repetition in type. Actually, they are not repetitions. In the past, many people have written books concerning the tabernacle as a type. But few books have been written concerning the temple as a type. Actually, both things are types of the church. Yet there are some basic differences between the two things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Tabernacle Being in the Wilderness,<br>Being Temporary and Movable,<br>Whereas the Temple Being in the Holy Land, Being Eternal and Stable</H2><P>The tabernacle was built in the wilderness under the direction of Moses and Aaron. The temple was prepared by David and completed by Solomon in Jerusalem. The tabernacle does not have a floor. It has a cover and curtains. When a person enters the tabernacle, what his feet touch is the sand on the ground. This reminds him that the tabernacle is something transitory and movable. This is why it is called the tabernacle, or "the tent of meeting."</P><P>The temple has many similarities to the tabernacle. In the tabernacle, there are the gold, the silver, the brass, and the iron. In the temple, there are the wood and the stones. The stones are a crucial material. In the New Testament, the Lord called Peter, Cephas (John 1:42). The word Cephas means a stone. In the tabernacle there was no stone. Stones are immovable; they signify stability and solidarity. The tabernacle was designed for the wilderness; it was transitory in nature. The temple was designed for the kingdom; it was eternal in nature. David represents the Lord, and Solomon represents the Holy Spirit. The meaning of Solomon is the One who brings in peace. God sent the Holy Spirit of peace to build up the temple. David is a type of the incarnated Christ, and Solomon is a type of the Holy Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Tabernacle Typifying God's Church on Earth,<br>Whereas the Temple Typifying the Church<br>as Christ's Unique Body</H2><P>In the Bible, there are always two aspects to God's habitation. On the one hand, it is transitory and wandering, and it is typified by the tabernacle. The tabernacle moved as the people traveled along. Sometimes it was in Elim. At other times, it was in Kadesh-Barnea. Sometimes it was in the land of supply. At other times, it was in the land of the bitter water. However, the tabernacle itself did not change with the change of location. Wherever the Israelites pitched their tents, there was the tabernacle. Hence, the tabernacle typifies God's church on earth, or His church in the localities. In Shanghai there is the church, because in Shanghai there are God's people. Whenever God's people come together, there is the church. When they are separated, there is no church. This is the aspect of the church as typified by the tabernacle.</P><P>The temple is different from the tabernacle. The temple was established on the threshing floor of Ornan (2 Chron. 3:1) and was built with stones. It was built for the kingdom. It was the center of the life of the people of Israel. The temple is unique, eternal, and solid, and it cannot be divided. Even when the nation was divided politically, the temple could not be divided. There can be only one temple.</P><P>From this, we see that, on the one hand, the church appears in different localities. Yet the spiritual reality of the church is still one Body. It is unique and eternal. These are the two pictures of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Tabernacle Being in Ruins<br>and the Ark Wandering,<br>Typifying the Desolation of the Church</H2><P>The visible church today is the tabernacle; it is already in ruins. At the same time, the temple is not yet manifest. In God's eyes, the church described in Ephesians 2 as God's habitation in the Holy Spirit is a fact. But in actuality, the church has not been fully manifested yet; it is still in its progressing stage. In 1924, we spoke of the history of the ark. The ark of the covenant was always advancing. First it passed through the river Jordan. Then it reached Shiloh (Josh. 18:1). At the time the Israelites went to war with the Philistines, the two sons of Eli had sinned, and Eli himself had become foolish and corrupt. He knew very well the reason the Israelites were defeated. Yet he still tried to use the ark to fight for them, with the hope that through the ark they would win the victory. But the Israelites failed. The ark was captured to the land of the Philistines, and it remained in the house of Dagon (1 Sam. 5:2). Later God brought in a curse, and the Philistines returned the ark on a cart drawn by cows (1 Sam. 4&#151;6).</P><P>At that time, Samuel was raised up to fulfill his ministry. He was still a child and was girded with a small ephod (1 Sam. 2:18). Here was a minister who was set apart for the kingdom. The ark represents Christ. Wherever the ark was, there was the presence of Christ. The ark was known as the ark of the testimony. It was the center of God's testimony. Without the ark, the tabernacle was empty. The tabernacle was meaningful only when it had the ark inside it. After the ark was taken away from the tabernacle in Shiloh (1 Sam. 4:17), it never returned to the tabernacle. It continued to wander, until it was received into the temple when the temple was finished (1 Kings 8:1-11). Before David, there was Saul. At that time, Shiloh was already rejected. The ark did not return to the tabernacle, but remained rather in the house of Obed-edom (2 Sam 6:10) until the time of David, when David welcomed the ark into Jerusalem (2 Sam. 6:12-15). Jeremiah 7:12 and 14 speak of how God dealt with Shiloh, and Psalms 78:60 and 1 Samuel 4:3 speak of how the ark had left the tabernacle. Second Chronicles 5 speaks of how the ark was returned to the temple. God dealt with Shiloh not in the way of burning it down with fire, nor in the way of destroying the people there, but by removing the ark. To have a tabernacle without an ark&#151;this is judgment, desolation, and punishment. Shiloh had the outward form of the tabernacle only; the ark was no longer there. It is like Christianity having only the name of the church, but the central testimony of the church is lost and God's testimony is removed.</P><P>When Solomon became king, he went to Gibeon to pray for wisdom in the tabernacle. Later, when he received the wisdom, he went to the ark (1 Kings 3:15). However, according to 1 Kings 3:4 and 2 Chronicles 1:3, the Gibeonites still made sacrifices and sought for God at the tabernacle. But from the day Solomon left the tabernacle, he never went back. Although in Gibeon there was still the outward human worship, all those who had received wisdom would never go back to the tabernacle. Those who had received wisdom went with the ark.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REALITY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Normal Condition of the Church<br>at the Beginning&#151;Bearing a Testimony<br>of Oneness in All the Places</H2><P>The church on earth today is one. Those who are in the church are men who are separated from the world. Under normal circumstances, every brother and sister should be serving God; this should be their proper occupation. Every one should be a consecrated one, and everyone should have everything in common. Under such a proper living, the gifted ministries such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, as listed in Ephesians 4, are produced. Although these gifted ones are scattered in different places, they are still in the same church. This is like electric current being one, yet transmitted throughout many places. Although the intensity of light may be different from one house to the other, the electricity itself is one. The light expressed in different places is different, but the nature of the electricity is the same. This is the same with the church. Although the churches in the various localities are different as far as their localities are concerned, there is nevertheless only one church. The church exists for the testimony of oneness. When we say the "local church," our emphasis is the church and not the local-ness. The life that all the churches possess is a life of oneness. For this reason all the churches should be one among themselves. Although there were the manifested churches in Corinth, Ephesus, and other places, they were all one church. This is the normal situation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Desolation of the Church</H2><P>However, when the church became desolate, conditions changed. At the time of Paul, the church was already falling into desolation. Paul said in the book of Philippians that "all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus" (Phil. 2:21). In 2 Timothy he said that all who were in Asia had turned away from him and his ministry (1:15). The descriptions in Peter's epistles are no exception; they all mention the desolation of the church toward the end of the apostles' time. On the one hand, Peter speaks in his first epistle of the church as a spiritual house, or a spiritual temple (1 Pet. 2:5). On the other hand, Peter also spoke of the condition of degradation. John's Epistles also speak of the coming of antichrist and of apostasy in teachings (1 John 2:18; 4:3; 2 John 7). These are the conditions of the end times. In Revelation 2 and 3, we see that the churches had become so desolate that the Lord could no longer write to the churches; He could only write to the messengers of the churches. The letter to Ephesus in Revelation 2 can be considered "The Second Epistle to the Ephesians." There the church had forsaken its original condition and had drifted farther and farther away.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Eyes upon the Spiritual Reality<br>of the Church in the Age of Its Desolation</H2><P>What we see today is merely a collection of human methods, doctrines, opinions, criticisms, and quibbles. Amidst the desolation of the church, we need to learn to exercise judgment. It is true that among all the denominations in Christianity, there are God's people who are still performing worship to God. You have to admit that there are still sacrifices. But the ark is not there any longer. There is no more testimony. The only thing that is left is an outward tabernacle. When God's tabernacle has become desolate, His eyes are turned to the temple. Today, we who are learning to follow the Lord have to make our choice between the tabernacle and the temple. Some like to follow what is on hand, what is visible, and what is available everywhere. Yet those who want to follow God have to choose the ark and to go on with it.</P><P>The position that we should take should be one of spiritual reality, that is, the position typified by the temple. Today the church is the habitation of the Holy Spirit. In this church, there is God's authority and the desire of God's heart. There is also the authority of the kingdom of the heavens. The Lord has given to the church the authority of the kingdom of the heavens. As such is the case, we can enjoy the power of the coming age in the church today. In the Old Testament, the temple and the kingdom are linked together; the temple is the most crucial element in the kingdom. In the same way, the church as the temple is linked to the power of the coming kingdom. This is where our way lies today. On the one hand, we have to leave the outward tabernacle. On the other hand, we have to seek after God's testimony. God has pronounced very clear judgment on the outward failures already. His judgment is His removal of the ark. Before God, to be without the ark is a shame. On the one hand, we have to leave the tabernacle. On the other hand, we have to seek after God's testimony.</P><P>What is God's testimony? In the Old Testament, God ordered Moses to make two tables of stones, which He called the tables of the law. On these stones were engraved the ten commandments. The tables of the law were also called the tables of testimony (Exo. 34:29). The ark that God commanded Moses to make was a type of Christ. Above the ark was the mercy seat. Within the ark was the law. However, God did not call the ark the ark of the law, but the ark of testimony (Exo. 25:22). Hence, the law is God's testimony.</P><P>The law is God's demand on man's conduct. How then can it be God's testimony? We have to realize that, on the one hand, God's testimony is the response of God's demand on man. On the other hand, God's demand is simply God's testimony. Where there are the divine demands, there is the divine testimony. Whatever demands God puts on man today, these demands are there to attest to God and to testify God. They testify God's glory, His holiness, and all that He is. The law declares God's demands, and the mercy seat bestows God's grace to man. The testimony is from man to God, and grace is from God to man. When God's glory is satisfied, there is the mercy seat. We have to know that the ten commandments do not refer to the dead laws, but to God's demand on man. This demand is itself a testimony, in which God testifies to Himself. The law maintains God's testimony, and it testifies for God. God has to explain to man His demands, and this explanation is God's testimony. Psalm 119 describes God's law as His testimony many times. When a man keeps God's law, he is keeping God's testimony. Every time the word testimony is mentioned in that psalm, it refers to the law.</P><P>Today the outward church has become weakened and has failed. It has lost the testimony of God and is not able to meet God's demand. For this reason, there are the disunity, divisions, denominations, and sects. God demands that man submit. But man cannot meet this demand. As a result, the testimony is lost, and division is produced. Although every revivalist comes along and builds a tabernacle, there is no ark of testimony in it. Even when there is a mercy seat, there is no ark. A man can go to different places to conduct conferences. What he is doing is merely moving the tabernacle from one place to another. What he is maintaining is merely a mercy seat without an ark. Although the ark is not there, the mercy seat is nevertheless put up. This is what men are doing today&#151;replacing God's testimony with man's need. Whenever man's need replaces God's testimony, degradation begins, and problems arise. What then is the way for our work today?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY FOR OUR WORK TODAY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Realizing the Limitation of an Individual,<br>and Being Delivered from Individualism</H2><P>God has His specific demands; He wants man to learn coordination. God not only requires that man be delivered from sin, the world, and the flesh; He also asks that man be delivered from his individualism. With regard to the knowledge of the Body of Christ, man's problem lies in the fact that since the first day he has been taught the wrong things. Since the Reformation, man came to think that he can be a Christian individually, that he can be sanctified individually, justified individually, and work and serve God individually. Right from the very beginning, this realization has been wrong, and the way a person takes subsequent to this is also wrong. Man thinks that as soon as he believes in the Lord, all he has to do is to be zealous, to consecrate himself, and to give up everything. However, a man must realize that he is not only a man of unclean lips, but he also dwells in the midst of a people of unclean lips (Isa. 6:5). While it is wrong to have unclean lips individually, it is equally wrong to dwell in the midst of a people with unclean lips.</P><P>If we lay a good foundation today, within twenty or thirty years the situation will change drastically. We must see that a person cannot be a proper Christian individually; he must follow the footsteps of the flock, and he must never hold on to any form of individualism. After a person is saved, he must immediately be brought to see that he belongs to the Body. To be joined to the Body is the meaning of the laying on of hands. When a new believer is joined to the Body through the laying on of hands, he can no longer be an individual Christian.</P><P>We must be brought to a point where we acknowledge the limitation of the individual. This word is easy for the young ones, but it is difficult for the ones with considerable gifts. However, we must see that even members as great as the hands and the feet are but hands and feet only; they must accept the other members before they can become complete. We must recognize our own limitations. Problems arise in the church because some people think that they are all-inclusive; they want to do everything by themselves. However, the hand can only be the hand; it cannot see, and it cannot hear. It has to accept the seeing and the hearing of others before it can enjoy the riches. It does not matter how great a gift I am; in many areas I nevertheless have to accept others' supply. Some can only be the cells. Surely they need others. The question is whether or not they would ask others to help them. The basic need is that they have to acknowledge their own limitations. They have to acknowledge that they cannot see, speak, or hear.</P><P>We have to clearly identify our own limitations. We may not know something, but there are others in the church who will know. The fact that I do not know something does not mean that everyone else does not know about it. I have to live by others. I may not be able to walk, but others can walk. Never think that we can preach only the Head without preaching the Body. The more you depend on the Lord, the more you will realize that you have to depend on the members. If we do not accept our own limitations, we will never find the way that others have opened up already. As long as the question of limitation is not resolved, we can never advance. What we have individually is only very little. Do not think that you are so capable or clever, and do not think that you will never be wrong and that others are always wrong. We all have to humble ourselves and be delivered from our pride and our individualism to receive the supply from others. All those who are accustomed to their cleverness and who think highly of themselves should make a turn and have a change. This is the first point.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Submitting to the Authority of the Ministry</H2><P>Second, not only do we have to acknowledge our own limitations; we have to know submission. In the Body of Christ, ministry means authority. Whoever can hear and speak is the authority. If a member can see, he is the authority. His being able to see is his authority. If a member can hear, his being able to hear is the authority. If you want to hear something, you have to submit to him. Either you walk blindly, or you have to submit to the eyes for your seeing. There is no one in the church who does not have to submit to anyone; everyone has to submit to those assigned by God. The problem today is that many brothers and sisters think that the supply others have received will not work in them. They think that they have to receive something directly from God. Man thinks that he can do without man's preaching, but God's commandments come through His ministers. For this reason, we must learn to submit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Being Interested in Interfering with Others,<br>but Always Seeking Help from Others</H2><P>A minister cannot speak in a loose way, nor can he demand that others submit to him all the time without himself being first dealt with by the Lord. God will never entrust His authority to such kinds of people. If a man has a natural liking to put his hands on others' business, God will not be able to use such a person. Man has to be like God, who does not like to control anything. If God wanted to control anything, He could remove the tree of knowledge of good and evil, or He could put a fence around the tower of Babel. He could remove the fiery sword from the cherubim. But God would not do such kinds of things. He never likes to interfere with the liberty of others. Man has to make his own choices. Some brothers and sisters like to interfere with others' affairs. But God has no interest in such kinds of things. He never forces anyone to believe. He says, "Every one who believes...would have eternal life" (John 3:16). Everyone who receives has eternal life. He does not force man to believe. If a man has been dealt with by God to such a degree that he no longer has a liking to interfere with others' business, God will entrust His authority to such a one.</P><P>A man should not have a desire to interfere with another member in the Body. If a man has been taught by God, he will firstly have no desire to interfere with others' affairs. Second, he will gladly seek advice from others concerning his own affairs. If we practice this, when thousands of members come together, with each one having no desire to interfere with others' business while gladly seeking advice from others, a beautiful Body life will be realized. If we do this, we will be balanced. God has no desire for us to be busybodies.</P><P>We have to be a person who has learned the lessons, and we have to reject and restrict all forms of individualism. On the one hand, we have to accept limitations. On the other hand, we have to learn submission. It is a joyful thing to pursue after submission. Today, in the whole world, in all the nations and among all the societies, there are all kinds of opinions, voices, expressions, and arguments. This is why all organizations have their rules, and when they conduct meetings, some are given permission to ask questions whereas others are given permission to answer. Those who speak cannot go on beyond a certain number of minutes. This proves that even in the world, an individual has to be limited by the group. Of course, this limitation is an artificial one, and not one that is done in submission.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Submitting to the Arrangement of the Head,<br>and Receiving the Riches from the Members</H2><P>The first sin of man was rebellion, lawlessness, and the overthrowing of authority. Satan's fall and rebellion were caused by his uplifting of himself to be above God. If we submit ourselves to God's authority today, we will have the proper testimony. We have to realize that not everyone has the authority, and not everyone has the word of God. The testimony of the Body today has nothing to do with numbers, but it is a matter of being in the Body. It is a matter of being willing to submit to the arrangement of the Head, as opposed to being free to make one's own choices and decisions. As a member of the Body, we cannot make any decision on our own. Christ has an immeasurably vast deposit in the church today. If we are in a receiving position, we will surely become very rich. If we insist on receiving only from God without receiving from the Body, we will become very poor. This is not a doctrine, but a fact. Not only is the thing I have my own, but what the brothers and sisters have is also my own. In many matters, other brothers and sisters have a clear discernment, but I do not have discernment. As such a one, I have to accept the discernment of the brothers and sisters. Some people know God's word. Some can discern the truth. I should gladly receive their discernment and judgment. What I do not know, someone else will know. If we will not receive from others, probably we will end up fifty years from now having the same as what we have now.</P><P>It is a strange thing that we have to exhort the brothers and sisters to receive from others. On the one hand, men say that they are poor and weak. On the other hand, they are not willing to receive riches from others. Is this not a strange thing? How rich are the ministries that God has raised up in the church today. Yet we are still in hunger. The reason for this is that we emphasize our own individualism too much. A man has to learn to bow down his head and to receive supply from others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Accepting the Laying On of Hands&#151;<br>Handing Over Oneself<br>to Accept God's Assigned Authority</H2><P>Receiving the laying on of hands means accepting the judgment of the church. It means that one is willing to submit to the authority that God has put upon a person. We are ourselves responsible for handing ourselves over. In the Old Testament, when men laid their hands on the heads of the goats, it meant that they were willing to hand the goats over to the priests. If they wanted to keep the goats, they should not lay their hands on the goats, because they were not willing to hand the goats over. The Bible says that a man has to come to the altar willingly and offer his sacrifices willingly. God wants man to hand himself over in a voluntary way. The Acts of the Apostles records the matter of baptism; it also records the matter of the laying on of hands. The laying on of hands signifies the acceptance of the authority of the church. Today, man sees that baptism is a separation of the believers from the worldly system. But they do not see that the laying on of hands is an acceptance of God's authority that He establishes in the church. When a man refuses authority, confusion results. If a man is willing to hand himself over to the serving ones, it will become easy for the serving ones to do their job.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRINCIPLE OF THE WORK&#151;<br>THE CO-WORKERS HANDING OVER THEMSELVES</H2><P>The principle in the work is the same. The co-workers in all the places should first hand themselves over and place themselves under the Head and be directed by the Head. Only then can the Lord do something, and only then will the work have a way to go on. We hope that in these days the Lord will at least give us a way to go on.</P><P>From now on, we have to accept the judgment of the Body. All major decisions and directions must be placed in the hands of the Body. If we do this, we will have life, power, and direction. Otherwise, there will be rebellion and insubordination. If we hand ourselves over, within us we will surely feel an "amen" and a sweet sense.</P><P>The situation in Foochow in the past has been one of confusion. The meetings there became a little kingdom by themselves. The saints were closed and would not fellowship with others. Their hearts were not broad enough and did not include all the believers; they did not see the unique Body of Christ. The way the Body will be manifested in the future is determined by the nature of the testimony of the local churches today. The local churches today are the models of the coming universal church. This is like an architect designing a house: first he builds a model. Although the model is not very big, what it represents is in nature the same as what will be built. First Corinthians 12 speaks of the universal Body, on the one hand, and on the other hand, the Body life in the local churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE OUTLET OF THE WORK&#151;<br>HANDING ONESELF OVER TO THE BODY<br>TO BE A THREE-DIMENSIONAL VESSEL</H2><P>In our work we must find an outlet for the Lord. What we are lacking today is not power, but an outlet for the Lord. The problem among us is that the co-workers have not properly handed themselves over. Although there is a little power, this power is not great. A three-dimensional cup can hold a lot of water. But a flat piece of glass or a broken cup cannot hold any water. Because our work has been "flat," we have lost many blessings. The tabernacle and the temple in the Old Testament both typify the church, the Body of Christ, in the New Testament. Only when this Body becomes a three-dimensional Body can it be a vessel of God. Only then can it contain God's riches and be a strong and powerful testimony for the Lord.</P><P>Not only should the co-workers do this, the brothers and sisters should also consecrate themselves fully in this way. No matter where he or she is, every brother and sister should be a servant of God. Here all of us need a specific declaration, and should count the cost, and hand ourselves over.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIRECTION OF THE WORK&#151;<br>FROM THE CENTER TO THE CIRCUMFERENCE</H2><P>The gospel spread from Jerusalem to Samaria, and then to the ends of the earth. This is God's way. If a man starts working from the ends of the earth, he is taking the wrong direction. We must work from the center to the circumference. At the same time, it would be equally wrong if all the believers were to remain in Jerusalem, for the intention of the Lord was that the gospel would be preached to the ends of the earth. For this reason, the Lord scattered the believers by raising up persecution in the environment. However, it was not wrong for the apostles to remain in Jerusalem. There should still be the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem, because Jerusalem was a center of testimony. In addition, Antioch was also a center of testimony. The problem today is that we do not have a Jerusalem, and we do not have an Antioch. All we have is simply local churches.</P><P>In the Bible, there was definitely a Jerusalem, and there was an Antioch. This is what needs to be recovered among us in these days. Our work today does not seem to have a Jerusalem. In 1937 we saw the ground of the church, but we did not see the light concerning Jerusalem. Nevertheless, we somehow felt then that the work should not belong to a locality. Thank God that He has led us on. What we have seen today is much more than what we saw then. We cannot change any part of God's Word, and we cannot skip any part of His Word. We should never forget that in the Bible there is still a church in Jerusalem.</P><P>Because our light was not adequate in the past, we suffered losses. From now on, we must have a fresh start. If we do not do this, the work will belong to the local church again, and the Lord will have no way to go on among us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A TESTIMONY</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee: Between 1940 and 1943, by the mercy of the Lord, we did quite a work there in Chefoo, Shantung. During those few years, many souls were saved, and many consecrated themselves. Of those brothers and sisters who were in Chefoo, ninety percent consecrated themselves. Later the migration started. Over one hundred people migrated to the northwest of China, and a few dozen migrated to Manchuria. With these migrating ones, their traveling expenses, ninety-five percent of them, were taken care of by the church. In the first three years after we began to have the testimony in Chefoo, about one hundred fifty brothers and sisters joined us in the breaking-of-bread meeting. This stirred up quite a lot of jealousy. Later the war started, and the Japanese began to persecute me. A dozen or more people in Christianity also began to join hands to attack me. The Japanese put me into prison for a month. After I was released from prison, I was not free from their hands. I was not the only one who was restricted; many other brothers and sisters also lost their freedom. At that time, the Lord prepared a way for me: I became ill and incurred tuberculosis of the lungs, and I had to rest for a year. During this period, I experienced many trials, and I was pressed on all sides. It was not until 1944 that I began to stand up to do a little speaking to the saints. I spent half of my life in Chefoo. In October of 1944, the Lord arranged for me to leave Chefoo to go to Tsingtao. At that time, I told the brothers and sisters that I had to go to take a rest. In this way, I left Chefoo, and I have never gone back.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE KINGDOM</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LORD'S DAY MORNING MESSAGE (1)</H1><P>Date:Morning, The Lord's Day, April 11, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 3:1-2; 5:20; 7:21; 18:3; Luke 18:23-24; John 3:3</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE KINGDOM BEING<br>THE CENTER OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</H2><P>Today we want to consider the center of God's word in the New Testament. In the New Testament, the first thing that the Lord wants is the kingdom of God, or the kingdom of the heavens. As far as the subject itself is concerned, it is the kingdom. As far as its having to do with God is concerned, it is the kingdom of God, and as far as its having to do with the heavens is concerned, it is the kingdom of the heavens. Many people do not pay attention to this matter. They do not have the thought of the kingdom in their mind. When they study the Bible, they only find such things as love, patience, and humility. Others, when they read the four Gospels, find such things as the miracles, the healings, the casting out of the demons, or the virtues of Christ. Man is curious by nature, and he likes to study these things. But there is one great subject in the Bible, and that is the kingdom of God, or the kingdom of the heavens. This is the central thought of the four Gospels. After reading the four Gospels, if you are asked about their main subject, it would be natural for you to say that they contain records of miracles and works of wonder by the Lord. However, you have to realize that the main theme of the four Gospels, and especially that of the Gospel of Matthew, is the kingdom. The emphasis of the Gospels is neither the miracles nor the works of wonder, but the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>The first message of John the Baptist was, "The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near" (Matt. 3:2). The first word that Christ uttered when He came out to preach was also, "The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near" (Matt. 4:17). Afterwards, when the disciples went out to preach, they preached first the gospel of God's kingdom (Acts 8:12). In order for a man to know the things of God, he must first enter God's kingdom. The story between God and man is a story about His kingdom. In the Gospel of John, we see the matter of the kingdom mentioned (John 3:3, 5). In the Gospel of Luke, what the rich man encountered was also the matter of the kingdom (Luke 18:24-25). Even the life mentioned in the Gospel of John is for the kingdom. I repeat the matter of the kingdom over and over again and come back always to the same subject because I want you to see that the main theme in the Bible is the kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE KINGDOM BEING THE STARTING POINT<br>AND THE MAIN POINT OF THE GOSPEL</H2><P>What is the first thing that we present to others? In the New Testament, the first thing that the Gospels present is the kingdom. The principle of the New Testament is that whatever is mentioned first is the most important thing. The first mentioning of the gospel in the New Testament is the gospel of the kingdom. The first book in the New Testament, the book of Matthew, is a book that deals specifically with the kingdom. The first book of the New Testament is not the book of Romans. The New Testament does not deal firstly with sin or with the question of salvation. Nor is the first book the Gospel of John, which gives life. The first thing that God places before man is not salvation or baptism, but the kingdom. The first word that John the Baptist preached was not concerning sin, but concerning the kingdom. The first word that the Lord Jesus spoke to Nicodemus was also concerning the kingdom. To preach the gospel means to preach the kingdom. Regeneration is not for the purpose of dealing with the question of sin. It is to deal with the fact that the kingdom is ahead, and that we need to be regenerated to enter into this kingdom. A person repents, not because he is evil, nor because he has too many sins, but because there is a demand ahead of him that he has to enter into the kingdom. It is because there is a kingdom that a person needs life. Only when a person has life can he have the eyes to see the kingdom.</P><P>Today, when people preach the gospel, the first thing they present to others is heaven. Actually, in the New Testament where can you find heaven being presented first? Did the disciples or any other person present heaven? We are not saying that we do not need to mention sin or salvation when we preach the gospel. We are saying that the New Testament shows that the beginning of the gospel is the kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE KINGDOM BEING<br>GOD'S REQUIREMENT TODAY</H2><P>The kingdom is too great a subject. In the past, we thought that the kingdom is a matter of reward. It is true that the kingdom is a matter of reward. However, it is not simply a matter of future reward, but a matter of God's requirement today. The reason we need to repent and be regenerated is that we need to enter into the kingdom. The kingdom puts a requirement on man. It requires him to do this and that. The Lord said, "Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens" (Matt. 5:20). This speaks not only of the condition for entering the kingdom, but the requirement of the kingdom itself. In the Bible, we see a rich young ruler who had a lot of money. When the kingdom put a demand on him, he was unable to meet the demand, and he left in sorrow (Matt. 19:16-22). The Lord also said that unless a man turns and becomes like a little child, he shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 18:3). This is not only a condition, but a requirement.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S SALVATION MEETING<br>THE REQUIREMENT OF GOD'S KINGDOM</H2><P>In preaching the gospel today, if we put heaven before men as the first thing, our gospel is too low. If a man believes in Christ and is forgiven of his sins merely for the sake of going to heaven, such a standard is too low. The opposite of sin is the law. If salvation is merely for the forgiveness of sins, at the most it is to bring a person up to the standard of the law. The New Testament salvation is not merely for the satisfaction of the law, but to answer a higher demand. God's salvation is saving us to a point where we are higher than the law, the opposite of sin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Requirement of the Kingdom<br>Being Higher Than That of the Law</H2><P>Suppose two brothers are engaged in a business together, and suppose the first brother has taken advantage of the second brother. Others may say that the first brother is not right. This is the human way of speaking, but a Christian should have a higher standard than this. A Christian should say that if the first brother does not return what he has taken, he is not behaving like a brother. Suppose the first one took the second one's clothing. Humanly speaking, it would be right and just for the second brother to reason with the first. But a Christian should say that such behavior is not becoming to a brother or a Christian. However, even to do that does not meet the requirement of the kingdom. The kingdom requires that the second brother, in addition to giving up his reasoning, give another piece of clothing to the first one (Matt. 5:40). This is the requirement of the kingdom. What Christians have to come up to today is the standard of the kingdom. What they have to fulfill is the requirement of the kingdom. Most of the pulpits in Christianity today preach moral teachings. The purpose of such teachings is to turn lawless, evil, unjust people into good men. But the requirement of the kingdom is much higher than goodness and righteousness. The requirements of Matthew 5, 6, and 7 are much higher than the requirements of the law. According to the standard of the law, the goodness and righteousness of the young ruler were high enough. But as far as the requirement of the kingdom is concerned, they were still far too short.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Requirement of the Kingdom Being<br>the Ruling of the Heavens</H2><P>As far as the law goes, it is right to demand payment of debts. Humanly speaking, it is right to be just, and wrong to be unjust. But as far as the kingdom goes, it is wrong to demand payment for debts. The requirement of the kingdom is not that a person cannot demand payment, but that he will not demand payment; and to go one step further, the requirement of the kingdom tells him to sell all he has and give it to others. Many people only know to teach others to be a gentleman, to teach an evil person to become a good person, and to teach an arguing couple to become a harmonious couple. This kind of sermon is welcomed by people. Yet, even if you are the best gentleman in Shanghai, you are still far off in the eyes of the Lord. Even if a man has not sinned, he still cannot enter the kingdom of the heavens. Those Christians who are living under the sense of heaven are those who are controlled by heaven. Man's view is to remove sin and to go to heaven, but the requirement of God's word in the New Testament is much stricter than this. God's requirement is not a question of morality, law, the conscience, or justice, but a question of the rule of the heavens. The kingdom is a matter of God's rule. Those who have a high moral standard may be justified before the law, but they come far short of the requirements of God. In order to satisfy God's requirement, a man cannot take the law as the standard, but he must take the kingdom as the standard.</P><P>If the standard of a Christian's living is his conscience, he will not be able to sell everything and give to the poor. At most, he will be able to be a moral person. He will never live out the life of Matthew 5 to 7. Today's civil law would never require a person to give his clothing to others. The requirement of the conscience at most asks that a man not argue with others, and that if one's clothing is taken away, he will let it go and will not pursue after it. This is the most that the conscience will do.</P><P>If an unreasonable husband argues with his wife, the wife can very well reason with him. If she asks any elderly pastor, she may be exhorted to be patient and may be told that unwavering patience is more precious than good treasure. However, such kinds of exhortation do not come up to the requirement of the kingdom. If the pastor is to present to her the requirement of the kingdom, he would ask the wife to love the husband all the more and to honor him all the more.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Kingdom Being the Demand of Life,<br>and Life Being the Supply for the Kingdom</H2><P>If this is the case, who can enter the kingdom? Who can be saved? This question was raised two thousand years ago already. The Lord's disciples asked Him, "Who then can be saved?" The Lord answered, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible" (Matt. 19:25, 26). Only God Himself can meet the requirement of the kingdom. The kingdom is intimately related to God's life. The kingdom is the demand of life, whereas life is the supply of the kingdom. On the one hand, the life we receive demands that we live out the kingdom. On the other hand, all the requirements of the kingdom are met by the supply of life. Regeneration is for a person to receive and to possess this life, and this life meets all the demands of the kingdom (John 3:3). Man thinks that a person climbs from a low point to a high point, and that improvement is gradual. But God gives to us a high life right from the beginning, so that we can live a high living of entering into the kingdom.</P><P>In the marriage life, you always encounter conflicts and tempers. Suppose a couple have believed in the Lord and are saved. At the beginning, they may still try to hold back their temper and to not give each other an unhappy look. But after a while, they will invariably come into conflicts. Our attitude at home toward our children and our servants often exposes where we are. If we cannot overcome in the small things, we will not be overcomers. In the New Testament, the Lord presented the kingdom right from the beginning. This kingdom requires that we take His life into us and live out a kingdom living. The kingdom life is able to take care of everything both great and small, and it is able to overcome everything.</P><P>Brothers who are engaged in business together may get along with each other well at the beginning. But after a while, they will start to argue with each other. They may argue so much that they have to bring the matter to some elderly brothers for arbitration. After the arbitration, they may be reconciled with each other for a while, and may agree with one another that they will henceforth not exercise their flesh, but will instead pray and confess their sins one to the other, and that by the grace of God they will no longer lose their temper. They may accept the word of exhortation of the elderly brothers. But after half an hour to an hour, while they are still talking, they may be provoked to argue with each other again. This is our real situation.</P><P>If one of these brothers would, on the contrary, answer the demand of the kingdom, not only would he stop arguing; he would even give what he has to the other. If we are only concerned about the conscience, the moral standards, and the public opinions, we are still not qualified to enter the kingdom. The life of Christ helps us not only to meet the standard of the conscience or of morality, but to meet the requirements of the kingdom.</P><P>If a husband loses his temper with his wife all the time, and a person comes along to exhort the wife to be patient and says that unwavering patience is more precious than good treasure, such an exhortation is like the barber's cutting of a person's hair; soon after he cuts the hair, the hair grows back again. If you can help the wife to see the requirement of the kingdom, everything will be fine. When the husband loses his temper, the wife can still smile at him. This shows that she is a person living in the kingdom, and that in everything she has overcome.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Answering the Demands of the Kingdom<br>in a Desperate and Absolute Way</H2><P>Today, God will not do anything to comply with our wish. All He wants is that we single-heartedly seek for the accomplishment of His will. If we seek for the accomplishment of God's will in this way, the kingdom will come. We must answer the demands of the kingdom in a desperate way. We must obey absolutely before we can meet the kingdom requirement. God's salvation does not bring us to the standard of the conscience, morality, or justice only. The requirement of God's kingdom is as "terrible" as an atomic bomb. We find many Christians who conduct themselves well in the first five or six years of their Christian life, but begin to fail by the seventh or eighth year. They begin to lose their patience and may even begin to lose their temper uncontrollably, or backslide or fall suddenly. Only those who answer the demand of the kingdom in an absolute way will overcome. The requirement of the kingdom is as high as heaven itself. The kingdom requires that we give all the reasons to others, and all the blame to ourselves. It requires that we give all the gains to others, and take all the losses to ourselves. If we do this, all the problems will be solved.</P><P>The same principle applies to our material offerings. Man considers it all right if he offers one-tenth of what he has. After he has tithed, he keeps the rest in his own pocket and considers it his. But the requirement of the kingdom is that you be separated from your money. It is not a question of giving up one-tenth, but a question of being delivered from the bondage of money. The way God wants us to take today is the way of answering the demand of the kingdom.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S WORK OF RECOVERY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (4)</H1><P>Date:6:30 a.m., April 12, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BEGINNING OF THE RECOVERY&#151;<br>MARTIN LUTHER</H2><P>God's work of recovery began with Martin Luther. From that time on, God began to have distinct recoveries on the earth. This, of course, does not mean that the recovery began with Luther alone. At the same time that he was raised up, other people saw the same things that he did. He is merely taken as a representative of the recovery in that age. Before his time, the truth had become a kind of tradition, the apostolic ministry had become a system of popery, the oneness of the church had become an ecclesiastical ecumenism, and spiritual authority had become political authority. The church was taken captive to Babylon. The prevailing thought at that time was that the church ruled over the world; it declared that the whole world belonged to God. As a result, the Catholic church brought unconverted people into the church. As long as a person was a Roman citizen, he was automatically a member of the church. Spontaneously, infant baptism came in at that time. Originally, Christians were people who took the voluntary way of poverty. Christians and poor people are always linked together. But when the church opened its door to the world, voluntary poverty was lost, and the church became rich. Under normal circumstances, there should be two kinds of poor people in the church. One kind is the naturally poor ones, and the other kind is the voluntarily poor ones. Today in the church, we have the first kind of poor people. But there is no second kind of poor people. On the contrary, there are rich people in the church, and the church is filled with affluence. However, although many people are rich in material goods, they are poor in faith, and the inward spiritual content among them becomes more and more depleted.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF VOLUNTARY POVERTY</H2><P>Since the time of Clement, the truth became less and less clear. On the one hand, men became more and more capable of analysis and expositions, but at the same time they lacked life and did not have much grace or righteousness. Even at the time of Augustine, the truth was still unclear. Historically speaking, the church was always on the decline. Eventually it fell to such a low degree that reactions rose up within the Catholic church. One of these reacting ones was Francis of Assisi. He was dissatisfied with the outward riches of the church. He himself was originally a rich man, or at least the son of a rich man. Within a few days, he sold everything and gave to the poor. He himself began to practice a life of voluntary poverty. However, the things he wrote are unreadable. You may tolerate a line or two of his writings, but by the third line they become intolerable. Although we cannot tolerate his writings, the practice of voluntary poverty is nevertheless a right one.</P><P>In the church, those who receive little should not be in want, and those who receive much should not have an excess (2 Cor. 8:12). It is not a sin to receive much, but it is a sin to receive much and to have excess. If a man knows the Lord, he will invest everything in the Lord. If a man says that he loves the Lord, yet will not invest in the Lord, his love is false. The Lord says that the poor we always have with us (John 12:8). He did not say that we always have the poor brothers with us in the church. Rather, He says that the poor we always have with us. Among the brothers and sisters, it is not difficult to be without want. As long as those who have excess would give away, poor brothers will not appear among us. The Lord's principle is not to keep, but to give. If we all give, there will not be unnecessary riches in the church. It is abnormal that some people are too rich in the church. All excess riches have to be given away. In the world, people would throw away their lives in exchange for money. But in the Bible, God wants our lives instead of money. We cannot be a Christian in an uncertain way. Our God is not uncertain; He is very specific. He wants not only our money, but our lives also.</P><P>Later, in Moravia God raised up Count Zinzendorf of Saxony. He was originally an aristocrat and a man of learning. For the Lord's sake, he set aside his estate to receive all kinds of believers. Through his work, the Moravians were raised up. Out of this group, many people were sent to foreign lands. The number of those sent out from them exceeds that sent from any other group and ranks highest in terms of percentage. After this, there was Sister Eva, who was a German. She also took the way of voluntary poverty.</P><P>In the last century, the Brethren were raised up. They were very strong in the truth. Although they did not like to talk very much about themselves, a few dozen of their leaders also sold all their possessions at one time to follow the Lord. For a Christian, the question of money must be settled once for all. If it is not settled, the Lord cannot have a way to go on. What is the meaning of degradation in the church? It means that the principle of economy has come into the church. Once the principle of economy comes in, everything will be reckoned according to value, and the Lord will have no way to go on.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DEFICIENCY OF THE REFORMATION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Recovery of Faith<br>without a Clear Understanding of Justification</H2><P>In Luther, we see the recovery of faith. However, Luther did not recover justification by faith. He only recovered faith, and he was not so clear concerning justification. History tells us that he once punished himself in order to be justified. In Rome, he once climbed up to a cathedral step by step in order to be justified. Later, he saw that a man is not justified by works, but by faith.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Bringing In National Churches</H2><P>Luther came out of Babylon, but he did not return to Jerusalem yet. He brought politics into the church and thought that by so doing, it would help the church. Little did he realize that no political power can help the church. On the contrary, any political power will only damage the church. In the end, the national churches were formed. The national churches are partnerships between politicians and believers. The one contributed Germany whereas the other contributed the doctrines, and the result was the national churches. In Germany, the Lutheran church became the national church. The reason the Lutherans embraced the power of politics was that Roman Catholicism was too strong. But by so doing, what we see was a change of nationality instead of a change of the church. The church was changed from a Roman church to a German church. In England, it became the Anglican church. Every Englishman automatically became a member of the Anglican church. As soon as a person was born, he was baptized in the church. No question was asked as to whether or not such a person was regenerated. The only thing that mattered was whether or not such a person was an Englishman. As long as a person was an Englishman and was born in England, he was a member of the church. Consequently, the tradition of infant baptism by sprinkling became very prevailing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RAISING UP OF INDEPENDENT CHURCHES</H2><P>With the rising up of the national churches, many pure seekers and lovers of the Lord became dissatisfied. They did not want to remain in the national churches. As a result, some independent free churches were formed. Soon after the Reformation, there were over two thousand independent churches. In Switzerland alone, there were over two hundred such churches. During this period of time, the Roman Catholic church persecuted the Protestant churches, and the Protestant churches in turn persecuted the smaller independent churches. To stop these small churches from being established, the English Parliament even passed a law to unify all the churches in England. However, this produced the so-called Nonconformists. They were faithful lovers of the Lord raised up by Him, who would not cooperate with the national churches. The government persecuted them and ordered them to take jobs five miles away from their former places of occupation. They could not work for the government, and all of them who were government officers were removed from their posts. Those who opposed the law were condemned.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF THE EQUALITY OF BELIEVERS<br>AND THE TRUTH OF BAPTISM</H2><P>After this, there were the Mennonites, who were the first group of believers to realize the error of a hierarchy. Among them, they recovered the title of "brothers," and they addressed each other as brothers. Some of them went to Russia to preach the gospel. In addition to them, the Baptists were also raised up. They saw the error of infant baptism, and they taught that a man must first be clear about the truth of baptism before he can be baptized. They were called the Anabaptists, and they were much persecuted at the beginning. These are recoveries of the outward things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF THE INNER LIFE</H2><P>In addition, there was the recovery of the inner life. Madame Guyon, Father Fenelon, and others brought in a recovery of the spiritual condition. These ones are now generally called the mystics. They practiced denying their self, joining themselves with God to oppose their self, giving no excuse to the self, and not asking God to spare His hand on them. In every age, we can find followers of their practice. In addition to these, there were also the Pietists and the Quietists.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RAISING UP OF THE PURITANS</H2><P>Later, the Puritans were raised up. Among them, some from Holland and England migrated separately to America. The ship The Mayflower was one of the vessels that carried these Puritan immigrants to the new land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF THE BRETHREN</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Heavenly Calling of the Church</H2><P>In the last century, God began to have a special recovery. First, He recovered the heavenly calling of the church. The church is like the Israelites in the Old Testament. It should not at any time look to earthly blessings. The church is a group of people who have been called by heaven. It is not their aim to reform society. God's people are those who take the heavenly way on earth. They have given up all hope for the world and society. To them, the world is passing away, and everything therein will be judged. The church's view is different from that of the world. What the church expects is heaven, and not world reforms. These words are familiar to us today, and we may not feel the power behind these words. But at the beginning, this matter was a tremendous recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Oneness of the Church</H2><P>The second thing the Brethren recovered was the oneness of the church. They saw the oneness of the Body of Christ and realized that the church today is in a state of ruin. Expositors such as J. N. Darby and F. W. Grant all agreed that the church today is in a state of ruin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RAISING UP OF JOHN WESLEY&#151;<br>THE RECOVERY OF SANCTIFICATION BY FAITH</H2><P>These recoveries occurred among the Brethren. In addition to them, John Wesley was raised up. He recovered the truth concerning sanctification. A man is not only justified by faith, but is also sanctified by faith. Wesley was indeed a servant of God, a dear brother, and a man greatly used by God. He bore the right testimony, but quoted the wrong Scriptures to prove his message. Although his quotations are wrong, the doctrine he preached was right. For example, he quoted 1 John 1:7 as a reference to sanctification. For this reason, some rejected his teachings altogether. This is to go too far. It is possible for a man to quote the wrong Scriptures. However, if he is the right person and he preaches the right doctrine, even if his quotations are wrong, the mistake is not fatal. On the other hand, if the quotations are correct, but the person is wrong, the problem is much more serious. We would rather see the person right and the quotations wrong, than to see the quotations right and the person wrong. Although he quoted the wrong Scriptures, God was still able to cause men to be sanctified.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF SANCTIFICATION<br>BY CONSECRATION</H2><P>After this, there was Robert Pearsall Smith, a porcelain merchant. He was the husband of Mrs. Hannah Whitall Smith, the writer of the book The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life. At that time, men were not very clear concerning the doctrine of sanctification. He preached that man is not sanctified by faith only, but by consecration also. Sanctification does not come merely by faith, but by consecration as well.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE KESWICK CONVENTION AND OTHERS</H2><P>In addition to him, there were others like Evan Hopkins of England and Theodore Monod of France. These ones, together with Smith in America, formed the so-called Keswick movement. In addition, there was Andrew Murray, a Dutchman. The raising up of these brothers set the general scene for the recovery. However, their recoveries were not complete. There were still recoveries of other minor parts. For example, we have the recovery of the hymns by Frances Ridley Havergal, and some other contributions by other writers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF THE CRUCIFIXION OF THE OLD MAN</H2><P>During the last century, God enlightened men concerning the matter of consecration and its importance through the brothers we have mentioned. However, their revelations were not deep enough. Consecration is not simply a kind of exchange, in which we offer to God all we have and all we are, and we take back from Him what He has and what He is. Darby told others that consecration is based on the casting off of the man of flesh and the removal of this man. The goal of the gospel is not only to forgive the sinner's sin, but to crucify the sinner. The gospel saves not merely by forgiving the sinner and delivering him from perdition, but by crucifying the sinner with the Lord. In preaching the gospel, we have to be careful. If we are not careful, we will easily preach the wrong thing. The gospel removes not only the sin in the flesh, but the person of the flesh. What goes to the heavens is the new man, and not the fleshly man. All spiritual lessons, including obedience and our service to the Lord, must be practiced in accordance with this principle. Even lessons as spiritual as those taught by Madame Guyon must be pursued according to the principle mentioned here by Darby.</P><P>Romans 7 says that we are dead to the law. This is why we can be married to Christ. Not only are our sins dead, but we ourselves are dead. If we were not dead, it would be unlawful and adulterous for us to be joined to Christ. If we are dead, we would not be our own person any longer, because the cross has removed our own person. Today there is no longer any need for this person to ask for forgiveness. Only a living person needs forgiveness; a dead person does not need forgiveness. The one who was dead in sin is the crucified old man, and the cross has removed this old man already. This was what Darby preached.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF THE TRUTH OF THE CROSS</H2><P>After this, we have Mrs. Penn-Lewis, who was raised up to preach the truth concerning the cross. She preached about the cross dealing with the old man. Her understanding was more advanced. Notwithstanding, today our understanding of the subject is more clear than that of Mrs. Penn-Lewis.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF THE TRUTH OF RESURRECTION</H2><P>After Mrs. Penn-Lewis, we have Mr. T. Austin-Sparks, who saw resurrection. We have been talking about resurrection for years, but we do not know what resurrection really is. Mrs. Penn-Lewis wrote two books about resurrection, but they are not very clear about the subject either. It was not until Brother T. Austin-Sparks wrote about resurrection in 1926 and published what he wrote in the Overcomer magazine that the world knew for the first time what resurrection is. When Miss Barber and I read his writings, we began to pay attention to this matter. Many people talk about resurrection, but they have not presented to others resurrection&#151;the real thing itself. When Brother Sparks talked about resurrection, light came. He presented to others the very resurrection itself.</P><P>What is resurrection? It is life going into death and passing through death; in the process, what succumbs to death dies, and what cannot die comes out of death alive. This coming out of death is resurrection. Resurrection is anything that death cannot swallow up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF THE REALITY OF THE KINGDOM</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Welsh Revival</H2><P>Let us go on to one more subject, the kingdom. The kingdom is a common subject, but to merely discuss the term "kingdom" is useless. The question is whether or not the kingdom as the very thing itself has been realized. When do men see the kingdom? I can say that it was during the Welsh revival that the kingdom as a real thing was recovered. Between 1901 and 1910, Evan Roberts brought in the Great Welsh Revival. This revival was unprecedented in church history. No other revival could match this one. Its effects cut far and deep. Roberts himself was a coal miner, and he did not receive much education. Yet God greatly used him. At that time he was only in his twenties, a very young man, and he was not eloquent at all in preaching. Yet his spirit was strong. His prayers were so powerful that it was said that even God had to answer these prayers. He learned from Mrs. Penn-Lewis and also from J. C. Williams. He did not have much schooling; yet when others touched him, they were saved and were brought to their knees. He was not eloquent; during the Welsh revival, he did not preach many messages. When he did stand up, his speaking lasted only fifteen minutes. Yet even those who dropped by to listen were known to be saved through his words.</P><P>Some have said that the Welsh revival was affected by China, because the revival broke out in 1901-1910, whereas in 1900 there was the Boxer Rebellion in China. During that rebellion, many Christians were martyred. After the rebellion, between 1901 and 1902, many Christians throughout the world began to pray for God's work. The answer to all those prayers was funneled into one man. Roberts himself was confined to his bed because of illness between 1903 and 1904, and he was not released until 1909. When he finally got up, he began to speak to everyone he met concerning the things he saw. In the Overcomer magazine, it was mentioned that many times during the meetings others would ask what he was going to say, and he himself would also wonder at the same time what he was going to say. Yet once his mouth was opened, something came out, and men saw the light.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Kingdom Being to Gain Ground for God</H2><P>During the past few years, I have seen a little of what God's kingdom is. God's kingdom is a great matter. Now when I pray, I pray for God's kingdom. God desires that His kingdom come on earth. In order for God's kingdom to come on earth, there is the need for the church's prayer.</P><P>What is the kingdom? The kingdom is man gaining ground for God on earth. Where God's kingdom is, there God gains the ground. Today man thinks that the kingdom is a question of history. Actually, the kingdom is a question of geography.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Kingdom Being<br>a Matter of Spiritual Warfare</H2><P>In order to have the kingdom and in order for God to gain the ground, there is the need for warfare. Hence, in order to recover the kingdom, we have to recover spiritual warfare. The messages on spiritual warfare were recovered by Mrs. Penn-Lewis. In her illness, she experienced spiritual warfare, and she saw that many people were deceived through their ignorance of spiritual warfare. Later, in collaboration with Evan Roberts, she wrote the book War on the Saints and released the truth concerning spiritual warfare. This light was hidden from man for two thousand years. Through Mrs. Penn-Lewis, it was recovered. Actually, this light was recorded in Ephesians 6 already, but no one before her had the experience of it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF THE REALITY<br>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Messages concerning the Body of Christ</H2><P>About 1930, Brother T. Austin-Sparks went on further to see the Body. From that time on, he continued to speak on the Body. He released over five or six hundred pages of messages on this subject. Yet what he released was but teachings only; the reality had not yet appeared.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Body Life</H2><P>The Lord's church is one Body because it has only one life. This Body comes out of one life. This life is the life of the Lord, which is the life of the Son of God. Since the Body comes out of one life, there is the need for coordination. We are not merely individuals, but we are parts of a whole. We are like the parts of a car; only when we come together can there be the whole car. We all come from one life. We need to realize today that the life we received is a Body life. What we have received individually is a "partial" life. Hence, we do not receive personal edification first and then become coordinated afterwards. Rather, in and by coordination we grow up to receive everything. If we see this fact, all those who will be saved after us will immediately see the reality of this fact and enter into it. As soon as they are saved, they will become persons who voluntarily hand themselves over to the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Proper Body Life Not Yet Realized</H2><P>The gospel is not prevailing today because the proper church is not yet manifested. In a proper church, as soon as a person is saved, he hands himself over to the church and sees the Body. Today, men do not have a proper consecration after they are saved. As a result, we have to go back and help them to make up their consecration. There is no proper church today. Hence, there is no place where you can show a saved person the normal condition of the church. The hindrance today is with us; we have not provided others with the necessary make-up lessons. If enough brothers and sisters would take the ground of God's absolute salvation and consecrate themselves fully to the Lord right after they are saved, and they would hand themselves over fully, the church will find the power and the authority to testify for the Lord and will bring others to the proper stand from the first day on.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RECOVERY TODAY<br>BEING ON OUR SHOULDERS</H2><P>Today, the responsibility of the recovery is on our shoulders. All the questions related to the recovery have to do with us. God's work in the world, and in China in particular, depends entirely on us. The responsibility has fallen on us. We have to see that in the Body there is only one life. If we see this, we will see the need for coordination. The problem that exists among the brothers and sisters reflects the problem that exists with us. If we are not the right kind of persons, we will not be able to preach the right kind of gospel. The gospel not only delivers men from sin, the world, and the self; it also delivers men from individualism, from money, and from everything else, into the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Last Recovery&#151;<br>the Coordination in the Body<br>and the Manifestation of Authority</H2><P>With each step that the Lord has taken in His recovery, the content of His recovery has become richer and richer. Today, it seems as if there is nothing more to be recovered. The recovery today has reached the stage of the Body. Perhaps this will be the last recovery. There may be other items of recovery, but as far as we know, when we reach the recovery of the coordination of the Body and the manifestation of authority, we have reached the final recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Taking the Way of Submission</H2><P>In order to arrive at this recovery, God requires that there be the manifestation of authority among us. We have to take the way of submission. If we submit, God will take the way of increase among us. The need today is that such a recovery be realized in us individually first. We have to be an all-inclusive person, and we should have all-inclusive experiences. The gospel we preach should be an all-inclusive gospel. When a man receives this gospel, not only are his sins forgiven, but he is brought into the Body. If we do this, in a few years' time the condition of the church will be entirely different. Today, the responsibility rests entirely on us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Having the Body Consciousness</H2><P>What we need today is a Body consciousness. The reality of the Body life lies in the Body consciousness. This is something that cannot be copied or imitated. In Kuling, one brother asked what his future holds. Once this brother asked this question, his future was finished already. In the Body we do not have an individual future; we only have the future of the Body. We would rather be wrong in the Body than be wrong in ourselves. I would rather submit to the Body than to seek for my personal future and offend the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEADING IN THE BODY</H2><P>Brother David Hsu asked: How do I know that I will not lead others into mistakes?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Judgment of the Body Being More Reliable</H2><P>Brother Nee: Actually, we are not aware of all the mistakes we make in our own lives. Who is responsible for these mistakes? Of course, we are responsible for them ourselves. Since we make mistakes in any case, I would rather make them in the Body. It is better to make mistakes in the Body than to make them in ourselves. If in the church today three or five people, or thirty or fifty people, know the will of God, and I do not have the right judgment concerning certain matters or persons, is it not better that I take their judgment than to make a judgment myself? In the Body, sometimes we become more clear when we do not know something, and we become unclear when we know too much. When a judgment is made by the Body, the responsibility rests on the Body. Sometimes when things happen to us and we are directly involved with them, we become affected by the factors involved and fail to have a clear discernment concerning the matters. But the Body is not affected by personal factors. It is not as easily influenced, and as such, its judgment is more reliable.</P><P>If we do not have any spiritual reality with us, these words may sound like the Catholic teachings. If we do not have any spiritual reality, Catholicism will indeed come in. But if spiritual reality is with us, we will realize that no matter how good our personal judgments may be, they can never be compared to the judgments of those with spiritual discernment in the Body. You cannot fight against the Body consciousness. Whenever you feel uncomfortable or uneasy, you have to give up and submit yourself to the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Learning to Submit to Authority</H2><P>Today we have to learn to submit to God's authority. Everywhere we see man's rebellion. In any kind of human institution, we see rebellion and insubordination. Man wants to be free and to be independent. He has his own proposals, views, and judgments. But there are no such things in the kingdom of God. In God's kingdom there is only order and submission. There is nothing better in the whole world than submission, and there is nothing more beautiful in the whole world than order. Here we have submission, and we submit one to another. Here we have no arguments, and no one strives to be the greatest. There is only divine order. What a beautiful thing it is when everyone is pursuing after submission!</P><P>Allow me to give a little testimony of my own. I began to learn this lesson in 1922. At that time, I was learning it in tears. Although the person to whom I had to submit might not necessarily be right, and although I might be right instead, if I refused to submit, I would not receive the discipline of the Body. Perhaps at that time, there was not the discipline of the Body yet. But at least, there was the discipline of the Holy Spirit. When I first began to work for the Lord, I was quite young. Another co-worker was five years older than I was. At the beginning he was quite zealous, but he did not have much light. However, God gave me quite a lot of light. At that time, many people exhorted men to believe in Jesus without being able to explain what they said. But I saw more light than others did with regard to the truth of the gospel. At one point, over sixty people wanted to be baptized, of whom ninety percent were saved through me. Since I had brought them to salvation, naturally I should have been the one to baptize them. But that other brother insisted that he would baptize them, for the reason that he was the older of us two. The Bible clearly indicates that whoever preaches the gospel also baptizes the ones he preaches to (Acts 8:35-38). I thought it was quite reasonable that I should baptize them. Later I went to Miss Barber, and she said that I should let the other brother baptize these ones. I asked her why, and she told me that the other brother was older than I was. Later I found another brother who was older than this one, and suggested that this second brother should carry out the baptizing. But Miss Barber insisted that the first one should carry out the baptizing. I was quite bothered. She told me that I should not reason, and she said, "Listen! From today on, you have to learn to listen to your brother." I thought that this brother was not clear about the truth or the way of God. Why then should I listen to him? This went on for three years. Every Sunday I fasted. God was teaching me the lesson of submission. Today I can work together with others because I have learned this lesson.</P><P>The Bible mentioned the centurion's word, "For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me" (Matt. 8:9). This is submission. Brother Witness Lee once said to me, "You are very severe when you speak on the platform, but you are not so severe when you step off the platform." Whether I am severe or not, I do feel that a person who will not submit to authority is a wild and disorderly person. Those who live in the church should submit to authority. A person who does not submit to authority may be saved, but he does not act like a regenerated person. Any time a person is free from any authority, he has no way to go on, and he does not have the reality of the church with him.</P><P>With God there is the anointing, and this anointing is poured upon the church. On the one hand, we have to submit to the anointing within us. On the other hand, we have to submit to the anointing in the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Protection and Blessings in the Body</H2><P>A Christian is most safe today, because for him, there is the protection of the Body. A man can be miles off the target if a boundary is not defined for him. Today, many truths have been established already, and there is no reason for us to stray off any longer. As long as we remain in the Body, the blessings and the anointing are here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING AN ABSOLUTE PERSON</H2><P>We have to see that the whole problem rests with us today. We have to realize how great our responsibility is. Because of our unfaithfulness, we dare not preach the complete gospel to the sinners. You must be a transformed person before you can preach a transforming gospel. You must be a different person before you can preach a different gospel. There must be a recovered person before there can be a recovered gospel. There must be men who are coordinated before there can be the gospel that brings in coordination. If we are not a certain type of person, we can never preach that certain type of gospel. We must be men of Acts 2 before we can preach the gospel of Acts 2. Only then will we produce more men of Acts 2. If your family, career, money, or position is your center, I have nothing to say. But I can tell you that you cannot be a co-worker. Unless we ourselves are the right kind of person, we can never expect others to be the right kind of persons. If we are not absolute, in twenty or thirty years God will raise up men who will be absolute. Whether or not God will find a way in this generation depends on whether or not there are absolute people in this generation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE IMPACT OF THE GOSPEL</H2><P>In the early churches, although the number of saved ones was not too great, they were all men who were on fire. Although many of them did not preach much, what they did say at the time of their martyrdom spoke louder than what we preach for a whole lifetime. What is needed today is nothing less than absolute obedience and absolute consecration. These are the things that will bring in the power. In his book The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbons described the sufferings of the martyrs. They were persecuted, exiled, and many times abused by the Roman soldiers. Yet the more the persecution came, the more people were saved. The question today is how much has the gospel laid hold of us. The more the gospel lays hold of us, the greater the impact of the gospel will be.</P><P>Whether or not we can cause the next generation to be a people of Acts 2 depends on how well we perform today. The question is whether or not we are willing to be torn down. The recovery may come to a halt when it comes to us, or it may have a new breakthrough from us. If God gains His way through us, those who are saved after us will not be like the saved ones we see today; a better breed will emerge. What others say and criticize is not important to us. The important thing is the kind of persons we are before God.</P><P>Our God is a God who is always going on. The Father works until now, and the Son also works (John 5:17). If we offer up all our time, money, and everything, power will come. At the beginning, the Lord demanded that the believers sacrifice their lives for following Him. The calling today is more serious than it was then. Formerly, we may have exhorted others to believe in the Lord by giving them a pat on the back and saying nice words to them. But today, to ask others to believe in the Lord is to ask of them their lives. Formerly, we were begging others to believe; it was as if they were granting us a favor to believe in the Lord. Today, the situation is turned; a man has to realize that to believe in the Lord will cost his very life. I am afraid that there are not many places on earth where the kind of message we have today would be preached.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY TO GO ON</H2><P>In order to match God's work, the way before us needs some adjustments. I can mention a few of these. First, there is the need to train people. In training people, we need to pay attention to the vessels themselves. The vessels must be right before the work can be right. Second, we have to strengthen our existing works. Third, we have to learn to judge others and to deal with others. We have to stop those who are too much and strengthen those who are not enough. In the future, we will judge the world and the angels (1 Cor. 6:2-3). For this reason, we have to learn to judge today. The first one we have to learn to judge is ourselves. If we do not judge ourselves, our judgment will not be clear. If we ourselves have been dealt with, our judgments will be accurate. Those who are the ministers of the word should especially learn the proper lessons. At the same time, all the brothers and sisters should learn to receive the portion of the ministers of the word.</P><P>Fourth, money must have no place in the heart of the co-workers. The co-workers must be delivered from the bondage of money. Any feeling for money in the co-workers must be completely taken away. We hope that the Lord will work to such an extent that we can have all things in common in the church.</P><P>Fifth, the local churches should pay much attention to the newly saved ones, to properly equip them and to render them the clear teachings. Two kinds of perfectings are necessary. One is the preaching of the gospel. This must be done year round in all the places. The other is the edification of the new believers. This needs a few dozen topics with which we educate the new believers week after week. These topics are fixed topics; there is no need to devise more advanced topics. The same topics can be used year round. Those who will serve as the speaking vessels need to learn the topics first. They should also know how to use the adequate materials.</P><P>Some brothers should remain in a place to wait on the Lord. Some should spend more time traveling to other places, while the rest stay in one place. Everyone should learn to work together as a Body. There should not be a church that is only tied to its own "turf," one that is closed to outsiders.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AS CONSECRATED ONES, LIVING FULLY FOR GOD</H2><P>There are certain things concerning consecration that are difficult to speak about. According to the Bible, there is no such thing as an unconsecrated saved one. Everyone who is saved is consecrated to the Lord. All the brothers and sisters who have consecrated themselves should move and act together with the co-workers.</P><P>The Bible says that the poor we have always with us. It is wrong for us to pile up goods in our houses. The basic principle and requirement of the Scriptures is that we should help the poor. Whether or not a poor person is one among us, the Bible requires that we give to him. If you have never remembered the poor, your heart will not be enlarged. When you give things away, you will learn to have an enlarged heart, and you will develop an enlarged view. Today it is difficult to find people with large hearts and broad views. The Bible teaches us not to be bound by material riches. Every commandment in the Bible is there for us to keep. If we fail to keep any one of them, we will suffer loss. It is easy to give to our own brothers, but it is not easy to give to outsiders. Nevertheless, the requirement of the Scriptures is that we remember the poor.</P><P>Many brothers and sisters do not realize how the co-workers live. Some co-workers have no fire on their stove five days in a row. Others do not have money to provide education for their children or adequate support for their family's livelihood.</P><P>We should help the brothers and sisters to choose their jobs in a proper way. In this kind of coordination, it is right for some to devote themselves to making money. But who should be the ones to make money? Only those who are fully consecrated are qualified to make money. Only this kind of money-making will be of any use. When the Israelites left Egypt, they took all the money with them (Exo. 12:36). When they crossed the Red Sea, the money crossed over with them. Any money that was left in Egypt, regardless of how much it was, was useless. Only those who have passed the Red Sea can employ their money to the proper use for the building up of the tabernacle. What is needed first is for the person himself to be delivered. Second, the money has to follow. Then third, there is the building up of the tabernacle. Formerly, we did not have the boldness to say this. But now we do. A person must first consecrate himself. If he does not do this, God will not want his money. The sin of the golden calf must first be exposed, and a person must first be delivered from such sin, before the question of the gold can be settled. It was because man had first worshipped idols that the gold went to the calf. The gold should have been given to the tabernacle. But because of idolatry, the gold went to the calf. Hence, the worship of the golden calf was not only a matter of sin, but a loss for the tabernacle. It was the same gold. But when it was placed on the golden calf, it was wrong, and it had to be ground into powder. On the contrary, when it was placed in the tabernacle, it was right. The same material could be directed toward different objects. One object was the idol. The other object was the tabernacle. In the New Testament, covetousness is placed side by side with idolatry. Idolatry is linked to covetousness (Col. 3:5). Where there is deliverance from idolatry, there is deliverance from money.</P><P>Today, all the co-workers should go on despite all kinds of sufferings. However, the rest of the brothers and sisters should also learn to be consecrated ones. This does not mean that everyone has to be a preacher. However, it means that everyone has to be a consecrated person. What is needed today are fully consecrated people. Not everyone is a preacher, but everyone should be for God full-time.</P><P>As long as there is a group of people who will go on in this way, wherever they may be, we will see the emergence of Acts 2 Christians. If we are consecrated, God will have a way to go on. If we do not consecrate ourselves, God's word will be jeopardized and will be depreciated. Acts 2 Christians are those who are at a crossroad; they see exactly the way ahead, and they have the boldness to tell others the right way to go. The more we fear that others will not believe, the more we will beg others to believe. But if we have enough deposit within us and we are clear about the way ahead of us, we will have the assurance to speak, and others will have the confidence to believe us. The reason others cannot have faith in us is that we do not have faith in the first place. However, if we are clear, others will follow us. If we ourselves are not clear, we will surely depreciate and discredit God's word. The issue today is fully with us.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S WORK OF RECOVERY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (5)</H1><P>Date:Monday, 6:30 p.m., April 12, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><P>Brother Chu-en asked: Will the church in Jerusalem and the church in Antioch become another form of a "central" church or "head" church?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SEEING THE BODY LIFE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Holy Spirit Being<br>the Starting Point of the Work</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: Our work today does not begin from Antioch. Nor does it begin from Jerusalem. Our work today begins from the Holy Spirit. The basic question is the starting point of our work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Work Being Carried Out in the Body</H2><P>We have to realize that the church is a Body. As such is the case, our work cannot be carried out individually, but it must be carried out in a corporate way. Neither can we be a Christian individually. Perhaps a person is a well-behaved Christian. However, he must be put together with others before his real condition is made manifest. Only those who know the Body will deal with themselves and coordinate with others. A man may have the greatest achievements and may appear to be very spiritual. But this should not be mistaken as true progress and true spirituality. Only by working with others will we realize whether there is true progress and whether the self is truly dealt with. When the self assumes the throne, it sees no one but itself. But if the self is dealt with, we will see others and will not see ourselves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Body Being the Test of Spirituality</H2><P>We must always bear in mind that our life is but a part of the whole. We must live together with the whole. There are severe disciplines in the Body. The way of the Body is the cross. Those who have not seen the cross do not see the Body. When relatives live far away from one another, they maintain good harmony. But when they move close together, they become enemies. When a person lives in a house by himself, there is comfort and bliss. But when two brothers live together, they have to learn to take the cross. The more people live together and the closer they are to one another, the more crosses there are. Sometimes a person is put in a situation where he has crosses all over him. What man considers as spiritual progress does not count unless it can pass the test of the Body. The only thing that will count is that which can pass the test of the Body. No matter how great a person's works are, how many gifts he has, and how much life he possesses, if he is not in the Body, none of these matters count. Only when a person puts himself among the co-workers and the brothers and sisters will he know how much he has been delivered from the self and how much he knows about the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Accepting the Limitations and<br>the Coordination in the Body</H2><P>The first thing we have to know is the Body of Christ. Once a person sees the Body of Christ, spontaneously he will see coordination. In the Body, the Lord has His assigned authorities. Who is an authority? Whoever has the ministry has the authority. Ministry is authority. We have to accept our own limitations. We must realize that we are only one minister before the Lord and that we have to work together with other ministers before we can meet the need. We should seek for coordination. When one member cannot meet the need, he needs the coordination of the other members. Only by coordination can we receive the supply from the Body everywhere we go. A man needs the coordination of the other members. At the same time, he needs to accept the limitations of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Submission to Authority<br>Being Submission to the Head</H2><P>Authority is the deputy of the Head. When the eyes see, it is actually not the eyes that are seeing, but the head that sees. When the limbs move, they are not the ones that are moving, but it is the head that is moving. All the movements of the body are headed up by the head. What is ministry? Ministry is the movement of the Head. Whenever we are at odds with the ministry, we are at odds with the Head. In the Bible, the overwhelming majority of authorities are deputy authorities. When we speak about submission to authority, we mean submission to deputy authorities. The real manifestation of authority is the expression of the Head. To submit to authority is to submit to the Head. For this reason, God's children ought to learn submission.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Accepting the Ministry<br>Rather Than Repeating the Ministry</H2><P>Ministry is expressed in two things: gift and authority. The gift is the power of the ministry. It is also the expression of authority. A man cannot accept the gift while rejecting the authority. For example, on the one hand, the eyes have the gift of seeing. On the other hand, they have the authority, and other members have to accept them. If other members do not accept the eyes, they will not receive the supply of their gift. As long as you are a member of the Body, you have to accept the gifts of the other members. There is no need for you to repeat their gifts. Concerning the ministry, there is only the question of accepting; there is no need of repeating. What we have to do today is not a matter of repeating others' ministries, like copying writing with carbon paper. All we have to do is to accept.</P><P>Always remember that you are only a member; you are not the whole Body. No one is all-inclusive. If a person is all-inclusive, he is no longer a member. The parts of a car are only the parts; they are not the whole. The parts cannot equal the whole car.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Every Member<br>Enjoying the Riches of the Body</H2><P>Although I am only a member, I can share the riches of the Body. Every member in the Body shares the riches of the Body. My fingers never complain that they cannot see. My ears never complain that they cannot walk. They never say, "How come I cannot walk as the feet do?" The many gifts in the Body are there to perfect the saints. This is why there is no division in the Body, and there are no conflicting ideologies. Although the position of the hand dictates that it cannot be the speaking member, as long as the mouth can speak, the hand is satisfied. For the mouth to speak is the same as for the hand to speak. The life that we received is a partial life; it is not the whole life. When we experience the riches of the other members in this way, the Body is perfected. Under such circumstances, how can the individual members be poor, and how can they be useless?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Coordination Dealing with the Self</H2><P>Many people think that what they have is their own, and that what others have is not theirs. However, we have to realize that individualism is the worst thing there is in the Body. In the Body of Christ, individualism must be removed. The greatest test to the self is in the meetings, in the church, and among the brothers and sisters. On the one hand, we have to see that we are members individually. On the other hand, we have to see that we are a Body together with many other members. It is easy to deal with unbelievers; the minute they walk through the door, they will realize that they have the wrong address and have stumbled into the wrong place. But it is not so easy to deal with individualism. Many times, individualism creeps into the church without one realizing it. It is when a person is being coordinated together that his self life is most severely dealt with. The minute a man lives in coordination, his self is dealt with.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LIVING IN THE REALITY OF THE BODY LIFE</H2><P>We must see the Body life before we can consider the question of the church in Antioch. First, there is the Body life; then we have the church in Antioch. For this reason, before we discuss the question of Antioch, we must first have some make-up lessons. If the reality of the Holy Spirit is present in the church, the question of central control no longer exists. However, if there is not the reality of the Holy Spirit, instead only approval by vote, planning, and resolutions in our work, what we have will be more than central organizations; it will be Roman Catholicism.</P><P>The Catholics say that there is only one church, that their priests are the only kind of people who can understand the Bible, and that their church is the only true church. It is true that there is only one church. But the way the Roman Catholics interpret this oneness is not the right one. How can something right become not right in the hands of the Catholics? We have to realize that it is right for the church to be one. But in the Catholic church, there are the human ideas, methods, and organizations. As a result, that which is right becomes wrong. Luther gave us two things: justification by faith and an open Bible. It is true that the Lord's recovery has made it possible for everyone to read the Bible, but this does not mean that everyone is able to interpret the Bible. Some do not have the gift of interpretation, yet they insist on interpreting the Bible. The result is errors. Some think that by putting together a few verses they can come up with a new doctrine. To do so not only produces wrong teachings, but it takes men out of the sphere of God's grace. Some would not be subdued even when others have pointed out the error in their teachings; they would still insist on speaking. These people can never be taught.</P><P>God has set up teachers in the church (1 Cor. 12:28). The teachers are those who interpret the Bible. In the church, some have been set up to interpret the Bible. The meeting spoken of in 1 Corinthians 14 has the prophets as its center. Not everyone can interpret the Scriptures. In the meeting, when those who can interpret the Scriptures stand up to speak, the others should discern. However, this does not mean that the interpretation of one or two, or of a few, will ascertain a truth. The speaking is done by one or two, but the others have to discern. Even when the congregation is not able to discern, the words of the prophets must still be judged by the Spirit of the Lord.</P><P>Antioch was not a center, because it was not the product of an organization, but the product of the Holy Spirit. Once the church is separate from the Holy Spirit and once it has lost its spiritual reality, it becomes the Roman Catholic Church. It is possible for Catholicism to be found among us. The basic question today is not the method of Antioch, but the kind of person we are. Are we a person living in the spiritual reality? This is the basic issue. Whether or not a local church can become a central church depends basically on whether or not that church is spiritual. This is the foremost issue.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO LOCAL CHURCH BECOMING A HEAD CHURCH</H2><P>Factually speaking, the church in Antioch could not have become a head church either. Antioch in fact had never exercised supervision over other churches. One local church cannot exercise supervision over another church. However, the work has the right to exercise supervision over a local church. The church in Antioch never exercised supervision over another church, but the apostles who went out from Antioch did exercise supervision over other churches. When a problem arises in a local church, the matter has to be brought to the attention of the workers. First Timothy says that an accusation against an elder must be accompanied by the word of two or three witnesses (5:19). An accusation cannot be based on rumors or hearsay; there must be witnesses, and the accusations must be presented to Timothy. Timothy was a worker. This is why he could deal with the problem of the elders in a locality. Antioch was only one local church. Jerusalem was also another local church. As far as their being a church is concerned, the question of a head church never existed. But as far as the work is concerned, it is something different.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE STARTING POINT OF THE WORK BEING<br>THE ONENESS OF THE BODY</H2><P>The starting point of the work in Antioch was the sending forth of two or three men. However, if workers are sent out by the work, the question of organization may come in. When we are having our gathering this time, brothers from different localities have come on their own accord. Such a kind of gathering is not a product of organizations, teachings, or doctrines. It is a product of the Body's need. There is only one Body. What is manifested in all the places is the same life. This life is the reality of this Body. The work is produced out of this reality. This is the Lord's standard. If we compare our work with the Lord's standard, we will see that we have surely come short. The Lord has shown us today that individual works can never come up to the standard of the Body. If we do not see this, but insist instead on our individual works, we will face a stone wall. All works that are not the issue of the Body life will sooner or later hit a stone wall. The Lord will lead us to the point where we have to take the way of the Body. He will lead us to the point where we will not be able to go on or even to live if we do not take the way of the Body. If a man falls into the river, surely he will cry out for help. In the same way, the Lord will force us to cry out for help and for rescue out of our individual works. This is the starting point of the work. The starting point of the work is the oneness of the Body.</P><P>The electricity that comes from the power plant is one, yet the places where it shines are many. Although it shines in many places, the electricity in these many places is under the control of the same power plant. Today, the works in all the localities should be under the fellowship of the one Body. No place should set up its own bunker or defense line. Today, we should express the life of the Body in the different localities. If we make the churches in our localities little kingdoms and territories bounded by their own "turfs," we are wrong.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TWO LINES OF THE WORK</H2><P>In the Bible, there are only two groups of workers. Other than these two groups, God did not have His eyes on any other institution of Christian work. These two groups of workers are the group from Jerusalem and the group from Antioch. In addition to these two groups, there were other workers. For example, the book of Philippians mentions some others who preached Christ (Phil. 1:15-17). Yet the Lord did not pay much attention to these ones; He only paid attention to the workers from Jerusalem and those from Antioch. Since the Bible pays little attention to these other ones, we pay little attention to them also. The Lord emphatically placed in the Bible two lines composed of two groups of workers, the line of Paul and the line of Peter. For this reason, we have to be clear about these two lines.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ORGANIZATION BEING THE RESULT<br>OF THE LACK OF LIFE</H2><P>The reason there are headquarters is that there is the lack of life. Once life is lacking, organization comes in. In the Body of Christ, organization is the heaviest burden. When a person is healthy, he does not feel the weight of his body. Once a person is ill, he feels the weight of his body. The more a person is ill, the heavier his body is to him. When a person dies, his body becomes the heaviest. It becomes so heavy that he has to be lifted up by others. When there is life, the body is a body. When life is gone, the body becomes a corpse. In the same principle, without life, headquarters appear. Once life is gone, there is the need for an organization to come in to arrange everything. As long as there is life in the Body of Christ, it will not be a problem even if this Body becomes very large. This is like saying that as long as there is life in the human body, a person does not feel the weight of this body no matter how heavy and big this body becomes. But as soon as this body becomes a corpse, it will become very difficult to lift it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LOCAL CHURCHES NOT BECOMING A METHOD</H2><P>Today we cannot make the truth concerning the local churches a method. If we make it a method, it will become very dead indeed. The question is not Catholicism or local churches. The question is the church being in doctrine or in life. I fear method as much as I fear Catholicism. The local church cannot become a method. Once it becomes a method, it will become very, very heavy. This is our basic problem today.</P><P>We cannot say that the Catholic church is all wrong. If the Catholic church would remove her idols, the oneness that she talks about is right.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING "HANDING OVER"</H2><P>I still need to say something concerning the question of "handing over."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Handing Over Being a Make-up Lesson<br>and Not a Teaching</H2><P>The matter of "handing over" must never become our teaching. It is not a teaching, but a "make-up" lesson. The reason there is the need for such a make-up lesson is that the matter was not taken care of properly at the beginning. It is like a man riding on a train; he should first buy the ticket and then board the train. However, some people have boarded the train without paying for the ticket. As a result, there is the need for some kind of make-up measure. Originally, tickets should be bought at the train station. After a man is saved, he should immediately consecrate himself (Rom. 6:6, 12-13), and he should not have to wait until a later date to make it up. But many Christians have not done this properly, and the church has not presented this need to them properly right from the beginning. We can say that today the church has given the believers a "bonus ride"; they board the train without paying for the ticket. But sooner or later, they still must pay for the ticket.</P><P>For the new ones who have just come in, we do not need to ask them to hand themselves over. What they need is to consecrate themselves. The reason there is a "handing over" is that the consecration was not done properly at the beginning. As a result, there is the need for such a make-up lesson. The standard of salvation is not high enough today, and many of the items a person should have acquired at the time of salvation are lost. Strictly speaking, when a man is saved, he should be fully consecrated and should be a person who lives fully for the spread of the gospel. As soon as a person comes in, we should lay the full demand on his shoulder. If we can do this, none among us will still be holding hands with the world after we are saved, or will have to come back at a later date to consecrate ourselves.</P><P>In the Gospels, when men thronged to follow the Lord, He presented His requirements to them. He explained that a man must take up his own cross before he can follow Him (Matt. 10:38; 16:24). The Lord never lowers His standard. On the contrary, He lifts the standard high. He says that man should follow Him, and that if a man is to follow Him, he has to do this and do that. Let me emphasize that after a man is saved, unless he consecrates himself, he cannot go on. Unless he takes up his cross, he cannot go on. If you want to come to the Lord, you have to consecrate yourself, and you have to take up your cross and give up the world and your individualism. All these things must be clearly dealt with at the time a person is saved.</P><P>The matter of "handing oneself over" is a measure taken because nothing else could be done. It is like a man boarding a train without a ticket. Since he cannot get off the train again, the only way is for him to buy a ticket then. For now, we try to settle for the term "handing over." One day, when everyone is consecrated as soon as he is saved, there will be no need for anyone to "hand themselves over" any longer. It is because the things that should be there on the first day are lost, and everyone has boarded the train without a ticket; some have climbed into the carriages through the windows, while others have walked in without any ticket. Although these have boarded the train without any ticket, they cannot go on with their free ride the rest of the time. Sooner or later, they nevertheless have to pay for their tickets. There is a difference between buying a ticket on the train and buying it at the station. To buy it on the train is abnormal, whereas to buy it at the station is normal. If everyone buys his ticket on the train, there will be no need for a ticket booth at the station any longer. If everyone buys his ticket on the train, you might just as well move the ticket booth into the train.</P><P>I am afraid that after some time the matter of "handing over" will become a new terminology among us. It is possible that in the future the matter of "handing over" will become a peculiar thing among us. If this happens, those teachers who come after us will write and ask us about the scriptural foundation for the practice of "handing oneself over." There is no such doctrinal term as "handing over." We borrow this term today because men do not have a proper and good beginning. If everyone begins in a proper way, there is no need to bring up this question any longer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Proper Start for the New Believers</H2><P>There is a big difference between a proper salvation and an improper salvation. One woman can give birth to a twelve-ounce baby, whereas another can give birth to a twelve-pound baby. The church should bear the responsibility in its ministry to help the new ones to have a good beginning. There is a great difference between the way taken by those who have a proper beginning and those who do not. Among the ones raised up by the Lord throughout the ages, many did have a good beginning. Once a person has a good beginning, he can go on in a proper way. As long as the beginning is clean-cut, that one can go on properly no matter how little he understands and sees at the beginning. There are others who dragged their feet along when they first came in. With such, their way cannot be straight. Once a person is saved, he should have a clear-cut separation from sin and the world. The question of money has to be settled. The question of consecration has to be settled, and the question of individualism also has to be settled. What the future holds for a person depends on God. After Paul brought others to salvation, he committed those saved to the grace of God (Acts 14:23; 20:32). No doubt in the way ahead a person needs God's grace. But in the initial stage, there must be a clear-cut salvation. If the beginning is not good, the make-up lesson later will not be easy.</P><P>Brother Tang asked: Is it one thing to go to God and another thing to go before man?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Need for the Work<br>of the Holy Spirit in the Gospel</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: There are six lines to take in preaching the gospel. One can start from love, righteousness, judgment, sin, the world, or vanity. However, no matter which line you take, there is the need of the work of the Holy Spirit. The result of the work of the Holy Spirit is just one thing: to subdue a person. The real gospel is one that subdues and softens a person. All those who think that they are doing God a favor by believing in Him are unqualified ones. Once a person sees the gospel, whether it is through the preaching of love, righteousness, or judgment, he will surely be softened and subdued.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Center of the Gospel<br>Being God</H2><P>When we preach the gospel, we have to present the proper way to others. The question of the world and of our service to the Lord must be dealt with together. We have to see that the center of the gospel is God and not ourselves. It is not that we gain something for ourselves, but that God gains something for Himself. As soon as a person is saved, he has to realize that everything belongs to God. Our occupations are not ours; they are God's. The doctors have to see that their occupation is not to be a doctor, but to serve God. They are only working as a doctor on the side. If a man is not willing to take this way or to accept the Lord and be baptized, we will not force him to do so. But we cannot lower the standard. As soon as a person is saved, we have to tell him that from now on he is no longer an individual person, but a member in the Body. As such, he needs to learn to listen to others and to submit to others.</P><P>If the church will not take this way, it will always remain sub-standard. If Brother Tang drinks cow's milk today, no one would laugh at him. But if he still takes his mother's milk, it would be a big joke. Strictly speaking, the church should have learned obedience already. But now it is going back to re-learn this lesson. This is why, in order to take the straight way today, we have to put everything upon a person the day that he is saved. Those who are saved must begin in a proper way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Minister of the Gospel Being<br>One Who Lives the Gospel</H2><P>We must be a certain kind of person before we can produce that kind of person. The gospel demands not only that we preach it, but that we live it. The gospel must not only be heard, but must also be seen. No preaching can match the act of a martyr. More people are gained through an act of martyrdom than through the work of preaching.</P><P>There was a sister who was nineteen or twenty years old. For the Lord's sake, she was banished to Siberia. On her way in the train, she comforted her family and said to them, "Do not cry for me. Cry instead for those who do not have God. What I have far exceeds what they have. I am happy to suffer for the sake of my beloved Lord. The suffering that I endure can never match that of my Lord." A young thirteen-year-old boy sitting close by heard this word, and he was greatly moved to believe in the Lord. Later, he became one of the great workers used by the Lord in southern Czarist Russia.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Need for Impact in the Gospel</H2><P>Strictly speaking, we need men of Acts 2 before we can have messages of Acts 2. What we have to do today is not simply to preach, but to have an impact on others. If we preach the gospel in this way, a fleshly man will not even be able to come into the church, let alone to go on afterwards. If there are such men and there are those who live this kind of life, corporately there will be the impact and the influence, and others will catch on to the warmth and the joy. Life is a matter of consciousness and feeling. With some people, you can only shake their hands; you cannot touch their spirit or their real person. If what a person has are the things of God, what others will sense in him will only be the things of God. If what a person has is the life of God, what others will sense in him will be life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MINISTRY BEING A MATTER<br>OF THE INWARD BURDEN</H2><P>All proper ministers are burdened with a message. If a man has a ministry, he will always be burdened with a few strong words that always remain with him. These few words become his burden. Sometimes the burden may appear very small, but the more the person explains it, the more words there will be. It is like a woolen yarn; the more you pull it, the more yarn you see. Any ministry that is of any worth is a ministry with a burden. Within that ministry, there is a specific burden.</P><P>With some people, all the time they are preaching on the podium, their minds are spinning. With some others, all that comes out of them is empty words. When others listen to the words, they do not receive any Spirit; all that they receive is the sounds. All real ministries have a burden within their words. The ones speaking may come feeling heavy, but they should leave feeling light. When they speak, they speak with a burden from within. If a man does not have a burden, any preaching he conducts with his mind and thoughts will be useless. A ministry must have a ministry's burden. The greatest suffering is for a person to come with something but to find no one to pick up his words. In the end, he carries back the same burden that he brings with him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING THE MOVE<br>OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES</H2><P>The problem of the move of the local churches must be solved in the Body. It is useless to try to solve it separately. The Lord must first have a way among us. Only when He has a way among us will He have a way among the churches. If He does not get through with us, He will not be able to solve the problems separately in the different localities.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED TODAY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Committing Oneself to the Body</H2><P>I see clearly that with our present condition, we need a second salvation. This is a great matter. The term "handing over" is only our borrowed term. I do not wish that it be taken by others and used as a standard terminology. Originally, man was rebellious, individual, and unwilling to hand himself over. Now through the work of the Lord, he is willing to drop everything and to hand himself over voluntarily. Today, if a man wants to hand himself over willingly, he has to do it; and if he does not want to hand himself over, he nevertheless has to do it. Some may think that they cannot hand themselves over, but they should go ahead and try it. Once a sacrifice is on the altar, the altar will sanctify the sacrifice. This is like some people saying that they cannot believe and that they have too many questions. But once they decide to believe, all their questions are solved. A person can believe even though he has many doubts and questions. As long as a person is willing, God can work on him. If a man thinks that he cannot hand himself over, all he has to do is to place himself in the church. The church will help him to become able. If one individual has some problem, he can ask for help from the church; a few others can come along to help him to hand himself over. Today, as long as man makes a little move, God will move along with him. The handing over that we speak of today is not an individual handing over, but a handing over that is done in fellowship. Such handing over is a kind of committing of ourselves. It may seem that a person is only putting himself on the altar on a trial basis, and it may seem that God is only accepting such a one on a trial basis. Actually, whether or not a man considers his move a trial effort, God takes it up seriously. He takes up those who do it whole-heartedly, and He also takes up those who do it half-heartedly. Today, when we hand ourselves over, we are committing ourselves to the Body. The Body is our greatest protection. In the coming days, we shall see that those who do not live in the Body will suffer great loss. The supply of the ministry is in the Body. Once we are separated from the Body, we are cut off from the supply of the ministry.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Realizing the Supply of the Body</H2><P>The book of Acts indicates that when Paul was in Athens, he was provoked in his spirit and was ill at ease (Acts 17:16). Yet when Timothy joined him in Corinth, he immediately received the supply (Acts 18:5). This is like a certain brother passing by your locality, or a new one joining your meeting. Immediately, you can feel the supply. Sometimes, when a few brothers visit a locality, supply follows them wherever they go. The brothers may not even need to say anything. All they have to do is to sit there, and the supply is there. Many times, as long as there is the proper audience, a speaker will be able to release his burden. The thing that causes the most suffering is for a person to come with a burden and to go home with the same burden on him.</P><P>Since we are a Body, we affect one another. However, we are not very clear how we affect one another. Sometimes we feel that our fellowship with the Lord is particularly intimate. At other times, we have some inexplicable feelings. The reason for these phenomena is that there exists a supply in the Body. With the Body life there is a supply. This supply is a reality. However, we do not know how this supply affects the members. In the Body, we should not be a brother or sister who consumes others' supply; we should have a clear realization of the Body. All our failures and weakenings today are due to the fact that we behave as individual Christians. There are some things that we cannot explain very clearly today. In the days ahead, perhaps there will be the opportunity for us to speak about them in a clearer and more precise way.</P><P>During the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, many Christians were martyred. At the same time that this was going on, many churches around the world had the feeling that something was happening. Many people were depressed in their spirit for many days, and they felt the need for prayer. This feeling was not something that came from the physical eyes or the ears. It was a feeling of the Body. Who can say that the faithful martyrs were not supplied during those hours by the effect of these prayers? Miss Barber was in England at that time, and she was oppressed in her spirit. She felt the need to pray. Soon after that, she found out what had happened.</P><P>Whenever one part of our body becomes sick, the other parts of the body will come to the sick member's aid and will try to deal with the sickness. In the same way, there is a supply in the Body of Christ. The Body life is not a term, but a reality. Many people think that the church is only a mysterious and abstract Body. They do not realize that this Body is a reality.</P><P>First Corinthians 11:29 mentions the discerning of "the body." The Body denotes two things: the Lord's Body, and the Body of Christ. Here it only mentions the body, without making reference to either the Lord's Body or the Body of Christ. Therefore, on the one hand, it refers to the Lord's Body, whereas, on the other hand, to the Body of Christ. Within this Body, there are the riches of the Lord, and there are the riches of Christ. Every Christian can receive the benefits of the Holy Spirit and of the Lord's grace in this Body. The greatest lack among Christians today is the supply of the Body. May the Lord open our eyes to see this Body and to realize the supply in this Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PRINCIPLES OF OFFERING</H2><P>Let us also consider a little the principles of offering.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Material Offerings&#151;<br>Not a Matter of Amount,<br>but a Question of Where the Heart Lies</H2><P>The Bible speaks about offerings with respect to a few things. The first is material offerings. There is no set principle as to the amount one should offer. Some offer more, others offer less. Some time ago, a few brothers in Ku-tien sold all their possessions. At that time, I stopped them temporarily from doing this. There is no set principle to offering. Some offer everything they have. Christ says that a man must sell everything to follow Him. John the Baptist said that those who have two garments should give one away (Luke 3:11). The Gospels tell us to care for the poor. In the Epistles, we see that the church should care for the widows among us. However, a person must first care for his own household (1 Tim. 5:16, 8). Second Corinthians 8:15 says that "he who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack."</P><P>The problem today is not how much a person should offer, but the fact that money has laid hold of man's heart. In God's work, no one can keep his money, on the one hand, and say that his heart loves the Lord, on the other hand. The Bible says that where our money is, there is the heart also (Matt. 6:21). In order for our hearts not to be ensnared by money, we have to let the money go. If the money goes out of our pocket, the heart goes out with it. If a man loves the Lord, he will be able to choose voluntary poverty. Voluntary poverty is the way for the heart to be released. Sometimes God will ask a person to sell all he has. Sometimes He will only ask a person to give what he has in excess. Whatever it may be, the heart has to be released. In Acts, the apostle rebuked Ananias for keeping back what he had in excess (Acts 5:3-4). Today we should not have anything in excess. To have anything in excess is a shame in the church. The church should not see any excess. If there is any excess, it should be given away.</P><P>Sister Eva said that every time she went to bed, she would always consider how she could save something more from her spending in order that others may receive more. We need to take care of our livelihood, and we need to take care of our family. But that is not this issue today. As long as we would set aside a portion from our income and would lower our standard of living a little, we will be able to give away all our excess.</P><P>Today, when we speak of handing ourselves over, we are not talking about what we have to do to take care of our money. Rather, we are saying that a person has to offer himself up for the Lord and for the gospel. Brothers and sisters who are engaged in an occupation, the Lord needs your ministry in your job! These few years we are short of new co-workers. Formerly, at its peak we had about four hundred co-workers. Today we only have about two hundred, with two hundred short. In order to fill up the gap of these two hundred workers, there must be a group of people who would go to make money. Formerly, I dared not say such a word. But today I dare to say such a word. Some should go to make money and offer their money to the Lord's service. They should consecrate themselves to make money for the Lord's service. Perhaps such a one can make a million dollars. He will only take what he needs to sustain his livelihood. The rest he will give to the church. If you are only a spectator here, nothing will happen to you. But if you want to give yourselves for the co-workers' need, it demands your life.</P><P>Of course, God does not want us to go to the extremes. He wants us to be in moderation. First He wants us; then He wants what is ours. We ourselves have to come to Him first before we can bring what we have to Him. If we do not come, God will not accept what we have. All the brothers and sisters have to see that everything is for the Lord and that everything has to center around the Lord. We must have the same center. Although some function in their money-making ministry while others function in their ministry of the word, the center for both must be the same.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Offering Up Our Occupation&#151;<br>Taking Up Occupations Approved by God</H2><P>Other than material offerings, the Bible also mentions the offering up of our occupations. The Bible shows us that many occupations are not suitable for a Christian to engage in. It is true that we have to make money, but we have to consider how our money is made. Some means of making money are not approved by the Lord. We can only keep the occupations that God approves, and we can never engage in works that God does not approve. Today, some leading ones in some localities have wrong concepts about occupations. They bring these wrong concepts to the church. As a result, the church is ill-affected. May the Lord be merciful to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A PRAYER</H2><P>Concluding prayer: The Lord of all our works, we beseech for men on behalf of the church. Today the church is in a state of desolation. There is a lack of men in the church. May the Lord grant us men, and may the church be filled with men. Give many gifts to the church. Be merciful to us, so that there will be consecrated ones who will hand themselves over. May we find men who would submit under Your mighty hand, so that we can serve You together with all the saints. In this age of desolation, we ask especially that You raise up not just the young ones or the co-workers, but a church that would uphold Your testimony. May more people put themselves into Your hands, so that their jobs, positions, and living can become worthy of the gospel. May there be young ones raised up to work for You, and may all the brothers and sisters rise up to match the move of the gospel. We believe that You can fulfill the work of Your recovery. May You do a greater work, and may You raise up more men to give all their time to serve You and to go out with the gospel. We ask that You raise up a great multitude of men. We are not asking first for their money or their time. We are asking for their whole person. May there be some who would offer themselves to You in a thorough way, and may they do it right now. We pray that You would remove from us the desolation and would give us men. Lord, be gracious to us; we are inquiring of You men. Only You are worthy to gain us. Only You can cause us to serve You unreservedly and single-heartedly. We would pour out the water of the well of Bethlehem here on the ground. May none among us be a withdrawing one, a hiding one, or a spectator. May the Lord be merciful to us. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray, amen.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TESTIMONIES OF CO-WORKERS<br>AND COMMENTS</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (6)</H1><p>Date:Evening, April 13, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</p><P>Brother Watchman Nee: In tonight's meeting, we would like the co-workers to give their own testimonies. Those brothers and sisters who are joining us as guests should only come with their ears. They should not be the mouths, nor should they take what they hear and use it as subjects for gossip. Tonight we want to speak honest words before the Lord and to speak the truth in love.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT BEING CONTROLLED BY EMOTIONS</H2><P>Brother Chang Yu-chi testified: (1) I find it easy for me to lose my temper and to criticize; (2) I always have strong feelings for injustice in others.</P><P>Brother Nee: Brother Chang is easily swayed by his emotions. He does not have much problem with his will. We cannot be influenced by our emotions. What we learn in sickness is a discipline from God through our environment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING DIRECT AND SIMPLE IN ONE'S MIND</H2><P>Brother David Hsu testified: (1) I always experience conflicts of various kinds; (2) whenever something happens, I would fall into much consideration and find my thoughts very complicated; (3) I also experience conflict between my heart and my head.</P><P>Brother Nee: We should have thoughts that are like straight lines. A straight line is the shortest distance between two points. We should not have circumventing thoughts. Once light comes in and we see ourselves, we should apply the dealing right away. If we do this, our mind will become simple.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HAVING A DEFINITE BURDEN IN OUR SPIRIT<br>AND SPEAKING INTO OTHERS' SPIRIT</H2><P>In serving the Lord, we have to seek for definite burdens in our spirit. We must have the Lord's words within before we can speak His word without. Our words are not just spoken for the ears of others. The real speaking is one in which the deep calls unto the deep. On the one hand, we should have the spiritual burden within us. On the other hand, our words should be conveyed to the depths of others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED FOR OUR SPEAKING<br>TO BE SHORT AND DIRECT</H2><P>The problem with Brother Hsu is the conveying. I have no way of knowing how much burden there is within him. However, he has used so many words and so much time, and yet that which is in his spirit is not yet conveyed to others. The reason for this is that there is not enough practice. As a result, his mind is poor. When we speak, our words have to be short and simple. Brother Hsu's problem is not a problem in the basic matter; it is a problem with his speaking. If he practices more, he will avoid the complications and the hesitations. Brother Witness Lee's prayers are "light" in time and "heavy" in content. If a man needs a glass of water, simply give him a glass. There is no need to lay a fifty yard pipeline first and then put the glass to it.</P><P>It is not easy for you to take such words. It is not easy for me to speak such words either.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED FOR A STRONG SPIRIT<br>TO RENDER OTHERS THE PRACTICAL HELP</H2><P>Brother Jih Yung-tung testified: I am learning to mingle myself with the other co-workers. But sometimes I become withdrawn because of others.</P><P>Brother Nee: Brother Jih needs to be strengthened in his spirit. The real love for the brothers has to do with our being absolute toward the Lord. This requires that our spirit be strong. Those who do not have a strong spirit cannot render others much help in the church. They cannot build others up, and they cannot cause others to waste themselves on the Lord. Only those who have a strong spirit can render others the greatest amount of help. We should not give others fragmentary and defective help. Rather, we should render them practical and definite help. This requires a strong spirit on our part.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FORTY-SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE WHOLE BODY SERVING<br>AND THE RECOVERY OF AUTHORITY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (7)</H1><P>Date:Morning, April 14, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OPEN TO RECEIVE THE SUPPLY OF THE MINISTRY</H2><P>Brother Nee: In the past, there were many things that we could not say or do. The reason for this is that we were not open to one another. This time, when over twenty brothers handed themselves over to us, I told them that now I am not afraid even to take off my hat to ask for money from others. When a man has handed himself over, his position is changed. There is the need for a certain degree of openness before there can be the capacity to receive a certain kind of words.</P><P>The first need today among the co-workers is to learn to be open. What we did last night (referring to the commenting on the co-workers, see preceding chapter) can only be done when there is openness. There are some things that we can say. There are other things that we cannot say. Here is a question of position. It is a question of whether or not a person has the position to say certain kinds of words. Here is also a question of motive and relationship. When you want to say something, you have to check if your motive is right. You also must ask what kind of relationship you have with your listener. Different relationships mean that our words have to be different. In addition, we have to speak in love. Without love, we cannot speak honest words.</P><P>We have been nodding our heads and patting each other on the back for over ten years. Yet there are still many things that we dare not open up to one another. We dare not speak about these things ourselves, and others dare not speak about them either. Outsiders may not know about these problems, but we ourselves have been clear about them for a long time. We know that there are some things that we cannot say or that are hard to say.</P><P>The problem today is that the members do not want to receive the supply from others. Once a member refuses to receive the supply, all ministries stop. When some people come across difficulties, they refuse to receive the supply from others. Instead, they will only accept exhortations and supplies that are three miles away from them. To have to say something under such circumstances does not touch even the surface of the issue; much less can there be any deep or open words. The need today is for us to put ourselves under the authority of the Head. If a man sees the Body, he will not be hurt or caused to stumble. What is needed among the brothers and sisters is not friendship, cordiality, or tactfulness. None of these things exists in the Body.</P><P>Among us in the past, we did have the supply. Yet, though the supply was there, it could not flow out. In the coming days, we do have to look to God for mercy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>UNDERSTANDING THE MINISTRY<br>AND THE MINISTRIES</H2><P>Specifically, every brother and sister must understand the need of authority in the local churches. Romans 12 speaks of the ministries, and Ephesians 4 speaks of the ministry. The ministry in these two places is different. The "ministry" in Ephesians 4 is singular; it is the same ministry as the apostles' ministry of the word and prayer as recorded in Acts 6. The ministry in Ephesians is "the ministry"; it is unique, and it refers to the ministry of the word, which includes the five kinds of gifts in that chapter. The ministries in Romans 12 are manifold; they are plural in number. Not everyone has a part in the ministry of the word. Only the apostles and the prophets have a part in this ministry. However, every child of God has a share in the ministries of Romans 12. In the local churches, all the brothers and sisters have a part in these ministries. Every member has to consider himself and to work according to his measure.</P><P>At the beginning of Romans 12, it mentions God's mercy. This mercy includes chapters one to eleven. Chapters one to eight cover sanctification, and chapters nine to eleven say that it is not of the one who wills nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy. Chapter twelve goes on to speak about God's mercy. This mercy produces a result, which is consecration. The goal of consecration is for the ministries, which is not to be a preacher, but to serve God. Service is ministry and ministry is service. The words service and ministry are the same word in Greek. This service is like the service of the priests in the Old Testament. There the ones who served at the altar partook of the food of the altar (1 Cor. 9:13).</P><P>A cook can prepare the food in the kitchen, but he does not serve the food himself. Rather, the waiter serves the food to the table. This is a picture of the ministry. A ministry is the work of bringing food from one place to another. Originally, the food was far away from you. But now the ministering one brings the food to you, and you can enjoy the food. Those who are serving receive the supply from the Head, on the one hand, and minister this supply to the brothers and sisters, on the other hand. A man receives his ministry from God. He receives such a ministry for the purpose of serving the brothers and sisters and the church. When the brothers and sisters serve together in a local church, everyone should put in his or her portion. This is a different kind of service. Such service cannot be replaced by the ministry. What Acts 6 talks about is a different matter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GAINING ALL THE ONE-TALENTED ONES</H2><P>There are two reasons why the supply among the brothers and sisters in the local churches is little. The first is that there are works of the flesh, and the second is that the saints have not learned the lesson of submitting to the authority in the church. Because there is the flesh, the responsible brothers are hesitant to let these fleshly ones function, for fear that they will do more damage than good. This actually helps the one-talented ones to bury their gifts. In the end, the church neither suffers a loss nor brings in a profit. The flesh does not come any longer, but neither do the one-talented ones come either. Today we have to turn the situation around. We can no longer despise the one-talented ones. We have to gain these one-talented ones. Of course, when the one-talented ones come, the flesh comes with them also. But we should not be afraid of this.</P><P>What is the church? The church is all the one-talented ones functioning. When all the dumb ones open their mouths, when all the brothers and sisters speak, and when all the one-talented ones are functioning, we have the church. What we need today is not just the "minister of ministers," but the whole church. Here, not only do we have the ministry of the word, but we have all kinds of services. We must never allow the one-talented ones to bury their talents.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECOVERING THE AUTHORITY AND<br>DEALING WITH THE FLESH</H2><P>There is indeed the need for the recovery of authority. The recovery of authority is for the dealing with the flesh. All the brothers and sisters have to rise up. Although they may have one talent only, they still have to rise up. Wherever the one-talented ones are placed together, there is surely the flesh. When the flesh comes in, there is the need to have the authority of the church. Some will exercise their flesh, and they will have to be told that the way they laugh, for example, is wrong, and that they should not do this. Hence, on the one hand, authority has to be recovered. This will safeguard the church. On the other hand, we still have to encourage the saints to speak. If we do not practice this, once we lay down the principle of forbidding the flesh, everyone becomes silent, and the services will become the work of a few again.</P><P>Everyone has to participate in the services. We cannot allow one or two to be passive. We oppose the system of pastors. It is wrong to have one pastor, and it is equally wrong to have ten pastors in place of one. We cannot tolerate one man only, and we cannot tolerate a few men either. Today we have to deal thoroughly with the one-talented ones. It is wrong for the one-talented ones to hide themselves. We cannot tolerate having one group of people serving while another group of people is not serving. All the local churches have to make a full turn in this matter. The responsible ones and the co-workers must first be coordinated before they will have the strength to deal with the flesh in the church, and before they can deal with all the rebellious, disobedient, and insubordinate brothers and sisters. Only then can the authority of the church be established. In another five years, you will realize what I mean today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>UPLIFTING THE SPIRITUAL STANDARD, AND<br>ESTABLISHING CHURCH AUTHORITY</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee: The situation today is that only a few co-workers and responsible brothers and sisters are serving. We have not brought everyone into the services yet. There are many reasons for this. With some, it is the immaturity in life and the lack of love that hinders them from coming into the services. With others it is the poverty of their spiritual condition that bars them from the services. The condition of the brothers and sisters is such that they are merely saved. Even their salvation experiences in many cases are weak experiences of salvation; they are not rich and absolute cases of salvation. Many only come for a Sunday morning "service," and they are not properly recovered yet. We are weak in all the areas, and authority among us has not been established or built up.</P><P>Once our standard is low, church services become a matter of position or organization. Today the condition among the saints is poor, but the responsibility is not on them; it is on the responsible ones. The responsible ones have to bear eighty to ninety percent of the responsibility. Today the saints are fully influenced by the co-workers. If the spiritual condition of the co-workers is high, the spiritual condition of the saints is high. If the spiritual condition of the responsible ones is progressive, the spiritual condition of the saints is also progressive. Those who are in authority need to have not only the position, but even more, the life. Aaron's rod represents authority on the one hand and life on the other hand; it is a budding rod (Num. 17:8). If life is not expressed in authority, such authority is a mere positional authority. If life is expressed, it will be easy for authority to be executed. An authority that is without life is an empty authority. This is like some so-called governments that apparently have the authority, but whose laws cannot be exercised beyond their own buildings.</P><P>Unless we build up the authority of the church, our work today is a failure. If we do not build up the authority, there will be no way for the brothers and sisters to be built up. If there is no authority in the church, where will the brothers and sisters go for the proper authority to submit to? The condition of the churches today is like a pile of stones; there is no building up. The situation among us is one in which not one stone lies on top of another. Today, no one is above anyone else. If authority is built up among us, the services will be built up also. When we are built up under the proper authority, the services will be produced.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUBMITTING TO AUTHORITY,<br>AND COORDINATING IN SERVICE</H2><P>There is only one mouth in the human body. There is only one place where orders are issued. All the other places only need to follow the orders. To mop the floor is a small thing. Yet, in doing such a small thing, a person must nevertheless ask the church. This is real coordination. A man is built up through serving in the church. If you have to ask someone about something, that someone is spontaneously the authority above you. With the authority, there are the orders. Without authority, there can be no orders, and without the orders, there cannot be those who follow the orders. On the other hand, the presence of proper services always proves that authority is there, and under such circumstances, a model of the Body will emerge.</P><P>Whether or not local authority is built up depends on the presence of authority in the work. If the coordination among the co-workers is not smooth, you cannot expect the coordination among the brothers and sisters to be smooth. The crux of the matter today is the coordination among the co-workers. This is our biggest problem.</P><P>I have met with Brother Nee many times. All the time, I have the feeling that Brother Nee's ministry must be recovered among us. During the past year and a half, we have discussed this matter many times. Once there is coordination in the work, the local churches will be able to send people out, and there will be an increase in quantity and quality. Today, the preaching of the gospel should be a work in the Body. Men remain unsaved because they have not yet seen the power of the church. Once the Body appears, there will be the real recovery. Today, we cannot say that we are fully recovered yet. In short, if Brother Nee does not resume his ministry, nothing will happen. If real coordination is not established in the work, we cannot expect the local churches to have the real services. As such is the case, there will still be the system of the Nicolaitans; we still will not see the whole Body rising up to serve, and we will still be left with a few serving.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEARNING TO LISTEN TO OTHERS<br>AND TO BE SUBMISSIVE IN EVERYTHING</H2><P>Brother Nee: My personal ministry is to serve as a minister of the ministers; I am here to serve the ministers. My own work seldom touches the brothers and sisters directly. Concerning the work, I have much to say. Concerning the brothers and sisters, I have very little to say.</P><P>In the church, a person has to learn to ask everything. Once there is the asking, the services will be produced. If a brother mops the floor in the church for two years and is still the same person, he should not come any longer. He has to mop the floor to the extent that he becomes a different person. In the church it is not the main emphasis to get the work done, but to learn to be the proper person through doing the works. Every time we engage in any work, we have to learn coordination, and we have to ask the church about everything. We should not propose anything, but should learn to submit. Those who have the ministry are responsible for speaking up, and others are responsible for putting aside their own ideas. Everyone has to learn to submit under the Head.</P><P>If the church does not learn this lesson, it will become the same as the denominations and other social groups. Everything in the church is under God's authority. Not only should the responsible ones learn to give orders, the brothers and sisters also should learn to follow orders. The responsible ones have to learn to speak, and they also have to learn not to speak. Whether to speak or not to speak, they have to live under the authority of the Head. To live the church life demands our very life. The first thing we have to do is not to think, but to submit. The saints should present all the problems to the elders, and the elders should present the problems before God. In this way, the saints can come to God through the elders, and God's authority can be realized among the saints.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PERFECTING AND EDIFYING THOSE WHO ARE RICH<br>AND IN HIGH POSITIONS</H2><P>We have to let the rich ones and those in high positions see that the church does not beg for their services. Who is begging for their services? There are others who can do things better than they can. But we have to let them see that the reason we allow them to serve is for perfecting them and edifying them. In addition, we have to help them to care for the poor in material things. We have to help those saints who occupy high positions to step down from their heights and to open up their wallets, so that God can edify all.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF THE WHOLE CHURCH<br>PREACHING THE GOSPEL</H2><P>In the matter of preaching the gospel, we have to recover the kind of preaching that is done by the whole church. We do not need to invite people with big advertisements. We should rather ask all the brothers and sisters to invite people individually. There is a difference between inviting people through the advertisements and inviting them individually through the brothers and sisters. In this way, the whole church will be able to rise up to serve. This kind of service will be the whole Body serving together. If we have only a few serving today, we have not reached God's standard.</P><P>The way to go on today is to have authority plus the one-talented ones. When authority is added to the one-talented ones, we have the church. Whether or not a church is up to standard depends on whether or not the one-talented ones are functioning. It is not enough just to have the two-and five-talented ones. If your work does not bring out the one-talented ones, your work is a failure.</P><P>The flesh always comes with the one talents. Before you have learned obedience yourself, you will not know if others are obeying or not. But after you have learned obedience, you will detect disobedience as soon as it is there. If we are coordinated, there will be authority among us. With the authority, we can deal with the rebellious and the insubordinate ones.</P><P>Our co-workers have been working and laboring all this time. I would like to ask if they feel tired? Perhaps God is telling us to let go now. The way today is not to struggle individually by ourselves. The way today is to do things all together and in coordination. The church is the reservoir of Christ; all the riches of Christ are stored in the Body. If one day we see the whole church rising up to preach the gospel, we will realize what a beautiful and powerful picture it will be.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TAKING THE WAY OF THE WHOLE CHURCH SERVING</H2><P>Today, very few spiritual giants are any longer being produced. In the last century, during the Keswick movement many spiritual giants were produced. At that time, people had very shallow knowledge about the Bible. When A. T. Pierson stood up to preach, very few people knew what he was talking about. Today, man's knowledge about the Bible has increased. When a person steps up to the platform to preach today, he only needs to speak the first sentence, and everyone knows what will follow. Today there are very few five-talented ones like Paul. However, although there are very few spiritual giants, two or three one-talented ones and two-talented ones will make up for a Paul. Today we do not have many Pauls. We cannot wait any longer for the spiritual giants to come to us. I believe the time has come for the church to rise up to serve, to work, and to preach the gospel. There is no way for us to go on individually any longer. Today is the time for us to take the way of the church. We have to be in the same mind with God. We criticize the denominations and their system of one man monopolizing everything. But in the local churches, it is one co-worker plus two or three elders that are monopolizing the services. They are replacing the functions of the saints. In principle, this is the same as the denominations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PERFECTING THE SAINTS AND<br>COMMITTING THE WORK TO THEM</H2><P>Our work today is one in which we perfect others to do the work themselves. We are not there to work for others. Paul produced a Timothy to be his disciple. Timothy then committed the work to the faithful ones (2 Tim. 2:2). The faithful ones went out and perfected others more. This is the way of our work today.</P><P>What happens now is that we are doing the work for others. This kind of working for others will not bring about anything even if we work ourselves to the point we contract tuberculosis. The way today is to teach others to work. Only those who can teach others to work will succeed in the work.</P><P>When a person takes up all the work upon himself, he is in reality telling everyone else not to work. This is the wrong way. The work of the co-workers today is to lead others and induce them to work. Their job is to distribute the work to others. They have to use whatever means they can to cause others to work.</P><P>An older brother who is now deceased was working in the navy. He told me once that when the gunboats are engaged in battles, the cannons are carried from the bottom of the boats to the deck and handed to the gunners. The gunners themselves do not carry the cannons. This brother told me that he had worked for many years on a gunboat, but he never fired a shot himself. All the time he was carrying cannons for others to fire the shots. What we have to do today is to be that kind of people. We have to bring the cannons to the brothers and sisters, and let them fire the shots.</P><P>One day we will all pass away, and another generation will rise up. The next generation that we bring in must not be made up of three or five serving ones, but must be made up of the whole church serving. If one day the whole church rises up to do everything by itself, to have the whole church preaching the gospel and the whole church edifying each other, that will be the day when the world will see the church doing a new thing on earth. Today, the whole problem lies with you and me. We must help every brother and sister to serve and make everyone a priest of God. Some may have the flesh with them, but we still have to ask them to work. Some brothers say that all they have is so little that it would be better if they hide it. But we have to tell them that they cannot do this. It is an easy thing for the one-talented ones to hide what they have. Many brothers and sisters feel that since they make mistakes no matter how they work, they may as well not work at all. But you have to ask them to work. This is the way. Please believe in my words. In the not-too-distant future, such a church will appear. By that time, men will see Philadelphia, the genuine brotherly love.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ALLOWING GOD TO HAVE A WAY AMONG US</H2><P>Today the responsibility rests on our shoulders. God must have a way with us first, before He can have a way in the church. Everywhere God is recovering the condition of the early churches. From the garden of Eden, through the tabernacle and the temple, God is gaining the church, which will usher in the holy city. By that time, God will be able to dwell in the city, and Satan will not be able to come into that place any longer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>USHERING IN THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee: In the last century, many spiritual giants were raised up. But today, it seems as if there are no more such giants. I believe the reason for this is that God wants to bring in the ministry of the church and the service of the church. In China and even in the whole world, there seem to be no more great evangelists being raised up. Not only are there no new ones being raised up, but the old ones are passing away. Some should not have passed away according to their age or their ministry, but they did pass away. The reason is probably that spiritual giants are a hindrance to the producing of the church ministry. Some so-called spiritual giants are not as prevailing as they used to be. Even among the co-workers now, there is always the sense of loneliness. Although the term coordination is not there, there is a cry for the reality of coordination.</P><P>Today, the saints' heart toward service is very different. The situation today is like the spring blossoms after the early rain. Among the churches, many people are seeking after the Lord. In the hospitals, on the campuses, many young ones are rising up. In Shanghai, everywhere we see clear signs that the brothers and sisters have a desire to serve the Lord. On the one hand, we do not see spiritual giants being raised up. On the other hand, we see all the brothers and sisters in all the localities rising up. Even the little members are rising up to serve the Lord. This is the Lord's own work.</P><P>Whether or not we can bring about the service of the Body depends entirely on us. Can we submit ourselves to the authority of those ahead of us? If we can submit to authority, we can be others' authority. What is needed today is men who can lead others into the services, and not men who will replace others in their services. We have to perfect others to the extent that they themselves can rise up and serve. It is not the way today to have revival meetings, nor to enlist people into services. The way today is for us to learn the lessons first and to dive into the realities first. It is difficult to submit to authority, but it is more difficult to be an authority. Yet only through authority can we bring the brothers and sisters into the services. This requires that we pass through the dealings and the breakings ourselves. We cannot give ourselves an easy way out. If we do not give ourselves an easy way, the Lord will have His way among us.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LEADING OF THE BODY<br>AND THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (8)</H1><P>Date:6:30 p.m., April 15, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING LEADING</H2><P>Brother Chang Yu-chi asked: What is the relationship between submitting to the authority in the Body and personal submission before God? Is there a difference between individual leadings and leadings in the Body?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Leading of the Conscience<br>and the Leading of the Church</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: Catholicism and Protestantism belong to two different systems. In Protestantism, everyone is led individually by his own conscience. In Catholicism, everything is governed absolutely by the church's leading. The Catholic church thinks that all God's leadings come through the church and that a man cannot come to God directly, but must come to Him through the church. The Protestants oppose this. They think that a man should follow God according to his free conscience. Protestantism rejected Catholicism, but in so doing, it brought in Sardis and paved the way for Laodicea. God wants His people to come out of Thyatira. He also wants His people to come out of Sardis.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Personal Leading Being a Matter<br>of the Sense of the Inner Life</H2><P>In the Bible there are two instances where the matter of God's leading is covered. The first place is the first Epistle of John, which speaks of the leading of the anointing (2:27). The second place is the book of Hebrews, which speaks of the leading in the new covenant (10:10-12). The former emphasizes the knowledge of spiritual senses, whereas the latter emphasizes the knowledge of God's law. The new covenant teaches us to know God's law, whereas the anointing teaches us to know the way to serve God. It is only when we live before God that we know His law. It is not by outward regulations, but by the responses of the inner life that we make judgments concerning everything. In the same principle, it is not by outward teachings, but by the anointing that we come to know what is of God and what is not of Him.</P><P>We have to be careful to realize that these leadings concern only our knowledge of God before Him; they do not include all other kinds of leadings. If we are not careful, and if we generalize these leadings to mean all kinds of leadings and conclude that all kinds of leadings come directly and independently from God, we will have a problem. First John and Hebrews are on the leading concerning the knowledge of God. As to the leading concerning the Lord's way on earth, we have to look at the book of Acts. The mistake of Catholicism lies in the fact that it not only holds a tight rein on the leading concerning the way of the church, but it takes over the leading of the individual consciences.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Leading concerning the Way in the Service<br>Being a Corporate Matter</H2><P>The book of Acts is a book on the leading concerning the way in the service. Only this book tells us the way the Holy Spirit led men in their works. In this book, it mentions the Lord's approving and His disapproving as well. In some places it says that the Holy Spirit said this and said that, and in other places it says that Timothy and Titus were assigned to this and that place. In addition, the Epistles to Timothy and Titus are also epistles on the work, and they follow the same principle as Acts. From Acts and these Epistles we can see that there is the side of individual leading, and there is the side of corporate leading. But the majority of the leadings there are corporate leadings. In Acts 2, when Peter stood up, the other eleven stood up with him. What Peter said became the words of all of them. He told the crowd to be baptized for the washing away of their sins. After his word, no one said anything more. John did not stand up and say, "Peter, save some room for me to speak." The failure of Catholicism lies in the fact that it does not give any place to the conscience and does not give any place to the reality of the Holy Spirit; the church becomes the highest monopolizing institution. The recovery of Protestantism is the recovery of the individual. However, because it is a recovery of the individual, anything that has to do with the leading of the way of the church is solved by committees, votes, and resolutions. However, real leading does not come through committees, resolutions, and debates, but in a spontaneous, unorchestrated, yet harmonious way. Where there is the reality of the Spirit, there will be no problem with the leading. The real leading is produced under the oneness of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>Acts tells us that when there was need among the churches in Samaria, Jerusalem sent men to help them (Acts 8:14). When the few brothers in the church in Antioch prayed, the Holy Spirit set apart two of them for His work. If it were up to us, we would have much consideration about the way to spread to Europe and the way to work. However, Acts shows us that it is not a matter of consideration, but a matter of the corporate leading.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Leading Being a Matter in the Body</H2><P>At the time of Paul's conversion, even God's speaking to him was through the church. The Lord spoke to Paul not only directly, but through the members also. Why did the Lord have to speak to Paul through others? If I have something to say to Brother Yu-chi, I can say it to him directly; I do not have to convey it through another person. But here was Paul, who was zealous in serving God, who shed others' blood and thought that by so doing he was serving God. One day, God cast a great light on him and turned his life around. Why would the Lord not speak to such a person directly? He sent others to speak to him instead. Moreover, He did not send Peter, John, or Philip, but He sent Ananias. No one had heard of Ananias before that time or after that time. The Lord sent a seemingly ordinary believer to Paul. This shows us that leading is a matter of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God Speaking to the Whole Body</H2><P>John's ministry is on God's house, Peter's ministry is on God's kingdom, and Paul's ministry is on God's church. With Paul, we see that from the first day on, he touched something, which is the oneness of the Lord with His church. The Head is one with the members, and the members are one with each other. Paul learned these two lessons right from the beginning. He saw the life of the Body from the first day on. This is why he was able to drop his self and to accept the commission of the work, and later to be able to commission others in the work. This shows us that God's speaking is not directed toward individuals, but toward the whole Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Rejection of the Leading in the Body<br>Being the Rejection of All Leadings</H2><P>We have to ask God to do one thing today: If a person rejects the leading in the Body, he will be deprived of all leadings. The Lord's leading in the work is manifested in the Body. If we pay our attention to our individual ways, we will miss God's leading. Whether it is the work or the services, everything is carried out in the Body. An individual can do something, but what he does is different from what the Body can do. The work of an individual is fragmentary, and it is not related to God's move. Works whose basis is the individual are either empty or unsubstantial. If a man stands on the right ground, he has the right works to do. If he does not stand on the right ground, even if he does some works, his works are empty. A man can be very busy, but in God's eyes, he can be very idle. An idle person is not one who has nothing to do. An idle person is one whose work does not count in the Lord's eyes. When I have no part in God's work and God does not recognize what I do, when I am only busy doing my own works instead, I am an idle person. A man can be very busy, yet still miss the Lord and see Him passing him by.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Taking the Corporate Leading<br>Being Wiser Than Taking Individual Leadings</H2><P>In God's work, we have to learn to accept the corporate leadings. I am not saying that there are no more individual leadings of the Lord, nor am I saying that corporate leadings today can never be wrong. It is impossible for corporate leadings to always be right; there are times when they can be wrong. But we can ask ourselves: Do we have leadings in our individual works, and have we ever made any mistakes in those leadings? It is possible for individual leadings to be wrong, and it is equally possible for corporate leadings to be wrong. But proportionally speaking, the decision of ten men ahead of me is surely better than my own decision. We have to learn to be a receiving vessel before the Lord. We should accept the judgment of the brothers ahead of us and should take their judgments as our own judgments. We should take others' judgments and should be able to have others take our judgments. If you know that a young one has done something that you know is wrong, and if through the lack of learning the proper lesson, you dare not speak to him, you are allowing him to perpetuate his mistakes. If I want to go to Taiwan today, and eight or ten brothers say that I should go to Tsingtao, I should submit to their judgment.</P><P>Sometimes an individual may feel very strongly and convincingly about something, and the feeling may differ from that of the Body. However, though feelings may differ, the spirit must not differ. I am here to do God's will, and you are also here to do God's will. When everyone is here to do God's will, there will not be a difference in our spirit. If you complain or are angry, your spirit is wrong, and your emotions are also wrong. If you say, "Why not ask me to go to other places? Why, of all places, should I go to Tsingtao?" your spirit is not right. If you say that you are going to be a preacher and your father insists that you apply for a job in the Customs Department, you cannot argue with him or lose your temper by breaking dishes and cups around the house. Although you cannot take his suggestion, you still have to say to him, "Father, I would very much like to take your advice. But I cannot obey you, because there is no way that I can be the same as you are." If our spirit is wrong, the result would not be pleasant. Not only does our spirit have to be the same, it has to be right.</P><P>In the church, those brothers who are in authority should learn to pray together. The basic principle of service in the church is the one accord. In the Bible there is no such thing as the minority going along with the majority; there is only the one accord. One can gather a few dozen saints to fellowship and pray together. If in the church a group of people would fast and pray together, they would surely speak the same thing. It is all right for a person to have some feelings of his own. But if he does not have absolute confidence that what he has is of the Lord, it is better for him to submit to the others' feelings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Leading in the Body Cutting Short<br>an Individual's Journey</H2><P>There is a strong relationship between a person's spiritual journey and the leading of the Holy Spirit. Why is there the need of the leading of the Body? It is because with the leading of the Body one can somewhat cut short an individual's spiritual journey. If a brother is left to himself, he may have to stumble for ten years before he can come up with something. But now through the Body he may acquire the same thing in one evening. If such a brother will take the judgment of the Body, he will save a lot of time. The use of authority in the church is for the purpose of cutting down mistakes and shortening the journeys.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Everyone Functioning,<br>and Everyone Submitting to Authority</H2><P>The principle of service in the church is that all the one-talented ones have to rise up. But as soon as they rise up, the flesh rises up also. Hence, in order for the church to become the church, on the one hand, all the one-talented ones have to rise up. On the other hand, in order to deal with the flesh, there must be the exercise of authority. Here the only solution is for man to listen and obey. If you think that something is right, you should obey. If you think that something is not right, you should nevertheless obey. Everyone should rise up. On the other hand, everyone should learn obedience. After a church has its authority established, there is still the need for the one-talented ones to rise up. Without the one-talented ones, there is no church. At the same time, without authority there will be confusion in the church. The problem with the Catholic church is that the one-talented ones have not risen up. However, most of the people in the church are one-talented ones. Today, the church falls into desolation because the one-talented ones are buried. If all the one talents are dug out, and everyone is a submissive one, the authority in the church will be able to deal with the flesh.</P><P>There was a brother in Foochow who could be considered the very "incarnation of opinion." He was very zealous toward the gospel. It was right that his one talent be put to use, but the church could not let him do whatever he liked. At the same time, the church must give him the opportunity to serve. At any rate, a person must learn to obey. You may not see the result today, but in eight or ten years you will see the result. To have authority alone is empty; to have the one-talented ones alone is disorderly. But when the one talents are added to authority, we have the church. Under such circumstances, what could only be accomplished in ten years can now be accomplished overnight. That brother that I mentioned was later dealt with. He responded by saying that he would quit and would move back to his hometown. I told him, "Brother, you cannot do this. You still have to serve. However, you must serve according to the way the church tells you."</P><P>For one to submit to authority is for him to inherit the riches that lie in the authority. If a man truly learns to drop the self, he will have no problem with the matter of submission.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Service in the Holy Spirit<br>and God's Light Being Found in the Body</H2><P>The kind of service that is of the Holy Spirit is found only in the Body. In 1 and 2 Timothy and in Acts as well, we see the matter of the Body. Paul told Titus to remain in Crete (Titus 1:5) and told Timothy to come to him before winter (2 Tim. 4:21). Paul did not ask them to go and pray; he only told them directly where to go. Today, God's move is carried out through the Body. Our service is also under the direction of the Body.</P><P>At the beginning God created a garden, and He went to the garden to look for man (Gen. 3:9). After man sinned, God did not have a place of rest any longer. Noah's dove was not able to find a resting place over the entire condemned earth (Gen. 8:9). God could not have a place of rest. This is why He later built the tabernacle. The tabernacle is God's resting place. The tabernacle brought in the temple. Later the temple was judged, and not one stone was found on top of another. After this, the church was brought in. Ephesians 2 says that the church is the habitation of God. Today, God dwells in the church (1 Tim. 3:15). In the Old Testament, the light was in the Holy of Holies. There was no lamp or sunlight in the Holy of Holies. Yet there was light there, because God was there. In the same principle, if you want to receive light today, you have to come to the church. It is a strange thing for a person to be able to come to the church, yet not receive any light. If a man is outside the church, he can remain in darkness. But once he comes into the church, he will see light.</P><P>Let me ask the co-workers a question: Do you receive more light when you read the Bible by yourselves, or when you meet in the church? Do you understand the Scriptures more by staying in your room, or when you speak on the platform? What one person cannot see clearly by himself, he will see clearly when he is with the brothers. You may think that what you have received comes from your own mind. But have you ever given more thought to the matter? All revelations come from the light. Only when there is the light can there be the revelations (Psa. 36:9). Today there is abundant light in the church. This is why we have to see that it is impossible for us to be an individual Christian.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee asked: (1) What are the difference and relationship between the coordination in the Body, the coordination among the co-workers, and the coordination among the brothers and sisters? (2) Is coordination merely a matter of following the ministers, or is there something else?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Church Service Being Absolutely<br>under the Sovereignty of the Holy Spirit</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: For all the time that the church has been on this earth, God never asks man to direct the church. God never asks a few more advanced ones to direct a church. The services in a local church are the result of the assignment of the Holy Spirit. We may think that those brothers who have good behavior and who have in addition some gifts are the best candidates for services. But actually, many times things work out exactly the opposite way. Those who appear to be qualified do not have the gifts, and those who do not appear to be qualified have the gifts. Although some do not appear to be qualified, others are saved through them. The ones who appear to be qualified, on the contrary, cannot bring others to salvation. Sometimes, the Lord would do something that leaves one bewildered as to what to make of it.</P><P>We have to realize that today the gifts are not under our control. Moreover, we cannot even ask for the gifts. Everything depends on the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:11). Man is unable to do anything; he can only submit to the works of the Lord. When God wanted Saul of Tarsus, He chose Saul of Tarsus. Today, our concept is that Paul is our dear brother. But if you were to ask the people in Jerusalem at that time, everyone would tell you that they were afraid of Saul. Even those in Tarsus were afraid of him. Others could never imagine that Saul would be saved. Even Saul himself could not imagine that he would be saved. Today we have to see the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit. Everything is under His sovereignty. Those who do not learn to submit under the Holy Spirit will never do a good work.</P><P>Paul did not receive his authority through his commission. A commission by itself does not give a person authority. Only when the Holy Spirit gives man authority will he have the authority. Paul told the Corinthians that they were his letters of commendation (2 Cor. 3:2). Where there is the gift, there is the ministry. Where there is the ministry, there is the authority. This is something that one cannot contend about. Paul received the gift and became the minister. This was why he could exercise authority over others. He did not need any commendations other than this authority.</P><P>Many times we say, "Lord, You are the Head of the church." This is easy to say, but it is not easy to be realized. Every work is initiated by the Lord; only He can raise up the gifts. All that the responsible ones are doing is cooperating with Him. If a man tries to act according to his self-will today, the church should exercise some kind of arrangement. This arrangement is for the purpose of dealing with his flesh. An arrangement should not be considered as the appointment of a gift. It is because there is the flesh that there is the need for some arrangement. Such arrangement is for the purpose of frustrating, subduing, and restricting the flesh. All works that originate from self-will cannot come into the church. The revival of the church does not come through man's arrangements, but through the sovereign operation of the Holy Spirit. Without the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit, any commendation, commission, or authorization is useless. The most they will do is to add a few signatures to the letter of recommendation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Whole Body Serving Being<br>the Greatest Recovery Today</H2><P>We have to see that if the one-talented ones do not rise up to serve, there is no way for the church to go on. The priesthood is a universal priesthood. This is the greatest recovery of this century. Many people think that the matter of service is the work of a few people, but true service is that in which the whole Body is involved. As long as this matter is not fully recovered, we have to go on speaking.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Loss and the Recovery of the Priesthood</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God Securing the Place of Rest through the Priests</H2><P>The priests are the ones who serve God. Those who serve God are called the priests. They may do a lot of other works, but none of those works can be considered true service. Only one thing is true service, and that is to dwell in the temple. In the Old Testament, there was the tabernacle. After the tabernacle, there was the temple. Within the temple, there was the dwelling of the priests. The book of Psalms mentions seven or eight times the matter of dwelling in the house of Jehovah. The work of the priests was to go to God on behalf of men and to go to men on behalf of God. In order for God to be among men, to dwell with men, and to find rest among men, He has to have the priests. Only when God secures the priests will He find a resting place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God Calling the Israelites<br>to Be a Kingdom of Priests</H2><P>The holy place and the priesthood are the twofold requirements of God. The work of the priests is to serve God, and the holy place is the dwelling place for the priests; it is also the dwelling place of God. Melchisedec was a priest of God. But he was alone, and he could not satisfy God. What God wants is a kingdom of priests. This is why He called out a people and brought them through the Red Sea into the wilderness. The purpose was to secure for Himself a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:6). In God's eyes, God's people and the priesthood are one and the same thing. God desires that the whole nation of Israel be a priesthood. As long as a person is one of His people, he should be a priest. This is why Moses told Pharaoh, "Let my people go, that they may serve me" (Exo. 8:1; 9:1). Every one of God's people is there to serve God. As such, every one of them should be a priest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Israelites Having Failed,<br>the Priesthood Becoming the Special Privilege<br>of the Tribe of Levi</H2><P>The law is God's testimony. What the law gives to man is what man ought to give to God. The law is God's testimony for Himself. Whatever God says to man, man should say the same thing to God. The law says that the children of Israel should be a kingdom of priests. Yet before the law was passed on to the hands of the Israelites, while it was still in the hands of Moses, the Israelites had fallen and had worshipped the golden calf. After Moses came down from the mountain, he ordered all the men to kill their own brothers and sisters. The Levites did according to what Moses said and killed over three thousand people. As a result of this, God chose the tribe of Levi to be the priests (Exo. 32:1-28; Deut. 33:8-10). Originally, it was a kingdom of priests. Now only one out of twelve tribes was to be the priests. From that time on, apart from the tribe of Levi, no one had the right to be priests. In the book of Judges, even when men had money, they could only hire the Levites as priests for them; they themselves could not be priests. In the Old Testament, one king tried to be a priest and was smitten with leprosy (2 Chron. 26:16-20). All those who serve according to their own will, will be smitten. To serve God is both a privilege and a right.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. In the New Testament, God Intending<br>the Church to Be the Kingdom of Priests</H2><P>What the Israelites had lost is today regained by the church. God desires that the church today be the kingdom of priests. Peter said that we are a royal priesthood and a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5). In Revelation, the apostle John said that we are all priests (Rev. 1:6). All the gold and silver are for the temple and the tabernacle; they are not for the golden calf. No one should worship a calf, not even the golden calf. A man has to learn to execute God's judgment and to deal with the golden calf. Only by this dealing will the real service be produced, and only then will the "Levites" rise up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Church Today<br>Not Having Arrived at God's Goal Yet</H2><P>What the churches are practicing today in all the localities is a big failure. The co-workers do not have the adequate understanding. In the bread-breaking meeting, we can say that everyone can open their mouth and can pray now. But in the matter of service, we have not seen everyone serving. We do not have every brother and sister becoming a priest yet. In the meetings, the only thing that everyone can do is to sing. It is true that in the holy place the priests sang, but that was not the only service. Today not everyone is serving yet. Only when the priests and the people become one entity is there the church. Our service today is only the service of three or five people; it is not the service of the whole Body. We have become the Jewish nation of today, with only one tribe serving, while the other eleven tribes rely on the service of the Levites. Other than the "Levites," no one else is qualified to serve any longer. Yet God's desire is that the whole Body would serve.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Way Today Being for the Whole Body to Serve</H2><P>My co-worker brothers, no matter how prevailing your ministry is, how many gifts you have, and how useful and strong you are, as long as you replace others' service, you are a Nicolaitan! Not only do you have nothing to boast of; you have to confess your sin instead. Personal godliness not only does nothing to build up the church; it actually tears down the church. The way of the work, the proper way, is to help every brother and sister to do the work himself or herself. It is not a question of much service or little service. It is a question of everyone serving. Unless we are all serving together, we are not the church. This is our way today. It has to be the church that is working. It has to be the church that is preaching the gospel. It has to be the church that is saving the souls. No matter how well you work, as long as you are replacing others, you are one of the Nicolaitans. With you there is only the ministry; there is no church. Even if you are a so-called spiritual giant or a revival evangelist, if you do not bring in the service of the whole Body, whatever you do, you are a failure.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Whole Body Taking the Gospel as Our Center</H2><P>The gospel is our occupation. Everything else is done on the side only. We have to take the gospel as our center. Our occupation is only to keep ourselves alive and to sustain our body to live on this earth; the purpose of our occupation is for the gospel. The real preaching of the gospel is done by the whole Body. The preaching of the gospel by three or five cannot be considered the real preaching. What we need today is for the whole Body, that is, everyone, to preach the gospel. If the brothers and sisters see that the church is a Body, they will not be individualistic any longer. The most blessed and happy thing is to give oneself to the gospel. Only when our money is with God will we be joyful. Many people may have too many material riches with them. This is why they are not happy. If they would lose some of what they have, their joy will increase. This is a great matter. The question is not whether one's occupation is high or low. The question is: "What are we here for?" Some work in their jobs, while others take care of their families at home. But everyone has to give his all for the gospel.</P><P>I heard what Brother Witness Lee has done in Chefoo. I also heard what he has done in Shanghai. All these works are good. But I would add one thing: In the matter of consecration, everyone must have a part. Everyone has to hand himself over. If every brother and sister hands himself or herself over, the next generation will not need such a word any longer. By that time, the minute a person is saved, he will hand himself over and will be consecrated.</P><P>Why do we baptize people? What is the meaning of baptism? Baptism means that we come under the name of the Lord. When a person comes out of the water, he should know that henceforth he does not belong to the world any longer. Rather, he belongs to the Lord. Baptism separates a person from the world. It is because the baptism of many people was not up to standard at the beginning and the job was not done properly, that we need the "handing over," the make-up lesson.</P><P>In the future, when we preach the gospel, there will be no need to put up big advertisements or propaganda. Men will hear and will see the gospel. They will see that everyone is serving. If there are three thousand people, all three thousand will be coordinated together. Everyone will be working, and everyone will be serving, but no one will be murmuring.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Realizing the Glory and Grace of Serving God</H2><P>Brothers, how should we answer God's call? In the old days, men tried to usurp the priesthood. Today, the priesthood is in our hands already. Are we going to cast it aside? What the Israelites had lost was lost; they could not recover it any longer. Are we going to make the service of God something cheap in our hands? For some, service to God is a matter of granting God a favor. But we have to see that for God to allow us to serve Him is His grace and favor on us. When a man does not see the glory of serving the Lord, he calculates everything. But when he sees the glory of serving Him, he would kneel before God to beg for this service. Recently the newspaper said that China Textile Corporation is issuing new shares. When the stock market is up, everyone wants to buy. As long as they have money, they would put it into the market. Do we see the glory of serving God today? Those who see it will surely give their all for it.</P><P>Those who are standing far off do not know God's grace. All those who know God's grace and who know themselves do not count the cost...</P><P>[Note: At this juncture, before the above words were finished, some brothers broke down in tears. Sister Pearl Wang also broke down in tears.]</P><P>Brother Witness Lee's concluding prayer: It is not that we can give the Lord much. It is what the Lord wants of us. May the Lord grant us a more absolute, thorough, and serious service. Amen.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A BRIEF REPORT ON THE WORK<br>IN FOOCHOW</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>MISCELLANEOUS NOTES (8)</H1><P>Date:April 16, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Chan Keh-san</P><P>At present, the services in the church in Foochow are divided into two areas, the spiritual part and the human part.</P><P>With the spiritual part, at present we have two categories of services: the preaching of the gospel and the perfecting of the believers. On the perfecting side, there are the care for the elderly ones, the care for the young ones, and the visitation services. Visitation is further subdivided into visitation of the sick, visitation of the poor, visitation of the backsliding ones, and visitation of the newly saved ones.</P><P>With the human part, we also have a few items of services. They are the cleaning group, the ushering group, the office group, the purchasing group, the accounting group, and the maintenance group.</P><P>Other than the different items of services, the church is divided up into different districts for its meetings. Every district has a name roster, and the names of all the brothers and sisters are on the roster. Every district has some responsible brothers who share the responsibility of taking care of the brothers and sisters. The gospel meetings and the prayer meetings are conducted in the districts.</P><P>For the general church meetings, there is the edification meeting on the Lord's Day morning, the gospel meeting on the Lord's Day afternoon, and the Lord's table meeting on the Lord's Day evening. During the week there is the midweek service meeting for perfecting the services. On Saturday there is the fellowship meeting.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FORTY-NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE TREASURE IN THE EARTHEN VESSEL<br>AND THE PRINCIPLE OF JERUSALEM</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (9)</H1><P>Date:3:00 p.m., April 17, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING RECEIVING A PERSON<br>FOR THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING</H2><P>Question: Should the receiving of a person for the Lord's table be based on asking such a one questions, or should it be based on touching his spirit?</P><P>Brother Nee answered: It is right to ask such a person questions. But it is not enough simply to listen to his words. When a person opens his mouth, whether the speaking is three or five sentences, or three or five minutes, you can find out right away where this person is. If a person does not open his mouth, you will not touch his spirit. A man can say nice words, rash words, or evil words. No matter what he says, his spirit does not change. Today, no one can know another person's spirit, except through his words.</P><P>Once a person opens his mouth, he gives away his spirit. The disciples said, "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?" Immediately the Lord said, "You do not know of what kind of spirit you are" (Luke 9:54-55). The minute the disciples opened their mouths, the Lord pointed out the condition of their spirit. We must never only listen to others' words. Instead, we must know others' spirit through their words. The receiving of a person for the Lord's table is not simply a matter of asking questions, but a matter of the condition of a person's spirit.</P><P>If a person requests to be received at the Lord's table, and you feel that his spirit is not right, you should deal with the matter. Whoever has such feelings has the responsibility to deal with the matter. All dealings are directed toward the persons concerned only. If a person should not be received, we only need to tell this one alone; there is no need to pass this word around to another person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTRY&#151;<br>THE TREASURE IN THE EARTHEN VESSEL</H2><P>Question: What is the difference between the minister in 2 Corinthians 3 and that in the other places?</P><P>Brother Nee answered: The minister mentioned in this chapter is different from the ministers we speak of in these days. The minister here is of the New Testament ministry. There is a difference between the nature of the New Testament ministry and the Old Testament ministry. The focus of the New Testament ministry is the beholding of the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face as recorded in 3:18.</P><P>Second Corinthians 4 tells us the result of having this ministry, and it goes on to tell us our relationship with the Lord. This relationship is described in 4:7, "We have this treasure in earthen vessels." This is a very crucial verse in the New Testament. The reason we have this ministry is that we have the treasure in the earthen vessel. Outwardly we may be an earthen vessel, but inwardly we have the treasure. We are not only giving the treasure to others, but we are giving the treasure that is hidden in the earthen vessels to others. The problem is that today men only want to improve their earthen vessels; they do not want to show the treasure that is hidden in the earthen vessels. Some people hold on to themselves too much. As a result, the treasure is not able to be shown forth. The principle of the spiritual life is that the treasure is hidden in the earthen vessel. It is not a mending of the earthen vessel, nor any artificial way of improving the natural man. We are not trying to cause the earthen vessel to cease to be an earthen vessel any longer. It does not mean that when a person no longer tries to say anything, hear anything, see anything, and do anything, he becomes spiritual. An earthen vessel is still an earthen vessel. The earthen vessel will never be worth much. If the Lord arranges for you to be a student, simply be a student. If the Lord arranges for you to be a housewife, simply be a housewife. To be a student or a housewife will not cover up the treasure within you. The ministry of the New Testament is a matter of how much treasure the Lord has given you. It is not a matter of how much you have washed the earthen vessel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>No Mending or Improving</H2><P>Today men are not natural enough before God; they want to be "improved" earthen vessels. But it does not matter how much an earthen vessel is improved, for improvement only produces one result: to draw others' attention to itself. The ministry of Paul was quite extraordinary in its manifestation. Paul himself, however, was quite an ordinary person. Today, men do not have a strong ministry, yet they themselves are strong. We need to learn the lessons before God, to be smitten and dealt with by Him. What we need today is not outward human endeavors or any work of improvement. Our problem lies in the fact that we do not know how to differentiate between the outward earthen vessel and the inward treasure.</P><P>Miss Barber was a person who truly waited for the Lord's return. She waited daily and yearly. Hymns, #377, is a deep hymn and was written by her. It shows the kind of person she was. Whenever a person came into her presence, that one would sense Christ. She was a person who earnestly waited for the Lord's return. One day, I went into her study room and found her wastebasket filled with wastepapers. She told me that she was working on a letter that morning, and that before she finished it, she felt something wrong within and had to throw the letter away. After this she wrote a second one, only to find that she did not have the peace either, and she had to throw that one away also. In this way, she filled up her wastebasket with wastepapers, and the letter was still not finished. This little incident proves that she was a person who lived in the presence of the Lord.</P><P>Outward godliness cannot help a person to become a good Christian. Only that part which the Lord has wrought into us counts, and only that part is worthwhile. It is useless to try to be a Christian in an outward way; a person has to drop all such endeavors. A Christian is one who learns to live in an inward way, and not by any outward means. Second Corinthians 4 speaks of the death of Jesus. This death of Jesus is the killing of Jesus (2 Cor. 4:10). This killing is not an outward killing, but an inward one.</P><P>We must never lead the brothers and sisters into the wrong way. We must not be like the Catholics, who teach people to imitate the conduct of their "saints." To do this is useless as far as helping anyone to know God is concerned. Where there is an imitation, reality will not come. As long as anything artificial remains, nothing out of God can come in. The imitation things must go away before the real things will come. The greatest principle today is the principle of the treasure in the earthen vessel. Never waste time to improve yourself. It is wrong to indulge oneself, but it is equally wrong to improve oneself. God has no intention for us to improve our earthen vessels. His intention is for the treasure to be expressed through the earthen vessel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Pretending or Imitating</H2><P>Many people do not realize how much they make pretensions and imitations before men. One year during Christmas, Brother T. Austin-Sparks was lying on the lawn playing with his son and his dog. That was a most unpretending and beautiful picture. Many people seem to have burnt-up earthen vessels; they appear unnatural to others and give others an uneasy feeling. No one can remain in their presence for more than three minutes. Some act in such a way that even their voices change and their speaking becomes different. None of these outward pretensions will accomplish anything.</P><P>The goal of Christ's salvation is to manifest Christ before men. It is to present the Lord within to others. We are not drawing others' attention to the earthen vessels. If we do this, it will only damage ourselves. We are drawing others' attention to the Christ within us. Only He is the treasure. When the Son of Man came, He ate and drank (Matt. 11:19), but the principle some practice today is not to eat or drink. Man always thinks that in order to be spiritual, he has to be somewhat extraordinary or mysterious. A prophet has no honor in his own country (John 4:44) because he is no longer mysterious. When men knew the Lord's brothers and sisters, they did not respect Him (Matt. 13:54-58).</P><P>However, the real ministry is inward. God can do a deep work in a man, and yet at the same time that person can still be a very approachable person. Evan Hopkins was a leader in the Keswick movement. He specialized in the teaching of sanctification by consecration. He had the talent of drawing rabbits' ears. Often he drew all kinds of rabbits' ears for his children and grandchildren. Humanly speaking, this was not spiritual at all. Yet God used him to spread the teaching of sanctification. God did not send the angels to preach the teaching of sanctification; He used ordinary men to preach such words. In the Gospels, the Lord taught the disciples to turn and become as little children (Matt. 18:3; Mark 10:15; Luke 18:17). A child never pretends. We should never pretend to be what we are not. All pretending Christians are those who cry for help in private. They say to themselves, "What a suffering and burden it is to be a Christian!" Even bystanders would feel sorry for them. God does not want us to be this kind of Christian. A Christian is not one who forces himself to behave in a certain kind of way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Simple and Strong in Spirit</H2><P>Natural naivety and spiritual simplicity are two different things. The more a person knows the Lord, the simpler he is. But human methods always lend themselves to further complications. A fleshly person does not have much within him, and what he has outwardly is more than what he has inwardly. When a person does not have anything inside him, but tries to assume something on the outside, he is deceiving himself. Neither a capable mind nor a strong emotion is of any use. The only kind of person who is of use is one with a weighty and strong spirit.</P><P>A man's head occupies one-seventh of the length of his body. If his head took up one-third of his body, he would look ugly. Some people have a good mind, but if their mind is too strong, they will look ugly. However, if such a one matches his strong mind with a strong spirit, he will not look ugly. The most outstanding part of a person is his nose. When a man bumps into a wall or a door, the first thing that hits it is his nose. The most outstanding part of our being ought to be our spirit. We need a large spirit, a strong spirit, a spirit that has been dealt with. If we have this kind of spirit, when others meet us, they will meet our spirit. If what others touch is only our knowledge or our disposition, we are completely useless.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COORDINATION AMONG THE CO-WORKERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>By the Authority of the Holy Spirit</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee asked: Is the coordination among the co-workers based on the ministers in the Body only, or is it based on some other things?</P><P>Brother Nee answered: Yes, there are other things. In the coordination there is also the question of arrangement. On the one hand, coordination is based on the Holy Spirit. The Acts of the Apostles can also be called the Acts of the Holy Spirit. The reason it can be called the Acts of the Holy Spirit is that the Spirit has the highest authority. The Holy Spirit is like the nerves in the whole body. It is true that the Body is under the direction of the Head. However, the Head rules the Body through the Holy Spirit. Today, the practical outworking of authority lies in the Holy Spirit. The Lord is directing His Body through the Holy Spirit. Authority is not a thing; the Lord did not give Peter a bundle of authority and ask him to come back for more when he used up that bundle. Authority is the Lord Himself. The authority that was manifested in Paul, John, and Peter was something given by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit coordinated these men together in different places. The question of authority is a question of being one with the Lord. The principle underlying authority is the oneness with the Lord. The Scriptures clearly state that the work that went out from Antioch was initiated by the commissioning of the Holy Spirit (Acts 13:2, 4). Only those chosen by the Holy Spirit have the authority.</P><P>The individual work of a worker before the Lord is based on his ministry in the Body. But the overall operation in the Lord's work is based on the Holy Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Keeping the Principle of Jerusalem&#151;<br>Working from the Center to the Circumference</H2><P>Today we need to consider afresh the principle of Jerusalem. God's work began from Jerusalem (Acts 1:4, 8). The word of the Lord was that the gospel should spread from Jerusalem. In the Bible, Jerusalem represents God's work. God set up Jerusalem as the center of the work. In God's eyes, all the apostles should remain in Jerusalem (Acts 1:4; 8:1, 14, 25). We will not take back a single word of what we have said in Hankow before. No doubt the church is local. But in God's eyes, there are centers in His work. What we spoke of in Hankow was the condition of the local churches when they are matured. The failure of our work in these years is that we pass on the authority to the local churches before they are matured. According to God's order, there is first Jerusalem, and then the local churches. Our failure today lies in the fact that we have the local churches first without having a Jerusalem. The order of the Lord's way is first Jerusalem, then Samaria, and then the ends of the earth (Acts 1:8). Jerusalem came first, then came the local churches. In the past we did not see this. This is why, though we had so many small churches, we did not learn coordination, and the local churches became little kingdoms under the hands of one worker with two or three responsible brothers. The problem with the Lord's testimony in the past is that we did not begin from Jerusalem.</P><P>Today, we have to learn first to stand on the position of oneness and to begin from Jerusalem. If we do not go back to the principle of Jerusalem, we will not have a proper way to go on.</P><P>Some Bible expositors say that it was wrong for the apostles to remain in Jerusalem. They say that the apostles should not have remained in Jerusalem. But in the Bible, we do not see the Lord asking them to leave Jerusalem. It is right for the apostles to remain in Jerusalem. Later, when they went out, it was not because of persecution, but because everywhere there were those who called on the name of the Lord. Something happened in Samaria. That was why Jerusalem sent John and Peter out. After they went out for a little while, they came back to Jerusalem (Acts 8:14, 25). God needs a Jerusalem also in China. The way of the work is that there must first be a Jerusalem. In Jerusalem there were many co-workers, and there was the church. There was much opportunity to learn the lessons. First there was Jerusalem, and then there was Antioch. Even Paul had to go first to Jerusalem to learn the lessons (Acts 9:26-29). It is true that Jerusalem was a church, but it was different from an ordinary local church. In Jerusalem, there were the apostles and the elders (Acts 15:2). But in Philippi there were only the elders and the deacons (Phil. 1:1). It seems that in Jerusalem the local church and the center of the work are at the same place.</P><P>Today, whether we are driven from our city by outward persecutions, or some go out because they decide to migrate, or to spread out, we have to remember that there is the principle of Jerusalem. The Lord's word says that the gospel is to be preached from Jerusalem unto the ends of the earth (Acts 1:8). This is a non-stopping principle; it continues until the ends of the earth are reached. If we want a new start, we have to have a Jerusalem. Unless we have a Jerusalem, there is no way to go on in the work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Co-workers Coming Together<br>to the Center of the Work</H2><P>Practically speaking, how should we go on? If we are clear about the principle just mentioned, there is no problem with the practice. If the co-workers will first drop their personal works and will come together in Jerusalem, the Lord will have a way. Although Paul was in Antioch, when a problem arose, he brought the problem back to Jerusalem (Acts 11:25-26; 15:1-2). Antioch can be considered the center of the gospel. As far as evangelistic works are concerned, it is right to have an Antioch. But if we want others to see a model, we have to bring them to a Jerusalem.</P><P>Today, there are a few dozen meetings in Fukien province, with over thirty co-workers. Because the attendance in every meeting is large, the workers only know that their own place needs men. Everyone wants to work from the ends of the earth to the center. When we had our meetings in Foochow, some came without their mosquito nets or even their toothbrushes; they thought that they were coming only for a very brief time and were going to go back right away. Their hearts were all in their own places. At present, over a thousand people have accepted the Lord in Foochow. There are not enough workers. In Jerusalem, they needed one hundred twenty workers to take care of three thousand and five thousand (Acts 1:15; 2:41; 4:4). Today we have only twenty workers. These twenty workers are only a fraction of one hundred twenty. How can we meet the need? Today, we cannot drop the Lord's basic principle. If we do, the Lord's work will suffer loss.</P><P>The proper way is to first save men in Jerusalem. After these men are sent out, the apostles are sent out after them. After this, Antioch is produced. Today, the way of consolidation is better than the way of scattering. Jerusalem is not a question of geography, but a question of principle. This time, when I mentioned this matter in Foochow, the brothers there responded at the beginning by saying, "Let us wait and see." But by the time I was leaving, they agreed that this is the right way.</P><P>Antioch cannot come before Jerusalem. We cannot work from outside to inside. Brothers, is not the word of God clear enough? God is waiting before us. We hope that God would give us a blueprint for the work in China. How should the way in China be in the coming days? Should we for now maintain the works in the different inland places or temporarily drop them? We have to catch up with what God is doing wherever it may be. Today, we have too few co-workers. During the past years, we have lost one whole generation; we do not have anyone to come after us. At present, I think the first place we have to take care of is Shanghai. I cannot say how many places the Lord has to begin along the coastal provinces, but I do hope that there can be a little beginning along the coast. I hope that some brothers would rise up in Hong Kong. Something must first begin to move in the localities, before the workers will have works to do. We do not know what God will do, whether He will have a beginning in two or three places at the same time, or whether He will start with one place first. At any rate, we need a Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Every Believer Receiving Spiritual Education</H2><P>In the past, we had one great failure concerning our work in the local churches. During the years 1928, 1934, and 1936, we did make some advances in our testimony. Yet we missed many opportunities in educating the brothers and sisters. We did not educate our own brothers and sisters well. These brothers and sisters were born into our midst, yet they do not know why we are meeting as we are. To them, everything is more or less the same. The reason for this is that we lacked some fundamental arrangements, and we have not provided these ones the proper education.</P><P>The co-workers should know that the edification of new believers is a work that goes on perpetually. Among us, some have been saved for over ten years. Yet they have not confessed their sins once since that time, and they have not made any recompenses. Now we have to select thirty to fifty topics, and we should repeat these topics year round. These topics do not need to be improved. Every year we preach the same topics. In this way, we will be able to build up a firm foundation.</P><P>Today, we need to take care of the whole gospel from its very foundation on. There is a difference between preaching the gospel and teaching the gospel. In the former case, one can change the methods. In the latter case, methods do not have to change. In the matter of preaching the gospel, no two persons have the same kind of footsteps, and no two persons have the same kind of testimonies. But after a person is saved, the teachings they receive should be the same. In the future, we will all have to receive the same basic teachings before we move out. All the co-workers have to learn to receive the same kind of trainings before the Lord.</P><P>The kind of Christian a person is, is based on the kind of education he receives. In the Anglican church, a person is taught only to recite the Lord's Prayer. Such ones do not even know the meaning of "amen." I believe we have to spend half a year to a year for our work. If we do not put in this effort now, in the future we will still have to make it up. If we do not do this work now, I am afraid that the future generations will blame us for it. We need to have the same footsteps before we can have the same testimony. Today, we are short of standard Christians. By doing this, everyone will receive the same teachings. All the brothers and sisters among us must take care of these make-up lessons.</P><P>In putting this into practice, we must be a person who is living, and we must have an adequate measure of life. Otherwise, the topics we cover will become dead teachings. If we practice this in a dead way, what we produce will become another tradition, and it will result in another hindrance that we have to deal with eventually. If we speak in life, others will receive our speaking in a living way, whether the subject is spoken for the first time, or whether it has been spoken for over ten years.</P><P>I hope that the co-workers would be in one accord and would pray for the way of Jerusalem. This matter touches your future and your family. Perhaps we will need some kind of arrangements. There need to be some arrangements concerning who should go where and to do what. Perhaps some brothers have been staying in one place for too long; they need to be reassigned. After a person lives in a place for three to five years, he becomes settled and comfortable in that place. It is like a tree having taken root in a place; it is difficult to cut it down after the roots are there.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Replacing but Leading</H2><P>The principle of the work is not to replace others, but to work along with three or five others. If we want to see the work in Shanghai built up, we have to put all the brothers and sisters here into function.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Humbling Oneself to Give to the Poor</H2><P>In addition, the church must pay attention to the matter of caring for the poor. No servant of God can hold back his money. Every item that was there in the early churches has to be recovered. If one item is missing, the church will suffer great loss. Caring for the poor is one item of practice in the early churches (Gal. 2:10). If we want to match God's heart, we have to be recovered in this matter. Contacting the poor always enlarges one's heart. We should do everything we can to contact the poor and to help them. A church that is separated from the poor will not be a prospering church. We have to learn to be led away to the lowly (Rom. 12:16). We have to learn to humble ourselves, as the Lord humbled Himself (Phil. 2:5-8). To give to the poor is not to perform charity toward them. It is only when a person has learned some lessons, has touched something, and has some kind of wound as a result of this touch that his help to the poor is proper. When I was living in Shanghai, one time I invited a street boy to eat dumplings with me. We must look for opportunities to contact the poor. There are always people around us who are poorer than we are. When the Lord was on earth, He never separated Himself from the poor. Many people are wrong in their dispositions; they have never been trained. We have to learn to "step down," to humble ourselves. The more people are saved among us, the more we should give away our money.</P><P>In order to do this, many saints may need to change their jobs. Some who are in business need to change their way of earning money. Some need to change the place they live. Those who are in school have to realize that even their studying has to be related to the gospel. The gospel has to be the center of everything. If it is not, whatever we do will be out of order.</P><P>The Body of Christ is a matter that demands our whole life. When you listen to a message, you may nod your head or smile. But when you put the words into practice, it will make you cry and scream. However, we must turn back to God's ordained principles before we can have His blessing.</P><P>We hope that our conference here will end in May, after which some will remain in Shanghai, while others will go to Fukien. Still later, some others may go to some other places. In the end, they should still return to Shanghai. Shanghai must be strong. If we can have a proper testimony in one place, the work in the other places will be easy. Otherwise, we will not have a model to show others.</P><P>We can make mistakes. But we do not want to make mistakes. It is not easy to make decisions before God. We really hope that the authority of the Holy Spirit can be manifested among us. In the coming days, we hope to look back to find that we have not made a mistake today. The whole work today must be carried out according to the principle of the Body. It must be carried out in coordination, and not in a scattered way.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ABSOLUTENESS OF THE TRUTH<br>AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br>THE BODY AND ITS MEMBERS</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (10)</H1><P>Date:April 17, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ABSOLUTENESS OF THE TRUTH</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Truth Bearing No Relationship with Man</H2><P>In learning to take care of God's work, one basic lesson is to be absolute for the truth. No truth in the Bible is involved with man. Today, man is not absolute toward the truth because he gets himself involved with the truth. Because the truth becomes involved with man, when a man does not experience a truth, he feels that he cannot speak that truth. Yet a person has to realize that it is not because he has the experience that he is qualified to speak concerning a truth. Truth is absolute in itself. David said that all men speak vanity (Psa. 12:2). When he spoke this word, he was not considering himself. Before God, David considered himself a non-existing person. God's servants cannot look inward into themselves. God's truth is absolute; it is not involved with us in any way. Because the truth is absolute, we have to sacrifice ourselves, and we have to put ourselves aside.</P><P>Man always sacrifices God's word. Brother Yu and his wife are both here. Suppose there is something that a wife should not do in the church. Can our brother's wife do it simply because she is a responsible brother's wife? The responsible brothers often deal with themselves in one way and deal with others in another way. If we have to ask whether or not a thing ought to be done, then we have to put the same question to everyone involved in similar cases. A responsible brother cannot say that if such a case involves others, the question ought to be asked, whereas if such a case involves his own wife, the question can be skipped. Many times, we want God's truth to follow us. We become involved with the truth. As a result, we ourselves are drawn into the involvement.</P><P>Last year two brothers came to me and asked if a certain responsible brother had done something wrong. I answered that they considered the matter wrong only because they were not the responsible brothers themselves. If they were the responsible brothers, they would not have considered it wrong. This is what I mean by man affecting God's truth.</P><P>We have to realize that the condition of an individual has nothing to do with God's truth. If truth is affected by man, the truth will become the truth no longer. If the truth is not something absolute for you, you do not know God, and you do not know God's word.</P><P>In Foochow, twenty-seven brothers and sisters came and met with me. Originally, it was only going to be a talk between Brother Lee, Sister Wang, and me. In the end, all the others came. I could only present the truth to the brothers there. What I am personally cannot affect what God's truth is. We cannot say that a teaching is right simply because others are good to us, and we cannot consider the same teaching wrong simply because others are not good to us. Once the truth becomes affected by human factors, it becomes no more the truth; it becomes something else. If the truth is not absolute in you, you cannot go on. The truth can never be controlled by man. I cannot say that something is right simply because you and I are from the same school or were born in the same place. So many problems in the world arise and so many disputes in teachings result not because of a change in the truth itself, but because of changes in human factors.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Truth Being the Unique Standard</H2><P>What does it mean to say that the truth is absolute? First Timothy speaks of the pillar of the truth (3:15). Why would it say the pillar of the truth? It is because a pillar is something immovable. It cannot go up or down. It is not like a chair that can be moved from one place to another. If we are not sober, the truth will not have any effect on us. The truth cannot be entrusted to a person who walks according to his feelings. This is a great test. A man must stand on the side of the truth to oppose himself. Only by this can he maintain the truth instead of himself. Those who have never been dealt with do not know what is the truth. Some people lower down the truth a little when they are wrong, and lift up the truth a little when they are right. This means that they are like elevators, and the truth goes up and down with them. Only those who have dealt with themselves are able to maintain the truth. Praise the Lord, He is the "elevator"; and we are going up and down with Him!</P><P>The reason for so much darkness today is that man sacrifices the truth and forces the truth to yield to him. If we can take the truth as the unique standard, and if we have the courage to say that since the Lord has done such-and-such a thing, we admit that we are wrong, new light will come, and a new way will be opened to us. Otherwise, you will end up thinking that you are the only right Christian on earth and that everyone else has to go along with you. Even the truth will have to go along with you. Those who make allowances for themselves do not have much use in the hand of the Lord. A person must be able to say before the Lord, "This is the truth, and I am wrong." If you do not sacrifice the light, the light will uplift you. Blessed are those who can go along with the truth. Only those who judge themselves have the hope of going on. Those who cannot go along with the truth, but instead lower the standard of the truth, will forever live in darkness. Light will have no way to shine on them.</P><P>On the one hand, a man cannot preach the truth unless he has the experience. But on the other hand, a person has to know that the truth has nothing to do with him. If a man is brought to a point that he can no longer withstand God's word and that he finds God's word condemning him, he will receive the light. This is the basis of revelation; it is the secret to receiving revelation. Throughout history, no one who has received God's light sacrificed God's word. If I am not up to the standard of God's word, I have to catch up, and I have to go along with God's word. If I cannot catch up, I can only say that I have sinned. If we do this, the way ahead will be clear, and we will have more and more lights. Otherwise, our reading and preaching of the truth will become vain talks and vain preachings. Man's emotions can never affect God's word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Truth Not Being Affected or Changed<br>by Human Factors</H2><P>If a thing is right, we should do it. If it is not right, we should not do it. If you do not do something just because you have forgotten to inform a certain brother about it last night, the truth has slipped away because of your failure to inform someone last night. In this case, your informing becomes the truth.</P><P>We have to see that God's word is right and we are wrong. Personally, I can have problems with you, but this must not affect the truth. God's work is always sacrificed because of human relationships. The reason the truth is not absolute is that problems have developed in human relationships. We can sacrifice God's truth today, but what will happen to the next generation? What will happen to those a hundred years after us? If we sacrifice the truth, they will not be able to see the truth. In order to be absolute, a man has to pay a great price. But if we are willing to pay the price to drop ourselves, others will receive the blessing.</P><P>If I want to be near this pillar, the way is not for the pillar to move two feet closer to me; the way is for me to move my chair two feet closer to the pillar. I can move, but the pillar cannot move. I can change, but the pillar cannot change. Many people have changed the truth because of human or historical considerations, or because of friendship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RELATIONSHIP<br>BETWEEN THE BODY AND THE MEMBERS</H2><P>Brother Tang asked: What is the relationship between the members and the Body? Where does the individual end and the Body begin?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Starting Point Being the Body</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: It is difficult to answer this question. Where does the individual end and the Body begin? Let me change your starting point a little.</P><P>We have to ask the Lord to give us the mercy to have a make-up lesson today. We have to see that God's children did not receive an individual life, but a corporate life. God sees us as one Body, but we pay our attention to individual members. Suppose here is a stalk of wheat. You may say that here are just grains of wheat. Actually, there is only one stalk of wheat. Bread is made out of many grains. We have a corporate life. What you should ask is when does the Body end and the individual begin. When does the individual life emerge out of the Body? You should not ask when does the individual end and the Body begin. One does not put all the members together and form the Body. Rather, it is in the Body that the many members are produced. In the Bible, there is no such thing as individuals receiving life; all the time it talks about the Body. We pay attention to the members, but God pays attention to the Body.</P><P>Do not think that by saying this, I am bringing you back to Catholicism. In the Catholic Church, there is only the catholicity; there is no church. The reason for this is that it does not have life. The Body life that we are speaking of does not start from the Catholic Church, but from the corporateness of the Body. Since our salvation was not a strong one in that it did not originate in the Body, we have to go back to the starting point to make it up for our lesson today.</P><P>First Corinthians 12:12 says that the Body is one and has many members. Here it speaks of first the Body and then the members. We proceed from the members to the Body. But here it speaks of the Body first and then the members. First there is the life of the whole Body. Then we go home and live our individual lives. These two things point out two different stances. A different stance produces a different result. When I stand here, I can see a few stars. But when I step to the other side, I cannot see them any longer. The place one stands is very crucial. The stance we need to take today is that of the Body.</P><P>What we have received is the life of the Body. It is only after I go home that I acquire personal inward knowledge. Brother Tang's question points out our problem in this age. We cannot say when the individual stops and the Body begins. When the next generation studies history, they will say that Brother Tang is surely a man of 1948. Today, with the individual there is no way to go on. Only with the Body is there the way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Having Fellowship in the Body</H2><P>We have to know that the life we have is corporate. Today, man thinks that the life he received is individual, the experience he has is individual, and the conscience within him is individual. But in the future, we will realize what is the conscience of the church. In twenty years, this matter will be as common as having a haircut.</P><P>If a person comes up to any major decision, he has to learn to follow the Body and to fellowship with the brothers ahead of him. Do not think that it is a difficult thing to ask others. You have to realize that it is more difficult to be asked of others. No one likes to mind others' business. No one can have so much interest as to take upon himself everything concerning others. This is troublesome, and it is too much responsibility. However, if we want to take the way of the Body, we have to fellowship. What you eat and wear by yourself are things in the realm of Adam; they are personal matters. But if you go beyond the normal limit, I will say, "This is wrong. You have taken all your monthly income to spend on eating. You have indulged yourself in eating. For this reason, I have to say something." I have to deal with the matter. This is a matter of the Body. The way a sister dresses herself may have gone beyond a certain limit. At such times, someone can say, "We are not interfering with the way you dress, but this is something that is damaging the Lord's testimony." This is not being a busybody.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Accepting and Exercise of Authority</H2><P>Some people like to assume headship apart from Christ. These are busybodies. You cannot entrust authority to them. Authority is received from the Head. Only after a person has received such authority can he execute it. Only those who are willing to accept authority can execute authority. The Chief of Police has received a commission. That is why he can execute his authority. No one is born a Chief of Police; he has to receive the responsibility first, before he can execute his authority. We must see the Head first, and we must first realize that He is behind us, before we can have the assurance to speak. I have no interest in touching others' affairs. All those who are interested in touching others' affairs, who like to be the head, and who like to express opinions, have to be stopped. If we do not do this, all those who like to make a display of themselves will become the authorities. In the Body, it is wrong both to be free and to be autocratic. Those who are spiritual and who are weighty before the Lord should rise up to speak. It is not because we love to speak that we speak. When we speak, we have to speak in the presence of God. Those who by their natural disposition do not like to be involved with others and who do not like to speak should be strong to speak. Those who by their natural disposition like to touch others' affairs should be restricted. What we want is the coordination of the Body, and not the coordination of the flesh.</P><P>The feet are not comely. The head is comely. This is why more people wear shoes than hats. The stronger a member is in the Body, the more it can supply others. The weaker a member is, the more it should receive supply from others (1 Cor. 12:22-24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>REPORT OF THE WORK</H2><P>We need to give a report concerning the work.</P><P>For many days, we have been waiting before the Lord, inquiring of Him as to the way to go on in the work. We think that first we have to concentrate our efforts together to maintain the testimonies along the coastal provinces. The apostles remained first in Jerusalem. Later Philip went to other places to preach the gospel (Acts 8:1, 5). As far as our number is concerned, what we have is not enough to meet the need of the places along the coast. The political situation in northern China is very unstable. Hence, we should concentrate on Foochow and Shanghai, and we should have a start in these two places at the same time. At present, we have over thirty co-workers. The number is not large. We should not have other co-workers wait in their localities for too long. To maintain a local testimony, there is not too much difference between the effort of ten people and that of twenty people. If the Lord is merciful to us, Hong Kong can be linked up with Canton, in the same way that Nanking and Hangchow are linked up with Shanghai. These are only suggestions. If you think that this is right before the Lord, we can go ahead and try these things out.</P><P>Brother Chang Wu-chen, Chang Chi-jie, the two brother Chows, Hsu Chung-jie, Weigh Kwang-hsi, Sister Liu Hwei-fen, Kwei Ru-yu, Wang Hsu-ching, Juo Fu-ru, Miao Yun-chun, Mrs. Lin Pu-ji, Mrs. Lee Yin-shin, and Mrs. Weigh Kwang-hsi should go to Fukien to join the first term of training.</P><P>Those co-workers who should remain in Shanghai: Brother David Hsu, Chang Yu-chi, Chu Chen, Du Chung-chen, Ren Chung-shiang, Witness Lee, Jiang Shui-wu, Sister Ruth Lee, Chang Shi-nien, Pearl Wang, Chow Ching-mei.</P><P>For Nanking, there are Brother Chang Yu-lan, Chi Yun-tung, and others.</P><P>Brother Hsia Hsi-ling will return to Tientsin. He should drop his job sooner or later.</P><P>Brother Lan Chi-yi will return temporarily to Hankow. Later, if he can find others to substitute for him, he can also come to Foochow.</P><P>As far as the nature of the work goes, there is the need to resume the literature work. We still need to publish books and magazines. We hope that there can be the following publications:</P><P>1.The Present Testimony&#151;For the more matured ones. The content will be of a deeper nature. We ask Brother Yu to take responsibility for this paper.</P><P>2.The Christian&#151;For the new believers. We ask Brother Witness Lee to edit this paper.</P><P>3.The Glad Tidings&#151;For the gospel. We ask Brother Stephen Kaung to take more responsibility for this paper.</P><P>4.Newsletters and The Open Door&#151;Dealing with practical problems in the localities. We ask Sister Ruth Lee to be chief editor of these papers.</P><P>There is the need for mass publication of gospel tracts.</P><P>The editing and compilation of the hymnal will be taken care of by Brother Tang, Brother Chow, Brother Lee, and myself.</P><P>The publication and distribution of these papers will be the responsibility of Chang Hsi-nien.</P><P>To all the other brothers and sisters: The money that you have earned in the past, you can keep it for your own use. From now on, all the money that you make, other than what you need for your own expenses, should all be given to the work of the gospel.</P><P>To the sisters who take care of their families: We hope that you will bear a good testimony at home. At the same time, you should serve the Lord properly in the church.</P><P>To the brothers and sisters who are still in school: You should continue to go to school. There is a great possibility that in the future all of you will have to give up everything to preach the gospel. While you are studying, you should prepare yourselves for this. Wherever the church puts you, you should work there. Your future is governed by the gospel.</P><P>Today, we present ourselves once again before the Lord. We hope that Brother Tang and Brother Kaung will come out in the near future. By the near future, we mean the very near future. I hope that my words will not be misunderstood.</P><P>Brother Chen Keh-san will first return to Foochow.</P><P>Brother Hsia came out of Tsingtao. The Communists have arrived in Tsingtao. Your coming out is not a running away, but a move under orders. All the other brothers and sisters are left in the Communist-controlled areas. Many want to leave and do not want to stay.</P><P>Brother Witness has come to Shanghai, but his family is still in Nanking. His children are growing up day by day. Mrs. Lee has ways to take care of them. Without the proper care, in the future they may be difficult to manage.</P><P>Today, God's work requires that all the brothers and sisters give up everything they have. Individually, we should all try to save as much money as possible. The co-workers have given up their all. The publication of the magazines alone will need so many hundreds of millions of dollars. The meeting hall in Foochow, the guest halls, and the place for the long-term training in Kuling all need money. We have purchased quite a lot of land already, but we have not bought everything we need yet.</P><P>The meaning of handing oneself over is that everyone does the same thing and lives the same way. Yesterday, rice cost 5.5 million dollars per sack. I admit that I was very angry at this. In the co-workers' lodging here in Shanghai, even getting food becomes a problem.</P><P>We should never say that money is not needed in the preaching of the gospel. We hope that God will bless us more and will bless the brothers and sisters to have more income. Everyone who has handed himself over has given his heart and body to the gospel. Everyone has his responsibility, and unless all of us give everything we have, we cannot go on.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CONSECRATION OF OUR BODIES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CHURCH CONFERENCE (2)</H1><P>Date:Evening, Friday, April 16, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1-2</H1><P>Prayer: Before we are about to speak, may the Lord give us the anointing in our spirit. Lord, the more we fellowship with You, the more we feel that we are filthy and defiled. We pray that we may be able to speak forth everything that You want us to speak. When Your presence is with the church, there is light, and men will touch You when they come in.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONSECRATION OF OUR BODIES<br>BEING THE DEFINITE CONSECRATION</H2><P>Among all the passages in the Bible, Romans 12:1 and 2 speak of consecration in a most explicit, thorough, precise, and definite way. This passage deals with consecration in a most emphatic and serious way. Many brothers and sisters have heard the subject of consecration before. But when Romans 12 speaks of consecration, it mentions at least three practical things. Of course, there may be more than three things, but at least there are three. Tonight, we will only speak concerning two of these three things. The consecration spoken of here is too precise, definite, and explicit; there is no way for anyone to avoid it. In other places, consecration may not be as definite. But the consecration spoken of here is very definite. Sometimes, when you ask others if they have consecrated themselves, they may say that they have done so. But when you look at these ones, they do not look like consecrated ones. This kind of consecration is too abstract.</P><P>The consecration spoken of here is the consecration of the bodies. Many people have changed the Bible. They tell others to consecrate themselves. But here it says that we have to consecrate our bodies. Why does it speak of the bodies? It is because the body is the most definite and practical thing. If Paul were to tell us to consecrate the heart or the soul, it would not have been so definite. The most definite thing is the consecration of our bodies. If a man has brought his heart and his mind here, is that person here yet? He is not necessarily here. But if his body is here, he is definitely here. If I ask whether or not you have consecrated your heart, everyone can raise up his hand. Some have consecrated their hearts, but they have not consecrated themselves. The desire of consecration has to spread from the heart to the body. It is like sickness which spreads from within a person to his body. With those who have only consecrated themselves in an inward way, their consecrations are intangible and impractical. Only those who have consecrated their bodies are practical. This is the only place in the whole Bible that speaks of the presenting of our bodies. The heart is abstract, and it is intangible. Only the body is practical.</P><P>Brother Suen, what is your consecration? Is it a consecration of the heart or of the body? Consecration is a familiar subject. Many may have been bored by the subject already. But this is the first time you have heard about the consecration of our bodies. The consecration of the heart can be haphazard, deceiving, and misleading. But the consecration of the bodies is as definite as a piece of rock; it is something that a person can touch. If I were to ask if you have consecrated yourself, you might be able to answer "yes" with confidence. But if I were to ask if you have consecrated your body, what would you say? Brother Suen said that part of it has been consecrated and part of it has not been consecrated. Miss Hsiao and Miss Kao, both of you have been Christians for many years. Have your bodies been consecrated yet? We are like the students who have not done their homework properly and who need to have make-up lessons. If we have not settled the question of the consecration of our bodies, we have not yet settled the question of consecration at all.</P><P>Both the New Testament and the Old Testament speak of consecration many times. But Romans 12 alone speaks of it in a most definite way. Many people love the Lord in their hearts, but they have not dropped the world. Heart consecration is the preacher's consecration, whereas body consecration is the consecration according to God's word. This is much more definite and practical. If you have it, you have it. If you do not have it, you do not have it. Many brothers and sisters say that their consecrations are not complete. This is terrible! We have so many brothers and sisters with incomplete consecrations! This shows that their consecration has never spread from their heart to their bodies.</P><P>Tonight I am not preaching a sermon here. I am presenting to you a visible, tangible, and touchable matter. Have you consecrated yourself or not? If our bodies are not consecrated, we have not yet taken a start in our consecration. At least one place in the Bible speaks explicitly of the consecration of our bodies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONSECRATION OF OUR BODIES<br>BEING THE CONSECRATION OF OUR TIME</H2><P>How can a person consecrate his body? Brother Suen answered that we have to not love our life unto the death. However, I am afraid that rarely do we encounter death experiences in our lifetime. Others answered that we have to serve, to consider all things as dung, or to not love the world.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, the consecration of the bodies is the consecration of time. The body is limited to time. When we present our time, we present our bodies. If we do not present our time, we will not be able to present our bodies. In order to serve the Lord, we have to set aside definite times for the Lord's work. Some people say that they read the Bible and pray from morning until evening. However, we are not counting merely on these things. What is really precious is for a person to set aside two hours a week to devote himself fully to the service of the Lord. With many people, their service today is a kind of capricious service. They do not set aside time consciously. Instead, they do it whenever they like to and give it up whenever they do not like it. The consecration that we are speaking of is definite. It is not a matter of joining the crowd. Today, the church needs more brothers and sisters to consecrate their time. If some brothers and sisters will exercise themselves to give a third or even half of their time to the Lord, not for serving as a preacher, but in the way of presenting their bodies, God will be able to take great strides among us. Suppose the responsible brothers would take up a job in the morning and would devote themselves to serving the Lord in the afternoon. They may be holding a job, but at the same time they set aside definite times to work for the Lord in the church, and they allocate definite periods of time for the Lord's use. This would be a most beautiful thing to have. I hope that the brothers and sisters among us would start practicing this even from their youth.</P><P>All the services spoken of in Romans 12 require time. To manage, to teach, or to exhort, all require time. If a person does not present his time, the services of the Body will never be realized. If a brother spends a lot of time on his business, how can he participate in all these services?</P><P>Concerning money, a person should also set aside one-tenth of what he has to the Lord in a definite way. Even if you are without food and without clothing, you nevertheless have to set aside this one-tenth to the Lord. Later, the Lord may lead you to offer up two-tenths, or three-tenths. The young brothers and sisters should be legal about this and should be as strict as possible about it.</P><P>If our time is presented, our bodies will be presented also. When our bodies are presented, the work will come, and the blessings will come. The more we serve, the more there will be things in which to serve, and we will never find a day of rest. When the Brethren were raised up in England in the nineteenth century, everyone put in their hearts and their time. As a result, the Lord blessed them. Today, in London alone there are two hundred eighty of their meeting places. We all love the Lord today, and we have all consecrated our hearts to Him. What we need to do now is to present our time. This is a word for practice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONSECRATION OF OUR BODIES<br>BEING A MATTER OF<br>NOT CONFORMING TO THIS AGE</H2><P>In Romans 12, the second definite thing concerning consecration is to be not conformed to this age. There is a difference between the age and the world. The world is kosmos; it is different from the age. The age is a part of the world. There are different ages, such as the age of the Ching Dynasty, the age of the Chinese Republic, and the age of the "May 4th movement." These are different ages. The word age means the modern world. It means that part of the world that is before your eyes. With different people, the age is different to them. In north China today, a young bride-to-be would want a wall clock. But fifty years ago, no one ever dreamed of having such a thing. What is the age? It is something that touches your heart. The world is the whole thing, and the age is a part or a fragment of the whole thing. A man can only touch the age that is partial; he can never touch the whole world. For this reason, a man can only drop the age that is partial; he cannot drop the whole world. Hence, a person gives up the world through giving up the age. The real consecration is one in which a person presents his time and drops the age. If a person only presents his time, his consecration is only a half consecration. The presenting of the time plus the dropping of the age equals a complete consecration. The presenting of the time and the dropping of the age are like the left and right hands; neither one can be missing.</P><P>Your age may be a house or a 1948 model car. A person can say that he does not love the world, but he cannot say that he does not love the age. The world is too big; it is not movable. But a person can chip a piece off this world. A person cannot move the world, but he can move such things as the rings and the diamonds. Those brothers who are in business have in their mind a set of abacus all day long. Some would even give up their jobs as college professors or judges to engage themselves in business. The most fashionable world today is to go into business.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ONLY A DEFINITE CONSECRATION<br>ENABLING US TO SERVE GOD</H2><P>If we give all our time to the Lord, we will have no more time to love the world. If the sisters will give to the Lord all the time that they devote to beautifying themselves before the mirror, they will find time to serve the Lord. What we need today is to put into practice these two matters. On the one hand, the age has to decrease in us. On the other hand, the time we give to the Lord has to increase. On the one hand, we have to learn to give more time to God. On the other hand, we have to learn to drop more of this age. If you do this, you will find yourself a person serving God.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CHURCH AS GOD'S DWELLING<br>FOR HIS CORPORATE EXPRESSION</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LORD'S DAY MORNING MESSAGE (2)</H1><P>Date:10:00 a.m., The Lord's Day, April 18, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Chen Keh-san, Witness Lee</P><P>Prayer: Lord, unless the Holy Spirit brings these words into the depths of our spirit, what we speak is vain. We can do nothing. What we need is Your presence. Only the operation of the Holy Spirit will bring about Your work. Lord, we are gathered together in Your Name. You are surely with us. If we give Your light the ground, You will surely shine on us. You will surely cause us to touch You. We pray that You will stop Satan from occupying any ground in man's mind.</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Isa. 57:15; Matt. 1:21-24; Eph. 3:17; 2:22; 1:23; 3:10; Rev. 1:5b-6; Eph. 5:25; Matt. 16:18-19</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHURCH&#151;<br>GOD'S DWELLING PLACE IN SPIRIT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God Becoming a Man to Dwell among Men</H2><P>Brother Chen Keh-san:God dwells in the most high place. As far as space is concerned, He dwells "in the high and holy place" (Isa. 57:15). As far as time is concerned, He "inhabits eternity." In terms of space, when one reaches the highest place, he reaches God's dwelling. Airplanes can only fly as high as ten thousand feet or thirty thousand feet; they can go no higher. But God dwells in the highest place. He is also the One who exists from eternity to eternity. He is like a circle that has no beginning or ending.</P><P>The wonderful thing is that this God who dwells in eternity one day came to earth to become a man and to dwell among men. His name was Emmanuel (Matt. 1:21-24). The Pharisees asked when the kingdom of God was coming (Luke 17:20). They were the hypocrites. The Lord could not say to them that the kingdom of God is in their hearts. Their hearts were full of dead bones. The Lord is the King of the kingdom of the heavens. Yet He dwells among men. Where the Lord is, there is the kingdom. This is why the Lord says that the kingdom of God was among them (Luke 17:21). This means that the Lord was among them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God in Christ Dwelling in the Church</H2><P>Christ was in the flesh for only a few dozen years. After He died and resurrected, He produced the church. The producing of the church can be likened to the producing of Eve out of Adam. When the Holy Spirit came, He dwells within the believers and also within the church. Today, God dwells among us through the Holy Spirit, and here we have the church. At the same time, the church becomes the dwelling place of God (Eph. 2:22). All the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily in Christ (Col. 2:9). Everything in Christ is everything of God. Christ is like a bank, and God is like the deposits in the bank. If Christ "goes under," God will become poor. Suppose I put my watch, my pen, and all my money into this handkerchief. Either you take the whole thing, or you get nothing. This is God's way. God does not give fragments to man; He gives the whole thing to man. When a man receives Christ, he receives life, forgiveness, and so forth. If he does not want Christ, he will have nothing. Today, when we believe in Christ, we receive all the riches. Everything is in Christ. With Christ, we have everything. Without Him, we have nothing.</P><P>When I have the sunlight, I do not need the little flashes of the torchlight any longer. Today, God's glory dwells in Christ, and Christ is in us. What can be more glorious than this? Even if the head of a nation were to walk with us, that glory would not be a glory when compared with the glory of Christ. On the contrary, it will become a shame.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Triune God Filling the Church</H2><P>God not only dwells in the heavens or among men, but also within man (Eph. 3:17). Today He dwells in the church. Christ is the One who fills all in all. He is exceedingly rich. Today the Christ in you, in me, and in another should also be very rich. Moreover, Christ is also dwelling in the church today. Hence, the church should also be very rich. In the Old Testament, it says that one can drive away a thousand. Logically speaking, two should then be able to drive away two thousand. This is human addition. But God says that two can drive away ten thousand (Josh. 23:10). The church is filled with Christ, and Christ is the One who fills all in all. How rich is the Lord who dwells in the church! The church is His Body (Eph. 1:23). God has made us His dwelling place through the Holy Spirit (Eph. 2:22). The Triune God is now living among all of us, and He is walking among all of us. This is different from living within one single individual.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Being the Body of Christ<br>for the Expression of the Riches of God</H2><P>Ephesians 1 speaks of the church as the Body. Chapter two speaks of the church as the dwelling place. The Lord is living within us. Today the Body of Christ is God's dwelling place in spirit. Chapter five says that Christ loves the church and gave Himself for her, for the purpose of gaining her (Eph. 5:25). If He could not gain the church, His death would have become a death in vain. Through His death, the church came into being. The church is intimately related to the kingdom. Revelation 1 says that He has washed us with His own blood to make us a kingdom (Rev. 1:5b-6). The purpose of the Lord's death was to secure a kingdom. The book of Matthew also puts the church and the kingdom together. The keys of the kingdom of the heavens were given to Peter (Matt. 16:18-19). Revelation 9 speaks of a star that fell, to which is given the key of the shaft of the abyss. The things from the abyss come up and fill the earth, so that men have a taste of hell for five months and cannot find death even when they seek for it. What is the meaning of the keys of the kingdom of the heavens given to Peter? It means that the things of the heavens should fill the earth. The kingdom of the heavens is inseparable from the church. The kingdom of the heavens is a great matter. It is not brought in through you or me alone. Such a great thing as the kingdom can only be brought in by the church. An eye or a hand alone cannot do much. Today the church is here. All that there is in the kingdom of the heavens should be opened up and brought in by the church. The Lord told Peter that the things in the kingdom of the heavens can be opened up to man. To open up the things in the kingdom of the heavens takes more than one individual's work. It takes the whole church to do it.</P><P>Wherever there is the testimony of the church, Satan will use all kinds of means to attack it. Among us, the Lord is expressing God's glory, His authority, and His riches. What a glory this is! If we are here by ourselves, God will be limited by us. God's intention is for the church to testify to the authorities in the heavenlies. For this reason, Satan is attacking the church everywhere. Today, if we neglect the testimony of the church, we will surely fail.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>No Member in the Body<br>Being Unnecessary</H2><P>The Body needs all of its members. A farmer plows with his hands and eats with his mouth. His mouth eats what his hands produce. There is a story that tells of a country farmer whose chin was caught by the spikes of a tree. His hands would not help him to free his chin. Instead, all day long he rebuked his eyes for being so careless as to let the chin be caught on the tree.</P><P>There is no useless member in the Body. Even the Head cannot say to any member, "I have no need of you." The Lord is after the whole Body today, and not just after individual members. This requires that we pay the greatest price to accomplish God's will. May God be merciful to us.</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:15-16</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHURCH&#151;GOD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Intention&#151;Dwelling in Man<br>and Expressing Himself through Man</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee:God is God from eternity to eternity. With Him there is no element of time. Yet one day He came into time and became a man in time. He was a God high up in the heavens. Yet He came and became a man. The Lord Jesus is God becoming a man. First Timothy 3:15 and 16 tell us what the church is. The church is the enlargement of the principle of Christ, which is God living in man, becoming man's content, and expressing Himself through man. If we read carefully from Genesis to Revelation, we can see that God has only one desire&#151;to gain a group of people to be His habitation. Although God has His habitation in heaven, and although He has His habitation in eternity, He is not satisfied with this. He wants to express Himself and to manifest Himself. He wants a habitation that can express Him. This is why in the Old Testament God had the tabernacle. Later there was the temple. His purpose for having these things was that He wanted to put all that He is in these things, so that man could touch all that He is through these things. Whether it is the tabernacle or the temple, the principle is the same: they are there for men to touch God Himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God Dwelling in Christ</H2><P>When the Lord Jesus came to earth, God was living in Him. All the fullness of God dwelt in Him. He was one hundred percent man, a real man, with the only exception of having no sin in Him (2 Cor. 5:21). The Lord Jesus said that His body is the temple of God (John 2:19, 21). Where Christ is, there is God. God's righteousness, power, love, glory, and holiness are all in Him. At the critical moments, God would come out of Him. Outwardly speaking, Christ was a typical man. Inwardly speaking, He was absolutely and fully God. Outwardly, He was a man. This is why He could become tired; He wept, drank, slept, and behaved absolutely the same as a man (Phil. 2:8). Those who knew Him said that He was just a man, a carpenter (Mark 6:3). Even His brothers and sisters said that He was a Nazarene. Yet at the same time, at the critical moments He would reveal Himself to be the Christ of God, the God-man. On the Mount of Transfiguration and while He was performing the miracles, we see Him as God. Others asked who He was, and He said that He was God. Apart from Him, man could not find God. The content of Christ was God. Yet outwardly He was a man. We can say that such a One, who was a man outwardly, was expressing the God who was living within Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God Dwelling in the Corporate Christ&#151;the Church</H2><P>We have to realize that our Christ today is not merely the Savior; He is not merely forgiving men's sins and saving them to go to heaven. We have to realize that the minute we believe, we have received this Christ. Now God wants us to express God also, in the same way that Christ has expressed God. But how can we do this? All those who have believed in Christ during the past two thousand years are a part of Christ. Formerly, there was only one Christ who was God's dwelling place. Now, through Christ's living in us, we have become God's dwelling place also. When we come together, we become the most beautiful dwelling place of God. Many people believe that in the future they will live in heaven. However, although you are not in heaven yet, the Christ in heaven has already come into you. This means that God has entered into you. Where the God of glory is, there is heaven.</P><P>The church is the enlargement of the principle of Christ. The church as a corporate entity has extended Christ to this day. Formerly, the earthly Christ was limited by time and space. But the Christ today is not limited by time or space. He is in Hong Kong, in England, in America, and in Japan. Everywhere there is Christ. Today Christ is in the church. If you do not come to the church, you will not receive the light. It only takes a few seconds for a man to receive Christ. However, to know the riches of Christ, it takes a person his whole lifetime. Even then he cannot fully experience the riches of Christ. This is why we need to apprehend these riches with all the saints (Eph. 3:18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Being God Manifested in the Flesh</H2><P>All of God's riches are in Christ. Today Christ is in the church. If you want to meet Christ, you have to come to the church. If you do not see light, you can come to the church and you will see light. If you cannot get through in prayer, you can come to the church and you will get through. God's manifestation in the flesh today is enlarged through the church. We admit that we are flesh, yet God is manifesting Himself through this flesh.</P><P>In the future, in the new heaven and new earth, God will become a city. That city will be the enlargement of God's dwelling place (Rev. 21:3). The boundary of the Holy Place will be enlarged to become the city. God will dwell in this city. By that time, if anyone wants grace and light, he has to come to the city. Today, if you want to receive grace, you have to come to the church.</P><P>Concluding prayer: Thank You, Lord, that You have released these words. Today God has come forth, and He is among us. God has revealed Himself. Today, our eyes are no longer blind. May You open the eyes of many to see, and may the words spoken touch many in their inward parts.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE BODY IN 1 CORINTHIANS 12<br>AND THE WAY OF THE WORK</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (11)</H1><P>Date:3:00 p.m., The Lord's Day, April 18, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BODY IN 1 CORINTHIANS 12</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>One Body, One Spirit</H2><P>Brother Chi Yung-tung asked: How do you explain 1 Corinthians 12?</P><P>Brother Nee answered: First Corinthians 12 is a brilliant portion of the Scriptures that reveals the relationship between the Holy Spirit and the Body. We can consider the matter by an illustration. In the Western world, men build houses with concrete blocks. These blocks are like the Chinese bricks, except that they are hollow inside. When men build walls, first they fill up these blocks with cement, then put cement outside the blocks to join the blocks together. The life that we received is the Lord's life; it is not the life of our flesh. We become one Body through the one Holy Spirit. What we have received within from the Lord is the Holy Spirit, and the nature of our oneness without is also the Holy Spirit. It is like the concrete blocks which have cement within and without. The nature of what is there within is the same as the nature of what is there without. We are baptized into one Spirit, and we are made to drink of the same Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13). That which is first put into us is the same as that which is added on to us later. This is why we can become one Body. What we have received from the Lord is the same as what is joining us together. The basis of life is the basis of fellowship. We can say that there is only one Body because all the members are of the same nature. The Body is one, because there is only one Holy Spirit. The members issue from the Body, and though there are many members, it is still one Body (1 Cor. 12:12). The origin of the members is the Body. From the one Body, the many members are produced. Later, the Holy Spirit joins these many members into one Body again. It is like a wall being composed of many bricks, and the many bricks put together become the one wall. Oneness is not based on having the same heart. It is based on having the same nature. We drink of the Holy Spirit within, and we are baptized into the Holy Spirit without. This is the oneness of the believers. As members, we proceed from the Body and consummate in the Body. Looking back, we are one Body, and looking forward, we are also one Body. Because we are one, we can be coordinated together.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Power of the Holy Spirit<br>Being in the Body</H2><P>Based on this oneness, there is the consciousness of the Body. The operation of the Holy Spirit is found in the Body. The Holy Spirit is not simply the power of single individuals, but the power of the Body. The service of the Body should be the manifestation of the power of the Holy Spirit. An individual before God is like a one-dimensional plane, whereas the Body before God is like a three-dimensional object. Today, the age of individual ministry is over. The gospel has to be preached by the whole church. Everything needs to be dealt with by the whole church. In the past, a single individual might have been able to preach the gospel and to have results in his work. But today, all these things must be done in the Body. Once we touch the reality of the Body, the power of the Holy Spirit is manifested. Many times, matters cannot be taken care of by one or two brothers alone. Many people think that the power of the Holy Spirit is for individuals and that a man can take home a bundle of the Holy Spirit's power and use it bit by bit. However, we have to realize that the power of the Holy Spirit is in the Body. Life issues from the Body and returns to the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Standing on the Ground of the Body</H2><P>We think that we are first the members and then become a Body after we are joined together at baptism. Actually, we start out being the Body. If you like to be a member, you are a member. If you do not like to be a member, you are nevertheless a member. If you stand on the ground of an individual, you will miss the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The Body issues from oneness and culminates in oneness. There needs to be a great change in our realization of the truth. If everyone would stand on the ground of the Body, things will become much easier. If a man does not stand on the proper ground, much trouble will result. One piece of a jigsaw puzzle that is out of place will put many other pieces out of place also.</P><P>The more we deal with the flesh individually, the more flesh there will be. In the Body there is no individual life, only the corporate life. Anything that is contrary to the Head and the Body does not belong to this life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Riches in the Body</H2><P>Many riches are in the Body. The Body is full of light. Where there is the Body, light spontaneously comes. The Body is the place where light is deposited. In the Body, we have the greatest light. God's light is found in the Body today. How much individual guidance can one have? If you are not the eyes, how are you going to see? The Body is also full of supply. What one cannot obtain individually, he obtains in the Body. If you only exist as an individual member, it would only be a question of you individually being useful or not. But if you are in the Body, whatever function you do not have, others will make up for it. Their functions will become your functions. The hands can touch, and the feet can walk. This causes the members of the Body to build each other up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LOVE IN THE BODY</H2><P>Brother Chow asked concerning love in the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Love Being Expressed Only in the Body</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: It is difficult for an individual to love by himself. Love is in the Body. Ephesians 4 speaks of the "building up of itself in love" (v. 16). Only when one is in the Body does he know what love is. Philadelphia is manifested in love, and not in doctrines. Ephesians 5 mentions the love in the Body. Verse 29 says that "no one ever hated his own flesh." First Corinthians 12:26 says, "Whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it." One only sees a person hurting others' bodies. One seldom sees anyone hurting his own body. When we have the love in the Body, we can speak the truth one to another. With some people, you cannot rebuke them apart from the Body. But when you are in love, you can rebuke them. With some people, you cannot say an honest word apart from the Body. But in the love of the Body, you can say an honest word to them. Love can only be manifested in the Body. Only in the Body is there the genuine love.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Loving in the Body</H2><P>It is difficult to put into practice many things in the Bible unless these things are placed in the right position. When they are in the right position, they can be accomplished easily. It is difficult for one to love individually. But in the Body it is easy to love. For example, the Bible says that we are all priests, and that the office of the priesthood is universal. But if you say to a nominal member in a denomination, "You are a priest," and if he takes your word and goes to the pastor the following week during the Holy Communion and says to the pastor, "We are all priests, and either of us can conduct the ceremony," you will find that there will be immediate troubles. What we have spoken cannot be realized in certain places. Some speak of guidance, but ignore the Body. Right away, there will be confusion. Guidance is in the Body. Love is also in the Body. When a person is not in the Body, he cannot see the right result.</P><P>Many words which are difficult to say to individuals can be spoken in the Body. This is because with the Body we have the right position. For over twenty years, I have not dared to speak concerning money. But today, I dare to speak about money. This is because I am in the Body. If a brother has need today, I can take off my hat and ask you for money. If the same thing happened before and we were standing on a different ground, it would have been unthinkable for me to do it. Today, since we are in the Body, if I do not ask you for money, who do I ask for money? In the Body, asking others is just like asking oneself.</P><P>This is what we mean by the Body. Only in this Body is there love and authority, and only here can we deal with the flesh. If we are in the Body, not a single word will irritate us or cause us to stumble.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY OF THE CHURCH AND THE WAY OF THE WORK</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee asked: What is the difference between the way of the church and the way of the co-workers?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Taking the Jerusalem Line&#151;<br>the Church and the Work Being One</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: We have covered the way among us in 1937. At that time, we spoke of the difference between the local churches and the work. Our line then began from Acts 13. But during the past few years, we have found out our problems. We found out that we have to begin from chapter one. The Acts of the Apostles begins from chapter one. It is wrong for us to pay attention to the difference between the church and the work before the church is ever built up. We should start from the basis of the church and the work being one. Our mistake lies in the order and the sequence; it is not a mistake in the truth itself. We were not wrong in the truth, but we were wrong in the timing. Our work must first return to the principle of Jerusalem. The starting point of the church is the work.</P><P>Before the Lord, there is first the church, and then the giving of the gifts of the apostles and the prophets, and so forth. In Ephesians 4, the Holy Spirit and Paul did not acknowledge even the existence of the twelve apostles. The order there is first the ascending on high of the Lord, then the giving of the gifts. These gifts are given after the church has been produced. The prophets there do not include such prophets as Elijah, nor do they include such people as Peter before the Lord's death. With Peter, he was an apostle in two different ministries. One was before the formation of the church, and the other was after the formation of the church. The Peter in the Gospels is the Peter before the formation of the church, and the Peter in Acts 2 is the Peter after the formation of the church. This is why we say that in Ephesians 4 there is first the church and then the work.</P><P>Before God, first there is the church and then the work. But on earth, there was first the work and then the church. There were the apostles in Jerusalem first, then the church in Jerusalem. Afterwards, there were the deacons and the elders. In the church in Jerusalem, there were first the deacons and then the elders. Many people become a deacon first and then become an elder afterwards. Some need to serve first in the matter of food, before they can take care of the administration. The situation in Jerusalem is different from that of an ordinary church. There we have the elders, the deacons, and the apostles as well.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Consolidating the Work and Spreading the Fruit</H2><P>Please remember that Peter carried out his work in Jerusalem. Only Philip was sent to Samaria. Under normal circumstances, we should send all the Philips out. Today the co-workers should come together and work in one place, whereas the brothers and sisters should be sent out. The believers in Jerusalem should go out everywhere for the gospel. If we do not migrate today, persecutions may come and force us out.</P><P>During the past years, small meetings have been raised up in many localities. These are not the works of the workers, but the works of the brothers and sisters. These brothers and sisters moved to these localities for the sake of their jobs. At present, small meetings have already started everywhere, and we have to go back and deal with every one of them. Our problem lies in the fact that we did not pay attention to the sending out of the workers right from the beginning. This is why many local churches develop problems. It is true that the apostles should remain and work in Jerusalem, but their view should be enlarged to include other places.</P><P>The church in Antioch is of a different principle. Antioch is the case of the church producing the work, whereas Jerusalem is the case of the work producing the church. Today, we should first come back to take the way of Jerusalem. Later, we hope that some local churches can practice the principle of Antioch. First Corinthians 12 speaks of the Body on earth. It deals with the question of the church on earth. That is why it says that the apostles and the prophets produce the church.</P><P>Today, we need both principles. On the one hand, the church produces the apostles. On the other hand, the apostles produce the church. If our work can progress along these two lines simultaneously, we will see great blessings ahead of us. On the one hand, we should consolidate the work. On the other hand, as soon as people are saved, we should tell them that they live for the gospel. We should not wait until the persecutions arise. We should send them out right away. This is the Lord's way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>REPORT OF THE WORK</H2><P>The following is a report on the work:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Building of the Big Meeting Hall</H2><P>How should Shanghai go on? What kind of way should the church in Shanghai take? The foremost question is the building of the meeting hall. Either we do not build anything at all, or we have to build a big hall. Before the Lord, what we see is not just what we have right now. The brothers and sisters should have some foresight. Other than the big meeting hall, there is the need to divide the work into five districts: Chia-bei, Yang-she-pu, southern French Concession, Fu-she Road, and Inner-city. Shanghai has a population of 4.2 million; there are many things that need to be taken care of. Foochow has only 320,000 people. Recently, a thousand people were added to Foochow, and there was no way that we could take care of them all.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Everyone Begetting and Nourishing</H2><P>More important than the business responsibilities, there are the spiritual responsibilities. These are works such as the bringing of friends to the gospel meetings, the visitation of the new believers, and so forth. The friends and relatives that you bring to the meetings should be taken care of by you yourself. When the new ones stand up in the meetings to answer the call, the speaker will not necessarily notice them, but you will. The speaker on the platform can be deceived through oversight, but you will not be deceived easily. If every brother and sister will bring their own friends, men will not be saved in a loose way. You can be very sure that certain ones are saved or not saved, and it will not be easy for false believers or false brothers to slip in.</P><P>After a person is saved, the more matured ones should take up the responsibility to care for him. Sometimes it takes five to ten persons to take care of one. You have to help such a one to read the Bible and to pray. You have to follow him up and to check if he has consecrated himself. If you do not do your job, the brothers have to rise up to reproach you. You have to see if the new ones are coming to the meetings, and what their family backgrounds are. If a brother cannot come for any reason, you have to go to him to make up the lessons for him. Brother Cheng, if you are the one responsible for the make-up lessons, and others do not come to the meetings, you cannot sit there and rest. I hope that concerning the matter of preaching the gospel and the visitation of the new believers, every brother and sister will participate in the work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Caring for the Poor</H2><P>Another more basic work is the caring for the poor among us. No matter how high a position a person occupies, or how reputable is his name, he has to learn to be led away to the lowly. We should gather together all our used items, such as old clothing, old socks, and so forth, and should invite those who cannot make a living otherwise to come and mend, wash, and iron this clothing, and we should preach the gospel to these people. Whether or not they will believe, we will still ask them to come to work. If we do not do this, our heart will be too narrow. By doing this, our hearts will be enlarged. Many brothers and sisters do not have any patience with the poor people. By doing this, our hearts will be enlarged. If we do this, one day we may not be able to find any used items in the church any longer; all the old things will have been given away. The early churches always cared for the poor (Gal. 2:10). It is wrong for a church to preach spiritual teachings only. Among us, every one of us has to deal with the unbelievers, every one has to deal with the new believers, and every one has to deal with the poor people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The New Believers' Meeting</H2><P>Another matter we have to take care of is the edification of the new believers. We have been Christians for over thirty years. The more we go on, the more we are clear about the things that a Christian ought to have. There are many basic truths that every Christian ought to know, such as rising up early, reading the Bible, praying, consecration, dealing with one's past, dealing with money, meeting, singing hymns, and so forth. There are fifty to sixty items of truth that every Christian ought to know. We workers have a bad habit: We do not like to repeat any message that we have preached before. We always hope that the manna will be different every day. In conducting the basic trainings, not only must we be strict regarding the topics, but we must pay much attention to checking on the practice of the new ones and overseeing them. All the co-workers have to be living persons. If we are not living, we will produce something like the Common Prayer Book, which is dead. In order to make our service truly church service, everyone has to be living, and everyone has to take up some responsibility. The matter of serving the Lord is a Body matter. As such, everyone has to serve. If we exhort others to serve, yet we have no work for them to do, our exhortation becomes impractical. We must give everyone something to do. When the whole church is working, no one will be idle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. A Model of the Work</H2><P>I hope that the church in Shanghai can be opened up for others to come and personally observe the way the work is conducted here. They can come and see how new ones are brought in and how they are being sent out. I hope that in the future we can see something spiritual established both in Shanghai and in Foochow. We expect to see that after a certain point everyone will be a priest, and everyone will aggressively preach the gospel and care for the new ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Migration</H2><P>The matter of migration depends on how much the brothers and sisters have learned the lessons. If they have learned the lessons properly, they can migrate. Hence, we have to help the new ones to serve both in business affairs and in spiritual affairs. All these must be something practiced by the whole Body. We have to know how to deal with the new ones, and we have to know how to send these new ones out. If we do not do this, we will not know how the other churches are doing, and we will not know whether they are doing well or not doing well. But if we do this, we will help the other churches, instead of just criticizing them. This is our hope. At the same time, we hope that these brothers who are sent out will have the same footsteps and will set up a high standard. Those who are willing to join us can join us, and those who are afraid are free to go. It is not enough to be recovered to the churches in the first century in doctrine only. We have to offer up everything we have for God. Today, unless we are fully brought back to the beginning in our living and our practice, we are not doing any meaningful work. We ourselves must first be brought back. The co-workers must consecrate themselves, and the brothers and sisters must also offer up their careers. This kind of consecration has to be absolute. We have to produce a group of Christians who are different, who glory in offering up everything to God. We have to be such a kind of standard Christians.</P><P>How can those brothers and sisters who are in their jobs serve God in an absolute way? In order to do this, the co-workers must first consecrate themselves in an absolute way. Only when the co-workers are absolute in their consecration can such consecration be wrought into the other working brothers and sisters.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>MONEY AND OCCUPATIONS</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (12)</H1><P>Date:6:30 a.m., April 19, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SOLID CONSECRATION&#151;<br>HANDING OVER ONESELF TO THE CHURCH</H2><P>We believe that many of the critical issues in consecration have to do with God. But there are two conditions to consecration without which our consecration will not be solid. The first factor has to do with the church. Consecration is not simply for us to hand ourselves over to the Lord, but for us to hand ourselves over to the church. Surely when a person consecrates himself, he hands himself over to the Lord. But no one knows when this kind of consecration has changed or has been retracted. Only the consecration that is done under the authority of the church is solid, and only this kind of consecration will last. If a man says that he is consecrating himself, yet has not handed himself over to the church, such a consecration is not solid.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE THOROUGH CONSECRATION&#151;<br>INVOLVING MONEY AND OCCUPATIONS</H2><P>The second thing about consecration is that it always touches our money and our occupation. A consecration that does not result in handing oneself over to the church is not solid, and a consecration that does not touch one's money and his occupation is not thorough. These two subjects, money and occupation, require special attention.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MONEY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Relationship between God,<br>All Things, and Money</H2><P>How does God see money? Here we need to understand two kinds of relationships. The first is the relationship between God and all things. The second is the relationship between all things and money. God made from one all things (Acts 17:26). Everything a person touches with his hands and treads over with his feet is made by God. God not only made from one all things; He is even the Lord of all things. Satan is God's adversary. Yet he cannot deal with God directly. Because he cannot deal with God directly, he deals with all the things that issue from God's creation. Because Satan cannot damage God Himself, he tries to damage God's work. If Satan can snatch God's creation out of His hand, God will have failed. In order to damage God's work, Satan tries to snatch away God's creation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God Making from One All Things,<br>Whereas Satan Unifying All Things through Money</H2><P>Today I wish to point out to you the relationship between all things and money, and the relationship between all things and God. Satan tries to gain all things, but he cannot gain every item of all the things. "All things" are too much for him to handle. It is too troublesome to gain all things. "All things" include the cows, the goats, wood, stone, and so forth. You cannot exhaust the whole list of all things with a thousand lines. God made from one all things. Hence, Satan reduces all things into one kind of thing. This one thing is money. There is nothing in this world that cannot be bought with money. If a person has money, he has all things. This is why "money" in Chinese is tung-hwo, which means the "common good." You cannot call a piece of stone plus a piece of wood, two of anything. You cannot call a chair plus a table, two of anything. But through the invention of money, Satan is able to unify all things. He makes all things simple. Originally, the world with all its myriads of items was made from one. Now Satan is unifying these myriads of things into one through money. Everything that we see today can be reckoned in terms of money. That is why money is the means to unify all things. All things are created by God. Only money is not created by God; it comes from Caesar. When men asked Christ if there was a need to pay tribute money, He asked them to show Him a denarius, and He answered, "Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar" (Matt. 22:21). He did not take any money out from His own pocket. Had He done this, others would have said that He too had Caesar in His pocket.</P><P>Money is created by Satan for the purpose of unifying all things. All things can be reckoned in terms of money. The earth is created by God. Yet, today man can reckon the price of lands in terms of money. If it is possible, man will even reckon the price of the moon, or the hydrogen in the sun, with money. Today man can buy everything. He can buy time. He can even buy human souls. One brother worked in the post office for many years. The post office has bought his soul. Included in Jacob's wealth, there were the cattle and the sheep, and there were also the souls of men. Revelation 18 tells us that the human soul is a commodity that can be bought and sold (vv. 12, 13). God has made from one all things. But Satan has unified all things into one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Satan Withstanding God through Mammon<br>and Usurping Man's Worship through Mammon</H2><P>When we gain God, we have all things. In the same way, when Satan takes hold of money, he has everything. Money is omnipotent; everything can be bought with money. To buy wood, stones, or any other things that we like, we need mammon. In this way, mammon becomes the power, the center of man's worship. Is man going to worship God or mammon? This becomes the controversy of the universe. The worship of God lies on one side of all things, and the worship of mammon lies on the other side of all things. Mammon is diametrically opposed to God. Why can mammon withstand God? It is because it is the only thing that can unify all things. Covetousness is not only a root of all evils (1 Tim. 6:10); it is even the same as idolatry. Riches are an idol. The Bible says that covetousness and idolatry are the same kind of sins (Eph. 5:5). After a man is saved, if he has not dealt with his money in a clear way, he is not yet fully saved. If a person still keeps wooden or stone idols in his house, will we accept such a one for baptism? Yet, many people have never dealt with the matter of money after they are saved. Today, we say that India is a nation of idols and that there are more idols than people in that land. Yet, there are countless more people today who worship mammon than people who worship idols. From the people in Asia to those in Africa, from the scientists to the most superstitious people, everyone worships mammon. Mammon is the most common object of worship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Delivered from Mammon to Serve God</H2><P>God wants to gain us, and mammon also wants to gain us. Unless God's people are delivered from the power of mammon, they will not have a proper testimony and cannot be proper Christians. If a man tries to hold on to both sides, he will not be able to serve the Lord well. Why did the Lord put such a harsh requirement upon the young ruler and ask him to sell all he had? That young man was quite good and had kept all the laws. But the Lord said that he lacked one thing, the most important thing, which had to do with mammon (Luke 18:18-23). The same principle applies when Zaccheus, at his repentance, gave half of his possessions to the poor (Luke 19:8). The same principle can also be seen in Acts 4 where the disciples sold their land and possessions, and no one said that any of his possessions was his own (v. 32). By the time we come to the Epistles, we see Paul saying, "He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack" (2 Cor. 8:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Overcoming Mammon to Have Spiritual Power</H2><P>In church history, the Moravian church was the group that had the strongest mission. Its founder, Count Zinzendorf, gave up all his possessions for the Lord. Sister Eva also gave up all that she had. A few decades ago, seven Englishmen came to China to preach the gospel. They were known as the Cambridge Seven. Among them was C. T. Studd, who was a cricket champion. He had received an inheritance of two hundred fifty thousand pounds, which equals 1.2 million U.S. dollars, and he gave it all away. When he told the British Consulate that he was going to China, the Consulate General was shocked by his consecration and dared not accept his application. After a week, Mr. Studd was still firm concerning his decision. God could use Mr. Studd in a great way because he had overcome mammon. Mammon stands in opposition to God. For this reason, every child of God has to overcome the power of mammon. If anyone does not overcome its power, he will have no spiritual power. The power of mammon does not lie in how much mammon a person possesses. Its power on the poor may be stronger than its power on the rich.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Working Only to Sustain Our Living,<br>and Not for Making Money</H2><P>For this reason, no Christian should try to make money. Men think that it is wrong to make money by unrighteous means and that it is right to make money by righteous means. But mammon itself is unrighteous. Just as God Himself is righteous, in the same way mammon itself is unrighteous. Luke 16 mentions making friends with the "mammon of unrighteousness" (v. 9). Money is intrinsically unrighteous. Its nature is contrary to God. We have to be clear about the position money occupies. If we are not clear, it will be difficult for us to go on as a Christian. Christians cannot try to make money from the worldly people. If we do, we will lose our Christian standing. We say that our Father is over and above everything, and that we are His sons. Yet if such a person as we are would try to make money from the rickshaw coolies, whether it is ten thousand or twenty thousand dollars, it would be a shame to us. There are only two kinds of people on this earth, the unbelievers and the brothers. We cannot make money from the unbelievers. What then about making money from the brothers? Would we not feel ashamed to make money from our brothers? Hence, no one can neglect dealing with money properly. A Christian cannot make money; he can only work to sustain his living.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OCCUPATIONS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God Having Ordained That Man<br>Take Up Occupations<br>That Involve Manual Labor</H2><P>The second question is occupations. What are the occupations that God wants? God's will for man is that he has to eat bread in the sweat of his face (Gen. 3:19). In the Old Testament, God ordained that Adam must till the ground and that Abel had to tend to the flock. Men like Abraham and Jacob were all herdsmen. Genesis 4 mentions the "artificer in brass and iron" (v. 22). All these are manual labor. In the New Testament, the apostles were fishermen, and Paul was a tentmaker. These are also occupations that involve manual labor.</P><P>Paul said that to the one who works, his wages are accounted according to what is due (Rom. 4:4). Occupations that are based on one's labor are right occupations, for they have no element of money-making. Such kinds of occupations increase and add to the value of the goods. You cannot consider these kinds of occupations as making money; they are merely a selling of our labor. There are only a finite number of things in the world. Suppose there were only ten thousand cattle in the world, and through my farming there are now eleven thousand; my labor has caused the world to have one thousand more cattle. Suppose there was only one stalk of wheat, and through my farming there are now thirty stalks, or one hundred stalks. This is to cause an increase in value. Why do I gain some money? It is because I have caused the world to have ninety-nine stalks more. Paul brought the material home, sewed it into a tent in the night, and sold it the next morning. The money he made came from the work of sewing. However, if you buy five rolls of fabric, store it away until the price for the fabric is high, and then sell it, you have made your money without increasing the value of the fabric by one bit. We cannot engage ourselves in this kind of business. All the occupations that do not increase the value of the goods must be changed. We have to have a turn in our mentality. The mentality of many people is focused on money, and not on value.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Rejecting Occupations That Do Not Increase<br>the Value of Goods</H2><P>We cannot engage ourselves in occupations that do not increase the value of goods. The occupations that are right are those that earn wages through manual labor. Those occupations that do not increase the value of goods make a poor testimony before God and even before Satan. In addition, they corrupt a person's heart.</P><P>We have two brothers who were business students. Now they no longer want to study business any more. Commerce turns a person's mind immediately to money. Before the Lord, we have to be delivered from money. Our occupations must be such that they increase the value of goods or that they improve the goods. Only those who are undefiled in their occupations can serve God in a useful way. If there is a group of people who are delivered from money and on whom money has no effect, God will have a way through these ones. In Chefoo, the brothers with lowly jobs were sent out first. These brothers were all engaged in occupations that increased the value of goods. Some occupations are involved with commerce. Those saints who are involved with this kind of occupation have to learn to drop them. The assignment of co-workers is an absolute matter today. The assignment of the saints' occupations should also be an absolute matter. The co-workers cannot choose their own place of work. Neither can the brothers and sisters choose their own occupations. Those who are on the jobs need to be coordinated in the same way as those in the Lord's work need to be coordinated. God can only use clean money. The need today is too great, yet we cannot lower God's standard.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Occupations Having Much to Do<br>with God's Testimony</H2><P>Brother Chang's occupation is not very good. It has too much to do with the government and politics. A job in the post office does not have much to do with politics. Working with the Customs Department is not very good, because it can involve taking bribes from others. An occupation has much to do with God's testimony. Here is the need for one to pay a great price.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Offering Up Ourselves<br>and Our Occupations to God</H2><P>Our views have to be enlarged. A man cannot say on the one hand that he is learning to serve God, while holding on to money on the other hand. The Lord has no intention that we serve Him while engaging in some money-making occupation. I hope that we can offer up ourselves and our occupations to God for the accomplishment of His purpose.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Long-term, Normal Way&#151;<br>Providing for Those of One's Own Household,<br>and Accepting the Arrangements<br>Made by the Church</H2><P>During the time of revival of a church, there are special measures taken. These special measures are different from the long-term measures. During the time of revival, we have to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. But in the long run there is the need for the church to make some arrangements. At the time of revival, Ananias could not keep back anything for himself. The minute he kept back anything, he was lying, and he was sinning against the Holy Spirit (Acts 5:1-5). But in Paul's Epistles, we are told that a person has to provide for those of his own household and that we have to care for the widows who have no support (1 Tim. 5:8-16). In the long run we do not expect the church to do the same things as it does during the time of revival. During revivals, we feel constrained to offer up everything. But during ordinary times, we have to take care of our family. Particularly, we have to take care of the children when they are young.</P><P>The long-term way for the church to deal with money is different from the way it takes during the time of revival. During revivals, we cannot quench the Holy Spirit. But in the long run the church has to make some arrangements. In the early churches, there were arrangements. The brothers and sisters should also make their own arrangements before the Lord; they should save something for their own use, and they should set aside the rest as available funds. In this way, even the jobs of the brothers and sisters become something that is for the gospel. Everyone has to consider and reckon before God. Where there are burdens that individuals cannot take up, other brothers and sisters have to come in to help. The church should not bear all the burdens. For this reason, the saints' relatives should be taken care of first by the saints themselves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Whole Body Coordinating Together<br>for the Accomplishment of God's Will</H2><P>Our occupation must be such that we earn our wages through labor and through increasing the value of the goods. Today, it is not a sin to receive much, but it is a sin to have excess. It is not wrong to take in much, but it is wrong to keep the excess. We have to simplify our own living, and we have to save money for others. Only those who have given to others know that indeed it is more blessed to give than to receive.</P><P>The increase in bank deposits is just the increase in zeros; it will not give you joy. Only those who save for God, who labor for God, and who increase the value of goods will have true joy in their hearts. If we will practice this, the whole of China will be won by us. Even the whole Southeast Asia will be won by us. We can carry out our work under the best arrangements. During the past years, there was not much coordination among the co-workers, and there was not much coordination among the brothers and sisters in their occupations. That is why we have not done well in both areas. Today, the occupations of the working brothers and sisters have to be coordinated, and the work of the co-workers also has to be coordinated. If the coordination is solid and good, all the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs will become our true co-workers.</P><P>If the Lord comes back soon, we will all see Him. If the Lord delays His coming for another one or two hundred years, those coming after us will watch the way we conduct ourselves today. We believe that the Lord has set a straight path before us. Our conference this time has much to do with God's business, the church's work, and the whole counsel of God. This is not a question of individuals doing business or making money.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A TESTIMONY OF THE REVIVAL<br>IN THE CHURCH IN CHEFOO</H2><P>Brother Lee: Since the end of 1942, I saw clearly that unless the problem with money is solved, there is no way for the gospel of God to go out effectively. God's gospel has been preached in China for over a century. However, the gospel cannot spread to the inland regions. For over one hundred years, it has been Western money that has been supporting the gospel work. This money has been spent along the coastal regions. Many people became rich as a result of becoming believers. These brothers and sisters are no longer able to move, for they have been nailed down by money. At the same time, money was not able to go into the inland regions.</P><P>We saw that as long as money has not been released from the brothers and sisters, there is no way for there to be a genuine revival. On December 13, 1942, the Lord did a work among us. That afternoon, I was getting ready to preach a message on life. We had been preaching messages on life for two or three years. But that afternoon my message took a turn. From that day on, we saw that as long as the problem with money is not settled, God's gospel can never be released.</P><P>Today, God cannot be released because the gospel cannot be released, and the gospel cannot be released because money cannot be released. I know that in a certain denomination in a certain place, a few rich people put their money together and built a chapel. Yet the men themselves were still collecting debts and exacting high interest on loans. Can God be released under such circumstances? On that day, some brothers in Chefoo had been without jobs for over a year. Some sisters had to take up embroidery work, which required fine labor, but which did not allow them to earn much money. As a result, not much was received from the offering box. For six months, we received nothing from the offering box designated for the co-worker sisters. But on that day, there was a great difference in offering; many envelopes were received. The offering on that day was not a result of my preaching. On the 20th, which was the following Lord's Day, I went up to the platform again. At that time, we sang Hymns, #472, and many were moved to tears. They realized that the gospel had not been released because they had been holding back their money. By the next Lord's Day, the 27th, the Lord's work was even stronger, and we felt that we had to meet every day. Beginning from January 1, 1943, which was a holiday, we began to have conferences that lasted from ten o'clock in the morning until six o'clock in the afternoon. One brother was sick and could not sleep at night. The Lord touched him and asked him to consecrate himself. He could not resist the Lord, and in the end he yielded everything. In this way, about six to seven hundred people all consecrated everything to the Lord. Some consecrated their grant deeds. Others consecrated their stocks and shares. Many consecrated themselves for the work in northwest China. This lasted for three and a half months. We met every day for over one hundred days. One day I said, "Who is willing to go to northwest China for the gospel's sake?" Almost everyone stood up. Many were willing to move their whole family including all their wealth for the gospel's sake. The first group that went were laborers with lowly occupations, farmers, and manual workers. The second group that went had better occupations. Some were nurses, whereas others were doctors, or men with capital. The third group that went out were the preachers and the co-workers. When the first group moved out, it shocked the whole city of Chefoo, for the outsiders had reckoned that we would never be able to do this.</P><P>This kind of revival went on for three months, and we got ourselves into big troubles. This does not mean that we tried purposely to get ourselves into trouble. All the brothers and sisters had consecrated their everything. What should we do now? The brothers and sisters had emptied out their hearts and had offered up all their belongings. Some came laughing, while others came weeping. But all came with their belongings. For two nights, we waited on the Lord until after midnight, and we discussed again and again what we should do. On March 14, which was another Lord's Day, after the bread-breaking meeting, we told the saints what they should do after they have consecrated themselves. During this period, everyone got into this revival. Many dared not even touch their clothes when they went home. The minute they touched them, the Lord would ask them to consecrate. If they kept anything back, they would not have any peace. But when they offered up everything, they had peace.</P><P>I realized that it was not right for the church to go into business, because the church was simply the brothers and sisters. Hence, we considered the general condition of the saints and assigned them to various businesses. We closed down some improper businesses. The consecrated lands could not come under the name of the church, and they could not be distributed. As a result, we put them temporarily under the names of the original owners, with the condition that when the church needed the money, they would sell the lands.</P><P>Nothing of what we did then causes me to have any regret. The only lack then was prayer. This gave the Japanese a chance to creep in. At that time, we did not see that Satan was doing everything he could to frustrate the work. At that time, because the brothers and sisters had offered up everything, including their time and all their possessions, the church had to make some arrangements. It was also at this time that I fell into trials. I became ill, and I separated myself from the work. Because of this, I was able to escape the hands of the Japanese. After the past five years, I look back and realize that what we did then was indeed the Lord's way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COORDINATION BETWEEN THE WORKING SAINTS<br>AND THE CO-WORKERS</H2><P>We have to see today that we are not our own and that our possessions are also not our own. Some people should consecrate themselves for the gospel, whereas others should offer up themselves in their occupations. There is the need for the coordination of both sides. Outwardly, you may be managing your own business, but in reality and spiritually, you are doing everything for the church. I reckoned then that this was the only way to have a thorough coordination. Today, if there is a lack with the co-workers, it is a shame to those who are holding jobs. On the other hand, there are some places who have many riches and little work. This is a shame to the co-workers. We have to see what a great force there is when the two sides coordinate together. If we see this principle, we will be free, and we will begin to trust in our brothers in the coordination. If you earn ten thousand dollars, and you spend it all on yourself, you do not need the church to rise up to condemn you; you will condemn yourself. No one will need to say anything to you; you will condemn yourself. If you ask what we should do if some decide to take back their consecration when they hear this kind of words, I would say that we are not afraid of anyone taking back his consecration. If anyone can take back his consecration, let him do it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ON BEING THE WISE STEWARDS IN MATERIAL RICHES</H2><P>Brother Nee: When we offer up all our money and then receive it back again from the Lord, the money will be very different. Formerly, we were the masters. Now we become the stewards. If we are a steward, yet waste our master's money, the Lord's illustration says aptly that some will accuse us (Luke 16:1). They will say that we are wasting our master's money. Today, we may hold different standards of living. But the principle remains the same: We have to do our best to be frugal.</P><P>Once the problem of money is settled, we will become a broad person. Today everyone's mind is different. This is why the same word conveys different connotations in different people's minds. If I say that I will treat you with a meal, the northerners will think that they will have wheat rolls, the southerners will think that they will have rice, the westerners will think that they will have bread, while the poor people will think that they will have corn. In the same way, when we speak of the need of the church, different people have different thoughts and reactions. When some hear about the need of the church, they will say that it is all right to buy less land and build smaller buildings; they think that there is no need to be very serious about the matter. A person who is not serious will not do things in a serious way. However, we cannot consider matters from our point of view. We have to consider matters from God's point of view. Once the problem of mammon is settled, we will be enlarged. A man cannot serve two masters. Either he serves the Lord, or he serves mammon. The reason we are in darkness and are not in the light is that there is the entanglement of money. If we can solve this problem, many other problems will be solved.</P><P>The gospel has been "bottled up" like water kept in a bottle, and money is like the cork of the bottle. If money does not go away, water will not come. If you do not give away your money, you will not even be able to live a proper human life. A person has to open his eyelids before he can see. In the same way, if money does not go away, a person cannot see the Lord.</P><P>I know that many brothers here are more well off than brothers in other localities. In other localities, some people cannot even send their children to school. We can be in scarcity, but we cannot become small. We cannot become small just through our scarcity. We have to show other brothers that not one thing is our own.</P><P>What should we do as far as our practice is concerned? First, we have to write down a list. Should we consider the matter individually, or should we consider it corporately? Both ways are possible. Many brothers and sisters receive help through others' testimonies, whereas others look to the Lord directly. This is not the time to talk about the left hand not letting the right hand know what it is doing. It is not a question of myself as a person individually; it is a question of myself being a member in the Body. Even if we will lose our reward, it is still worthwhile for us to cause one or two brothers to rise up. Forget about our personal rewards in the future!</P><P>The church does not want to do anything that will eventually come short. We hope that more stewards will be raised up by the Lord. If some of us have made such a decision, they can present their testimonies before the brothers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FIRST HANDING OVER OURSELVES<br>AND THEN OUR MONEY</H2><P>What we want is first you, and then yours. I am a priest, and I live for God. We care only for the fact of handing ourselves over and not for argument. We are not here for money; we are here to help others to hand themselves over. If a man does not hand himself over, it is meaningless to receive a few dollars from him; it is better to return such money back to him. God would not be pleased with such money. In God's eyes, money is not the main problem. A man hands over his money because he has first handed over himself. You as a person are more important than your money. When a person comes, what he has will come along with him. It is difficult to say this kind of thing to all the brothers and sisters in general.</P><P>If you do not want to hand yourselves over, I will not say such words. But if you have handed yourselves over and I have handed myself over, then we can say such words. What we were not able to say among the co-workers for the past twenty years, we can say today. Today we are standing on the same ground, and we are working and serving together. We are all the same, and we are all serving God together.</P><P>We have to look to the Lord to bring all the saints in Shanghai into this practice. Otherwise, our words here for the last few days will result only in a few more consecrations. In another five days, things will all cool down again. This is indeed a serious matter. If we can bring the brothers and sisters into this practice, many tremendous things will follow.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PAYING A SERIOUS PRICE,<br>AND COORDINATING TOGETHER</H2><P>In all the past years, all of us have suffered so many dealings, made so many sacrifices, borne so much hardship, and paid so much price. But today, the Lord is asking us to pay a higher price. Only by paying a serious price can we obtain serious results. The Lord has no intention that the co-workers be the only ones to go through dealings and that the other brothers and sisters be exempt from dealings. It is difficult for the co-workers to be coordinated together. It is likewise difficult for the working brothers and sisters to be coordinated together. When two or three brothers go into business together, they invariably say at the beginning that they are doing this to glorify the Lord. But in the end, many times the result is a shame to the Lord. However, if you hand yourselves over today, things will be different. This is not just a combination of capital, but a coordination of the persons. Here, one person can bring forth results a thousandfold, and two persons can bring forth results ten thousandfold. If the brothers will be faithful to the Lord in their jobs and if they are coordinated together, there will be the blessings. With such a purpose, center, ground, and goal, we can bring in the Lord's blessing. When there is any hardship, we try to solve it in coordination. When the co-workers are not coordinated, they can do their own isolated works. But when they are coordinated together, there will be no more room for individual freedom. The same principle applies to those brothers and sisters who are holding jobs.</P><P>Personally, I am most reluctant to do such things. But looking ahead, the Lord has His works. For this reason, we have to take upon us this inconvenience and to have such a beginning. The co-workers and the responsible brothers should not try to avoid such an inconvenience. When we are doing our isolated works, we can be very comfortable. But in order for the Lord to have a way, we must be coordinated together. In the coordination, we have to accept all the inconveniences. If we do not do this, it will be difficult for the Lord to have a way among us.</P><P>During the past four evenings, my words have been coming out like water gushing out from an open tap. Once the tap is turned to open, there is no more thought of turning it to closed again. We do not know how far this water will carry us. It is not an easy thing for me to speak about these four topics. To speak about them is more difficult than to speak about forty other topics.</P><P>In 1942, we prayed much for the Lord to have a way among us. I do not know how much we had prayed. However, although we prayed so much, every time we felt that something was blocking. Because of that something, we did not get through. Now, we have broken through the small circle. We will see if we can break through the larger circle.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH<br>AND THE ADVANCE OF THE CHURCH</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CHURCH CONFERENCE (3)</H1><p>Date:Evening, Friday, April 19, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</p><P>Brother Witness Lee: First I would like to explain the nature of this meeting. The purpose of this meeting is to share with the majority of the brothers and sisters the things that we, the co-workers, have been discussing for the last few days. I will first begin with a question: From the Bible and from church history, what is the way for us to serve in the church?</P><P>Brother Watchman Nee answered: We have to ask first of all if the church has taken a different stand with respect to its service to the Lord. Is the church different today from yesterday in its stand toward service? Here we have two absolutely opposite and contradicting views. Many people do not realize that, on the one hand, the church is in desolation and that, on the other hand, the church is advancing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Beginning from the Time of the Apostles</H2><P>On the one hand, the way the church has taken for the past two thousand years is one that has become progressively poorer. In God's view, the church is fully in desolation. We see many sins and errors existing in the church today. From the Bible, we see that even the early churches were already in desolation. During Paul's time, there were already the false shepherds, the false prophets, and the false apostles. The condition at Ephesus seemed to be better. Yet in reality it was also in desolation. In Philippians, Paul said that all were seeking after their own things and no one was seeking after the things of Jesus Christ (2:21). Second Timothy was written by Paul right before he died. There we see also the condition of the desolation of the church. First Timothy speaks of the elders and the deacons (3:2, 8). But in 2 Timothy, Paul could only entrust the testimony to the faithful ones. It was as if he was saying that even the elders and the deacons had become untrustworthy. In 1 Timothy, he spoke concerning how the elders had to be faithful. But in 2 Timothy, he could only concede that there were wooden and earthen vessels in the great house (2:20).</P><P>Second Peter tells us that at Peter's time some had betrayed the Lord and denied Him (2:1). In the Middle Ages, the church had become degraded. It was not carried into Babylon at the fourth century; even at the time of the apostles, it had already fallen into desolation. This is why judgment begins from the house of God (1 Pet. 4:17).</P><P>John's Epistles were written thirty years after Paul's Epistles. In John's Epistles, we see that some had even denied Jesus as the Christ. They did not acknowledge that Christ had come in the flesh. These were those who had come as the antichrists (1 John 2:22; 4:3). Furthermore, the book of Revelation, written between A.D. 90 and A.D. 95, speaks of seven churches. Other than two that did not receive a rebuke, the other five all received severe rebukes (Rev. 2&#151;3). All the way from the degradation of Ephesus to the Lord's vomiting of Laodicea out of His mouth, there was a continuation of degradation. The lampstand at Ephesus was removed, and Laodicea was vomited out of the Lord's mouth. Although there were some recoveries in between, for the main part it was a situation of desolation. The book of Jude has only one chapter. It tells of some who had crept into the church unnoticed v. 4).</P><P>Historically speaking, the situation of desolation continued. From the second century on, the Roman Catholic church was formed in a general way. During the second to the third century, the practice of the local church was abolished. By the fourth century, at the time of Constantine, the formal church was established.</P><P>In the early churches, once a man believed in the Lord, he immediately dropped the world. The believers did not work for money, but for the sake of the church. The saints had all things in common. The brothers and sisters continued steadfastly in meeting and in the apostles' teachings (Acts 2:42-46). Because those who believed risked everything to believe, many were afraid to believe. Acts says that three thousand and then five thousand were added into the church. But it is possible that a few times more than three thousand and five thousand people had not dared to believe. Many people would say that to go in this way would cost their name and their position. Pentecost not only brought in people; it also kept people away. Pentecost is something that cannot be touched. Once a man touches it, it ruins his life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Desolation Continuing until Now</H2><P>The condition at the beginning was very different from what it is today. We cannot live on earth as if the church has never been degraded. We cannot offer up sacrifices like Cain did. The principle of Cain is to live as if a fall had never existed, when in reality there was a fall. Before Cain, there was Adam. God commanded that Adam had to eat bread in the sweat of his face. This was Adam's curse. Cain's mistake did not lie in the fact that he tilled the land and was punished. His mistake lay in the fact that he did not condemn Adam's fall. He went out to till the land without any sense of remorse. When a man sins and does not have the realization that he is sinning, he has fallen into the principle of Cain. For some, they are obviously in sin. Yet they feel like they have never sinned. Abel tended the flock, and God accepted his sacrifice. The reason God accepted it is that Abel acknowledged the existence of the fall. He realized the value of the shedding of the blood. Cain was different; he acted as if nothing had happened, as if there was no need for a judgment. Hence, while we live on this earth today, we cannot live without a sense of desolation. Why do we leave the denominations outwardly and separate ourselves from others? It is because the church has fallen. There are so many sects today, and so many people are nominal Christians. Under such degraded conditions, we cannot be dull in our feelings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ADVANCE OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>However, from another angle we may say that the church has always been advancing for the last two thousand years. On the one hand, outwardly speaking, the church is in desolation. Yet among the faithful lovers of the Lord, God's recovery works have become deeper and deeper, and more and more numerous as time has gone on.</P><P>While I was in Foochow, I told some sisters that the history of the church is like our own personal history. Please tell me, as far as our own history is concerned, when are we the richest? The minute we are saved, we are justified, sanctified, and regenerated. We have Christ living within us, and we have the Holy Spirit as our power. All these things are obtained the minute we believed. Although you may not realize that you have obtained these things, they are all there within you. When does a Christian become poor? It happens at some later date when he gradually drops all these riches. This is why soon after a person is saved, he falls into darkness and trials, and he loses all these things. After some days, the Lord's mercy causes such a one to regain some of what he has lost. Still later, trials come, and he becomes fallen again. The Lord's mercy comes upon him once more, and he is revived, and he recovers all the lost riches again. Every time we regain something, that thing becomes more solid in us than before. Eventually, all those things will become part of us. During his lifetime, Jacob rose many times and fell many times. But at the end of his life, he could worship God leaning on the top of his staff (Heb. 11:21). He regained all that he had lost. He was able to come back to God like one who is fully saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Age of the Fathers until the Time<br>of Luther's Reformation</H2><P>The same is true with the history of the church. The revelation in Ephesians reached the highest point. But this does not necessarily mean that the experience of the church in Ephesus was the richest. The church in Ephesus was like a new believer. During the advance of the church, truths such as justification by faith, sanctification, the oneness of the church, preaching the gospel, and the truth concerning the cross became clearer and clearer. That which was recovered at a later stage became clearer than that which was there at the beginning. From the letters that the church father Clement wrote to the church in Corinth, we can see that those men were less clear than we are concerning the gospel. Even Augustine's Confessions and Thomas &#224; Kempis's On the Imitation of Christ do not contain as much truth as we have seen today. Among their revelations, there are treasures, and there is also sand.</P><P>We have to see that the church stands in between these two contradictions today. Outwardly speaking, the church is becoming worse and worse. Inwardly speaking, its nature has become better and better. In his books, J. N. Darby described the church as a house in ruins. Yet many do not realize that the church is at the same time a house of revival. No one after Paul was able to match Paul's revelations. He saw the truths in a most clear way. Unfortunately, he is gone today. If he were still alive, you could ask him how he feels about today. Today, on the one hand, the outward church has become more and more fallen and degraded. But on the other hand, the inward nature of the church has become better and better.</P><P>Once a truth has been recovered, it can never be lost again. The truth of justification by faith was recovered in the midst of fiery trials. It can never be lost today. Let me ask you, in another one thousand years, will the church ever lose the truth of justification by faith again? The books of both Romans and Galatians speak about justification by faith. But of the two thousand years of church history, one thousand years saw this truth lost. However, once this truth is recovered, it will never be lost again. The book of Galatians was already there with the church for fourteen hundred years before Martin Luther, but the truth of justification by faith was lost. Today, through the recovery of Luther, the truth of justification by faith can never be lost again. Formerly, men argued in doctrine about justification by faith. But today, because many have shed their blood or been burned to death for this truth, it can never be lost again. What the church has inherited today can never be shaken again. All the truth becomes more and more solid as time goes by.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Reformation until Now</H2><P>After the recovery already mentioned, God raised up another group of people, men like J. N. Darby, and so forth. They saw something concerning the heavenly vision, the removal of the flesh, and so forth. There were also men like Pearson Smith, who recovered sanctification by faith. There was Madame Guyon, and there was George Muller, who saw the matter of faith. Then there was Evan Roberts, and then in recent times there was T. Austin-Sparks. We can say that there has never been a time when the church was as clear and as rich as it is today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Continuation of the Recovery of the Church</H2><P>There are sixty-six books in the Bible. Of these, only one book has no ending, and that is the book of Acts. This book only has a beginning; it has no ending. All the other books have a proper conclusion and an ending. After Acts 28, there are still many untold stories. John, Peter, Barnabas, and Paul all went to Rome and were judged there. The whereabouts of many other brothers and sisters are not mentioned in Acts. Why does Acts not have an ending? It is because we are still continuing the book of Acts today. The gospel has not been thoroughly preached, and the Lord has not come back yet. Today we are still writing Acts. Ephesians 2 speaks of the dwelling place of God. Ephesians 4 speaks of the perfecting of the saints by the gifts, for the arriving at the oneness of the faith and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ unto the building up of the Body in love. Ephesians 5 speaks of the church being without spot, wrinkle, blame, and reproach, and being fully glorious. These are conditions that have not been attained yet. We are still in the continuation of the recovery of the church.</P><P>When I was in England, Brother Austin-Sparks asked me what chapter in the Bible is the hardest to fulfill. I told him that the hardest chapter should be Ephesians 4 on the perfecting of the saints. After reading that chapter, I am very concerned that this chapter will not be fulfilled. I am confident about the other chapters. But I do not as yet have the confidence about this chapter. For the past two thousand years, Ephesians 4 has not yet been fulfilled. According to the present condition, I am afraid that given two thousand more years, this chapter will still not be fulfilled. If this is the case, humanly speaking, the Lord will not be able to come back. It is true that outwardly the church is in desolation. But the question today is whether or not there is a group of people who will stand on God's side to receive God's riches, and who will pay the price to appropriate these riches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FLEEING DISHONORING THINGS,<br>TAKING THE WAY OF THE RECOVERY</H2><P>What is our position today? We are standing between two contradicting things today. Outwardly, we should learn to condemn the desolation around us, and we should be separated from it and be delivered from all degradations. For this reason, we have to be clear about the ground of the church. We cannot say that everything is all right; we have to separate the vessels of honor from the vessels of dishonor. The vessels of honor are not born honorable; they become honorable through their separation. The Bible says that if a man cleanses himself from the dishonorable things, he will be a vessel of honor (2 Tim. 2:21). Honor comes through separation. All those who will not separate themselves from dishonor, who are not serious about anything, will be vessels of dishonor. What is it to be a person of dishonor? It is to mingle oneself with the vessels of dishonor without realizing that there is anything wrong. This is one aspect of the church.</P><P>At the same time, we have to learn to live in the Body, to learn to be the sons of God, and to learn to take the way of recovery. In God's eyes, the church has come up to the full measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ already. This matter was not realized in the past; it was not realized yesterday. But today it is here. What the Lord is doing today is much more than what He has done before. Today, Christians should come up to the standard of God's advanced work in this age. It is not enough to see just the outward desolations. There is the need to advance further to see the Lord's work today. We do not know when the Lord will stop His work. We only know that God is preparing the stones today. One day, when all the stones are prepared, that will be the day when the temple is completed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TYPES OF THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>In the Old Testament, there are two types: one is the tabernacle, and the other is the temple. Many people can speak on the tabernacle; there are at least one hundred books on this subject. But it is difficult to find a book on the temple. Men pay attention to the type of the tabernacle, but neglect the type of the temple. They think that the tabernacle and the temple are more or less the same thing, and that they are repetitive types. Actually, the two types are entirely different. The tabernacle was something temporary and on the periphery. The temple was something eternal and in the center. The tabernacle was in the wilderness, and the temple was built by Solomon. The tabernacle in the wilderness typifies the condition of the church on earth, and the temple in the kingdom typifies the eternal condition of the church before God. If we see this light, we will be very clear concerning today's situation.</P><P>God had obtained a tabernacle in Exodus already. This tabernacle followed the Israelites wherever they went. Later the tabernacle settled in Shiloh (Josh. 18:1). But the children of Israel stumbled and sinned. They had no king among them, and everyone acted according to that which was right in his own eyes (Judg. 21:25). Later the Philistines came, and they became enemies of the Israelites. Then Samuel, Saul, and David were raised up. At that time, the two sons of Eli sinned, and the Israelites were defeated before the Philistines. The people tried to take the ark out. The ark was the ark of the testimony, which was also the ark of grace. The Israelites thought that the ark could help them. However, God did not help them, and the ark left the tabernacle and was moved into the house of Dagon. God did not try to protect the Israelites for the sake of the ark, nor did He need the Israelites themselves to protect the ark. After the ark left the tabernacle, it never went back to it again. It remained outside the tabernacle until Solomon finished the temple, when it was moved into the temple. Jeremiah 7:12 says that at the time of Jeremiah men were still going to Shiloh. Because the ark had left the tabernacle, God left the tabernacle also. The ark had turned its back on the tabernacle and was facing the temple. This is the condition of the church today.</P><P>At the time of Solomon, the king went to Gibeon to offer up sacrifices. Solomon prayed for wisdom in Gibeon, and his wisdom was unmatched by anyone else. The Bible says that Solomon went up and offered a thousand burnt offerings (1 Kings 3:4). Second Chronicles 1 tells us that there was still the brazen altar, and there were priests at Gibeon (vv. 3-5). But the ark was no longer inside the tabernacle. The ark had turned its back on the tabernacle and had turned toward the temple. This is the testimony of Christ. It is also our way today. Our way is the way of following the ark; it is not toward Gibeon, but toward the temple.</P><P>Today, God is preparing all kinds of gold, silver, wood, stones, brass, and iron. One day, when the time comes, Solomon will appear. On that day, no one will hear the sound of any work, for all the materials will have been prepared (1 Kings 6:7). Once Solomon came, the temple was completed. The materials for Solomon's temple were not cut on the spot; they were prepared ahead of time. Although there are noises today, in that day everything will be coordinated, and there will be the temple.</P><P>The desolation of the church is a fact. However, the testimony of the temple throughout the past two thousand years has never stopped. One truth after another has been recovered. These are not small recoveries. Although there are all kinds of noises today, all the materials are being prepared. As a fulfillment of the type of the building of the temple, the church of God is advancing. At present, the materials are being prepared one by one. By that time, there will no longer be any need for any last-minute work; all that will be needed will be for the materials to be put together. The temple is not built on the spot. Rather, it is prefabricated. God's work today is the perfecting of the Body of Christ, and it is for the arriving at the oneness of the faith (Eph. 4:12-13). This has been God's work throughout the ages. His works today are more numerous and more advanced than His works yesterday. The Lord Jesus said that the Father works until this day, and He works also (John 5:17). As time goes on, the Lord's work becomes better and better, and the content of it becomes richer and richer. Today, if we take the way of recovery, we will surely see God's work among us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A PRAYER</H2><P>Sister Pearl Wang prayed: May the Lord's word not be distorted through man. May His word not be locked up by man. May we not frustrate God's work, and may we not limit His work. Instead, may God's work have a free way among us.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>DEALING WITH MAMMON<br>AND SERVING GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (13)</H1><p>Date:6:30 a.m., April 20, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</p><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MAKING MONEY BEING UNBECOMING<br>OF A CHRISTIAN'S STANDING</H2><P>Today there are only two ways to serve. Either one serves God, or he serves mammon. Of all the Christians in the whole world, perhaps eighty percent serve mammon. Of the remaining twenty percent, perhaps eighteen percent serve both mammon and God. It is difficult to find a few persons who will serve God only. In the past, we never mentioned the matter of mammon. On the one hand, it was because we were not faithful. On the other hand, it was because mammon is a difficult subject to talk about. Mammon itself is unrighteous. A Christian should not only consider it wrong to make money by unrighteous means, but should realize that making money itself is improper. It is not a question of much money or little money. God's word says that we cannot serve God even by making money by righteous means. If a person has not settled this question, he has not settled the most basic issue. God made from one all things, and money unifies all things into one. God created all things, and money can procure all things. Any thought of making money is a sign of serving mammon. Rice costs three million dollars a basket. If you try to make three million dollars to buy the rice, you are serving mammon. Where are you going to make your money? Will we not feel ashamed to make money from our brothers? Can we make money from the unbelievers?</P><P>For example, if the president of a country were to make money from a rickshaw coolie, would it not be very unbecoming for him to do such a thing? We are more noble than any president in the world. The worldly presidents are elected, but we are born kings. I wish that we could give away all our things. This is more proper and becoming.</P><P>All proper occupations extract riches from nature itself; they do not extract riches from others' pockets. For example, if there are two billion people on the earth and everyone has a dollar in his pocket, the total wealth of the world would be two billion dollars. If I try to make money, I will have to cause the money in my pocket to increase. In order for the money in my pocket to increase, the money in the pockets of others will have to decrease. How can a Christian extract others' money into his own pocket? Is it becoming for a child of God to do this? Any kind of money-making is a reduction of others' wealth and an increase in one's own wealth. What we have to do is to increase the natural wealth on this earth. Why do we have to increase our own wealth at the expense of others' wealth? How can a Christian do such a shameful thing?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>REJECTING OCCUPATIONS<br>OF PURELY COMMERCIAL NATURE</H2><P>All the occupations in the Bible derive their riches from nature. The fishermen derive their wealth from the sea. The farmers derive their wealth from the land. These occupations increase one's own wealth without decreasing others' wealth. It is all right for us to increase our own wealth, but not at the expense of others' wealth. The increase of the herd of Abraham and Isaac was a blessing from God (Gen. 24:35; 26:12). But the increase of the herd of Jacob came from Laban (30:37-43). The increase in the herd of Abraham and Isaac was right, but the increase in the herd of Jacob was wrong, because in making the increase, he did injustice to Laban. Today, there are many people like Jacob. If this problem is not solved, we cannot serve God in a proper way. As a minimum requirement, we cannot engage ourselves in money-making jobs. We have to reject any work that is purely commercial in its nature.</P><P>Ezekiel 28 mentions the king of Tyre, who refers to Satan. He fell because of the multitude of his merchandise. Merchandising is a purely commercial activity. Ezekiel 28 is the record of the first commerce, whereas Revelation 18 is the record of the final commerce. Ezekiel 28 is the beginning of world commerce, whereas Revelation 18 is the consummation of world commerce. Revelation speaks of "the merchants of the earth." The word merchants here refers to great entrepreneurs. Antichrist will use Babylon to carry out his commercial activities. Pure commerce is not just a matter of money, nor is it a matter of gold or silver. Rather, it is a question of where the money is coming from. Today, we have to pay attention to how money comes in. It is all right for me to increase my wealth, but I cannot decrease society's wealth. For example, to turn iron into steel is to contribute something to society, and such kinds of work are proper.</P><P>Today, our thoughts have to be controlled by God. Those who are for money see nothing but money. They do not see how many fishes have been added; they only see how many dollars have come in. Pure commerce is too great a temptation for man. This is why we have to make a complete turnabout in many things in the days ahead.</P><P>The Jews were originally farmers, tillers, shepherds, and laborers. But after they became degraded and were scattered into the nations, they became the most numerous and powerful merchants on earth. In the Old Testament, God allotted the lands to the Israelites and charged every one of them to work on their own land. The Jews learned the lesson through this, and they would not want to work for others or to have others work for them. They would rather manage their own business.</P><P>Here is a serious hurdle, and one that is difficult to overcome. We have to ask God to turn our thoughts around. It is wrong to make money. Somehow, we have to be delivered from money.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NATURE AND SUBSTANCE<br>OF MONEY BEING UNRIGHTEOUS</H2><P>Luke 16 mentions the unrighteous steward and the unrighteous money. There the Lord commended the unrighteous steward for his wisdom. He used his master's money to make friends. There is a difference between the parable itself and the teaching that comes after it. The parable itself goes from verse 1 to verse 7, whereas the teaching begins from verse 8. Here it says that the sons of this age are more prudent than the sons of light in their own generation. This one changed the bill of one hundred measures of oil to read fifty, and the bill of one hundred measures of wheat to read eighty. This is unrighteousness in procedure. Surely it is wrong. But after this, the Lord teaches us to bring people into the eternal tabernacle with the mammon of unrighteousness. Here we have the money itself as being unrighteous. Not only is the procedure unrighteous, but money itself is unrighteous. In the parable itself, it says that the procedure is unrighteous, but in the teaching it says that the money is unrighteous. Money itself is unrighteous in nature and substance. Here it does not say that wheat is unrighteous, or that oil is unrighteous. Instead, it says that the person is unrighteous; he is an unrighteous steward. And in the teaching it says that even money itself is unrighteous. Some people think that since unrighteous money can give us friends and cause others to be saved, and it can send people to the heavenly eternal tabernacle, this must mean that money is good. But we have to realize that before God the nature and substance of money is unrighteous. Today we need to repent for our attitude toward money. Money stands in opposition to God. We cannot allow one thing that is in opposition to God to exist. Either we serve God, or we serve mammon. Mammon demands man's worship, in the same way that God demands our worship. Once this matter is settled, our service to God becomes simple.</P><P>During these years, concerning money, the co-workers can boast that they have not been tied down with jobs for a living. Although the other brothers and sisters have more occasions to be exposed to money, they have to remember that they are serving God just as the co-workers are. We do not expect anyone among us to be a steward for his whole life and yet find nobody to receive him into the eternal tabernacle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY TO DEAL WITH MONEY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Returning Money<br>that Comes by Unrighteous Means</H2><P>When the Israelites left Egypt, they were supposed to take with them as much gold as possible (Exo. 12:35-36). If the money that we have comes from righteous means, we can give as much as we want to. But if it is gained through unrighteous means, we have to return it. Some people will never let go of the money in their hands. From now on, we have to maintain our Christian standing. We should have the sense that, in the matter of money, we can rise above others' heads. Others consider money as their life, but we do not. Money that we gain through righteous means can be kept, but money that we gain through unrighteous means should be returned.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Avoiding Occupations that Do Not Increase<br>the Value of Goods</H2><P>With some kinds of money, it is all right to make it as a businessman, but not all right to make it as a friend. These are things that we can have no part in. In short, we can only deal with this question by taking care of the principles; we cannot deal with it in detail. It is wrong to buy with a view to speculate. But if a man moves some goods from one place to another, it is a work of labor, and there is nothing wrong with it. However, if there is the need for bribery in the process of doing this, we are faced again with temptation. In choosing our occupations, we should take the broadest possible way, and we should avoid dangerous bridges as much as possible, because with such bridges there is always the danger of falling, and the fall can be quite serious. Always remember that the mentality of a businessman is on making money. This mentality does not revolve around need, but around money. It is not a question of righteousness or unrighteousness, but a question of our occupation.</P><P>Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi asked: Is an occupation with the insurance business all right? (Everyone smiled, but there was no answer.)</P><P>Brother Nee: Today, we should walk on the safe side as far as our occupations are concerned. It is not worthwhile for us to stumble because of our occupations. If I am to look for a place to live, I will never settle at the border next to Siberia. It is foolish to do that, because I would be the first one to be shot should someone come across the border. The wise way is to settle farther away from the border.</P><P>If we want to serve God, we cannot remain at the borderline. We can answer Brother Weigh's kind of questions a thousand times, and the problem will still not be solved. The safe way is to move a little farther away from the border. The main thing is that our occupations should not be a mere increase in dollars, but should be an increase in the value of goods. Any work that is of a service nature is always more noble than works that are purely commercial in nature. A Christian should maintain a high standard in the occupation he chooses. We have to study the noblest way for money to be earned. There is a difference between running a woodcraft store and being a carpenter. A carpenter improves on something from nature, whereas a store owner merely sells woodware; the latter is commercial in nature. It is wise always to stand on the safe side as far as our occupations are concerned.</P><P>Perhaps Paul did not have the time to sell the tents himself. Perhaps Mark sold them for him. If that was the case, Mark would have been acting as an agent. This kind of business can still be considered permissible. If I go into some kind of manufacturing business with three or five brothers, and one of us works as the sales agent, this is different from pure buying and selling. Hence, we see the need of coordination here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Giving Up Occupations that Contain Elements<br>of Danger or Temptations</H2><P>As for those occupations that contain elements of danger or temptations, we have to give them up. Some resignations involve time and cannot be completed right away. At any rate, it is wrong to take money from others' pockets. We have to settle the matter of occupation by taking care of the basic problem. All occupations should add to the value of goods. The world should see something added to it through my occupation. Works of a commercial nature increase the money, but do not increase the goods. If there is only an increase in wealth without there being an increase in goods, it is wrong. It is unjustified for us to take from society without giving back to society.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING BROTHER NEE'S OPERATION OF HIS PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS</H2><P>I think I have to say a few words to the brothers who are holding jobs. Among those with whom I have been having fellowship, the matter I am about to share has been quite clear. My personal affairs should also be handed over to the brothers and sisters and be left to their arrangement. It is a long story, and there is no need for me to go into the details of it. But there are certain things that I need to say. At the beginning, I told the brothers that if one day I, Watchman Nee, had to go into business, it would be to the shame of all the brothers who are in business. When the co-workers at times tried to go into business together, I always did my best to stop them. As a result, I began to hear words behind my back, saying that I only allow myself to go into business, but would not allow others to do the same. At that time, I told others, "It is enough that I have gone into it already. There is no need for all of you to do the same." Later I allowed three other co-workers to be involved with it.</P><P>From 1931 to 1937, the number of workers among us increased. At that time, many said that they lived by faith. However, they engaged themselves in many "methods" and "schemes." This made me disgusted. I told two or three of the so-called co-workers, who are no longer with us, that they are "living by faith," but I am not "living by faith." What I had said once to the brothers in business, the co-workers, and the ones who were so-called living by faith, I say the same thing today; I will not change what I have said. I begged these three groups of people not to put up their signboard of living by faith. I was hoping that there could be a fourth kind of people, those who can arrange work for the brothers and sisters, and who can help some brothers to live with a peaceful conscience. Although I dared not hope to give them a lot of money, at least I hoped that I could help them to get by in their living and to live with a peaceful conscience.</P><P>At the beginning, ninety-eight percent of the pharmaceutical enterprise was in my hand, or in the hands of those who had put their trust in me. Later this became eighty percent. After some time, I was left with only sixty-five percent. After the war, some had requested to withdraw, and my part increased again to become eighty percent.</P><P>I went into the business at the beginning with one hope. My situation today is like a widow with a few children, who hopes to raise them up, but who fails. Eventually the widow remarries, and after a while the children are all gone. By that time, she cannot tell why she had remarried in the first place. My hope today is the same as it was then. In between, however, something happened, and I cannot tell you why there was a "remarriage."</P><P>For over a year I have not involved myself in many things. When Brother Lee came to Foochow, the fellowship was recovered. But I must say again: My feeling today is the same as it was in 1939. Thank the Lord that in these days Brother Witness has the same feelings as I do. We feel that there are many books we need to write, and many hymns we need to put out. We hope to prepare a new translation of the New Testament. Yet these things are left undone. Some young co-workers wanted me to resume some responsibilities, but time does not allow me to do the same things any longer. If I were put back to 1939, it might have been possible to have another beginning.</P><P>Because of the four turmoils and the four incidents of unfaithfulness, money that would have been enough to purchase two or three meeting halls all slipped out of our hands. Last year, when money was in our hands, it was worth over four hundred thousand dollars. Now, other than the seventy-three thousand dollars that we owe to others, there is still in our hands over two hundred thousand dollars. The money I have in my hands is trust funds; it is what others have entrusted to me. I want to tell you that I am not running away from anything. From now on, this trust fund will be entirely in your hands. Twenty or thirty percent of the shares is in my hands...I cannot do it now, and perhaps you will not allow me to do it now either...What we personally feel in these days is a small thing. Nevertheless, my personal feeling is that, as I have been telling you these days, there must be some to come forward to offer.</P><P>Concerning the brothers who are in business, forgive me for saying a few uncomplimentary words: You have taken too much upon yourselves. It seems as if somebody is telling me something. Actually, no one is telling me anything...One sister, Amy Carmichael, who went to India to preach the gospel, was much helped financially by some others...Everyone is needed.</P><P>I have to say a few words for my co-workers. I know how Brother Lee spent his days in Chefoo. Some co-workers' children could not go to school and were starving at home. Among us, we have five widows who are without any care. Even today, Brother Tseng Li-san's child is still unable to graduate from elementary school. Today, among us, the number of widows left behind by former co-workers is not five, but twenty. While the husbands of these sisters were alive, they gave up their positions and their jobs. After they died, they were all forgotten. My co-workers, I cannot say that I am good. I admit that I have my shortcomings. We come short in the work, in offering, and in the Lord's grace. But I ask myself, "Why is it that among my co-workers, other than Brother Li-san who was killed by the Communists, ninety percent died of tuberculosis?" On the one hand, I have to say that we have not been responsible enough. On the other hand, I thought that it was I who persuaded them to leave their jobs. You may say that you trust in God, and that God can take care of them. But when I saw them one by one passing away and dying, I was angry. I may have done many wrong things, but God knows why I have done them...(Editor's note: At this point, Brother Nee wept, and everyone wept bitterly.) You may say that I have not been frugal enough. But you do not know my position. If this matter is not settled, many other things cannot be settled.</P><P>I do not count on receiving my reward before God. I admit that I had my mistakes. I looked for a way. I told others that CBC [the pharmaceutical enterprise] is a business corporation. I was hoping that I could render some help to those brothers and sisters in need. But I have no liberty in this matter. There should not have been the need for me to say all these things. But since you have handed over yourselves, I also should hand over myself.</P><P>We spent fifty thousand dollars on Kuling, another forty thousand dollars on Foochow. For the purchase of the land in Shanghai, we spent four hundred seventy thousand dollars. We have to give everything we have for the gospel. If possible, in the future, please do not force me to do the same thing as I have done. If my co-workers have to do the same thing again, the responsibility falls on the shoulders of you brothers who are in business.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BROTHER LEE'S FELLOWSHIP</H2><P>Brother Lee: For many years, God's blessings have been among us; they have never left us. God's responsibility is still on our shoulders. We are not so-called "watching the sky from the well," looking at the outside from our small circles. We do believe that God's blessing has not left us. Our responsibility on earth is not finished yet. I do not know how many burdens there are on our shoulders. Brothers, the population of our country occupies one-fourth of the population of the whole world. The most unreached continent in the whole world is Asia, and the most unreached land in Asia is China. The gospel is like a relay race. The Western brothers have sent the gospel to China. But because there was no outreach from China, there was no blessing. This is not God's principle. At least the gospel has to spread throughout the whole of China. Today, we can stand on a lofty ground and say that God can do everything. But who will meet the need? If we are not faithful, God will cause a reaction. If we are not faithful this time, the blessing will come again. But when it does, there will be confusion. It is like a farmer directing water to his field; there must be the proper water ducts. Without the ducts and the ditches, the water will flow all over. If we are more faithful before the Lord and will dig a deeper channel, the water will flow better. God has put us in this place; it is a blessed place. Here we need two groups of people. One is the group that offer their time and bodies for the work of the gospel. The other is the group that offer their money for the gospel.</P><P>My words are for both groups of people. I speak to myself, and I speak to the brothers and sisters. In 1943, I went through a severe trial. For a few days, I was asking the Lord why my way was so difficult. Although I cannot say that there was a time when I had nothing to put on my stove, I did fall ill of tuberculosis. It was hard financially. It was hard circumstantially. I was tired in my body, and the Japanese were threatening me. At that time, God provided for me sixteen hundred U.S. dollars through a sister. But later, when I tried to escape, not one dollar was with me. I admit that I felt frustrated. For some time, financially I was at the end of the rope. I could not hold on any longer. I almost collapsed. I told the Lord that I would never admit that my way was wrong. If I were to die that way, so let it be. Yet I would never admit that my way was wrong.</P><P>One day, one co-worker came to see me, and he asked, "Should I go back to my job?" I was not weeping outside, but I was weeping inside. I said, "Between the two things, you have to consider what is God's will; you have to consider if God has called you to be full-time and if He has given you the commission." When I said that, I was suppressing God's feeling within me. I saw the difficult circumstances, and I could not bring myself to say what I should have said. That was why I told him to go back to his job.</P><P>I do not say that I have done a good work. In Chefoo, many people have asked me to help to train some young ones. I was not so strict with them. If I were to be stricter, I would have said, "The way is here before you. It is up to you to take it or not to take it." Everything will have its final reckoning before the Lord...We have to admit that God's blessing is among us, and it has exceeded the financial limitations that we have put on Him.</P><P>From last year until today, we have been trying to buy some land. Because our requirements are too high, and the supply has not come up to the need, what we have received up until today, including what Brother Nee has come up with, is only enough to buy half of the proposed land. If we had three to four hundred gold bars in our hands, the new meeting hall would have been finished nine months ago. This matter is a big burden upon us. Now, brothers everywhere have handed themselves over. It may seem that if we go on this way, we will stir up trouble. But even if we are to stir up trouble, and even if we are to die for it, we have to strive on. In the summer, over one hundred brothers and sisters will have to be trained in Foochow. Every one of them needs three million dollars for support. How much money do we need here!</P><P>My co-workers, I admit that the way ahead is not easy. I admit that there will be sufferings. You brothers who are holding jobs should ask the Lord and inquire of Him. How should these problems be solved?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BROTHER NEE'S FELLOWSHIP</H2><P>Brother Nee: I beg that all of you would take up the things that are in my hands. For you to go into business, there is no shame. But for me to go into business, there is the shame. But I will still say that the responsibility today is on your shoulders.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FELLOWSHIP AND EXHORTATIONS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (14)</H1><p>Date:6:30 a.m., Wednesday, April 21, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Nature:Testimonies and questions by the co-workers, and exhortations by Watchman Nee</p><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>INDIVIDUALS HANDING OVER<br>RESULTING IN THE BODY TAKING OVER</H2><P>Brother Du Chung-chun asked: What occupations are considered proper?</P><P>Brother Nee answered: Brother Chu said something once: "If I hand something over to the Body, I do not have to take care of it any longer. It is no longer my own business, but the Body's business." This is rightly put. Your burden is no longer on your shoulders, but on the shoulders of the brothers and sisters and the church. If you hand yourself over, everything becomes the Lord's. If you make money, it is God who is making the money; and if you lose money, it is God who is losing the money. Our principle is to let the dead bury the dead. We have to know that to serve God is not just a matter of serving God alone, but to serve Him in the Body. Today, by the grace of God, we have handed ourselves over. If you merely say with your mouth that you are serving God, nobody knows when you have stopped this service. This kind of service is not definite. However, if you hand yourself over, you cannot turn back even if you want to. You may say that you cannot walk, but many others will carry you; they can move you. If our service is for the church, we will be able to give up even the things that we could not otherwise give up. It is not a matter of my own arrangement, but a matter of the Lord's arrangement in the Body. It is a tremendous thing for a person to decide to consecrate himself. However, this thing is not done individually, but in the Body.</P><P>Brother Chow asked: In the future, should the brothers engage in business by using the name of the church? (No answer from Brother Nee.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SISTER RUTH LEE'S FELLOWSHIP AND TESTIMONY</H2><P>Sister Ruth Lee: I have asked for permission already from the other brothers concerning what I am about to say. It all happened about thirteen years ago. At that time I wanted to have an apartment, but I could not go into detail about the reason for having it...Although I have been negative in recent years, there was still a supply from the brothers. Brother Chu gave me ten thousand dollars, and when Brother Chang Tze-che came from Tsingtao, he gave me a few thousand dollars. From that time on, I decided to set aside a certain amount from what I have received...When I moved back from the countryside, I saw many more white-haired people in the church. The next time I came back, there were even more white hairs...The sisters had given up all their savings, and some sisters had to stay in the hospital and could not go home...What I have can only become less; it will never become more. All the money that I have is enough to feed one more person for a month only; it will be gone by the second month. I can sleep on the floor and let others sleep on my bed. But others will not feel comfortable sleeping this way. If we have to provide a place for others to rest, it should be a place where others can rest comfortably. I felt that somehow I have to have a place that is like a home, that others will not feel ashamed or burdensome to live in, and which is close to the meeting hall. Only then will such a place be able to render others some spiritual help...When a person gets older, she tends to develop her own peculiarities. Others say that living together provides fellowship. Actually, living together provides frustrations. This is why I have hoped all the time to have a place that can provide hospitality for the saints. Brother Lee said that perhaps they can provide a place for me in Chefoo.</P><P>Today, I ask Brother Nee to forgive me for all my past attitudes and words. I also ask the responsible brothers to forgive me for my past attitudes and words. I was sympathetic toward Brother Nee's venture into business. Concerning the CBC Laboratory, I heard too many words, and they made me angry. Eventually, these angers spilled over to Brother Nee. Brother Nee said, "The magistrates are the only ones that can light a fire; the common folks should not even light a lamp." [Translator's note: A Chinese idiom meaning that only one is allowed to do something, referring to Brother Nee's venture into business.] I am not Brother Nee, and I cannot speak for him in many things. When others said that Brother Nee was wrong, how could I take such words? I could not single out Brother Nee for blame. As a result, I began to blame the other responsible brothers. Since they had promised that this [the business venture] was God's will already, how could I stop other brothers and sisters? Yet when others came to me, they were bothered to the point of a mental breakdown, and I could not help but sympathize with them. It is God's grace that I have not had a mental breakdown today. Even if ninety-nine percent of the responsibility lies with others, I still hold one percent of the responsibility. Actually, I should say that I hold more than one percent of the responsibility.</P><P>At one time, some people criticized the book The Normal Christian Church Life and asked me to say something bad about Brother Nee. People wanted to use me as a tool to oppose Brother Nee.</P><P>Concerning the CBC Laboratory, I did tell people that it was a "gossip center." My motive concerning the business was bitter, and my attitude toward Brother Nee was also bitter. I would not say that I have never condemned anything; there were indeed things which I took offense in. Once a person got involved with the CBC Lab, their spiritual condition collapsed. If what has happened these few days had happened then, none of what I am saying would need to be said.</P><P>I wish that the tears I shed today would be my last tears. I wish that when I leave the world one day, and others open up my closets, they will find them empty. If my closets are full, it will be to my shame. I realize that it is better to prefer poverty than to prefer wealth. During these years, I did have the thought of selling everything I have. Sometimes I cannot recognize my own belongings. Others always push me to buy something for myself, but I always give this and that kind of excuse. I seldom buy things for myself. When I bought an overcoat, it was three people who literally dragged me to the store to buy it. I do not care much for my own clothing. I am not saving things in my closets and keeping them for myself. As for cash, I cannot come up with even a thousand dollars. I do not have a single piece of gold with me. I can testify for my conscience' sake that all that I have is worth nothing; everything I have is what I need for myself. Of course, I can hand over my rice and my oil. I can give my last drop to the church.</P><P>The last time, when the church proposed to buy a piece of land, some people were blaming others, while others were plainly sitting back and watching. At that time, twenty pieces of gold would have done the job. But we waited and waited, until all the money was gone, and everyone was still sitting there watching. Because of this, we accomplished nothing. This is wrong. If everyone hands himself over today, what follows is the responsibility of the church. I open up myself this way today out of necessity. My words end here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>REQUIREMENTS OF A WORKER</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Proper and Pure Spirit</H2><P>One brother asked: When is it the time to say, "Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth" (1 Sam. 3:9)?</P><P>Brother Nee answered: In the past, the brothers in all the localities gave the co-workers quite a lot of headaches. Some people were quite zealous outwardly, and they wanted to work full-time. The brothers in those localities went ahead and acknowledged such ones as co-workers, and they received such ones as co-workers on our behalf. This brought us a lot of problems. We cannot recognize such acknowledgments. Those who serve with the ministry of the word ought to learn to touch others' spirit. A servant of God ought to know, when others are speaking, whether the speaker's spirit is in accord with him or is in contradiction to him. The spirit of some is improper or defiled. There is no way for us to remove their defilements. For example, you may come and tell me that Brother Suen is wrong. If Brother Hsu comes along and asks me how Brother Suen is doing, I cannot tell him Brother Suen's mistakes. Even if I were to tell Brother Hsu the mistakes, he may not believe me. Hence, we hope that all those who wish to serve the Lord full-time will first learn some lessons in the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Waiting for Confirmation</H2><P>I am not saying that those who want to give themselves to the work have to be perfect in any sense. However, their spirit has to be pure and simple before the Lord. You may not know the kind of spirit you have. Up to a certain point, everyone else may say that now is the time for you to drop your job. By that time, you should drop your job. Even though some have a heart to serve full-time, they should still wait in their jobs for a while. The question is whether or not the Lord wants such a one to drop everything to serve God at that time.</P><P>Our brother Philip Luan died because of our unfaithfulness. He left his job, but did not receive adequate care. Hardly can we find another brother who loved the Lord as much as he did. We did not have enough light. If we did, and we realized the hardship in the environment, we would have persuaded him to go back to his job. Everyone should have the same need in the preaching of the gospel. Brother Hsia Hsi-ling has a good job at the customs department. He has been working there for many years. He has not asked if he should drop that job, but we feel that he should drop it. Everyone has to offer up himself to the Lord. Those brothers and sisters who are in their jobs are not the first-class citizens. Unless everyone offers up everything, we have no way to go on.</P><P>Brother Suen Chang-ming asked: Everyone should be a priest. This kind of service is a matter of coordination. Now in our factory, we have to support one hundred workers, and the burden is already very heavy. In Acts 2 and 4, there were over eight thousand people that needed support. How did they do it?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>"Offer Up Yourselves"</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: After the war, the CBC Laboratory was worth eight hundred thousand dollars. Last year, it was worth only four hundred thousand. This year, it is worth 1.2 million. Yet we owe others seven hundred thousand dollars. We have no idea what will happen next year.</P><P>When we were going to buy the land from Mrs. Chow, some consecrated all they had by selling everything. I felt that that money was blood money. After I made the announcement the first and the second time, I dared not make any more announcements, because all the ones who were giving money were middle-class and lower middle-class saints. Those who had the money and who should have offered were slow to move.</P><P>After that first failure, I dared not ask others for money again. I told others that, should we have to build a meeting hall, I would do it myself. Sister Ruth Lee may have harbored some complaints against me, that I did not take care of so many works that were necessary, and that instead I went into business. But in order for the work to be done properly, some have to sacrifice themselves. I can say this word to you today: I have done my work, and I have sacrificed myself. Today, I am a part of those who are sharing responsibilities in the work, and I am also a part of those who are holding jobs. I am not an insensitive person. For you to go into business, there is no sense of shame. But for me to go into business, there is the sense of shame. I know that with this matter some have something to say about me, and I can tell you that some have come and questioned me. Yet, I risk bearing the shame of receiving no greetings on the street. I risk bearing the shame of "remarrying" myself as a widow, so much so that the children are gone, and I am left wondering why I was doing what I was doing, with a dead child in my arms. For eight years, I could not lift up my face and look into the brothers' and sisters' eyes. Do I not have the right today to say a word to you: "Offer up yourselves"? Why would you not offer up yourselves? Today is the time for all the working brothers and sisters to offer up themselves.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FELLOWSHIP AND EXHORTATIONS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (15)</H1><P>Date:6:30 p.m., Wednesday, April 21, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Nature:Testimonies by the co-workers, and exhortations<br>by Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TESTIMONIES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Riches Frustrating a Person<br>from Becoming a Proper Christian</H2><P>Brother Hsu Yung-ming from Hangchow: If we do not take the first step now, we will have no spiritual future. I am willing to hand over all that I have in my hands. I do not have to grit my teeth to take such a step. In order to be a proper Christian, I have to take the way of poverty. If I am rich, I cannot be a good Christian.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Thoroughly Handing Oneself Over</H2><P>Brother Chan Kwang-hsien from Hangchow testified: Those who are entangled with affairs cannot serve the Lord. We are the Lord's soldiers, and we are trained daily for the purpose of going to war. During the past two years, I saw in Romans 12 that it is a reasonable thing for us to offer ourselves as a living sacrifice. If we do not obey the Lord, we will be in trouble. If salt loses its taste, it will become useless. If we do not hand ourselves over to the Lord in a thorough way, what we do will amount to nothing. Everything belongs to the Lord, and everything of the Lord is ours. We can never be separated from Him. If I do not follow the Lord, I will remain in the world, and in the world there is only darkness. Even when we make some money, we will not have peace, and we will not be able to sleep well. May the Lord remove our foolishness. He is the One who abides forever.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Handing Over One's Riches to Become Free</H2><P>Brother Chang Yu-lan from Nanking testified: I am quite old already, and I have been saved seven years. In the past, through my work in scientific research, my two eyes were damaged by an explosion. After I prayed, the Lord recovered one of my eyes, which can now see clearly. I have three shortcomings. The first is that I am short in consecration. Consecration requires concrete expressions. Without concrete expressions, it is not enough just to have the heart. Now, everyone is handing over themselves with a consecration slip. I must therefore hand myself over also. Second, I have been a major general for twenty years, and all the officers have been very good to me. It is difficult to cut off this relationship. Third, there is the problem of serving mammon. Mammon has put my body and soul under bondage. I can have twenty million dollars with me, but what good does that do if my mind is in bondage? If I cannot get through in this matter, money will still exercise its influence on me. If I hand over my wealth and I die, everything will be over. But to be a living sacrifice is more troublesome, because I still have to live. I am willing to hand over everything I have to the apostles, and I am willing to be without any opinion. When I hand myself over, I become free. Many people have died in the hands of the Communists; their goods were confiscated. It is better that I consecrate everything to the Lord instead.</P><P>Brother Witness Lee laid hands on him and prayed for him: Lord, gain our brother within and without. Your works are eternal works. May You work more and more in our brother, that his spirit will become stronger and stronger, that his eyes will become brighter and brighter. This is the Body's prayer, and we believe that the Head affirms it. May those who touch him see light daily, and may he be able to send others away in blessings. Accomplish for him what he purposes in his heart. Prepare for him a job that exceeds all that we ask or think. May You cover him much with Your blood for Your testimony's sake. Strengthen our brother's inner man, until the day we see You.</P><P>Brother Hsia Wen-tsao testified: In the past, I was always bound. Two years ago today, I had a thousand mou [Chinese acre] of land and a fabric store. Although I was strong outwardly, I was weak inwardly. Today, all these things are gone. I should have consecrated everything then, and I would have saved so many souls. Today, if we do not give ourselves to the Lord, Satan will not let us go; he will try to gain us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Offering Up Our Money Being a Great Deliverance</H2><P>Brother Chi Yung-tung testified: After I heard Brother Nee's words, untold tears were flowing within me. I was brought into the responsibility of the work through our brother. When I left my job in 1928, I had five children, and I was in debt. But what the Lord has given me today is so much richer than what I had. The Lord is responsible for meeting His demands, because whatever comes from God, God Himself will be responsible for fulfilling it. I was once a rich man, and I encountered robbers four times. These robbers were not only after money; they were after our lives. They tried purposely to kill the landlords and the capitalists. They had killed over thirty people out of forty. These facts are for our warning. It is good for Christians to be neither rich nor poor. Money makes a person proud, and consecration is a great deliverance. We must not miss the Lord's command today.</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1-2, 4; Acts 2:44-46; 4:32-35; 5:12-14</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MONEY AND THE SERVICE IN THE BODY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Consecrating Everything for the Purpose<br>of Serving in the Body</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee's fellowship:Romans 12 speaks in a strong way of the matter of consecration. The consecration there is for service. This service is a service in the Body of Christ. It is not individual service, but service in the Body. If a man is not in the Body, it is difficult for him to understand God's will. I am afraid some people will misunderstand what we are doing here during the past few days and will think that we are rallying a fund-raising campaign. If you understand things in this way, you are off. We have received God's grace to serve Him in this age. In order to do that, we have to offer up everything and put everything in the Body. We need to be coordinated in our work and in our jobs. In order for God to take the fast way, and in order for the work to reach a high standard, we must have such a kind of consecration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Where Riches Are, There Being Our Person Also</H2><P>Why do we have to touch the matter of riches? It is because the Lord says, "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Matt. 6:21). Where your heart is, there will be your very person also. Riches are like a nail; they nail a person down. Perhaps in these few days, some nails have loosened up. But they have not fallen down yet.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Deliverance from Riches Being the Practical Way<br>to Offer Up Our Bodies</H2><P>The first time God did such a work was in Acts 2. There the saved ones were delivered from riches on the first day (vv. 44-45). Yet today, every one of us is still under the tight grip of riches; they are still nailing us down. May God deliver every one of us from riches. Romans 12 speaks of two bodies. One is our own body, and the other is the Body of Christ. We offer up our bodies for the Body of Christ. If a man has not been delivered from riches, he cannot offer up his body to God.</P><P>The most powerful testimony in God's recovery is the testimony of the Body. In order to have the Body service, a man must offer up his own body as a living sacrifice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Delivered from Money to Serve in the Body</H2><P>Acts 2 and 4 show us that as soon as money goes out, there is the one accord. When the disciples took care of the problem of money, the one accord followed, and God's work was realized in a marvelous way in an instant. The book of Acts is our standard. The first time God saved men, He saved them in great numbers. All those men were delivered from riches. Their service was carried out in the Body. This service in one accord is the Body service spoken of in Romans 12.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Dealing with Money to Have the Body Service</H2><P>If a Christian has not been terminated by God with respect to money, he cannot serve the Lord along with other members. Even if he is to serve, his service will be a superficial one and will not be one that issues from the heart. One of the greatest obstacles to our consecration is the matter of riches. And one of the greatest enemies in the Body of Christ is individualism. In Acts, no one said that anything was his own. If you say that this money is yours, it will be difficult for you to be delivered from individualism. The strongest manifestation of individualism is in the matter of money.</P><P>Our way, our work, and our testimony in the future lie with the Body. If the question of money is not settled, we cannot expect to have good coordination, and we cannot expect that we can serve God.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FELLOWSHIP AND EXHORTATIONS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (16)</H1><P>Date:6:30 p.m., Thursday, April 22, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Nature:Testimonies by the co-workers, and exhortations<br>by Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TESTIMONIES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Consecration through the Lord's Love</H2><P>Brother Du Chung-chun testified: I once consecrated myself to the Lord. For a few months I did not have a job, and I was left with twenty to thirty thousand dollars. Others were hoarding, but I would not do that. Others suggested that I should stock up on rice, but I did not do it. Later I almost committed suicide. I thought that I was quite good, that Satan would choose to attack me. I knew that Satan did not attack some others. This meant that they were worse than I was!</P><P>But then later I also did some hoarding. I bought medicines. On the one hand, I was condemning others for hoarding. But on the other hand, I was doing the same thing. It is bad enough for a man to be sick; it is worse when others hold back medicines from him. From that time on, I dared not despise others any more.</P><P>I was like Thomas, who would not believe until he saw with his own eyes. I did not consecrate myself, and I became very unhappy. Humanly speaking, consecration costs our life. But actually, it is the Lord who has loved us. If a mother asks a child for something, and if the child loves the mother, he will surely give it to her. But will the mother take the thing away and keep it for herself?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Everything Being in the Body</H2><P>Brother Lan Chi-i testified: I am a misguided man. I was brought up in a misguided environment, and I have been taught by misguided teachings. At the age of thirteen I was saved. Although I was misguided, the Father who has begotten me is not misguided. His leading and His demands are the same as His supply. The supply to meet the demands does not come from us, but from the Lord.</P><P>In 1939, Brother Nee spoke on the Body. He said that if a person leaves Christ, he cannot survive, and that in the same way, if a person leaves the Body of Christ, he also cannot survive. In our work and our living, we have to be in the Body. That revelation was like the shining of the sun to me; it outshone my dying lamp and made me feel ashamed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Forsaking All for the Lord<br>Not Being a Loss but a Gain</H2><P>Brother Chen Keh-san testified: After I was saved, someone said to me, "In what position you are called, you should remain in that position" (1 Cor. 7:20). I was deceived by this word. At that time I was the superintendent of the police department. Later, when I dropped the world, I shed many tears. Yet the Lord was moving within me. I have dropped many things, but it was not because I was afraid of the Communists.</P><P>From age twenty-four to twenty-six, I was the superintendent of the police department. After I was called, I felt that, should I have to give up the whole world to gain one soul only, it would have been worthwhile. I reckoned that even if I could get only one person saved during my whole life, it would be better than for me to gain the whole world. But a few days after I said this, I got one person saved already. You may think that what you have dropped is something great, but to the Lord it is a very small thing. What we have is very little. The Lord is the great ocean. Seemingly, when we forsake something, it is a loss to us. Actually, it is a gain.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>At Home in the Body</H2><P>Once a person touches the Body, he feels happy. One day I was on a ship, and I did not see any brother. It made my spirit depressed. Here, you have too many brothers. This may cause you to take things for granted. In Kutien, one brother had to travel seven days to visit another brother and had to spend eight days for the return journey. The traveling alone took him fifteen days. In our heart, we fellowship with the Christ in heaven. But while we remain in our bodies, we still have to seek for the fellowship of the brothers who are visible.</P><P>I was invited by someone to visit Hsien-yu, and I thought that I could be back home in one or two months. But once I was there, I was kept from coming back. This was a foolish thing for me to do. It was not until Brother Witness Lee came to me that I returned home. Today, it is not a question of doctrine, but a question of life. A man can listen to Charles Spurgeon speak for twelve years and still not be saved. Yet when he touches life, he will be saved. In the same way, we only have to touch the Body once. We are coming forward to the heavenly Jerusalem. There we have Paul and Peter; this heavenly worship also includes us. Here is no limitation of time and space; what is theirs is ours also. By this, the individuals receive the riches of the Body.</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 12:24; 1 Cor. 10:17</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LIFE OF THE BODY<br>AND THE LIVING IN THE BODY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Every Life Having Its Own Characteristics,<br>Demands, and Tastes</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee:With the Lord's salvation, there is the life. This is different from all teachings, doctrines, religions, or philosophies. The Lord's salvation does not cause us to do something in an outward way. This life has its own demands and characteristics. The fish has the characteristics of a fish, and the bird has the characteristics of a bird. Every living thing has its own characteristics, and each kind of life has its own taste. The fish needs to live in the water. We do not have to tell the fish, "You should live in the water. This is proper and right." When we eat, the food meets the need within us. This need within us causes us to realize that the food is good, sweet, and pleasant.</P><P>There are things that we do not like. Yet, if you put these things in front of a pig, it may think that they are very good. On the other hand, the food that you like, such as chocolate, oranges, or peaches, may not be appealing to the pig when they are placed before it. Why is this so? It is because there is a difference in life that results in a difference in taste.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Living in the Body<br>by the Demand of the Body Life</H2><P>A person is not a Christian according to teaching, but according to taste. It is a matter of the demand of the life within. Only those Christians who live according to this demand and this taste are "standard" Christians. Why would you not sin after you are saved? Is it because the Bible teaches you so? Is it because you are afraid that the church would excommunicate you? We do not sin because we do not feel comfortable within if we sin. We act righteously, live a holy life, and walk in the light because we feel uncomfortable within if we do not do these things. A Christian loves others because the life within him is a loving life. The life that we have received at salvation is a Body life; it is a corporate life. It demands that you serve God together with all the saints. Is it possible for a person to be saved and yet not meet with others? Will he be happy? Surely he will not be happy.</P><P>Some have said that, after a person has been a Christian for a long time, meetings will become tasteless to him. If you have lost your taste for the meetings in Shanghai, try to go to Soochow to study the Bible and to pray alone. Immediately, you will see that this will not meet the inward demand. The life within demands that we mingle together with all the saints in fellowship and coordination. By yourself, you can ride in the clouds all alone. But let me ask you: When Brother Chen Keh-san was in Hsien-yu, was he comfortable? Did he not feel like a hanging corpse, being neither in heaven nor on earth? When I arrived at Kulongsu, he was still trying to stay at Hsien-yu. Of course, in the end he still came. The first day we spoke, he began to cry. He said, "For so many years, I did not know where I was." If your hands remain in your Body, they look fine. But if the hands are cut off from the Body and are hung on a tree, will they look fine? If you see such hands, you will surely be startled. That would surely be like a hanging corpse.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>At Home in the Fellowship of the Body</H2><P>The Body is not a teaching; it is a life. Anyone who acts contrary to the demand of this life will not feel comfortable or be at ease. This life not only demands that we love and be patient; it also demands that we behave as Body Christians. Twenty years ago, God might have tolerated your being an independent Christian. But all those who want to meet God's demands today feel the need of fellowship, the Body fellowship. Once a person is in this fellowship, he feels at home. The Christian life is a matter of life; everything issues from the demand of this life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Offering Up Everything for the Body Life</H2><P>I was saved twenty-three years ago. At that time I did have the opportunity to make money. Yet, when money came into my hands, after a few months I did not have the peace.</P><P>In reading the history of the early martyrs, we find a story about a group of soldiers who once rounded up some Christians in order to torture them. One Christian could not stand the pressure and withdrew. But a soldier who saw the glorious expressions on the faces of the martyrs ran up and asked to fill in the place of the one who had withdrawn.</P><P>From today on, if you are still an independent Christian, you will not feel comfortable. This is not simply a demand of love, it is a demand of life. All those who will not offer up themselves will go away sorrowing, just as the young ruler did (Matt. 19:21-22). All those who offer up themselves will say, "Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!" Every time you meet God's demand, He will become your strength. Today, we need to meet all of God's demands. If you only meet part of His demands, He will not work for you. Only when you meet the Lord's full demands will He work for you.</P><P>One sister hoarded many legs of ham in her house. The Lord constrained her to consecrate. When she took up one leg, she felt that it was too big and tried to change for a smaller one. When she took up the second one, she still felt that it was too big. When she picked up the third one, she still felt that it was too big. In desperation she said to Satan, "Satan, if you say one more time that this is too big, I am going to give every one of them away!"</P><P>God's commandment to the Israelites was that they first had to put their feet into the waters of the Jordan before the waters would open up and the power would come. Brothers and sisters, give yourselves boldly to the Lord! Do not worry about anything any longer!</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIXTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>HANDING ONESELF OVER<br>FOR THE SERVICE IN THE BODY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (17)</H1><P>Date:Evening, April 23, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TESTIMONY</H2><P>Brother Chang Hsing-yung testified: During the past four years, I was persecuted by the Japanese, and both my arms and legs were injured. Although men rejected me, the Lord delivered me out of the rubble. Later, I went to Shanghai and Taiwan. In both places, I loved money more than I loved God. This time a brother informed me of this co-workers' conference, and I was able to make it. Now I have received the light, and I am willing to consecrate myself afresh to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MAMMON BEING<br>THE GREATEST HINDRANCE TO GOD</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee: I deeply feel that the Lord is mainly after men, and not money. From Brother Chang's testimony, we can see that the greatest hindrance to serving God is mammon. This is not to say that mammon is the only hindrance, but we can say that mammon is the most serious hindrance. It hinders us from serving the Lord with all the saints. Today, the hindrance within us is money, and the hindrance outside of us is also money. Money is the greatest hindrance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HANDING OVER ONESELF<br>FOR THE SERVICE IN THE BODY</H2><P>Originally, during the co-workers' conference in the past few days there was no intention to speak on the matter of mammon; we were only speaking on the Body and on submission to authority in the Body. To serve the Lord, we have to serve Him in the Body, and we have to hand ourselves over. If you do not hand yourself over, there is no way for you to serve. From this, we continued on with the line of handing over. In handing oneself over, not only must the work be handed over, but the money has to be handed over also. Once we touched the matter of handing over, we found out that this matter has a tail, and that tail is money.</P><P>Are you satisfied with the way you serve the Lord? We do not have to ask God about this matter. We only need to ask ourselves. If the Lord were to reckon with us today, could we give to Him a proper account? If our hearts condemn us, how much more will God condemn us also (1 John 3:20)? If you have not yet been coordinated in the church, your heart will surely not be satisfied. You can be zealous and eloquent, but you will not be satisfied, because today is not the day for new teachings any longer. You can love the Lord and have faith in Him, but today the way of individual service is a dead-end road. I dare not say whether this was true one hundred or two hundred years ago. But God's need today is that we take the Body way. When we feel dissatisfied within, it means that the Body has a demand. The Lord requires that we serve Him today in the Body of His Son. No matter how many souls you have saved or how much work you have done, if you are not in the Body, you will not be satisfied with your service.</P><P>The words "handing over" are an apt and clear-cut expression. When you hold back yourself, you are giving yourself trouble. If you hold back yourself, you can only drag your feet in the way of serving the Lord. We cannot hold back anything in our consecration. If we do, we are offering to God burnt offerings with the dung attached. Before the burnt offerings are offered up, the dung has to be washed away. We have to have a clear dealing concerning everything related to us before we can consecrate ourselves to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HANDING OVER OURSELVES BEING<br>THE FIRST CONDITION FOR SERVICE IN THE BODY</H2><P>If I do not hand myself over, but instead I study and pursue after spirituality by myself, I will end up in poverty. The first condition for serving in the coordination of the Body is to hand ourselves over. We should hand over ourselves to God, and we should hand over ourselves to the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ONLY BY HANDING OVER OURSELVES<br>WILL THERE BE THE PRACTICAL SERVICE</H2><P>Here is a brother from Tsingtao. I have known him for eight years. Perhaps he has helped the brothers and sisters, and he has offered money and provided hospitality for others. But can these services be counted as service according to the Bible? We cannot replace gold with brass. How can we gain the practical experiences in our service? I say that God's way today is to hand over ourselves, to offer up everything, to throw it away and to drop it. We have to empty out everything in our pockets and put it all in the church. When Brother Chiu handed over himself, he discovered that there was a "tail" behind. How strong is that something that is holding onto his "tail." Brother Chang's testimony shows us that as soon as he was saved, he wanted to serve the Lord in a proper way. But my concern is this: It is one thing to have a heart to serve the Lord; it is another thing to be willing to hand over everything. Have we handed everything over to the church? If we have not, what should we do? We all know that we should hand over ourselves to the Lord. But practically speaking, have we handed ourselves over?</P><P>Some brothers forgot the question of their living when they handed over themselves. Later they asked the responsible brothers, "What should we do about our living? What should we do about the children's education?" When I heard that, I laughed within myself. You have too many worries. O men of little faith, if you can be concerned for yourself, will God not be concerned about you also? Do you think that all the responsible brothers in the church are cruel people? Will the Body not love its own members?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PRINCIPLES IN OUR PRACTICE</H2><P>In the history of the church, many brothers and sisters have consecrated everything to the Lord. But today we have received God's revelation. Not only do we have the light; we are clear also as to the way to go on. In the past, the persons may have been right, but the methods were wrong. For six years, I have been pondering over this matter. I feel that here are two principles. The first is on the spiritual side, and the second is on the practical side.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. On the Spiritual Side</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. On the One Hand,<br>Accepting All The Offerings of the Saints</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. On the Other Hand, Making Arrangements<br>according to the Amount of Grace Each Receives</H2><P>If you have less grace, the church will make fewer arrangements for you. But if you have more grace, the church should make more arrangements for you. If a newly saved believer offers up everything, the church should mark his condition and should accept all his offerings. The church should say to such a one that the church has accepted one hundred percent of what he has offered up. However, soon after that, the church should return to him ninety percent of what he has offered up and should only take ten percent. Later, when this brother is strengthened in grace and grows in life, the Lord will provide other measures to take care of him.</P><P>I know of a newly saved brother who was not very strong in grace. The church only took ten percent of what he offered. This is like a child giving things to the mother. The mother only takes ten percent of what the child offers and returns the other ninety percent back to the child.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. On the Practical Side</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Church Supplying All the Needs of the Saints</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Title of All Possessions Being Still<br>under the Saints' Names</H2><P>On the practical side, the principle is that after a person offers up himself, the church naturally will not bother him concerning his personal life and his career. On the contrary, the church should supply all those who have needs. In Paul's Epistles to Timothy and in Acts, we see that Christians have to be responsible for their own household (1 Tim. 5:8; Acts 6:1). In name, your household and your possessions belong to you. But in reality, all these are the Lord's. This kind of arrangement saves a lot of future entanglements. Man's mind changes. If everything comes under the church's name, whatever a person needs, he will have to ask for it from the church. However, today the church is not your boss. The church only helps you; it does not bind you. You should realize that when you consecrate yourselves to the church, the church does not become your boss. Rather, the Body becomes all your supply.</P><P>If you make one billion dollars a year, and your own expenses are six hundred million dollars, you will give the other four hundred million to the church. The church will not bind you. You do not have to get permission from the church concerning whether you should eat Chinese food or Western food, or what you should wear and eat, and how you should live and travel. How much traveling expense you should have for yourself, and how it should be accounted for&#151;these are things that do not need to go through the church. In this way, even if you should become cold in two years, and you do not want to give yourselves to the church any longer, the church will not have to go after you. The church can still supply. If you are strong in grace, and you offer up three houses, one of which is enough for your own use, you can sell the other two houses for the church's use. Or you can leave them in your own name. The church does not want to be entangled with the question of ownership. In case you die and you have transferred ownership to the church, your children will blame you for that. The church does not want to have this kind of entanglement. If you leave the title under your own name, you will not cause your children to be entangled with the church.</P><P>The main thing is that a man has to be delivered from riches and from the power of riches. Your riches are not God's goal; God's main goal is to gain you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Safe Way</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Everyone Offering according to<br>What He Has Purposed in His Heart</H2><P>One wife did not like for her husband to offer up everything. She only handed over sixty percent of what they have to the church. In matters like these, we should give the family the freedom to decide. If we do this, the saints will be liberated. The church is not demanding that people offer up everything in the way a bandit does. You cannot force those who are willing to offer up only sixty percent to offer up one hundred percent. Everyone should simply act according to what he has purposed in his heart. If we do this, all the brothers and sisters will be liberated.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Everyone Offering Willingly<br>according to the Measure of Grace He Receives</H2><P>The amount of spending we require, based on our living conditions, is the amount that we need. If your wife does not receive that much grace, you cannot force her to have the same capacity as you have. You cannot force your wife and children to offer up themselves. Consecration has to be done willingly. In your will, you can will your estate to your children. You can leave a line there for you to give something to the Lord, and another line for you to take care of your family's living and career. This is the most flexible way and the safest way; it is done according to the measure of grace. Through practicing this way during the past few years, we have found that the brothers and sisters all received the protection. On the one hand, there seems to be the restriction. On the other hand, there is the liberation. Apparently, a person lost everything. Actually, he has gained everything. This kind of practice does everything in grace and has no entanglement with anything else.</P><P>The way of the Jesus Family [Ye-su-chia-ting, a Chinese Christian group that practices literal communal life] has its errors. Those people are right in their heart, but they are wrong in the way they do things.</P><P>If we are faithful before the Lord, twenty years from now the brothers and sisters after us will see a highway opened up before them. Today, if we cut out the highway, we will bring in God's blessings. May the Lord work among us to such an extent that once a person is saved, he immediately hands himself over. Here, there is grace, on the one hand, and the proper way, on the other hand. It is a salvation and a way of protection as well.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SERVICE OF THE WHOLE BODY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (18)</H1><P>Date:April 24, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ALL REDEEMED ONES NEEDING TO SERVE GOD</H2><P>At present, among God's children there seems to be a common phenomenon that only a certain group of people are serving. However, God's word says that everyone who belongs to God is a servant of God. When the Israelites were in Egypt serving as slaves, they did not have any freedom. God delivered them out of Egypt and through the Red Sea for the purpose that they would serve Him in the wilderness (Exo. 3:18). The number of people under the blood was the number of people who left Egypt. The number of saved ones was the number of serving ones. When the Israelites left Egypt, they brought all the gold and silver with them (Exo. 12:35-36). Hence, as many as there were who were redeemed, that many served God in material offerings, and that many followed the tabernacle. It was not just a minority who served. Both in the Old Testament and in the New as well, there was not a distinction between the serving ones and the non-serving ones. Only degraded Christianity makes a distinction between the serving ones and the non-serving ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HISTORY OF THE PRIESTHOOD AND ITS CHANGES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Salvation Being to Obtain<br>a Kingdom of Priests</H2><P>God said explicitly that He would make the Israelites a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:6). The priests are those who wait on God and follow God. No one else is able to come as close to God as the priests can. Their job is to serve God. The Israelites were to be a kingdom of priests; the whole nation was to be priests.</P><P>The priests' eating, their living, and their slaughtering of the bulls and the goats were all for the purpose of serving God. The proper profession of the priests was to serve God; everything else was a sideline. They were not working as teachers, doctors, or in any other professions. Exodus 19 tells us that God intended that all the Israelites, old or young, great or small, male or female, were to be the priests.</P><P>The goal of God's salvation is to gain the priests (Rev. 1:5-6a). The blood of the Passover lamb delivered the Israelites with the goal of obtaining and ushering in a kingdom of priests. The greatest calling and also the greatest grace is that men can serve God as priests. As many as there were who left Egypt, the same number were to serve God. As many as there were who reached Sinai, that many should serve the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Degradation of the Israelites Resulting In<br>a Kingdom of Priests Becoming a Tribe of Priests</H2><P>At the bottom of the mountain, the Israelites worshipped the golden calf and sinned against God. As a result, Moses told the people to kill their own brothers. However, only the Levites obeyed Moses' words, and they killed three thousand people (Exo. 32:1-29). The loss of three thousand men was not the greatest loss. The greatest loss was that the people could not all be priests any longer. Originally, it was twelve tribes who were to be the priests. Now only one tribe was left (Num. 8:5-19). Originally, it was to be a kingdom of priests. Now it became a tribe of priests. The Levites did not care for human feelings or sentiments, and they stood on God's side. As a result, they gained the priesthood. Here we see that some had forsaken their priesthood. They had forsaken it through the worship of the idol; they established another worship.</P><P>Because of rebellion, the earth opened up its mouth and swallowed up the rebellious ones (Num. 16:30-33). Only Aaron's rod budded; all the other rods became dead (Num. 17:6-10). Only one tribe was selected to serve God. After this, the people lost their standing before God; they could only come to God through the priests. Even those who had a heart to come to God were kept outside. The eleven tribes became those who were far from God, and only the Levites were the ones who drew near to God. The eleven tribes became those who could only come to God indirectly, whereas the Levites were the ones who could come to God directly. The eleven tribes became the ones who were served, while the Levites became the serving ones.</P><P>The book of Judges shows that the Levites became excessively honored because the Israelites could not serve, even if they had money. The Israelites had to ask the Levites to serve for them (Judg. 17), and it took a great effort for men to invite a Levite to serve in their house.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>In the New Testament, God's Desire Being<br>for the Church to Be a Kingdom of Priests</H2><P>This situation lasted for over fifteen hundred years. All of this time, eleven out of twelve tribes were kept outside the tabernacle, and only the tribe of Levi was admitted into the tabernacle. This lasted until the New Testament, when Peter said in his first Epistle, "But you are..a royal priesthood" (2:9). Now everyone becomes a servant of God. At the end of the New Testament, in A.D. 95, when John was about to die, he said that we have been made "a kingdom, priests to His God and Father" (Rev. 1:6). God's intention toward the church today is for everyone to be a priest. We are a kingdom of priests. What the Israelites had lost, God is recovering through the church. Through their unfaithfulness, the Israelites lost the priestly kingdom. God's intention today is for every Christian to be recovered to be a priest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF THE UNIVERSAL PRIESTHOOD</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>All the Saved Ones Serving God</H2><P>Any service that is not in the nature of a priestly kingdom is wrong. The church has been selected out of the world already. There cannot be a further selection within the church. As long as there is no sin, no fall, and no golden calf, God forbids any further separation. As many as there are who are redeemed by the blood, that many should serve. However many sons there are, that should be the number of servants also. The number of servants should equal the number of sons. Service should include the same number that salvation includes. Today among God's people, there are only backsliding ones; there are no non-slaves or non-maids. There are only rebellious ones; there are no non-serving ones. Any service should be a service by the whole church. This is the Body service that we are talking about in these days. The problem today is that God is not satisfied even when ninety-nine percent of the people are serving. God wants everyone to be serving. We do not believe that a majority of the people should serve, while a minority of the people do not serve. Neither do we believe that a minority of the people should serve, while a majority of the people do not serve. Service is not the work of the ministers, or the work of a few evangelists. Why do we speak so much about the Body service? It is because it is a matter that belongs to all the brothers and sisters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Person Needing to Forsake Everything<br>to Serve God As Soon As He Is Saved</H2><P>God's word tells us that we are those who have received God's mercy. But what should we do now? Christianity thinks that a man is first saved through the Lord's blood and by His grace, and then goes on further to forsake the world. As he advances further, he drops everything to serve God. This is degraded Christianity. According to God's word, as soon as a man is saved, and as soon as he steps into the entrance, the Lord tells him to take up the cross (Matt. 16:24). Either a man does not become a disciple, or he has to be one in an absolute way. The Lord sets the price clearly right from the beginning for every saved one. The first day they come, they see the tomb. The first day they come, they are asked to forsake the world. We cannot lower down the gospel, and make the gospel no more the gospel. The Lord never lowers the price to attract customers. The gospel is the least expensive thing there is. Yet at the same time, it is the most costly thing there is. If we are to be saved, we have to be saved in a clear-cut way. Only those who have paid a high price can feel the joy. When the young ruler returned home, his money remained with him, and so did his sorrow (Matt. 19:22). Where money is, there sorrow remains. When money is gone, joy comes along. This kind of salvation requires that a man give up everything totally. Today, many brothers and sisters are sorrowful, just as the young ruler was. They have things in their hands that they cannot drop. The only difference between them and the young ruler is that they have not returned home yet; they are still meeting here. If you want joy, you have to consecrate yourself fully and offer up everything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Whole Body Consecrating,<br>Ushering In a Thorough Service</H2><P>Last year I asked a student at the Chiao-tung University how he would feel if someone were to hit him on his right cheek. If someone hit your right cheek, you would be angry when you go home. However, those who are joyful before the Lord are the ones who, after being hit on the right cheek, turn their left cheek to the enemy. After a person has been hit twice, he will be joyful, and he will be able to utter praise. The Lord's way is the way of absoluteness. Those who are not absolute cannot sing. I am not begging people to come to serve. I am showing you that you are a servant of God. God wants you to serve.</P><P>This time our conference is a co-workers' conference, but this does not mean that the responsibility is only on the co-workers. Today, the responsibility is on the whole Body. When we read 1 Corinthians 12 and Romans 12, we see that service belongs to the whole Body; it is not a service of three or five special people. For this reason, we asked all the brothers and sisters to hand themselves over. What the Lord wants is absolute service. We hope that every brother and sister can get through in this matter. The Lord wants such an absolute service. Not only the co-workers need coordination in their work; every brother and sister needs to be coordinated also.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ONLY SERVICE THAT COUNTS<br>BEING THE BODY SERVICE</H2><P>I want to ask the brothers a few questions. What kind of service is considered real service? The only service that counts is the service in which the whole Body serves. Only the Body service can be counted as real service. Either you are not a Christian at all, or you have to be a serving Christian.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FULL COORDINATION<br>BRINGING IN THE BODY SERVICE</H2><P>In order to have the Body service, there is the need for coordination. What is coordination? It is not a loose arrangement. If my hands are connected to my body, they will be useful. But if they are locked up upstairs, they will not be useful.</P><P>Since the time you have been a Christian, have you ever inquired of the Lord concerning your job, your house, and your business? Is your job suitable for the gospel? When a man moves to a new place, he considers whether the place is beneficial to him spiritually. But he never considers whether the job he takes will help him to give himself to the gospel. Today, our co-workers cannot seek for their own convenience in the work; they cannot freely choose their own field. Those brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should in principle do the same thing. You have to hand over your job, and you should learn to coordinate together. In other words, all the brothers and sisters are co-workers. Everyone should hand himself over for the gospel. If there is to be coordination, it has to be a coordination of all the brothers and sisters. Some of us have to change our dwelling or our occupations, and all of us have to offer up our possessions. This is a great price. It may cause some to have heartaches. We have to realize that from the very beginning the Lord requires that we serve this way. Any service that drags its feet along is not joyful and clear-cut service.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONSECRATION BRINGING IN<br>SINGLENESS IN SERVICE</H2><P>We have to tell the young brothers and sisters that whatever they do in the future, whether they will be a teacher or a doctor, they can only do it as a secondary occupation. Every one of us lives for the purpose of serving God. Why do we tell people to offer up their possessions? It is because without offering up our possessions, we can never serve God. The Lord says that a man cannot serve two masters; he cannot serve God and mammon at the same time (Matt. 6:24). The colt must be loosed (Matt. 21:2), and everything has to be offered up and released before a person can serve. Those who are not loosed cannot serve.</P><P>If anyone asks me how much he should offer, I would answer, "Everything." Brother Lee said that the church will lay aside the consecrated things for you. But what would you do if the church does not lay them aside for you? If we want to serve God, we have to serve Him in a desperate way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SERVING GOD BEING THE HIGHEST GLORY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>It Being God Honoring Us<br>and Granting Us the Favor</H2><P>When I was in England, I heard of a brother by the name of C. A. Coates. Once someone gave a book written by him to the Queen of England. The Queen read the book and was helped by it. Coates wrote eight books altogether. When I was in England, I asked the British brothers, "Coates has eight books. Why wouldn't he give the other seven books to the Queen also?" The brothers did not say anything. They acted as if I had said something wrong. Later I asked some other people and found out that a common English person could not give a book to the Queen. Even if you were to try to give her a book, she might not necessarily accept it.</P><P>Consecration is God honoring us. It is not a favor we grant to God. Rather, it is God's acceptance of us and of our possessions. Hence, it is God's honor to us. We are not granting Him a favor; He is granting us a favor. For God to accept a person such as we are is the greatest privilege He grants to us. If I kneel before God and He sends a fire to consume the sacrifice, it is His favor to us in accepting my service. Man thinks that he is sacrificing himself by consecrating himself to God. Little does he realize that for God to accept him is His mercy. Why do we have to calculate so much? We have to learn to push our way through to serve Him, to crawl before Him, and to kneel before Him. A man ought to learn to humble himself before God. We are not begging you to go to God. Rather, you should beg to go to Him yourself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Serving God Being to Our Profit and Being<br>the Result of the Lord's Dynamic Salvation</H2><P>Now the China Textile Corporation no longer dares to issue any more shares because, once it issues them, they will be sold out within half an hour. Today, the blind ones are not the ones who cannot see; the blind ones are the ones who do not see. Our only fear is that we give too little to God, that God does not accept what we give to Him. Is our consecration a profit for God, or is it a profit for us? Is it a favor we render to God, or a favor God renders to us? When we come to God, the only thing we fear is that God will reject us and deny us. We only fear that we give to God too little, that He will not accept us. All those who know God will say, "Lord, here is some more. Here is some more." All those who have once seen the Lord can give half of what they have to the poor without any complaint. The Lord said to Zaccheus, "Today salvation has come to this house" (Luke 19:9). Today, many people do not realize the greatness of the Lord's salvation. This is why they encounter difficulties. Salvation not only saves our soul; it means that we are delivered from everything. Let us remember the story of our burial. Why were we baptized? Baptism is a declaration that we have been separated from the world. Merely to invite three or five people to come and serve will not solve the problem. What we need to do today is for the whole Body to rise up for the gospel. The demand for the co-workers in the days ahead is quite severe. The need is also very great. For the sake of China's gospel, for the sake of the co-workers going on, we need a fresh consecration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED IN SERVICE AND THE WAY OF SERVICE</H2><P>If I had a hundred billion dollars today, I could distribute it all to the proper use within a few days. Our work needs money. From now on, we have to work with a goal and with proper arrangements. All the co-workers are living for the Lord. We ask all the brothers and sisters on the job to offer up themselves also. We have to work in coordination and in the Body. None of us is for ourselves. We must live for the Lord and for the gospel. We cannot have part of the people offering up themselves, while part of the people are not offering up themselves. We need all the brothers and sisters to offer up themselves and to live for the gospel. Those who are teaching or who are in business have to offer up their all for the gospel. The Lord has to do what He did in the first century. We are not afraid of believing in the first-century gospel. We are not afraid of preaching the first-century gospel. We are not afraid of doing what the first-century gospel did. If we would rise up as a whole Body, the whole of China will be taken; no one will be able to withstand us. If we do not believe in a thorough gospel, and if we do not have a thorough consecration, it will be difficult for the Lord to use us.</P><P>The gospel has been preached in China for over a century. All the time, it has been restricted to the coastal regions. Not much has been done in the inland regions. We have wasted twenty years. If we are not faithful again, we will be set aside.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A STRONG TESTIMONY PRODUCING A STRONG RESULT</H2><P>In the first century, men were not able to preach the gospel freely. They could not go to the church buildings. At that time, men believed because they saw the gospel and they saw the Christians. The Christians at that time were hiding in their homes. It was when they were put on the fiery stakes that they were seen and heard for the first time. The effect of seeing the gospel is much stronger than that of hearing the gospel. This kind of gospel shows men that salvation is not cheap. The prayer of the martyrs during those hours became their gospel messages. Historians tell us that the believers in Rome were killed first, and the ones who were not killed were exiled.</P><P>Today, Christianity is weak in others because it is weak in us. During the first century, men were afraid, yet they kept coming. Today, lukewarm Christians are useless ones. On the one hand, the testimonies of the early believers frightened many people away. But on the other hand, this kind of gospel also made many frightened of running away. Where there is the apostles' service, there is the apostles' blessing. Today, the whole responsibility rests on our work. If the Lord cannot get through among us, He cannot get through anywhere. The past twenty years were the Lord's preparation of us, while we were praying and seeking during that time. However, if the young ruler is to come today, he may not wait any longer. Today, we have to offer up all our money, time, and heart. Only then will the Lord have a way, and only then can we reach our destiny. Do not allow money to choke our heart, and do not allow it to block man's way to God. All the brothers and sisters have to participate in the spiritual work, and all the possessions have to be offered up. If we do this, the Lord will have a free way among us.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>BEING CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST<br>AND BEARING THE CROSS</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LORD'S DAY MORNING MESSAGE (3)</H1><P>Date:The Lord's Day, April 25, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Chen Keh-san, Witness Lee</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Isa. 14:12-14; Gen. 3:4-5; John 12:31; Col. 2:14; Heb. 2:14; John 19:30; Matt. 27:50; 1 Sam. 16:13; 2 Sam. 2:4; 5:3</H1><P>Prayer: Lord, may none of us here miss Your presence. In particular, may those who desire to rise up but who cannot rise up not miss Your presence. Lord, if You want to receive a better worship from us, we ask that You do a deeper work within us. Do not let any one of us slip by. Do not let anyone come and go empty-handed. Do not let anyone come and go in sorrow.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST DESTROYING THE FALLEN SATAN<br>THROUGH THE CROSS</H2><P>Brother Chen Keh-san: Isaiah 14 and Genesis 3 show us where sin came from. In Isaiah 14, Satan said five times, "I will." Satan is a creature, and God is the Creator. The creature cannot demand anything from the Creator. A carpenter is the maker, and a chair is being made by the carpenter. The chair cannot demand anything from the carpenter. If you pay attention to the word of the serpent in Genesis 3, you will notice that his words are the same in nature as the words in Isaiah 14. This nature has come into man's heart today. Everyone is under Satan's hand. The Lord came, and Satan's place is lost. The Lord accomplished redemption. He is the "foreign" One, the real Foreigner. He was uplifted, and Satan was defeated.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DEATH OF CHRIST TERMINATING THE FLESH</H2><P>Today, Satan utilizes man's flesh and makes it his puppet. However, man's flesh is what Christ put on. When Christ died, we were all hung on the cross, and the flesh was terminated (Gal. 5:24). In this way, Satan became naked. Hebrews 2 says that Christ through death destroyed Satan who has the might of death. This is like the Japanese Emperor Hirohito being condemned. When he was condemned, the whole Japanese nation was condemned. It is a small thing for one man to be condemned, but it is a great thing for a whole nation to be condemned. The Bible says that the whole world was judged when One was lifted up (John 12:31). The Lord accomplished a great thing on the cross. His death terminated the flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CROSS BEING THE GROUND OF OUR VICTORY</H2><P>The cross is the place of death. It is also the place of victory. Other than the cross, there is no victory. To Satan, the cross is the place of condemnation. To us, it is the place of victory. For this reason, no Christian can leave the ground of the cross. If they leave, they will be defeated.</P><P>Some Fukienese say constantly, "Satan is defeated," as if they are chanting curses. Such chanting will never defeat Satan. Only the cross can defeat Satan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUFFERING WITH THE LORD TODAY,<br>REIGNING WITH HIM ON THAT DAY</H2><P>First Samuel says that David was the anointed king (16:13). Jonathan was a good friend of David; the two of them were one in heart. If Jonathan had followed David, he could have become the chief minister. Yet he returned to Saul. David was in the forest, yet Jonathan was in the palace. This was wrong. He returned to the palace too soon. If he had followed David, how wonderful the palace would have been to him later! Today we are afraid of suffering. The Lord will surely be the King on earth one day. The question is whether or not you are willing to follow Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING CRUCIFIED WITH THE LORD AND<br>BEARING THE CROSS</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee: When Satan's rebellious life and nature entered into man's flesh, man's flesh became Satan's armor. God sent Christ to come and put on the human flesh also. The Lord dealt with Satan through putting on the human flesh. Within man's flesh, there is Satan. Every fleshly person has Satan working within him. Hence, as long as man is in the flesh, he offends God. The most wonderful thing today is that, although Satan entered into man's flesh, Christ also put on the human flesh. Nevertheless, Christ did not have any of the satanic nature in Him. The Chinese have a saying: "One has to venture into the tiger's den before he can catch the cub." This is like a situation where a robber has climbed into a house, and the policeman has to go inside the house to catch the robber. Hebrews 2:14 says that Christ through death destroyed the one who has the might of death. In His flesh, Christ destroyed the dwelling of Satan through the cross. This is why the cross of Christ stripped Satan naked.</P><P>Today in order for us to oppose Satan, we have to remain on the ground of the cross. If we do not stand on the ground of the cross, Satan will be able to do many things. How can we remain on the ground of the cross? There are two things concerning the cross that are quite important to a Christian. The first is that we are crucified with the Lord on the cross. The second is that we have to bear the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Crucified with Christ</H2><P>We have been crucified with Christ (Gal. 2:20). We have to see that not only has the Lord died for us; we have died with Him also. Why do we have to die? It is because we have already been condemned to death; we do not deserve to live on this earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Bearing the Cross&#151;<br>Remaining on the Ground of the Cross</H2><P>To bear the cross means that we remain on the ground of the cross. Baptism signifies our crucifixion with the Lord. However, after baptism, have we walked away from the cross? Whenever we walk away from the cross, we are setting the cross aside, and we are not abiding in the cross. The distinctiveness of Christ's salvation lies in the death. The distinctiveness of our experience of salvation lies also in the death. Death is the way of the Christian salvation. Not only do we testify on the day of baptism that we are dead; we have to allow the death of the cross to continually work in us moment by moment. On the one hand, we were crucified with Christ. On the other hand, we bear the cross, and the cross becomes the place in which we remain. To bear the cross does not mean to wear a golden cross or a wooden cross. To bear the cross means that we remain in the cross, and we continue to stand on the ground of the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>a. The Cross Terminating Man and<br>Bringing In God</H2><P>A brother has a peculiar wife. This wife is the most peculiar person in Shanghai. Every day, this brother suffered because of his wife's peculiarity. One day he came and asked the responsible brothers about what he should do. The responsible brothers told him that this was the cross arranged by the Lord. Then there were mothers who could not handle their children. The responsible brothers also told them that this is the cross. The bad husband is a cross. The disobedient children are a cross. This is the cross, and that is the cross. It seems as if these kinds of crosses are everywhere.</P><P>Those who say such words do not have any light. If a brother is involved in a car accident and is sent to the hospital, or if he suffers in his business or encounters hardship from his wife, many people would say that this is the Lord's cross for him. They think that all these things are the cross. But what really is the cross? The cross means only one thing: "Not as I will, but as You will" (Matt. 26:39). The cross is the removal of human ideas, views, and opinions. The cross removes the human flesh and replaces it with God's will and His ways. The cross is the Lord's death terminating us and removing the human opinions and elements in us. The removal is the negative aspect of the cross. On the positive side, the cross brings in everything that God is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>b. Bearing the Cross Being to Allow Death<br>to Work Continually in Us</H2><P>The cross means death. This death works continually in us, putting aside our ideas, views, and opinions. All those who allow this death to work continually in them are bearing the cross.</P><P>Sisters, when you put on your dress, when you choose the fabrics and the styles, is there any element of your own will there? If there is, you are setting aside the cross, and the effectiveness of the death of the cross will not work in you. You are not submitting to God's will, because you have not taken up your cross.</P><P>The problem with the brothers is mostly money. In your prayer, you may say, "Lord, not according to my will." But after your prayer, you dare not ask what God's decision is. If your future plans run contrary to the Lord's will, you will not want to obey. Although in your prayer you say that you do not want your own will, yet in practice you are doing everything according to your own concepts and opinions. If we are dealt with by the cross, and if we allow the cross to break a hole through our proposals, decisions, and opinions all the time, we are bearing the cross. A person who is bearing the cross is one who will not come down from the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>c. The Cross Bearing Us<br>instead of Us Bearing the Cross</H2><P>With Christ, He first bore the cross and then was crucified on the cross. With us, we are first crucified on the cross, and then we bear the cross. When you take up the cross willingly, you will find that you are not bearing the cross; rather, the cross is bearing you. You will be relaxed, restful, and free. May the Lord teach us to learn the lesson of bearing the cross.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THINGS THAT A CO-WORKER SHOULD<br>PAY ATTENTION TO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (19)</H1><P>Date:3:00 p.m., The Lord's Day, April 25, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THINGS THAT A CO-WORKER SHOULD<br>PAY ATTENTION TO</H2><P>Brother Chang Kwang-yung asked: How should we take care of the many problems in coordination? When we work in the different local churches, what are the things that we should take care of?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Taking Care of One's Standing<br>in Contacting the Saints</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Being Based on Spiritual Relationships Only</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: There are a few things that a worker should pay attention to. The first thing is his standing in contacting the brothers and sisters. When a worker goes to a new place, he should pay attention to his relationship with the brothers and sisters. Many times, the relationship between the co-workers and the other saints is not spiritual. The degree of intimacy in fellowship can only be determined by spiritual factors. Those workers who are too strong or too weak dispositionally need special help.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Rejecting Any Friendship</H2><P>We have to be delivered from relationships of friendship. Friendship probably has to do with sameness in disposition or compatibility in position. Some co-workers are closer to some saints because they like each other dispositionally. Some workers are burdened for some brothers and sisters because they have similar weaknesses. As a result, their friendship becomes more intimate. But this kind of relationship will not render anyone any help. In the end, no brother or sister will receive any deliverance through this kind of friendship. The co-workers have to cut off all relationships of friendship with the brothers and sisters. Our relationship is a spiritual one. It is not because we are similar in our disposition, or because we are from the same school or born in the same place that we are related.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Not Falling into Others' Weaknesses</H2><P>If we fellowship with a weak brother, we have to help him, instead of falling into the same situation that he is in. What we have to do today is to pull him up to another level. This is where the problem lies between our Brother Leland Wang and Brother Chang Chi-chen in Foochow.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Learning to Be Led Away to the Lowly</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Keeping a Distance from the Rich Ones</H2><P>The second point to pay attention to is to learn to be led away to the lowly. We have to be careful about those people who are famous and who occupy high positions in society. We should keep a distance from them, lest we fall into suspicion. Not everyone can go into the home of a rich brother or sister. Sometimes to visit such brothers, one has to go through the doorkeepers. Do not live in the houses of the rich ones. It is not a good thing for today's Christianity to be mixed up with great capitalists.</P><P>Once I was in Chefoo, and because of my sickness the brothers invited me to stay at the house of a well-to-do brother. I declined the offer. They asked me for the reason, and I told them that it has to do with my footsteps. Another time I went to Kaifeng to conduct some meetings. The first few days I stayed at a rich person's home. Later I decided not to stay in the house of those government officers. Those who love to acquaint themselves with the rich and the influential people have lost their standing as a worker of God. I have no patience for these ones. Such ones have lost their standing in the work. Our standing is that of a worker of God. Every worker should maintain his ministerial standard. Both the Lord and the apostles as well rebuked the rich and the influential ones more severely and sharply than they did others. If we do not take care of the issue of money properly, we will leave a bad taste with others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. It Being a Shame to Have Selective Fellowship</H2><P>In contacting others, one has to watch out if his standing changes with the acquaintance. It is a shameful thing to have selective fellowship among the co-workers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Learning to Listen to Others</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Listening to Others Being a Basic<br>Qualification of the Workers</H2><P>The third matter is a serious demand on the workers today. It is to learn to listen to others when they speak. The basic requirement, technique, or qualification of a worker is that he can listen to others. You have to be able to sit down for an hour and listen to the brothers and sisters. As the brothers speak, you have to be able to understand sentence by sentence what they are saying. Not only do you have to hear what they are saying; you have to be able to understand what they are saying.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Being Quiet Within,<br>and Not Having One's Own Words</H2><P>While the brothers and sisters are speaking, that is the time that you have to remain quiet. You cannot be saying something else within you at the same time. Many people hear the wrong things because, while they are listening, they are at the same time speaking within. This is like having two radios turned on at the same time at home. When two different stations are speaking at the same time, one cannot hear clearly what either one says. In the same way, if a man cannot listen to others, it is because he himself is also speaking while they are speaking.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Touching Others' Spirit with the Spirit</H2><P>There is another point concerning listening. Man's spirit is revealed through his mouth. When a man speaks, his spirit is released, and it touches the spirit of others. A man's spirit is released through his speaking. If you cannot listen to others, you will not be able to touch their spirit. Whether or not a worker is strong in his work depends on whether or not he is able to touch others' spirit with his spirit. It is difficult to find one in a thousand who can detect others' spirit without listening to their words. Whether a man's spirit is rebellious, defiled, strong, weak, or in any other kind of condition, it is expressed through his words. We have to be an objective person. Only an objective person can listen to others speak. This is the greatest need in our work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Learning to Speak Accurately</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Not Speaking Carelessly or Loosely,<br>Not Being Double-tongued</H2><P>The fourth thing is that a worker has to learn to speak accurately at home in his daily life. A careless person has no hope as far as participating in God's work is concerned. A double-tongued person cannot help anyone in any church; he can only cause trouble. Some brothers have asked me how they should study the Bible. I can tell you that only an accurate man can study the Bible. Some people by nature cannot study the Bible. Even if you were to send such a one to the seminary, it would still be useless. He may be able to study philosophy, but he can never study science. Science is accurate, and every bit of knowledge in science is acquired through numerous experiments and verifications. In the Lord's work, there is no such thing as "more or less the same." Either things are the same, or they are not the same. For example, the whiteness of snow is different from the whiteness of a white horse. But the careless ones will say that they are the same.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Not Speaking from Feelings</H2><P>The sisters should pay particular attention to this matter. In their daily life they should be careful; they should speak properly, sentence by sentence. The careless ones, those who are active in their mind and who have a hard time differentiating between the real and the false things, are of little use in God's hand. The more we want to be accurate in our speaking, the more troublesome it is. It is easy to be careless. But a careless person can only speak from his feeling; he cannot speak accurate words. However, truth is absolute. It cannot change according to your feeling. Truth is not affected by anything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Only an Accurate Person<br>Being Able to Study the Bible</H2><P>Who can study the Bible? The Bible is not understood through methods, but through the proper persons. A person can listen to, study, and read the Bible. But if he wants to get some light out of it, he has to be an accurate person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Appointment of Elders</H2><P>The fifth point concerns the appointment of responsible brothers. Not everyone can appoint elders. Paul asked Timothy to appoint elders, but he did not ask Mark, Silas, Luke, or Demas to appoint elders. Some are hands, and they cannot be the eyes. Some people say that they have to consider more. But if you are a hand, will you know if the pillar is white by more consideration? Even if you are to consider five days, you will still not be clear if the pillar is white. It is better for you to seek the help of the eyes. It is easy to appoint a person, but it is troublesome to ask anyone to step down from responsibility. If you do this, the whole church will be greatly affected. For this reason, we cannot appoint responsible ones lightly. Paul asked Timothy to look for the faithful ones. It is not an easy matter.</P><P>When the Western missionaries select personnel, most of the time they select the good and the lovable persons. To us these ones may be the most useless ones; they may even be swindlers. Some people ask why we do not appoint certain brothers as responsible ones. We have to realize that some brothers are good people and nice gentlemen, but they can easily be deceived. Do not say that this is only the missionaries' problem; we the Chinese can have the same problem. It is not a light matter for a man to receive a ministry before the Lord. There are certain basic qualifications in appointing a person. It is not such a simple matter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Concerning the Physical Needs<br>of the Co-workers</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Taking Simple Luggage When Traveling</H2><P>Sixth, the co-workers should pay special attention to their physical needs. Concerning our personal life, the Lord's principle is first that our personal belongings have to be simple when we travel. It is too improper for a worker to travel with five or ten pieces of luggage.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Eating What Others Serve</H2><P>Second, you must pay attention to the things you eat. Whatever others put in front of you, you have to eat. Other than for reason of physical weakness, you have to make yourself an easy person to be served. When you are at home, you can do whatever you like. But when you are traveling, it is not so simple.</P><P>Once I was in Anhwei. The people there like sesame oil, but I hate sesame oil. Among them, I had sesame oil continually for sixteen days. They saw that my appetite was not good, and they asked if I like preserved eggs. I said yes, and they served me preserved eggs, only soaked in sesame oil again!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Learning to Overcome Our Bodies<br>in Our Dwelling</H2><P>The third thing has to do with the place we live. The co-workers should not pick places for sleeping that are too good or too coarse. They have to select moderate places. Once they have decided where to stay, they should stay there until they leave the city. Even if you find that you are staying in the lion's den, you have to wait until daybreak. If the king has not come, you cannot go out by yourself. Unless others make further arrangements for you, you should not make any choice of your own. Many workers are involved in trouble merely through moving around.</P><P>Once someone prepared a bed for me. It was supposed to be a sofa bed, but it was a bed that no one could lie on. The bed was put together with blocks of wood. When the body turned, the wood would make noise. I was disturbed not only by others' noise, but by the noise I made also. A worker has to learn to live in abundance, and he also has to learn to live in poverty. A worker must learn to put his body under.</P><P>There was a brother in southern Fukien province who had a somewhat high standard of living at home. When he had to work in a place that had a lower standard of living, he found that he could not handle the situation. Whatever I eat and wear, and however I live at home is a personal matter before the Lord. But when we are guests in others' homes, we have to live according to the standard of that family. Habit is one thing, and a mind to suffer is another thing. No matter how weak I am or how many needs I have, I have to learn to lower myself. Do not let any church think that it is a troublesome thing to provide hospitality for a servant of God. If you practice living in a low way at home, even when others put you in a lower place, you will be able to stand it. Only those who have learned to overcome their bodies can present no difficulty to others. Only a mind to suffer can give us the strength to humble ourselves before men. Hence, we have to learn to overcome our bodies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Knowing How to Live in Abundance&#151;<br>Taking Only What One Needs</H2><P>Brother Chang Kwang-yung asked again: Sometimes after I deliver a message, I feel hungry, and good food is placed before me. If I eat too much, it would be embarrassing. What should I do? After working in a place, and when I am about to leave, others would try to give me gifts. What should I do? If I do not accept them, the host would be offended. But if I accept them, should I give something in return later?</P><P>Brother Nee answered: We have to know how to live in abundance. However, to live in abundance does not mean to enjoy abundance. I know when to eat and when not to eat. A person who is careless in eating is one who has never been restricted before God. If I really need a chicken, I can eat a chicken every day. If I do not need it, even if five chickens are served in front of me, I can refuse them. In principle, I eat only the portion served to me.</P><P>When Satan sinned, he craved for the throne. When man sinned, he craved for food. It is not a question of eating much or eating little, but a question of eating what is placed in front of you. I will not make additional requests on top of what others are serving me. When I live among others, I maintain my standing. Otherwise, you will give others a bad impression about the gospel. When many young workers are about to be sent out for some work, I would invite them to a good meal. That one meal determines whether or not a worker will go out. Perhaps this is not a good thing to say, because the next time it will not be an easy thing for me to invite anyone for meals anymore.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Concerning Receiving Gifts</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Accepting in Love, Sharing with Others</H2><P>Concerning the matter of receiving gifts, I can tell you a story. In 1937 I was in Manila. At the end of my stay, the brothers and sisters there sent me away on a ship with a crate of fruit. Inside the crate was one hundred eighty to two hundred pieces of fruit. If I spread out the fruit in my cabin, I could almost start a fruit store. But by the time I left the ship and went on shore, I did not have one piece of fruit left; I had given them all away to the attendants. Although they were not poor with regard to money, they were poor with regard to fruit. If I went home with two hundred pieces of fruit, what would others think? They would say what a scene that a preacher would come back with so much fruit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. No Need to Give Others Gifts in Return</H2><P>If others give us gifts, we cannot give gifts to them in return. If we do, this kind of thing will never end. We cannot turn down the brothers' and sisters' love. But I would rather share with the poor people such love. If others invite me for a meal, I would rather eat five bowlfuls, and send the other five bowlfuls to the poor people outside the door.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TESTIMONY AND EXHORTATIONS</H2><P>Brother Hsia Hsi-ling from Tientsin testified: The church in Tientsin began in 1936. By the grace of the Lord, we have been in one accord for the last twelve years. As long as there are two or three who are faithful, the testimony can be maintained. Four major events happened during these years. The first was the political turmoil. The second was the flood. The third was the war in Asia, and the fourth was the so-called North China Christian Alliance. At present we have about one hundred people breaking bread. Among them, two or three brothers are particularly living and fresh. The responsible brothers are Hsia Hsi-ling and Lee Pi. At present we use the meeting hall for prayer, and the place is too small.</P><P>Brother Nee's word of exhortation: We hope that Brother Hsia can leave his job and be free from the bondage of money. Money should only help us in the gospel; it should not hinder the gospel. In assigning the co-workers, we should take the most economical way. We must see that God is moving already, before we should move.</P><P>The work in Tsingtao should face west along the railway line. The work in Shanghai should face the direction of the Yangtse River. The work in Tientsin should face the east as well as the west. What we have at present should be strengthened. If some brothers feel clear to go, we should release them to go.</P><P>Brother Mak from Swatow testified: I began to learn to come into the service in 1940. I stayed in Sian for six years. At present I am in Swatow. There are about three hundred saints who are in fellowship with us. We are short of brothers who can give messages.</P><P>Brother Nee's exhortation: The Gospels mention the story of the woman with an issue of blood. There were many people at that time. The object of their touching was the same, yet the result of their touching was not the same. Everyone was touching Christ, but the woman's touching was different from the others' touching. Others may have touched His back or His arms. They may even have torn His garment, but there was no result. The same kind of people may be praying in tears; the same kind of people may be touching the Lord. Everything may be the same, but the result is not the same. We have to see that there is another world behind the visible things. If we are not careful, we will become the crowd who were pressing against the Lord. There were many who were following the Lord and many who were touching Him. But only one person's touch made a change in life. Outwardly, everyone was touching Him, but if one were to dig deeper, he would discover that there was another world. This one touched a Christ that no one else had touched. Even though others pressed against Him, the Lord ignored them all. Others' touching did not bring about anything, but this woman's touch brought about something.</P><P>Today, those Christians who are pressing the Lord will not be saved. Only those who are touching Him in a real way will be saved. Whether or not you have someone to give messages is not the main thing. Today, many people who give messages are merely causing people to press against the Lord. What we need are those who are willing to pay a serious price.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIXTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (20)</H1><P>Date:Evening, April 26, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S SALVATION AND DEMANDS BEING<br>THE SAME TODAY AS AT THE BEGINNING</H2><P>I believe that God is going to do great things today, and I believe that God has done something great already. God has given us a great salvation, a thorough salvation. In the first century, God saved men. Today, He is doing the same thing. The extent to which God saved men in the first century is the same as that which He is doing today. God cannot change the gospel in the course of two thousand years of human history. There is no change in the result and the demands of the gospel. We should not think that the first century Christians were required to pay a great price, and that today we do not need to pay the same price. Those who follow the Lord today must pay the same price as those in the first century. At that time, men had to forsake everything. Today, the requirement has not changed. There is, of course, a difference between putting a lamp under a bushel and putting it on the lampstand, but the lamp itself has not changed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DEGRADATION AND<br>THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>During the past two thousand years, the gospel has not changed. On the very day that the church was produced, God saw this new creation and considered that it was good. This is like God considering everything as good in Genesis after He created everything in six days. But after some time, the situation changed. Although the situation changed later, the beauty of the original creation remains the same. The beauty of the church on the first day at Pentecost was comparable to the beauty of Eve on the day of her creation. However, gradually the church changed. It turned from being Ephesus to becoming Sardis. At the time of Martin Luther, God began to take the way of recovery step by step. For the past four hundred years, every fifty years God did some recovery work. During the past one hundred years, His work has been especially strong. It seems as if the last few decades have seen the peak of recovery already. There has never been a time when the church has been as rich as it is now.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BODY TESTIMONY BEING GOD'S FINAL RECOVERY</H2><P>We believe that God is recovering the most difficult thing today. What worries us the most today is the fulfillment of Ephesians 4. It seems as though we never have to worry about the fulfillment of John 3:16. We are not afraid that it will not be fulfilled, and we are not worried. Suppose someone says that he has believed and asks what he should do if he still has not received eternal life. He has believed, yet he has not seen any result. What should he do? We are not worried about this. I have read the New Testament more than two hundred times. I am not worried about any other passage. I have even read Revelation a few hundred times. I am not worried about that book either. However, I am worried about Ephesians 4. I am concerned how this passage of the Scriptures will be fulfilled.</P><P>Ephesians 4 says that the work of the ministry is to arrive at the oneness of the faith. The church is the Body of Christ, and it builds up itself in love. We are not concerned about things like the new heaven, the new earth, and the lake of fire. But when I lie on my bed, I am always apprehensive about the fulfillment of Ephesians. I have studied the Bible, and I have prayed. But I still do not have the assurance that the condition in Ephesians 4 will be fulfilled in the church today. Among God's children today, there is much confusion, and there are all kinds of divisions. When will we be one? Today, there are all kinds of ministries; the situation is very complicated. How can this chapter be recovered?</P><P>Yet, brothers and sisters, we believe that there will be a day when God's recovery will reach the fulfillment of Ephesians 4. God is doing a recovery work everywhere. The ultimate work among all these works may very well be the recovery of the Body testimony. God's leading today is to bring us back to the beginning, and to be recovered to the condition of the beginning.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHURCH BEING BUILT<br>UPON THE UNIVERSAL PRIESTHOOD</H2><P>First Corinthians 12 and Romans 12 show us that in God's arrangement or plan, there is no such thing as one pastor monopolizing the service of the whole Body. Neither is there such a thing as one group of brothers and sisters serving while another group of brothers and sisters is being served. What we see in the Bible is the whole Body being a priesthood. The whole church are priests. God's intention was for all the Israelites to be a kingdom of priests. But in actuality, not everyone was a priest. The situation among the local churches today is a little bit better than this. The brothers and sisters have the liberty to pray, to sing, to preach, and to take up responsibilities. But we have to realize that this is still not the church. The church is built upon the universal priesthood of the whole Body. The church is not built upon a few brothers and sisters. Once the priesthood is not universal, we have Roman Catholicism. Once the priesthood is universal, we have the church. We have to see that service to God is not a question of three or five people serving, or thirty or fifty people serving. Our service to God today must be entirely different. In order to serve God today, everyone has to rise up to do the work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT THE SERVICE OF THE MINISTERS,<br>BUT THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>This time while we were in Foochow, we noted the fact that in the past century, God raised up many spiritual giants, and all of them were outstanding people. From 1820 until now, many spiritual giants were raised up. Yet strangely, among us today we see very few spiritual giants. It seems as if the spiritual giants are all gone. Today, we see the work of gospel preaching being done not through the so-called great evangelists, men like Charles Finney and Stanley. It is not easy to find giants like these anymore. It seems that God is taking a different way today. Today is the day of the service of the church, and not the service of the ministers. It is no longer a matter of individuals preaching the gospel, but a matter of the church preaching the gospel. Previously, we had to invite famous and eloquent speakers to come to preach the gospel, and we had to conduct much propaganda. But today, it is the church coordinating together to preach the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT THE INDIVIDUALS PREACHING THE GOSPEL,<br>BUT THE CHURCH PREACHING THE GOSPEL</H2><P>Take the case of Foochow as an example. This time when the brothers were preaching the gospel, we had some brothers giving messages on the platform. But there were no advertisements and no famous speakers. One brother who had been saved for only two or three years was doing the preaching, and all the other brothers and sisters went out to invite friends. Twenty to fifty brothers and sisters could bring in four or five hundred people, and four or five hundred people could bring in a few thousand. Before the speaker stood up, two or three hundred people were saved already. Those brothers and sisters who brought their friends along with them knew if their friends sitting next to them were saved or not. The speaker on the platform could be deceived, but the brothers and sisters were clear about the condition of their friends. They could say that this one who stood up was genuine, and that one who stood up was not genuine. After the meeting, they helped the gospel friends to become more clear concerning the gospel. They helped them to write down their names, to show them the direction to the meeting halls, and to visit those who have expressed their willingness to believe in the Lord.</P><P>This time in Foochow, within one month, we had almost a thousand people saved. Today, some people are still opposing, and this is why our work is still not that strong. I believe, if there is no frustration, the whole Foochow can be taken over by us. Today, the church is not a few special brothers rising up to preach the gospel; it is the whole church rising up to preach the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WHOLE CHURCH INVOLVED<br>IN THE CARE OF THE NEW BELIEVERS</H2><P>Concerning the perfecting of the new believers, we also have to do it as a Body. Previously, whenever the number of saved ones increased, we faced problems. Today, as soon as a person is saved, he has to be perfected. This kind of perfecting is a kind of spiritual education. There is a big difference between those believers who have received the proper education and those who have not received the proper education. In Foochow over twenty brothers and sisters are devoted to the work of caring for the new believers. We have divided up all the streets in the city, and we have assigned definite brothers to take care of every district. The whole city of Foochow is divided into five districts, and all the brothers and sisters are charged with the responsibility of taking care of these districts. The older brothers and sisters who cannot move around freely stay behind to count the attendance; when someone is absent, they inform the brothers who are responsible for the visitation work. These visiting brothers and sisters will look up the absent one and will conduct make-up lessons with him. He has not come to the meeting, so the brothers go to his home and repeat the same thing to him. An absent one may end up saying that it is too much of an imposition on the brothers, and that rather than having them to come to his home, he would rather go to the meetings. Although we cannot say that the new believers are advanced in any kind of extraordinary way, we can say that they are more advanced than the old ones. This is the church building itself up, or perfecting itself, in love.</P><P>Therefore, the question is whether or not we have seen the church. The service of three or five people is not the church. Only the service of all the brothers and sisters is the church. Perhaps here is a group of brothers and sisters who spend some money to hire a pastor, and who ask the pastor to do everything for the others. The rest may still love one another. You may say that there is very little difference here, but I will say that there is a big difference here. There is a difference between the Body working and one individual working. There is also a difference between a minister working, and every brother and sister working.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY FOR THE WHOLE BODY TO RISE UP TO SERVE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. All the One-talented Ones Being Put to Use</H2><P>Formerly, we had new believers who were zealous to serve. But as soon as human zeal comes in, the flesh comes in also, and as soon as the flesh is stopped, the service stops also. If we allow such people to serve, the church will be brought into confusion. But if we do not allow such people to serve, the church will become silent. If you put down a person's flesh, his spirit will be put down as well. This became a problem for the co-workers, and this is the reason we did not find the way in the past. It is for this reason that authority needs to be recovered in the church. On the one hand, all the one-talented ones have to rise up. On the other hand, the church has to exercise its authority to deal with the flesh.</P><P>Today, men always wait for Paul's five talents to come along. But we may have to wait a hundred years before God will give us a great gift or a great ministry. We may have to wait decades before there is a teacher raised up. The way today is the way of the whole Body serving. Although the one-talented ones are not worth much, when a few of them are put together, they equal a five-talented one. As soon as a person is saved, he has at least one talent. There is no one who has less than one talent. In the church, one cannot find anyone who does not have even one talent, unless, of course, such a one has buried his talent. Today, the building up of the church hinges on the building up of the one-talented ones. If some five-talented ones are raised up, we praise the Lord for it. In terms of function and result in the work, the great gifts are surely good when they are coordinated together. It is good to have the help of the five-talented ones and the two-talented ones. But what we need today is for the one-talented ones to rise up. The way to deal with the flesh is by the authority. But at the same time, the one-talented ones have to rise up. Only this will afford the church a way to go on, and only then will there be works for the church to do.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Recovering the Authority of the Church<br>to Deal with the Flesh</H2><P>In serving the Lord, on the one hand, the brothers and sisters have to learn to be obedient and to take the cross. Once the Holy Spirit operates, the cross will function within a person's heart. On the other hand, the authority of the church needs to be recovered; this deals with the flesh and deals with those who will not take the cross. In order for the work of the church to be recovered, there is first the need for the recovery of the one-talented ones. In order to recover the work of the church, there must also be the recovery of the authority of the church. It is not enough to recover the one-talented ones alone, and it is not enough to recover the authority of the church alone. If all the one-talented ones will rise up, in a short time we will be able to take over China. Who can withstand the mobilization of all the one-talented ones? If God will do this work among us, we will see an unprecedented work of salvation among us.</P><P>At the same time, the brothers and sisters have to learn to listen to others. If they do not listen, the church will fall into confusion. Naturally, the young and the new believers have many things that they do not know. The more advanced and mature brothers and sisters should exhort them to listen to others. We are people with a very small capacity. According to our disposition, we do things when we feel like doing them, and we go home and sleep when we do not feel like doing them. However, in the Body today, whether you like it or not, you have to do what you should do. Even if you have to cry with tears or sacrifice yourself, you still have to do it.</P><P>Co-workers, brothers, we have to receive something from the Lord. We cannot let anyone slip by. We cannot be so foolish in our work as to be unable even to tell the real believers from the false ones. We cannot leave a person alone for three to five months after baptism without rendering the proper care to him. We are our brothers' keepers. Those who do not act as their brothers' keepers are those who murder their brothers (Gen. 4:8-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Everyone Handing Over Himself, Everyone Working, and Everyone Submitting to Authority</H2><P>If we do these things, a church according to Pentecost will soon appear. If everyone hands himself over, if everyone is learning and working, and if everyone offers up his material riches and is obedient, we will have the proper coordination. I hope to see this situation not only in one or two places, but throughout the entire nation.</P><P>During the war, we had over four hundred co-workers among us. If the material supply had been adequate, we could have increased the number to a thousand. Whether in the east or in the west, most of the ones who are actually doing some kind of works are our brothers and sisters. In Chekiang, there are over ninety co-workers. In the one province of Fukien alone, we see God's blessings everywhere.</P><P>The foolish ones only see what they have in their hands; they do not have eyes for the whole earth. Today we have to enlarge our view. In China today, there are close to a thousand churches. But what is that to the Lord? We need tens of thousands of churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Everyone Needing the Training</H2><P>All the brothers and sisters in the church have to be trained. What we need today is not theology, but education in the things of God. When a local church is young, there is no way for the brothers and sisters to serve. But when a church is strong and rich, there will be much work. By that time, even if all the young saints put themselves into the work, there will still be a shortage of manpower.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Migration</H2><P>After the brothers and sisters are trained, they can be sent out. The apostles are the ones who should remain in Jerusalem. In reading the Bible, many people think that the twelve disciples were supposed to go to the ends of the earth. If that were to be the case, how could the twelve disciples travel through the whole earth? The Bible shows us that the twelve apostles were to remain in Jerusalem, and that Samaria should be taken by Philip. Peter's visit to Samaria was a temporary one. It would have been wrong for him to settle down in Samaria. The gospel work is a relay race; it is not done by one man alone. Today, the co-workers should remain in their own Jerusalems. After they gain some people, they should send them out. If they do not send out people, persecutions will come, and difficulties will arise. In order for the gospel to go out, there is the need for migration. The apostles should remain in Jerusalem and work there, and all the brothers and sisters should receive training from the church. At the same time, the church should care for the poor people, the unbelievers, and the new believers; it should learn how to deal with them, how to gain them. After they are perfected, they should be sent out. This kind of coordination will be effective; it will spread to all the places. Not only do the apostles have to preach the gospel; all the brothers and sisters have to preach the gospel as well. Philip was not specially ordained to be an evangelist, in the same way that Stephen was not specially ordained to be a martyr. We think that only special brothers can do special works. Yet, Philip was simply one of those who were serving the tables. We have to know that Samaria was taken over by such a table-server. Coordination requires that everyone be consecrated and that everyone offer up what he has.</P><P>Perhaps many will say, "I do not have the eloquence. I do not know how to preach the gospel." You have to start learning today. If you preach well, you have to preach. If you do not preach well, you still have to preach. Perhaps the first time you preach, the sinners will not be saved. But the second time you preach, they will be saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Working Saints Offering Up<br>Their Material Riches</H2><P>Whoever wants to be a Sunday-goer or a spectator can continue to be a pew-member. But in the church, everyone has to offer himself up. To the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs, I have to say that from now on you are no longer working for money. If a person does not offer up his riches, his consecration is invisible and intangible. No one can tell when he has taken back such a kind of consecration. The Bible says that the disciples laid everything at the feet of the apostles (Acts 4:35).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ALL MYSTICAL THINGS BECOMING TANGIBLE<br>AND PRACTICABLE</H2><P>Today, every mystical thing has to become practicable. For example, Christ says that we have to humble ourselves and to love others. Is this good? Yes, it is good. But the Lord's word does not stop here; He charges us to wash each other's feet. Today, no one would admit that he is proud. No one would put up a sign and say that he is humble. Yet whether or not you are humble depends on whether or not you have washed each other's feet. All the mystical things have to become tangible before they can become reliable.</P><P>The book of James says that if there are poor brothers among us, and we love them, we cannot merely lift our hands and say, "May the Lord bless you. Be warmed and filled" (cf. James 2:15-16). The mystical love is eternal; yet it is useless as far as practical matters are concerned. It is more practical to give the poor brother a bowl of rice.</P><P>If a brother offends me, I have to forgive him. But if this forgiveness remains a mystical one, I can forgive him fifty or a hundred times, and others will still not realize it. This kind of forgiveness must be transformed into a kind of tangible dealing.</P><P>The same is true about withstanding Satan. If you withstand Satan in an inward way, you do not know whether or not the withstanding works. But if you say a few words, Satan will go away.</P><P>The same is true with baptism. Once a person believes, he needs to be baptized. Perhaps some will think that it is too quick to baptize a person right after he believes. But this is wrong. To believe with the heart is something that is invisible. One must have the visible baptism before the matter is settled. To believe with the heart is mystical. To be baptized in the body is tangible.</P><P>The same is true with consecration. A mystical consecration is not solid. Many consecrations remain a mystical consecration. Many say to the Lord, "I consecrate everything." But the Gospel of Luke shows us that Zaccheus' consecration was very concrete. He offered up his possessions (Luke 19:8). The Lord's command to him was also very concrete. During the past one hundred years, the church has received many mystical consecrations. But the consecrations at the time of the early apostles were tangible consecrations. At that time, when a man handed himself over, everything was settled. Every brother and sister should hand over himself or herself; everyone should submit to the authority of the church and should be coordinated together with other brothers and sisters. Brother Witness said it well: When the church is advancing and the material offering falls behind, it is the fault of the brothers and sisters; while, on the other hand, if the material offering is adequate, yet the gospel falls behind, it is the fault of the co-workers. Those brothers and sisters who participate in the spiritual services have to be coordinated, and those brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should also be coordinated. Some sisters wanted to offer up something, but I declined their offerings, because they had not offered up themselves yet. First Corinthians tells us that God first receives us, and then ours. The person has to come first, before the possessions and the time come also.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD BEING AFTER ABSOLUTE ONES</H2><P>The coordination that we are speaking of today is one that costs the co-workers' lives. It is one that also costs the other brothers' and sisters' lives. All the brothers and sisters must have the Lord as their center, and they have to offer up everything for the gospel and for the service. We do not consider being a Christian to be our second profession. Some are professing Christians. But we should be the "professional" Christians. Christ should be our first profession. All the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should offer up all their time. The Lord demands that we deny ourselves for the sake of loving Him. The Lord's demand is the same today as it was in the first century. In God's word, there is no place for halfway ones; there are only absolute ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A PRAYER</H2><P>Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi prayed: May the Lord forbid that tonight's words be merely mysterious words in our heart. May they be transformed to outward realities. May they not be merely notions, but realities. May they not be merely doctrines, but life. May they not be something that is nice to hear, but something that is good to see. May we not have fragmentary services, but complete services. May we not only have a consecration of the heart and the mouth, but a consecration of the hands and the feet. Amen.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>DELIVERANCE FROM MAMMON<br>AND<br>MINISTRY AND AUTHORITY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (21)</H1><P>Date:April 27, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DELIVERED FROM MAMMON TO SERVE GOD</H2><P>The Bible assigns mammon a very important position. Mammon stands in opposition to God. Today, more people are gained by mammon than those gained by God. Perhaps of a hundred people, eighty are gained by mammon. Of the remaining twenty, eighteen to nineteen serve both God and mammon. It is difficult to find one in a hundred who truly serves God. Mammon gains more souls than God does.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Deliverance from Mammon Being<br>the Basic Qualification for One to Serve God</H2><P>Originally, we had no intention during this time to speak about mammon. We were going to look at the matter of the Body life. Later, the fellowship about the Body life led to a second problem. The first problem is individualism, and the second problem is mammon. Individualism frustrates man from serving God. Mammon also frustrates man from serving God. If a man serves mammon, not only will there be no service to God corporately, but individually that person will not be able to serve God either. We can say that deliverance from mammon is the first and the foremost condition for one to serve God. If a man is not delivered from mammon, he cannot serve God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Money Being Satan's Means<br>to Unify All Things</H2><P>All things are created by God. God is the unique source of all things; He is above all things. When men see all things, they should be moved to worship God. Today, the human mind invented atheism, and it is obviously wrong. The heavens move men to know God. "All things" are diverse and complicated. Satan wants to unify all things. There is no way to add up all things. For example, a chair and a table cannot be added together to make one unit. What is an adult plus a child plus a piece of luggage plus a bar of gold plus a piece of land? They do not add up to one unit. However, if you convert all these things into money, you can add them up. If all things cannot be unified, how can the businessmen do their accounting? With so many different units, how can one reckon their values? Money is the only means by which we can reckon all things. With money, a piece of land becomes no more a piece of land; it becomes money. Rice becomes no more rice; it becomes money. When we add together all things, we end up with a certain amount of money. In the end, Revelation 18 tells us that even the human soul can be reckoned with money. When a man sells his time to work for others, he is selling his soul. For example, when I hire a laborer, I agree with him ahead of time how much I will pay him for working eight hours. This is to buy the human soul with money. Money can buy us the human soul, and money can buy us all things. God created the earth, yet man divided it up into pieces and reckoned the value of every piece with money. If man can occupy the land on the moon, he will sell it for money also. Even for airplanes to fly over the earth, man charges people for access of the air space. Perhaps some people think that this is nothing unusual. But to us, and to the Bible, this is very strange. In six days, God created all things. Can you find out how much money "all things" are worth? Here are all sorts of things, in all fashions and colors. Yet Satan has simplified these things and unified them under money. This is why money is called in Chinese "the common goods."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Satan Usurping Man's Worship through Money</H2><P>At the same time, money is taking hold of all things. On the one end, God produced all things through creation. On the other end, Satan converted all things into money, thus unifying all things. If a man has money, he can buy anything. He can buy gold. He can even buy the whole of Shanghai, or the whole of China. There is not one thing that money cannot buy. Mammon is opposed to God. This is the reason that the Bible not only tells us that the love of money is the root of all evil (1 Tim. 6:10), but that covetousness and idolatry are together (Eph. 5:5; Col. 3:5). Covetousness is the only idol. When one worships money, he is not worshipping money itself, but the created things behind the money. Because man wants goods, he spends the "common goods," that is, the money, to buy the particular goods. This means that man wants God's things and does not want God Himself. This is the reason why man either serves God or mammon. Those who have a heart for mammon can never love God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Only Way to Serve God Being<br>to Be Delivered from Mammon</H2><P>God's things come from God; this is grace. These things that come from God are not for sale. The sunlight is not metered, and there is no charge for it. But the electric light has a charge for it. To get anything from Satan, man has to buy it. Even the carob pods of the prodigal son had to be bought. If a person truly wants to serve the Lord, he must be delivered from money. Once a person's thoughts are turned to money, he cannot serve God. It is wrong for a man to view all things from the side of money; he should view all things from the side of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MINISTRY AND AUTHORITY</H2><P>Another thing which we must see is the relationship between ministry and authority. The eyes have the ministry of the eyes; they control the seeing function. For any member in the body to see, it has to rely on the ministry of the eyes. The meaning of coordination is that I give to others what I have, and others give to me what they have. The first condition to coordination is that we accept our own limitation. We have to acknowledge that we are only a member, and that we are not the Body. If you are capable in everything, then you are the whole Body, and you do not need coordination any longer. However, as long as you are only a member, you cannot think that you have everything. The one-talented ones cannot pretend to be rich. Even if the eyes are important, they cannot replace the ears. One can see the colors only with the eyes, and one can hear the sounds only with the ears. Perhaps I can only speak; I cannot walk. In that case, you will have to do the walking. If you see this, you will realize that what one individual can do is actually very limited.</P><P>During these days, the Lord has shown us that too few brothers and sisters know what real coordination is. One brother said once, "I don't think that this thing should be done this way." I said to him, "Who is asking you to think?" If you are an ear, you do not have to say, "I think this matter should be done this way." If the eyes see that something is white, then it is white. There is no need for the ear to think whether it is white.</P><P>The sisters cover their heads with respect to the brothers. Christ says that He does not speak from Himself (John 12:49). The word from is ek in the original language. It means "out from." This means that the Son can speak nothing out from Himself. In other words, Christ's head is covered before God. Today, the church also has its head covered before Christ. The fact of the covering is demonstrated through the sisters' covering of their heads. Whenever we are in the coordination of the Body, all our heads have to be removed. For many to think what to do and to express what opinions they have is quite inappropriate. Someone asked me once, "If I cannot say amen to a certain thing, what should I do?" The Bible never says that a servant of God should do something "when he feels amen to do it," and should not do something "when he does not feel amen to do it." Man's head needs to be cut off. When some brothers and sisters talk to me, I have the feeling that my head should be cut off. Only the unique Head is qualified to think. Today, man's mind is full of the thought of being the head. A person has to learn to reject proposals and opinions.</P><P>God has reserved for Himself teachers, who can make decisions concerning the interpretation of the Bible and judgments on the Scriptures. The reason that there are so many sects and strange doctrines is that everyone wants to be a teacher. However, in reality, not everyone is a teacher. It is useless for the ear to say that something is white. Whether or not that thing is white is not up to what the ear says, but what the eyes see. Today, there are many heresies that developed from the church because of this very reason.</P><P>There is one thing very strange in 1 Corinthians 12: although the eyes and the ears are on the head, they are not the head. In the body, the controlling organ is the head, whereas the working organs are the members. The organ that actually sees is not the eyes, but the optical nerves within the head. Outwardly speaking, the whole body moves by the seeing of the eyes. Actually it moves by the head. Even if you are a great gift or a strong member, you are useless if you are not in coordination, and if you are not the eyes, surely you need coordination all the more. Today, we need to see our own limitation.</P><P>There are many things that do not require our considerations. Once we see the limitation of the members, the question of authority will be settled. If we are at odds with the members appointed by God, we are at odds with the Head. If you are omnipotent and omniscient, you will not need any coordination. In the church, we are not afraid of seemingly foolish ones who know nothing; we are only afraid of those who know everything and who can do everything. In coordination, we should not be the head. Rather, we should learn to listen and should not have too many of our own thoughts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING THE ASCERTAINING OF MINISTRY</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee asked: How does a person know what kind of ministry he has?</P><P>Brother Nee answered: It is better that he does not know. Whether or not you have a ministry is up to the Head to know; it is not up to you to know. This is the reason we have to accept the judgment of the whole Body. Only the knowledge of the Body is reliable. Whether you think you have a ministry or do not have a ministry does not count.</P><P>It is useless for a brother or a sister to tell others in the meeting that he or she has a ministry. If you have a ministry, you have it, and it will be manifested through your exercising it. Concerning the ascertaining of ministry, we have to realize that the judgment of the whole Body is more accurate than the judgment of an individual.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING PURSUING THE GIFTS</H2><P>Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi asked: What kind of attitude should we take concerning the pursuit of the gifts?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Ministry Being Constituted<br>of the Death of Jesus,<br>whereas the Gifts Being Bestowed upon Us Outwardly by the Holy Spirit</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: First and Second Corinthians tell us the difference between the gift and the ministry. First Corinthians is on the gifts, whereas 2 Corinthians is on the ministry. The basis of the ministry is the death and life of Christ. A gift is merely a power that the Holy Spirit bestows outside of us. The word "death" in 2 Corinthians 4 is a special word in the original language. There is more than one word for death in Greek. One of them means the opposite of life. It is used to describe a person as being dead, as opposed to being alive. This is the word commonly used. Another word means a kind of killing. It is used in the sense of killing a person, as opposed to begetting a person. The death in 2 Corinthians 4 has the sense of killing in the Greek language. Hence, it can be translated as the killing or the slaying of Jesus. While I was in London, I told the Western brothers and sisters that for the word death in 2 Corinthians 4, we can use a new word deathize. This death is a death that kills you. What this is saying is that the positive death of Jesus is being wrought into us. It refers to that death which issues from Jesus and which causes us to die. A ministry of life comes from God and is produced through repeated dealings. Spiritual gifts, on the other hand, are but elementary matters in the church. What the Lord cares for today is that we serve the church with the ministry, and not with the gifts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Needing Life Ministry<br>More Than Spiritual Gifts</H2><P>The minute a brother stands up to speak, one can tell right away whether he is a brother with a gift or a brother with a ministry. In Southeast Asia, men cut the rubber tree with a knife. The life of the tree flows out through the scar of the knife-wound. This is a picture of one who serves with a ministry. When a man passes through fiery trials, he can give life to others. This is very different from merely giving gifts to others. In order to have a strong church, what we need is not gifts, but the ministry of life. When you walk into an immature church, there may be much activity, but there is not much life. On the other hand, you may see a brother who is not eloquent; you may be concerned for him and may wonder if you should do his job for him. Yet with him, there is the ministry. What is manifested in him is not the gifts. When a church is mature, many ministries will be produced, and there will be much life supply. Every brother should learn to touch the difference between gift and ministry. The church needs more ministries to be raised up. An immature church requires the presence of gifted brothers. But we cannot allow such a situation to go on forever. Gifts are temporary, whereas ministries last forever.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Gifts Being What One Uses,<br>whereas Ministry Being the Person Himself</H2><P>Brother Yu's fellowship: The life of Christ is His deposit within the believers. This life is a real entity from Christ. It is a reality from heaven. Gift is only a thing; one can borrow it and use it for a while, but the user may not know what it is. It is like Balaam's donkey speaking human words; one cannot say that because of this, the donkey has become human. Those who exercise gifts are like children speaking grown-up words. God has raised up some people with a ministry. On the one hand, they have to have the gifts, because otherwise they cannot do the work of perfecting. However, those who speak merely according to their gifts are entirely different from those who speak according to a ministry that is produced in the course of twenty years or more. Some say, "If others can speak, why can't I?" The problem is that while a child can speak grown-up words, he does not therefore become a grown-up. It is like the donkey who can speak human words; it does not mean that the donkey can consider itself a human being just because it speaks human words. Outwardly, the speaking of those with gifts and the speaking of those with a ministry are the same. But inwardly, the two are different.</P><P>When a church is strong, the spirit of the saints is clear. Although there may not be many outward activities, men will learn the proper lessons before the Lord. When a church is young, there may be the gifts, but there will not be the ministry. If we know God, we will see that a person may say something, but this does not mean that he is what he says. Some gifted ones fall much faster and easier than those who have no gifts.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY<br>IN THE BODY<br>AND THE BODY CONSCIOUSNESS</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (22)</H1><P>Date:April 28, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY IN THE BODY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Restricted in Our Speaking</H2><P>A man learns restriction first through his speaking. It is most difficult for a man to control his tongue. A tongue that is under control only dares to speak words of the learned (Isa. 50:4). The first thing we have to see is that a person who is rebellious in his speaking is one who has given himself away.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Not Speaking Reviling Words</H2><P>When I was in London, I met a couple who would not submit to the responsible brothers. The husband was a good man, and the wife was also a good sister. The only trouble was that they were too talkative. They testified that whenever they spoke contradicting words, their spirit became a contradicting spirit. We have to see today that, as soon as our words come out, our spirit comes out. Both 2 Peter and Jude as well talk about the matter of reviling. Reviling is done through our speaking. If we are not careful, and we revile the brothers ahead of us, the oneness of the church will be damaged.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Withstanding Reviling Words</H2><P>Those who take in reviling words bear the same responsibility as those who speak reviling words. It is one thing for a person to dump trash on others. It is another thing for a person to receive trash from others. One of the reasons the church is divided and damaged is that there are reviling words. In order for the church to maintain the oneness, the brothers and sisters have to withstand reviling words.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Example of Michael</H2><P>Michael was an archangel. In the beginning, he was under Satan. Although Satan fell, Michael did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him. Moses' body was probably left on the Mount of Transfiguration. Michael could not revile Satan. He could only say, "The Lord rebuke you" (Jude 9). He had to invoke a higher authority to rebuke Satan. From this we see the importance of our words.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Reviling Words Damaging the Body</H2><P>Some people's tongues are "waxed"; they are very cunning. This kind of people never know or understand the Body. They unconsciously damage the Body with their words. It is bad enough for a man to have a wound. But if one rubs sand on the wound, the hurt will be greater. The same is true when one speaks reviling words. If a man's tongue is not under control, all other kinds of controls are useless (James 3:2). Man's tongue is the most cunning of all things. A double-tongued person will soon find that he has no one he can perfect; he will have turned away every possible person he could have perfected. If you are an inquisitive person and one with an itching ear, you would want others to talk to you and to entertain you. But those who have learned the lessons should rebuke you to your face. One needs not go on speaking when he is in front of an inquisitive person; his words can stop right there.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Need to Know the Body</H2><P>The consciousness of sin comes from knowing God. In the same way, the consciousness of reviling words comes from the knowledge of the Body. Reviling words are opposed to the testimony of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Learning Not to Be the Head</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Submitting to the<br>Authority of the Head, and Being<br>the Authority One to Another</H2><P>The head manifests itself as the head by its ideas and proposals. The meaning of submitting to the authority of the Head is that one does not need to make many proposals and will not have many ideas of his own. A Christian who lives in the Body is a most simple person.</P><P>There is a basic difference between a Protestant's understanding of the Bible and a Catholic's understanding of the Bible. The Catholics think that the Pope is the only one who can make decisions on the interpretation of the Bible and that no ordinary person can interpret the Bible. The Pope's decision is the only decision. From this doctrine, many kinds of idolatry were developed, including the worship of Mary. Protestantism is more advanced than Catholicism. It claims that as many Christians as there are, there are that many popes, and that everyone can read the Bible and interpret it. If we have the light, we will see that both of them are wrong. In the Body, the Lord has only arranged for certain members to have the authority to make judgments on the interpretation of the Scriptures. Hence, do not try to be a pope in haste.</P><P>For example, the Lord has raised up some brothers among us to help us concerning the way of life. If any of the brothers have any question concerning the way of life, they can go to these brothers to seek for help. In the Body, there is not just one brother, but many brothers who can supply us life in many aspects. If you want to receive help from them, you have to realize that they have the ministry and that they have the authority. You have to submit yourselves to their authority. This authority is given to them by the Head. If any member of my body argues with my mouth or my eyes, it is arguing with the head who establishes those ministries. If a member does not submit to the function of these members, it is not submitting to the head. A rebellious person first demonstrates his rebellion through his words, then through his thoughts. The more simple you are, the more you can be one with others. It does not mean that when you submit to others, you do not have a ministry any longer. In the Body, we are authorities one to another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Ministry Being Authority</H2><P>Ministry is authority. When the Lord gives a ministry to a person, He is giving authority to that person. Many people are worried about many problems, but as a member we have to learn to remove our own heads. This is the meaning of the sisters' covering of their heads. Head covering means that only the Lord is the Head. This of course does not mean that the responsible brothers can make any proposal they want. A person who has been dealt with is one who does not like to interfere with others' affairs. Only after we become a person who has no interest in interfering with others' affairs can we be the authority; only then can we bear responsibility before God, and only then can we manage the affairs of the brothers and sisters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THOSE WHO<br>ARE IN AUTHORITY<br>NOT INTERFERING WITH OTHERS</H2><P>God never interferes with man, nor did He ever force man to do anything. The garden of Eden was not fenced with barbed wire, and hell does not have any fences either. If a man wants to go to hell, he can go in easily. All roads lead to hell. Today, in the twentieth century, man has invented the electric fence, and has installed twenty volts or sixty volts of electricity to these fences. But our God never interferes with man, nor forces man to do anything. All those who by nature like to meddle with others' affairs must be dealt with. Those who by nature like to control others can never be the authority. Those who are the authorities should let others know that they do not like to control others. They speak only because they have received authority from the Head. A man who has been taught and who has learned to be an authority will not answer questions in a light way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ONLY THOSE HAVING BEEN<br>DEALT WITH BY THE LORD<br>AND WHO KNOW THE LORD'S MIND<br>BEING ABLE TO BE THE AUTHORITY</H2><P>The deepest chapter in the New Testament concerning man's experience is 1 Corinthians 7. There Paul said that he did not have the commandment from the Lord. Yet up to a certain point, he said that he had the confidence that he had the Spirit of God (v. 40). Paul said that he gave the brothers his own opinion. It was as if he was saying that he had followed the Lord for twelve years, and that according to him the matter should be taken care of in such and such a way. In the end, he said that in his spirit he felt that he had the Spirit of God. Because he had been dealt with by the Lord in many things, he could speak according to the principle by which he had been dealt with. He had followed the Lord for so many years and had learned so much. He was brought to the point where he could say that he knew the Lord's heart.</P><P>Abraham and Enoch walked with God. That is why they knew God's way. God did not have to tell them anything; they simply knew God's heart. It is a strange thing for a man to follow the Lord many years and yet not know the pace the Lord is taking, the direction He is turning, or the method He is using. A person who knows God's heart knows the Lord's mind even before He makes things manifest.</P><P>We need to be a person who has been taught by God and one who is under control. Only those who do not speak carelessly or express their opinions carelessly can hope to be used by God. Only these ones can represent the Head. Only such kind of people can lead the brothers and sisters on in the way ahead of them. God will never entrust authority to those who by nature like to criticize others. In order for a man to submit, his head must first be cut off. If you are a person with your head removed, you will immediately sense when others' heads have asserted themselves. You will feel their assertion of headship like feeling an electric shock. Once you touch them, you will realize that they have asserted their headship, and that in certain matters they have rebelled. You know it because you yourself have been judged in this matter already. This is why you can feel it when similar cases come up. If a brother has been dealt with in these two things, that is, in the matter of speaking and in learning not to assume headship, there will be no difficulty in the exercise of authority. Those who have caused problems in these two matters have never known what the Body is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AN ADDITIONAL WORD</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee: In our contact with the brothers and sisters, if we pay much attention to the outward methods, we will become a movement. Today, we have not spent enough time on the matter of life and revelation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT BEING A PRETENDER TO THE THRONE</H2><P>Brother Nee said: In French history, there were certain persons who were called pretenders to the throne. The throne did not belong to such ones. Yet they claimed to have it. It is somewhat like the last Chinese Emperor Pu-yi, who had lost his empire already, but who continued to claim himself to be the emperor.</P><P>Today, many people claim that they are the church, or that they are the authority. Whether it is in the Roman Catholic church, the Presbyterian church, the Baptist church, or the Methodist church, all those who claim themselves to be the church or that they have the authority are the "pretenders to the throne." The Roman Catholic church says that Peter was the first Pope, and that all subsequent popes are the representatives of Christ. Today, if we are a little more clever and a little less clear about the boundary line, we will fall into their error and will become a pretender to the throne also.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BODY CONSCIOUSNESS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Body Consciousness&#151;<br>Submitting to the Authority of the Head,<br>and Fellowshipping with the Body</H2><P>What is the church? Outwardly speaking, the church is local. We have covered this in the co-workers' meetings in 1937. But what is the content and the life of the church? If a church does not stand on the ground of the local church, it is not a church. If a local church would submit itself to the authority of the Head, it is spontaneously a church. In the church, we are members one of another. The meaning of being members one of another is that no one keeps back something for himself. My heart is joined to all the children of God, and it is related to all the members. As members, our experience of coming into the consciousness of the Body is just as definite as our individual experience of touching the Head. The Body has a Body consciousness. This consciousness causes a member to submit to the authority of the Head and causes it also to open up itself to the Body and to have fellowship with the Body. This is what we call Body consciousness.</P><P>I will use a somewhat inadequate illustration. When a man travels overseas, he may be a foreigner in another land, but he is still under the headship of his own country. A Chinese who loves China and who lives in a foreign land may tell others that he is China; he does not say that he is a Chinese. But then, some foreign students are ashamed to be known as a Chinese; they often say negative things to the foreigners about China. Some political fugitives are even worse; they are actively damaging China. But those who truly love China have a special consciousness about China. They can say that they are China.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Body Testimony&#151;<br>Taking the Head as the Authority<br>and Being One with All the Saints</H2><P>A person who has the Body consciousness can say that he is the Body. If you say that you are the Body, yet you do not submit to the authority of the Head, what you say is false. On the contrary, if you are in the Body, you will not just be a drop of water, but you as a drop will be mingled with the sea. By that time you can say that you are the sea.</P><P>Outwardly speaking, the church has the locality as its boundary. But as far as its content goes, it takes the Head as its authority. Here all the saints are one in Christ. The local church is not just a local church as such. Within the local church, there is the testimony of the Body, and in this church everyone holds on to the Head.</P><P>When we fellowship with all the children of God, we will not criticize others easily. The basic issue is that we have to pray to God to create a Body consciousness within us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Way to Have the Body Consciousness&#151;<br>Dealing with Individualism</H2><P>How do we turn from a situation that is without Body consciousness to one that is with a Body consciousness? First, we have to deal with our individualism. For everything, we have to know the positive side as well as the negative side. It is not enough merely to know the positive side; we need to know the negative side as well. If we do not know both sides, we will not be able to learn the proper lessons. For example, the opposite side of sins is forgiveness, and the opposite side of justification is ungodliness. The opposite side of salvation is the world. If a man wants to understand forgiveness, he must understand sins. If a man wants to be justified, he has to be delivered from ungodliness. If a man wants to be saved, he must know the world. The Bible seldom says that a man is delivered from hell. Most of the time, it says that a man is delivered from the world. Another example is sanctification. The opposite of sanctification is to be common. The word "holy" is hagios in the original language, and it means to be separated. The opposite of separation is to be common. All the truths in the Bible are in pairs. If we mismatch these pairs, we will be confused.</P><P>The opposite of the Body is individualism. Hence, if we want to see the Body, we must first see the negative side of the Body, which is individualism. A man must first deal with his self before he can see the Body. Many people deal with the matter of loving the Lord and of obedience. But the more they deal with them, the more they build up the self, their own righteousness, their goodness, and their holiness. This makes it even harder for them to be mingled with others and to follow the footsteps of the flock.</P><P>Individualism is the deepest thing that is hidden in a person. A man needs to be touched by God to such an extent that everything with him is dealt with. Today man only sees the personal sanctification of the Keswick movement. Why do we not speak of corporate sanctification? The sanctification in Hebrews 12 is a corporate sanctification. Today, many people talk about personal faith. Why do we not speak of corporate faith? In the Bible, when it says "the faith," it means the saving truth, whereas "faith" without the article refers to the act of believing. "The faith" refers to the corporate faith of the whole church. Today, man refuses to pay attention to corporate faith and corporate sanctification because he has not seen that what he has is only very little.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>On Seeing the Body</H2><P>A piece of glass may hold a little bit of water, but it can never hold the equivalent of a cup of water. Every Christian has received some grace, but individual Christians are not the whole. Even if they receive much grace, they can only be considered big pieces of glass. They are still two-dimensional; they are not three-dimensional. Today, individuals have to be set aside. What the Lord wants is not individual pieces of broken glass, but a whole cup. God's principle is for one to chase a thousand, and two to chase ten thousand (Deut. 32:30). Today, the church is filled with individuals. But wherever there are two persons who are one, they can drive out ten thousand, eight thousand of which they gain as extra profit. Today, God wants to see the church preaching the gospel, the church teaching the truth, and the church making the money. Everything is placed in the church. Seeing the Body is one kind of salvation. This salvation is stronger and richer than the first salvation that an individual receives. Once a person has been touched by the Lord, he can no longer say that he can be an individual Christian alone. We need to allow God to work in us. A man develops the Body consciousness not through thinking or deduction. Once the self is dealt with, the Body consciousness is manifested. You will see that, on the one hand, you are the Body; on the other hand, you are also a member. When a man sees individualism as a sin, he will submit to God. Once a man sees the Body, nothing will become difficult. When a man sees the Body, it will not be difficult for him to love others. When a man sees the Body, it will not be difficult for him to live by faith or to receive answers to prayers. In the Lord's work, if a man has not seen the Body, he cannot do anything. Hence, many things today hinge on seeing the Body truth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Be Obedient, to Be Taught,<br>and Not to Assume Headship</H2><P>A person has a problem with Body consciousness because he has a problem concerning individualism. In order for a brother to become submissive, his own ideas must first go. My hands have been listening to my head for forty-five years; they never express their own ideas. They always keep their place. This is why there is no problem with my body. If my heart tries to set up another head, my body will argue with itself from morning until night. To remove our individualism, we have to tear down our own head. We have to learn to speak as one who is taught, to think as one who is taught, and to act as one who is taught. Submission is the simplest thing there is. It is difficult for a person to submit alone. But when there are a lot of people around, it will become easy to submit. In order to submit to one another, there is the need for everyone to be dealt with.</P><P>Coordination does not come by human thoughts and opinions. If our physical body can have such a wonderful coordination, how much more wonderful should the coordination in the Body of Christ be? We believe that when Christ's spiritual Body is coordinated together, what we see will be even better and more beautiful, and its result will far exceed what we think.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>VOLUNTARY POVERTY<br>AND SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (23)</H1><P>Date:April 28, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 6:21-24</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VOLUNTARY POVERTY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Deliverance from Mammon to Serve God</H2><P>Matthew 6 shows us that if our eye is single, the whole body will be illuminated. Our eye has to be single. After this word, in the next verse the Lord speaks of the matter of serving the Lord. In the matter of serving the Lord, a man has to be single. No one can serve both God and mammon. In the first verse it mentions the eye being single, and in the next verse it mentions the service being single. Mammon is a serious thing. If a man wants to serve the Lord, he must be delivered from mammon. Those who are not delivered from mammon cannot serve God.</P><P>A single eye means an eye that is delivered from mammon. Only this kind of eye will enable one to see the truth. The truth is absolute; it has nothing to do with man. If a man does not know God, it is because his eyes are defiled and impure. In order for a man to know God, he must have eyes that are delivered from any defilements. An impure person cannot see the truth. In the eyes of a defiled person, everything is defiled. Such persons cannot see God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Voluntary Poverty<br>As a Result of the Lord's Salvation</H2><P>A Christian should consider mammon as a menace, something that needs to be disposed of right away. He should drop it in the same way he would throw away a piece of red-hot coal from his hand. A Christian's poverty should be one that is voluntary. Some become poor through their environment. Others are poor because of their parents or other special circumstances. But there is a certain kind of people who are poor because they have met salvation. They have chosen to become poor. There is a big difference between the last kind of poverty and all the other kinds of poverty. This is like being a soldier in the army: some are drafted, whereas others enlist themselves voluntarily.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>It Being Difficult for the Rich Man<br>to Enter God's Kingdom</H2><P>Why do we have to choose poverty? It is because the Bible says that it is difficult for a rich man to be saved. It is more difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of the heavens than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle (Matt. 19:23-24). No rich man can enter the kingdom of the heavens.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Mammon Being an Idol</H2><P>Mammon is an idol. Covetousness is the same as idolatry (Eph. 5:5; Col. 3:5). If you work in an office and others pay you with an idol or a golden calf, will you take it? Of course, you will not take it. But today, many people do not realize that mammon is the same as idols. It does not matter what kind of money it is; as long as it is mammon, it belongs to Caesar.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Testimony of Voluntary Poverty</H2><P>During the time of the apostles, the disciples gave up everything to follow the Lord. In church history, there were tens of thousands of Franciscans who chose to live in poverty. We are often too careful concerning this matter. We are afraid that we will become too much. Actually, there are too many times in your life that you have done too much already. If you would not misunderstand me, I would say why not do it one more time and be a little bit too much in consecration. The founder of the Moravian movement, Count Zinzendorf, was an educated person, and he offered up all his material possessions. The number of missionaries this group sent out ranks the highest among all missionary groups during the past few hundred years. The Brethren do not like to advertise themselves, but many among them also chose the way of voluntary poverty.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Dealing with Mammon to Take Care<br>of the Church's Need</H2><P>In the Old Testament, when Rachel left Laban, she took the images with her, and she was condemned (Gen. 31:32). Today, Christians have to deal with mammon in the same way that they deal with idols. A Christian should not have idols in his house. In the same way, a Christian should not lay up for himself riches in his house. For God's children to lay up riches is the same as for them to touch idols. Today, there are too many needs in the church. At least there are three needs. First, there is the need of the work. Second, there is the need of the poor brothers. Third, there is always the need of the poor people. The Lord's word says that the poor we have with us always (Matt. 26:11). We have to take care of the needs in these three areas.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Money Having to Go<br>before One Can Experience Deliverance</H2><P>Mammon is more serious than idols. When the church is strong, it will take the stand of voluntary poverty. In this way, no false brothers will dare to come into the church, for once they come, they will have to sacrifice themselves. All those who come in through eloquence, intelligence, or wisdom will not be able to remain in the church. This will purify the church. When money goes out, a man is delivered. If you want to remain clean, you have to let your riches go.</P><P>In the Bible, we can see the Lord's relationship with money through two cases. The first case was the paying of the poll tax (Matt. 17:24-27). In this case, we see that the Lord did not carry any money in His pocket. The second case was His entrusting the money to Judas (John 12:6; 13:29). In that case, we also see that the Lord's pocket did not carry money. Judas was the only one suitable to carry money.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>No Excess through Much Gathering,<br>and No Lack through Little Gathering</H2><P>Paul's principle was that those who gather much have no excess, and those who gather little have no lack (2 Cor. 8:15). This is the principle of coordination in our work. If those who gather much have excess and those who gather little have lack, it means that there is no coordination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Offering Up Everything,<br>Keeping Only What One Needs</H2><P>Today, concerning the matter of offering, it is not a question of offering one-tenth or one-twentieth. It is a matter of everyone being as frugal as possible. Other than his own necessities, he should offer up all the rest. Anything less than this is not up to the proper standard of serving the Lord. Neither the Lord nor the church will want anything less than this standard. Everyone who serves the Lord has to forsake everything to follow Him. Other than providing for his own daily needs, a man should offer up everything. Those who lay up riches for themselves are the servants of mammon.</P><P>Consider the idol worshippers. How many procedures they have to go through! They have to kneel down, to burn incense, and so forth. You have to realize that serving mammon is just as complicated as worshipping idols. The book of Matthew says that where our treasure is, there is our heart also (Matt. 6:21). Following that, it talks about the matter of laying up riches. In order for our hearts to be saved, we have to be delivered from the laying up of riches. Those who have not been delivered from riches have not been saved in their hearts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Giving to the Poor for the Purpose of Being Delivered from the Power of Mammon</H2><P>Today, some people are bound by the world, but the bondage of money is more serious than the bondage of the world. Why do we have to give to the poor? To give to the poor is not merely for the sake of the poor ones. It is for the purpose of delivering ourselves from the power of mammon. When we do this, we promptly take care of the problem of money in our hands. Some people think that to spend money on the poor people is for the sake of the poor people. It is true that it is a good thing for a poor person to be saved through our giving. But even if he is not saved, it is still a good thing for us to give. A person who cares much for money will go into eternity alone; no one will thank him. But those who spend money on others will find others welcoming them in the heavens. Those who offer up themselves in laboring must also offer up themselves in material giving. It is one thing to be poor. It is another thing to have the kind of poverty that Paul refers to, which enriches many (2 Cor. 6:10). Today, the amount of excess we have is the amount of sin we have. The amount of excess we have is the amount of idols we have.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING SUBMISSION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE BODY</H2><P>Brother Lee asked: How can one see the authority of the Body?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>First Finding Out the Deputy Authority</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: With some people, their submission seems to be a selective one. In order to practice submission, the first thing to ask is who is above me. When we go to work in the secular world, the first thing we ask is who the boss is. If we do not get this question settled, we will not be able to do a proper job, not to mention the possibility of being punished. The same principle applies to working in an office or in any institution. For many people, the first thing that comes to their mind when they sit down is how to be the boss. Such people need to learn a serious lesson of submission. Submission is a lesson that a man has to learn before God. We have to be disciplined to such an extent that we bear a submissive nature. Whenever any brother or sister or co-worker goes to a place, he or she has to find out who his or her authority is.</P><P>For example, the brothers and sisters who are staying at our guest houses have to submit to the authority in that house. When they come to the meeting, they have to submit to the ushers and have to sit where they are told to sit. Every house that you stay in has its own authority. A Christian should learn to look for authority and to submit to authority. All those who pretend to be the head do not know what headship means in the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Submission without Any Preference</H2><P>I have never seen a man who says that he knows the Head, yet does not submit to Christ's deputy authority. A person who knows the Lord will never be selective in the matter of submission. For example, Brother Witness' children cannot be selective in their submission to their father. If a brother or a sister has never learned to submit to every deputy authority assigned by the Lord, he is under the greatest deception. The Bible says that there is no authority except from God (Rom. 13:1).</P><P>There are very few places in the Bible that talk about direct submission to God. Most of the time it talks about submission to man. Wherever we go, what we have to do is to submit, and not to criticize freely with our lips. If others give you some special authority, that is up to them; what you have to do is to learn to submit. Many people have never learned the lessons. Everywhere they go, they tear down the authorities, and they do not bridle their tongues. This kind of people are rebellious ones. May the Lord be merciful to us, that we will not be wild Christians. Not only should we not be selective in our submission; we should be actively seeking after the ones we should submit to.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Submission to Authority<br>Being the Nature of the Lord's Life</H2><P>When I was staying in London, everything was set up by the host. In the morning, we woke up at six o'clock. At noon we had our meal. At three o'clock in the afternoon, we had our afternoon tea. One Swiss brother from Japan was shaking his head and sighing every day. I asked why he was so unhappy. He was fifteen years older than I was, and he made tens of thousands of pounds every year. He had a few thousand workers working under him. He told me that he was having a hard time because he had not been a student for over twenty years. At the guest house where he was staying, the brother in charge was a rather uneducated person. It was very unpleasant for this Swiss brother to come under that brother's supervision. I stayed in London for eighteen months. If I had not learned submission, but instead criticized and opposed, how could I have been happy within? Submission is the nature of the Lord's life. It is for our protection to submit to God's authority.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Learning Submission in the Church</H2><P>A Christian ought to learn coordination, and coordination comes from submission. A rebellious and independent person is one who will not be coordinated. Christians ought to learn to submit one to another, and to be delivered from rebellious acts, critical words, and reviling conduct. Not only should a person have the realization of authority in the church and in the Body, but when he is alone, he should still have this realization. Today, we learn submission first in the church. It is rather difficult to learn submission outside the church. It is more natural to learn submission in the church. This is God's protection; it keeps us from exposing ourselves. If we learn the lesson this way, the spirit of antichrist will be removed from us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUBMISSION TO THE GOVERNMENT</H2><P>Concerning submission to our government, we know that no Christian can overturn any government. If certain political factors are contrary to our faith, the most we can do is to escape. It is like what the Lord says, that we escape from one city to another. In the Bible, to escape is not a shameful thing to do. If a government is not good, we can escape. But at the same time, all Christians should still pray for the governments that are not good.</P><P>One brother asked: If there are government-enacted laws which the government itself does not keep, should a Christian still keep them?</P><P>Brother Nee answered: We still have to keep them. But under certain circumstances, there are laws which a Christian cannot keep. Brother D. M. Panton said once that if a law is itself unlawful, we do not have to consider whether or not to keep that law. For example, Pharaoh ordered all the Hebrews to kill their male children. The midwives did not obey this order, yet the Bible says that God dealt well with the midwives (Exo. 1:20). Moses' mother did not obey the order of Pharaoh (Exo. 2:1-2), yet Hebrews 11 praised her faith. The reason for this is that Pharaoh's law was itself a lawless order. In the New Testament, when Peter and John disobeyed the order of the high priest, they were acting under the same principle.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIXTY-EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>BROTHER NEE'S WORD OF FAREWELL<br>TO BROTHER K. H. WEIGH</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (24)</H1><p>Date:April 29, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Note:Brother K. H. Weigh arrived in Shanghai in early April to attend the co-workers' fellowship. On April 30, he left Shanghai to go to Foochow. This message is Brother Nee's word of farewell to Brother Weigh on the evening before Brother Weigh left.</p><P>There is only one Christ, but due to different viewpoints and different emphases of the workers, it seems that Christ has been divided into many Christs. If a worker cannot express to others the one Christ whom God desires to present, his work is a failure. Many today have had very intimate contact with the Lord, whereas others are merely pressing against Him (Mark 5:24). Perhaps some indeed touched His back, held His hand, or tore His garments; yet they had no relationship whatever with Him in life. Among the many who thronged Jesus, the woman with an issue of blood was not the only one who was ill, but she was the only one healed in life (Matt. 9:20-22).</P><P>Some today indeed know the Christ of Bethsaida (Mark 8:22-26), or the Christ of Gadara (Mark 5:1-20), or the Christ of Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35). In their experience they have really seen the miracles and the wonders. They may even be able to perform the miracles themselves. Yet if there is no true inward revelation, none of these works will amount to anything. Some may be able to tell others with moving power about a Christ of Emmaus. They may be able to expound the Scriptures and may cause others to become truly fervent in their hearts; yet it is all to no avail. The real work is to impart a Christ of revelation to others. I speak these words not only to Brother Weigh, but to all the co-workers and to all the brothers and sisters alike. If you and I cannot impart a Christ of revelation to others, our work is a failure.</P><P>Here we see that there are two basically different stands that a worker of the Lord can take: one emphasizes work, the expounding of the Scriptures, miracles, works of wonders, answers to prayers, and so forth. The other presents before men a Christ of revelation.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>BROKENNESS AND MINISTRY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (25)</H1><P>Date:6:30 p.m., Friday, April 30, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING THE ONE TALENT IN THE BIBLE</H2><P>Brother Chi Yung-tung asked: What does the one talent in the Bible (Matt. 25:15) refer to?</P><P>Brother Nee answered: The one talent refers to the gift that the believers receive through the Lord's redemption. Today, the church fails because the one-talented ones have failed. If all the one-talented ones rise up, the church will be manifested, and others will see what is the Body. Every redeemed one has at least one talent; no one can have less than one talent.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING COORDINATION IN THE BODY</H2><P>Brother Chu Cheng asked: Is the coordination of the Body something spontaneous, or is there some kind of arrangement?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Need for Arrangements</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: Strictly speaking, our coordination before the Lord should be something spontaneous, but the problem today is that the young ones do not see the matter of coordination. This is why the brothers ahead of them should make some arrangements.</P><P>In the book of Timothy, Paul did not leave one thing for Timothy to make his own decision. He only required that Timothy and those with him be obedient. Today, if we do not make any arrangements, many people will not coordinate together.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Submission Helping a Person<br>to Break through His Individual Limitations</H2><P>There are certain advantages to being coordinated. All our judgments before the Lord are based on the light that we have received. The amount of light we see determines the amount of judgment we have. During the first few years of their Christian life, many people do not see much light. Their work and conduct surely cannot exceed the light they see. Hence, their work and conduct are limited by their judgments, and their judgments are limited by the light they have received. At Pentecost, the church became a strong testimony in an instant. Hence, as far as the church is concerned, it has been strong ever since the first day. But as far as the individuals are concerned, their condition progresses as time goes on. If the young ones would accept the judgments of the older ones, they will be able to do things beyond their capacity, and all the services before the Lord will be covered properly. In this way, the church will gain a profit. If all the one-talented ones will submit to authority, they will not have one talent only, but will make a profit. We have to see that the riches in the church far exceed the riches of individual members.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING FOLLOWING THE MINISTRY OF THE AGE</H2><P>Question: How should Jonathan in the Old Testament (Saul's son&#151;1 Sam. 14:1-46) choose his way?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Seeing the Ministry of the Age</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: In the Old Testament, both Solomon and David represented the Lord. The two persons represented the one ministry in two separate ways. In the Old Testament, there were many ministries. After Moses, the judges were raised up. After that, there was Solomon, the kings, and the prophets. After the Israelites were taken into captivity, the vessels for the recovery were raised up. The Old Testament is filled with different kinds of ministries. In every age, there is the ministry of that age. These ministries of the ages are different from the local ministers. Luther was a minister of his age. Darby was also a minister of his age. In every age, the Lord has special things that He wants to accomplish. He has His own recoveries and His own works to do. The particular recovery and work that He is doing in one age is the ministry of that age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Forsaking the Past Ministries</H2><P>Jonathan stood between Saul and David. He was one man standing between two ministries. What he should have done was to follow the second ministry. However, because Jonathan's relationship with the first ministry was too deep, he could not disentangle himself from it. In order to catch up with the ministry of the age, there is the need for us to see the vision. Michal was married to David, yet she did not see anything. She only saw David's condition before God, and she could not tolerate it. As a result, she was left behind (2 Sam. 6:16, 20-23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>All Being a Matter of God's Mercy</H2><P>It is God's mercy that a person can see and come into contact with the ministry of that age. Yet, it is altogether a different thing for a man to take up the courage to forsake the past ministry. It is a precious thing to see, and it is a blessed thing to come into contact with something. Yet whether or not one can set aside his past ministry is entirely up to God's mercy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING THE CONTENT OF THE MINISTRY</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee asked: What is the relationship between the knowledge of life and the service?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Outward Man Being Broken,<br>and the Inward Life Being Released</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: The word knowledge cannot adequately describe the way we are taking. Whether or not a man's ministry can be released depends not only on whether such a one knows life, but whether his outward man is broken. The content of the ministry is fully a matter of the life within.</P><P>We have an outward man, and we have an inward man. Some people's outward man is broken, and their ministries are released. Many years ago, I gave a message on the Lord's Day morning entitled "Deep Calls unto Deep." A man who is not broken outwardly can only have "Shallow Calls unto Shallow."</P><P>Every one of the brothers from Kiangsu is an eloquent speaker. Yet, when a person touches them, he feels that there is something wrong. These brothers are like drops of oil on the water. They are shallow, and they do not have any depths. If you ask them to speak, they can speak with their clever minds for two hours. But after their speech, you cannot touch their spirit at all.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Outward Man Being Broken<br>for the Inward Man to Be Released</H2><P>What we need today is for the outward man to be broken. If the outward man is not broken, the inward man will not be released. Everything outward has to be broken. Only when that which is outward is broken can that which is inward be released. The earthen vessel has to be broken before the treasure can be released (2 Cor. 4:7). As long as the ointment is in the alabaster box, the fragrance will not be released. Only when the box is broken will the fragrance be released (John 12:3).</P><P>God deals with us daily through our environment. On the one hand, the Lord works in us. On the other hand, He makes arrangements in our environment. Strictly speaking, for a Christian there is no such thing as the environment; with him, there is only the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Every environment is a discipline of the Holy Spirit. The purpose of these disciplines is to break our outward man. Once a man's thoughts are broken, his inward man flows out. Once a man's emotions are broken, also his inward man flows out.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Release of our Inward Man<br>to Touch Others' Inward Man</H2><P>Never think that as long as you say the right thing and the proper words, you will be all right. There is another question: whether the words you say come from your outward man or your inward man. We can only blame the co-workers for the condition of the brothers in Kiangsu. A person whose outward man has not been broken may use the same terms and may speak the same thing; his words may even mean the same thing. Yet you cannot touch anything in the words he speaks. If we want to serve others, our outward man must be broken. Only when the outward man is broken can the inward man be released. Only when our inward man comes out can we touch others' inward man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Extent the Outward Man Is Broken<br>Determining the Amount of Ministry One Has</H2><P>A man who is capable of thinking and scheming, and who is clever in his mind, is not very useful in spiritual things. You may speak something with a smile, or you may speak the same thing with tears. The issue is not how you speak it; the issue is how much of your inward man is released. Today, the extent a man is broken determines the amount of ministry he has. We all have to be dealt with by the Lord in these matters. We love to meet some whose outward man is broken. Once you see such people, you touch their inward man. The purpose for which we are disciplined and restricted is that our outward man may be broken. A man can be talking about sad things on the platform, yet he himself does not feel sad at all. He can be talking about happy things, yet he himself does not feel any joy. This kind of person can only perform; he cannot preach. Some people are so hard in their outward man that whatever others say, they have no response. They are like the men at the time of John the Baptist, who would not dance when others played the flute and would not sing when others rejoiced (Matt. 11:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>No Short Cut</H2><P>The basis of a man's ministry is his knowledge before God. But whether or not the ministry can be released depends on whether or not the outward man is broken. When we began to learn to be a minister of the word, we learned to have the proper knowledge before God. However, the more we go on, the more we have to see that there can be no real ministry unless the outward man is broken. If the rubber tree is not cut, the sap will not flow out. It is impossible for a person who has no wound in him to have a ministry with him. There is no short cut. Some people still do not know even today what it means to utter something from his inward man.</P><P>Never forget that a man can only have a certain ministry if he is dealt with by the Lord. After a man has been dealt with, his spirit will be more pure. Whether or not a man's spirit can be released depends fully on whether or not he has been dealt with. At the same time, whether or not a man's spirit is clean depends on whether or not he has been dealt with. Once the outward man is broken, the inward man can be released, and a person's word will be able to reach others' hearts. Many people think that as long as a person can help others to become excited and can bring in an exciting atmosphere, everything will be all right. But those who have never been cut open in their outward man will not be of much use. The Christian service is based on brokenness. The degree of brokenness and the amount of wounding determine the amount that will be released.</P><P>How should a man speak in order that his spirit can be released? The only way for his spirit to be released is for his outward shell to be broken. Whether or not a man's outward shell is broken determines whether or not his inward spirit is released. If a man wants to have a spirit that can be used, his outward man must be smitten. At the time we are regenerated, the Lord comes into our spirit. At that time, our spirit is like the Holy of Holies; it is full of light and life. However, whether or not the Lord can be released depends on whether or not our outward man is broken. If the outward man is broken, no outward things will become hindrances to us any longer. On the contrary, they will all become outlets for the spirit to be released. If our mind and emotion are broken, they will no longer become the hindrance to the flow of life anymore. On the contrary, they will all become the channels for the inward man to be released. After a man has been broken, his mind and emotion will become the gateway for his inward man to go out. Every city in the world has only four gates. Only the New Jerusalem has twelve gates (Rev. 21:12). Whether Christ can be released from us depends on whether or not we have been broken.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Need for the Strongest Point to Be Broken</H2><P>The nose is the most conspicuous part of the human body. If a man bumps into the wall, the first thing that hits it is his nose. For many people, when they express themselves, the strongest and most obvious things that come across to others are their cleverness or their thoughts. In order for a person to serve the Lord, the strongest part of his outward man must be broken. Only then will his inward man be released. We cannot be Christians for so many years and yet still remain whole and unchanged.</P><P>You can say that you have not received great revelations before the Lord. But you cannot say that for all these years, you have not received the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The goal of the discipline of the Holy Spirit is for you to be a broken man. One day, when you receive God's mercy, you will be able to say that at last you understand what it is to be a broken man. By that time, you will realize how easy it is for your spirit to be released. In order for the inward man to be released, there is the need for severe dealings from the Lord. Those who have never been dealt with cannot afford the Lord a way to go on.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Mercy</H2><P>Every spiritual thing is received by men who are balanced and who are just right in everything. We can neither be too much nor too little. Those who are over-zealous in their pursuit will not receive anything. Neither will those who are lazy receive anything. When we ask, we have to ask in a proper measure; we cannot ask for nothing, and we cannot ask for too much. Sometimes when we ask more, it will be too much, and when we ask less, it will be too little. We need God's mercy. Spiritual growth does not depend on a person's running. But then, those who do not run will not receive anything either. If God grants you mercy, you will run according to just the right measure. For this reason, everyone has to commit himself to the God of all mercies (Rom. 9:16). If we do this, we will become just right in everything.</P><P>Today we can only say that we are those who have experienced God's mercy. Spiritual growth is something that is totally beyond man's power to control. God has to put us in a place of total inability and total helplessness before He can have a way in us. If the Lord is merciful to us, we will get through. If the Lord is not merciful to us, we can do nothing. Many people receive frequent chastisements, yet their outward man is not broken at all. In order to become a minister, the only way is for us to look to God's mercy. No one can be in haste in this matter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Having a Deeper Knowledge of the Lord's Life<br>through the Lord's Dealings</H2><P>Brother Yu Cheng-hwa asked: Can we say that the content of the ministry is our knowledge of life?</P><P>Brother Nee answered: We know the Lord by learning the lessons through His dealings and His smitings. When our outward man is broken, we will begin to know the Lord. A man knows the Lord through the process of being smitten. When we are smitten by the Lord day by day, our knowledge of the Lord will increase day by day, and we will see how His life replaces our life. This is not an increase in life, but an increase in knowledge. We have this life already. But through the Lord's dealings, we will gain a deeper knowledge of this life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Passing through the Dealings<br>to Know the Riches of the Lord's Life</H2><P>The life that all the believers receive is a rich life. Yet we do not realize how rich this life is. It is only when our outward shell is broken that we realize how rich the Lord's life is, and how it can achieve things that we cannot achieve.</P><P>During the war in Europe, one man was hit by forty-seven bullets. Yet he still lived. A man's body can take in as many as forty-seven bullets and yet still be alive. Some people are very healthy, and their bodies have never been cut once. These people have not yet found out the amount of abuse the body can endure. The riches of the Lord's life are beyond any of our imaginations. Hence, no one should feel sad about the trials that come upon him. Trials are there not only to test a man's faith; the purpose of these trials is for the Lord's life to be expressed. God measures to us all kinds of circumstances and environments in order that we will receive the benefit of knowing Him. Only those who have passed through the dealings will know God, and only those who know God will be able to serve Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Paying a High Price for the Lord to Have a Way</H2><P>Today, our outward man has to be broken before the inward man can be built up. We have to consecrate ourselves in a desperate way to the Lord before He will bring us through. If we do not put ourselves in His hand in a desperate way, the Lord will do nothing. There was once a sister who had an argument with her family, and she threatened to kill herself. She told everyone that she was going to jump into the river. The family followed her to the edge of the water. But when they saw her carefully holding up her skirts, they realized that she was not going to kill herself. Today, unless we are reckless in giving up everything, we will not have a way to go on. If a man worries about this and that, and if he always makes sure that he is not too much, and if he is always careful and afraid, he will not be able to go on. A man has to learn to pay the price in a desperate way. If we want to be a Christian, we have to be one in a desperate and thorough way. Today is the end time. We need desperate people. Otherwise, there will be no spiritual future for us. It is difficult for those who go halfway and who are reluctant and unwilling at heart to go on. Among us, we need to have some desperate ones to rise up. Only then will the Lord have a way.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVENTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>REPORT ON THE WORK</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (26)</H1><P>Date:7:00 p.m., Saturday, May 1, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PUTTING THE JERUSALEM PRINCIPLE<br>INTO PRACTICE</H2><P>It is a little too early for the co-workers to take the way of Antioch today. The principle of Antioch that we practiced before begins from Acts 13. In practice, we have omitted chapters one to twelve; we have skipped the line of Jerusalem. Man thinks that the work of spreading the gospel from Jerusalem through Judea, Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth is done by the twelve apostles. But God's word says that the apostles remained in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1). Jerusalem was the place where Peter worked, and Samaria was the place where Philip worked. When Philip reached Samaria, he gained the Samaritans. The Lord did say that the gospel is to be preached to the uttermost part of the earth. But He did not say that the same group of people will be doing this. Those who went to Samaria were one group, and those who go to the uttermost part of the earth are another group. When the apostles gained men in Jerusalem, they sent them out to Samaria. From Samaria, the gospel passes through other hands until it reaches the uttermost part of the world. In the past, we were too early in putting into practice the principle of Antioch. Now is not the time to practice the principle of Antioch. Now is the time to practice the principle of Jerusalem.</P><P>Although we cannot say that we are absolutely clear today, when the few responsible brothers came together, we felt that we should begin our work from the coastal regions. From now until August can be considered as one phase of our work. During this phase, all the workers in the whole nation will consolidate in Foochow and Shanghai. Brother Witness Lee will take up the responsibility in Shanghai, and Brother Chen Keh-san will take up the responsibility in Foochow.</P><P>In addition, we need to have training meetings. After August, the work will concentrate on three areas: Tientsin, Tsingtao, and Canton. We will leave Hong Kong, Swatow, and Peking alone for the time being. We will initially establish a firm footing in the first three places. Tientsin is linked to Manchuria on the one hand, and to the Northwest on the other hand. Tsingtao will be particularly important to the Chiao-chi railway line. Today, the largest number of believers are in Fukien. Next to it is Shantung. From Tsingtao, we can gain the whole province of Shantung. We hope to commit the whole area to the brothers in Tsingtao. The responsibility of the brothers in Shanghai is toward the west, in cities like Hankow and Chungking. The direction in Fukien is also toward the west. At the same time, Fukien should take care of Taiwan. The work in the provinces of Kwangtung and Kwangsi should begin from Canton. In the future, when Southeast Asia rises up, Hong Kong should also have a start. At present we cannot see that far. The gospel work is done in portions. The relay race is a very good illustration. One man takes one portion, and the next man takes another portion. This is like the students of Chiao-tung University who ran from Nanking to Shanghai; every one of them ran a portion of the whole journey.</P><P>We admit that the principle of Antioch is still very necessary in the future, but the way we should take at present is the way of Jerusalem. The work is developed through the fruit gained in Jerusalem, and not through the going out of the workers. Every believer should have his living centered on the gospel, and his work, occupation, dwelling, and livelihood should all be for the gospel. The church should continually send out more people. After we finish the building of the meeting hall, in a month or so, it will not be difficult to see the number double. It is even possible to triple or quadruple our number in one year.</P><P>Our failure during the past years has been due to the absence of the vision of the Jerusalem principle. From 1937 we have been practicing the principle of Antioch. But it is not until today, in 1948, that we begin to go back to the principle of Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PERFECTING THE BELIEVERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Conducting Trainings<br>to Produce Standard Christians</H2><P>We have to say something about the training in Foochow. Our work in the past had certain problems; we did not produce "standard" Christians. Among us, those who were saved during certain years bear certain kinds of resemblances. Those who were saved during certain other years bear certain other kinds of resemblances. Their resemblance is based on our knowledge of the truth during that period of time.</P><P>In addition, there are certain problems with the brothers who are speaking for the Lord; none of them want to say the same thing twice. In this way, some brothers and sisters have been Christians for over eight or ten years, yet they still do not know the basic truths. They think that such and such a chapel is just the same as Wen-teh Li [the meeting place of the church in Shanghai]. They do not even recognize our own name! A Christian acts according to the principle of constitution. Hospitals, schools, and orphanages can be built at will. But a nation cannot be formed at will; it must have its ground and its constitution. Likewise, the church also has its ground and its constitution. We have not given the brothers and sisters the proper education. As a result, once they encounter some problems, or they are questioned by those in the denominations, they do not know how to give an answer, and they end up thinking that our responsible brothers are at odds with others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Having Basic Lessons,<br>and Receiving the Same Teachings</H2><P>There are many basic lessons that we have to pass on to the saints. Those who have been saved in recent years may be clear concerning salvation. But they are not clear concerning the gospel. Our understanding of subjects such as the gospel, the law, death, sin, righteousness, and grace is different from that of others. We have fought the battle over these truths already. These are the inheritance of the church, and we cannot lose them. For the brothers and sisters, we may have to prepare fifty or more lessons. We have to educate the brothers and sisters with these lessons. I hope that many brothers and sisters among us will receive the same teachings.</P><P>In addition to these lessons, there are other basic lessons. For example, we should know how to make recompense, what to do when a person is caused to stumble, how to receive answers to prayers, how to study the Bible, what kind of attitude a Christian should take toward money, and how to choose an occupation. In these matters, the co-workers must first be trained, and then they can communicate these matters to others. These truths must be something living in us before they can be communicated to others in a living way. This is what I mean by the relay race.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Workers Having to Be Living<br>and Having to Be Full of Life</H2><P>We have divided the whole of Shanghai into thirteen districts, and we have started the perfecting meetings in every district. Every Friday, we conduct some perfecting meetings. Each week of the fifty-two weeks of the year, we speak on one subject. In one year's time, we return to the first subject. We do not change these subjects. Although the responsible ones do not take the roll, they should know who is there and who is not there. Suppose you are saved in the twentieth week. You will join the others in the perfecting meetings right away. By the nineteenth week of the following year, you will have completed one cycle. In doing this work, every worker must be living before the Lord and must be full of life. Otherwise, the truth will become something dead with him. If it becomes dead, we will end up with another Common Prayer Book. We do not wish to see this. Although the subjects may be the same, the life can be different, and the power can be different. By summer of this year, over thirty of our co-workers will have to be trained in this matter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECOVERING THE LITERATURE WORK</H2><P>We also need a full recovery in our literature work. There are four magazines that need to be recovered. The first is The Christian, and we ask Brother Witness Lee to be responsible for it. The second is The Present Testimony, and we ask Brother Yu Cheng-hwa to be responsible for it. The third is The Glad Tidings, and we ask Brother Stephen Kaung to be responsible for it. The fourth is The Open Door, and I myself will be responsible for it. In addition, we need some gospel tracts, and we will ask Brother Chang Yu-chi to be responsible for them. There is urgent need in the publication of books, and the cost will run up to a few hundred millions or even a billion dollars.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</H2><P>We expect to see the whole church rising up to preach the gospel, and all the brothers and sisters serving God together, rather than three or five people serving by themselves. The works that the church has to do are, first, the preaching of the gospel, which should not be the responsibility of those who are giving the messages only. The second is the gospel visitation, which is conducted in the homes. The third is the visitation of the new believers. The fourth is the perfecting of the new believers, and the fifth is the care for the poor.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Preaching the Gospel</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Mobilizing All the Brothers and Sisters</H2><P>The first kind of service is the preaching of the gospel. The brothers responsible for the preaching of the gospel should promote the gospel work in all the districts, schools, and in all the other places. These few brothers should not just be responsible for the preaching itself but should be responsible for mobilizing others to preach the gospel. Whether or not our work can be successful depends not only on how well the responsible brothers themselves are serving, but on how much the other brothers and sisters are serving. Today in Christianity, there are no priests; there are only pastors. But among us, we have to put all the one-talented ones to use. When all the one-talented ones rise up, we will have the church. If you replace their functions, you are wrong. The right thing to do is to help them along in their work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Not Being Negligent,<br>and Not Being Covetous for Gains</H2><P>At the same time, if you are a person who is not serious, and who is loose and irresponsible, you cannot serve God. Today, we cannot serve God in a careless or negligent way. I am not hired by the church; I am not receiving the church's salary. I am not a hireling. I am here to serve God. As such, I cannot be negligent. Others may have to sleep on the floor in order to get their work done. I have to be more desperate than they are; I have to sleep under the floor. If a man cannot be negligent in serving the earthly things, how much more must he not be negligent in serving God? We are not here for money. To serve the Lord, we cannot ask anyone for anything, not even a bowl of rice. We serve because we love the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Everyone Participating</H2><P>Every week we should have a gospel meeting, and every brother and sister should go and invite people to come to this meeting. This should be the responsibility of all the members. Never allow the brothers and sisters to develop the habit of asking what the meeting that night is about. If it is going to be a gospel meeting, do not let them say, "All right. I will go home and sleep." You have to say to such brothers, "No. Now that you realize that it is a gospel meeting, you have to rise up immediately, because you have a part in this meeting."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Gospel Visitation<br>and Visitation of the New Believers</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Being Baptized as soon as One Is Saved</H2><P>The responsibility of visiting the new believers is quite heavy. If the church assigns a certain brother to visit someone, this brother should take along with him the one who introduced that new one to the church. As soon as a person is saved, he should be baptized right away. Many people were quite alive when they first believed, but after waiting for a while to be baptized, they became dead. As soon as a person believes, he should be baptized. If he is baptized, and if something happens later, he will not feel so free to deny his faith any longer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Whole Church Working,<br>Bringing Increase in Quantity and Quality</H2><P>In arranging the visitation, we should divide up the city into districts according to the map. Once the time is ripe, and there is a certain number of ones desiring to be baptized, we should baptize them. If we do this, in a short time, we will double our investments. No other period of time affords as much opportunity as today for the work to go on. If the whole church rises up, there will be no place to hold the blessings. In Foochow, within one to two months, a thousand people were saved. When the whole church is involved in this kind of work, everyone who comes into the church will be up to the proper standard. Everyone who is born this way will be an eight-to nine-pound baby, and no one will be a twelve-ounce baby that has to be kept in an incubator.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Teaching Others to Serve God<br>Properly and Conscientiously</H2><P>Here I have to speak a frank word to you. You have to speak honest words to others. In the past, a certain person may have been loose, and you may have let it go. But you cannot do that any longer. If a person does not do his job, you cannot let him go; you have to compel him to work. After he has agreed to work, you still have to tell him, "Why are you so loose? Why would you not be careful in taking care of the things of God? You need to learn. Who told you to hand over yourself to be a child of God in the first place? But now, and as long as you are His child, you have to serve, and you have to serve in a conscientious way."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Perfecting of the New Believers</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Conducting the New Believers' Meetings<br>by Districts</H2><P>We have to conduct the new believers' meetings in the districts. The reason for this is that many live too far away and cannot otherwise attend this kind of meeting. At present, we have considered everyone a new believer, and we are giving make-up lessons to all of them. Among the brothers, we have selected twenty brothers to do the teaching work in the thirteen districts. The subjects covered in the thirteen districts are the same, and their contents are the same. This meeting is set up specifically for the perfecting of the new believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Those Who Are Absent<br>Needing to Receive Make-up Lessons</H2><P>The ones who are responsible for visiting the new believers should go out on Friday evening to give make-up lessons to those who were absent the previous week. In giving the make-up lessons, you have to do a detailed job. In this way, whether or not a person comes to the meeting, he will receive the same teachings. For example, Brother Cheng may give a message here for two hours with sweat all over him. After he finishes his message, he still has to go to the home of a brother who is absent from the meeting to give him a make-up lesson. Someone besides that other brother may say, "Look, Brother Cheng has put in so much effort to give his message already. Now when others do not come to the meeting, he still has to spend time to give make-up lessons." By saying this, the one who has been absent from the meeting will say, "That is right. Next time I think I have to come to the meeting."</P><P>This kind of work is most definite and fine. Everywhere you go, you will find out right away the things that are wrong with that place, and right away you will be able to make up the lack. If we practice this, our work will not be as confused and uncoordinated as it is today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Caring for the Poor</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Caring for the Poor<br>Being the Lord's Commandment</H2><P>Among us there are three kinds of people. The first is the sinners, the second is the new believers, and the third is the poor people. The church is never free from having a relationship with the poor people. If anyone feels happy about offering money to the Lord, while unhappy to give money to the poor, he is wrong. It is wrong to leave the ointment in the alabaster box; we should offer it up to the Lord. It is right for us to take care of the Lord and His work first. But after the alabaster box is poured out, the Bible tells us to sell everything we have and give it to the poor. Caring for the poor is also a commandment of the Lord (Luke 12:33).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Caring for the Poor Being a Practice<br>of the Church in the Time of a Revival</H2><P>In church history, we see that whenever there was a revival, there was the practice of caring for the poor. Strictly speaking, it is a small thing for a poor person to eat more or eat less, to have more clothing or less clothing. But it is a serious thing for a Christian to become narrow in his heart. If you want to spend all your money and do not want it to become a hindrance to you, the way is very simple; all you have to do is to catch the time of a church revival and go to the Lord and offer up all you have. If you do this, your money will not become your hindrance any longer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Caring for the Poor<br>Being Also the Normal Work of the Church</H2><P>Caring for the poor is not just the work of the church at the time of a revival; it is also a normal work of the church. It is part of a Christian's daily life. We hope that the brothers and sisters would go home and bring back what you have to the church. We want everything, new and old. We have brothers and sisters who can wash, sew, and mend these things, and who can distribute them. Every time the church receives some money from the offering box, it should set aside a certain amount for the poor. We need one brother and one sister who are designated for this relief work. It is good if some can give good messages. But if you cannot give a good message, it is equally good if you can give away your belongings.</P><P>We have to learn to be those who are led away to the lowly. If the ones who receive our help are saved, that is an additional blessing. But even if they are not saved, you will still receive the benefit. All the things in the brothers' and sisters' homes that they do not need should be sent away to the church. If your house is cleared of all these things, you may end up having fewer burdens to bear. Some people may have their backs bent over by the burden of these things already.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ARRANGEMENT OF PERSONNEL</H2><P>We need to make some announcements concerning the arrangement of personnel. First, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the gospel work...Second, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the gospel visitation work...Third, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the new believers' meetings... Fourth, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the visitation of the new believers....Fifth, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of caring for the poor...If there are other arrangements, we will notify the brothers and sisters through printed circular letters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OTHER MATTERS</H2><P>We still have some announcements to make concerning other matters. For those brothers who are holding jobs and for those students who are still in school, we ask that they would not drop their present occupation. When you receive some light from the Lord, we hope that you will make adjustments according to the light you receive.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE OFFERING OF MATERIAL RICHES</H2><P>Concerning money, we need to make some public announcements. If we preach the gospel well, and if all the brothers and sisters are coordinated together, our homes, our occupation, and our money will all be for the gospel. The responsible brothers will help the saints to make proper arrangements for the possessions that they have handed over. Some money should be retained for one's own use, while other money should circulate. We hope that we will not need to spend too much time to ask how the brothers and sisters spend their money. In this matter, much of the responsibility rests with the individuals. The church does not want to touch this matter too much. If the brothers and sisters are too much off the mark, some should remind them a little about the proper way. The kind of living each one maintains before the Lord should be determined by each person's own standard. The church cannot make such a decision for the brothers and sisters.</P><P>Concerning the offering of material riches, we hope that part of what the brothers and sisters put into the offering box will be used for local expenses and part for the caring for the poor. In addition, the brothers and sisters have to learn to follow the Lord's guidance in giving personal gifts to individuals. The money that is set aside for the work can be dropped into the offering box that is set apart for the work. If everyone gives up all his excess, those who gather much will not have excess, and those who gather little will not have want.</P><P>We expect every worker to exercise faith before the Lord. We do not want to distribute to the co-workers the money that is designated for the work, thus making the work suffer through the lack of money. On the other hand, we do not want to see any excess in money, and we do not want to see the work falling behind the supply. We hope to see the work and money going up in proportion to one another. At any rate, we hope that the brothers and sisters will do their best to be frugal. We hope that no one will try to save up his money for future use. Every time we receive some income, we have to give, and we should not worry about our future.</P><P>At present, the fund for the work in Shanghai is under the management of Brother Witness Lee and Brother Tang Shou-ling. The fund for the work in Foochow is under the management of Brother Chen Keh-shan and Chan Si-wen. In all other places, we will not receive money for the work. For example, if the brothers in Chefoo or Tsingtao want to offer something for the work, they should send it to either of the two places we mentioned.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING THE RECEIVING OF CO-WORKERS&#151;<br>THE NEED FOR LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION</H2><P>There is one thing we would like the saints from out of town to pay attention to: You have been receiving and acknowledging co-workers on our behalf for a long time. This practice gives us a lot of trouble. If someone comes to your place to work, please ask him to show you the letter of recommendation from us. In the past, you have acknowledged some co-workers whom we find it hard to acknowledge. In the New Testament, Paul also mentioned the matter of a recommendation letter (2 Cor. 3:1-3). Today, not only is there the need for recommendations in matters related to the church; there is the need for recommendations in matters related to the work as well. If a letter only recommends a certain person as a brother, you have to treat him as a brother. If he is also a co-worker, there should be a separate recommendation letter to recommend him as a co-worker.</P><P>May the Lord cause all of us to do our best to stand firm in our own position. Whether a person is making money or is engaged in spiritual services, he should offer up everything he has. We hope that we will do a proper job before the Lord in all these matters, and we hope that we will see God's blessings.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVENTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ZACCHEUS' SALVATION</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LORD'S DAY MORNING GOSPEL MESSAGE (4)</H1><p>Date:10:00 a.m., The Lord's Day, May 2, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Brother Chang Yu-tze conducted the singing, Brother Witness Lee gave the message.</p><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Luke 19:1-10</H1><P>Gospel Song:</P><ol class="decimal"><li>Hear the voice of love, O sinner,<br>'Tis the Savior's cry.<br>While He's seeking for the sinners,<br>Do not pass Him by!<br>Sinner, sinner, hear the Savior's cry,<br>While He's seeking for the sinners,<br>Do not pass Him by!<br><br></li><li>Do not pass me by, O Savior,<br>Hear my earnest cry,<br>While the others You are calling,<br>Do not pass me by!<br>Savior, Savior, hear my earnest cry,<br>While the others You are calling,<br>Do not pass me by!</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JESUS COMING INTO JERICHO&#151;<br>THE PLACE OF A CURSE</H2><P>"And He entered...Jericho" (Luke 19:1). These words seem simple. But all those who understand the Bible know that these words are actually not so simple. Here is a person called Jesus, and a city called Jericho. Both words begin with "Je-." The Bible is not an ordinary book. It is a book of classics, and every word in it is full of meaning.</P><P>Who is Jesus? Jesus is not a common person. If you enter Jericho, there is nothing special about what you are doing. But Jesus is an extraordinary person. His entry into Jericho was also very special. Because He was a special person, Jericho became a special place. All the names of places in the Bible have their spiritual significance. Egypt signifies the flesh, Babylon signifies corruption, and Jericho signifies the place of a curse, which is the world. Jericho is a place of a curse, but Jesus came to Jericho. He came to the place of a curse. Is this world a comfortable place? When we were born, each one of us looked wonderful. But by the age of twenty, we do not look wonderful any longer. By the age of thirty, we look worse. When we are old, we eventually lose our breath, and we die and rot away.</P><P>This world is indeed a place of a curse. A flower looks beautiful in the morning, but by the next day it is gone. A house lasts at most for a few dozen years, and it will go into decay. Everything in the world eventually goes into decay and corruption. In addition, there are problems such as famines, wars, pestilences, unemployment, sickness, old age, death, and so forth. Although man can sit in a sofa chair and sleep in a soft bed, and although he can enjoy comfort outside, he has no comfort within. He can neither sit nor sleep in peace. Some people can never put their hearts to rest; they are afraid of death all the time. Only those who put their hearts in the Savior will find peace. You can do your best to dress yourself up, but you cannot do that for over fifty years. In the end, you will still go into the coffin. Some people wish that the sun would not move and that the earth would stand still, so that they could remain young. But when they wake up in the morning and look into the mirror, they cannot help but find more gray hairs and wrinkles. This is the world today. It is a picture of a place of a curse.</P><P>You are one who lives in Jericho. What about the Lord Jesus? He is the One who "entered" Jericho. He did not originate from Jericho; He "entered" it. He came to Jericho from heaven. Hallelujah! He came from heaven to earth. He came from heaven to the place of a curse, the city of Jericho.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>"WAS PASSING THROUGH"&#151;<br>JESUS COMING TO THE SINNERS</H2><P>Verse 1 says, "And He...was passing through Jericho." The words "passing through" are excellent. The Lord Jesus passed through Judea. He passed through Europe, Asia, Shanghai, and Wen-teh Li. Today, His Spirit is here. His name is here. We who believe in Him are also here. If you feel something moving within you, it means that He has come to you. Verse 1 says, "...was passing through." Here is a question of time. He was passing through. It does not say that He had passed through, or that He will pass through, but that He was then passing through.</P><P>There was a man whose name was Zaccheus. Perhaps you are that man. This man Zaccheus was a government officer. Yet he was not a clean officer, but a corrupt officer. He was a chief tax-collector. He was also a rich man. His social standing was not a noble one, for he was a chief tax-collector involved in extortion and bribery. Today, some people's educational standings are not noble, for they only graduated from high school, yet they have received a college diploma through unrighteous means. These diplomas are not clean. Is your house clean? Is your social standing clean? Moreover, are you clean with respect to your marriage? How is your marriage life? If our lives were being investigated, none of us would be found noble. No one would be found clean, and no one would be found moral.</P><P>In this cursed city, there were not very many moral people. To say that there were not very many is too nice. Actually there were none. Where there are rich men, there is sin. Where there is money, there is sin. If you have not sinned, where did your money come from? This man made a lot of money, but spent very little. He might even be receiving money without spending anything at all. He was a traitor among the Jews. He would not sacrifice one single hair of his for others. He made himself rich through the power of Rome. If a man is not mean, he cannot be a rich man. All rich people are mean people. While others may be dying of hunger, they still hold tightly to their purse strings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>"SEEKING TO SEE JESUS"&#151;<br>ALL THOSE COMING TO HIM AND<br>CALLING ON HIM BEING SAVED</H2><P>Zaccheus was a small man. He was not tall. He was short, both morally and physically as well. He was afraid of seeing many things, but he was not afraid of seeing Jesus. When I was between twenty and twenty-one years old, I traveled once to Tsingtao. On the boat, some people were playing with a Ouija board. I wanted to take a look at it. But the people were afraid that I was a Christian and would not allow me to see it. Our Lord Jesus, however, is not afraid of being seen. He likes to be seen. He will not hide Himself away from anyone who comes to Him. If a man would come and see Jesus, His love, grace, and blessing will come to such a one.</P><P>In Peking, there was an old man who once said that Jesus was not as good as Buddha. Later we had a gospel meeting, and his relatives brought him to the meeting. After the meeting, the preacher prayed for the sick ones. Those who could not sit down were able to sit down after the preacher prayed, and those who could not stand were able to stand. This old man prayed to the Lord in his heart, "Although I am sick, I do not ask You to heal my sickness. I only ask You to forgive my sins." When he prayed this way, he was saved. After the meeting, he was walking on the street, and he heard traveling troupes singing. It was his favorite pastime. But that day when he heard that sound, he did not feel that his heart was drawn to it any longer. Later he began meeting with the brothers and sisters.</P><P>Zaccheus saw Jesus. Jesus was surrounded by many people, but Zaccheus was still able to see Him. Today, many people see only the backslidden Christians and those who do not have a proper testimony. They do not see Jesus. These people have been hindered by the surroundings.</P><P>Zaccheus was a dwarf. Today there are many dwarfs. If you cannot understand the Bible, it means that your spirit is dwarfed. Many people are spiritually deaf; they cannot hear God's voice. Today, Jesus is here, yet you do not see Him, because your spirit is dead. The crowd who thronged around Him could not see Jesus. If you want to see Jesus, you have to "run on ahead." You have to call on Him by yourself. The first thing Zaccheus did was to run, and the second thing he did was to climb. The meaning of climbing is to overcome the difficulties in the circumstances and the natural environment. A Man called Jesus was there. Zaccheus had never seen Jesus before. If he had seen Him before, he would not have needed to see Him. Actually, if he wanted to know who Jesus was, he could just shout, "Who is Jesus? Please lift up your head." But strange to say, he did not call. On the contrary, Jesus lifted up His head and called to him, "Zaccheus!" Zaccheus was bewildered. How could this stranger know him? How Zaccheus was touched! The Lord Jesus said, "Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house" (Luke 19:5).</P><P>How could the Lord say this? It is because He is God. He knows everything. No one who is willing to see Jesus will miss Him. If you see your own sins, and if you know that the Lord can deliver you out of your sins, and you call on Him, He will surely save you. If you come to Jesus, and if you behold Him and call on Him, you will surely meet Him within you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WELCOMING JESUS&#151;RECEIVING THE SAVIOR<br>AS THE DYNAMIC SALVATION</H2><P>This man wanted to see Jesus. In the end he was seen by Jesus. Right after he was seen by Jesus, he received Him. In order to believe in the Lord, the first thing we have to do is to see the Lord, and the second thing we have to do is to receive Him. Jesus wants to live in your heart. If you come to see Him, and if you receive Him, He will come and live in your heart.</P><P>Zaccheus was saved, and he had a great change. Formerly he would not sacrifice even one hair for others, and he was an extortioner. Now he gave half of his possessions to the poor, and he gave back four times as much to those from whom he had taken away something by false accusations. Jesus is the Savior. When He comes into you, you will be saved, and you will be delivered from your sins. If you do not have the Lord Jesus yet, you need to be saved today. The Lord Jesus can deliver you from your sins.</P><P>Everyone knows that money is good. Even those who do not have money know that money is good. But those who have money can tell you that money can eat you up. If you have five gold bars at home, they will take away your sleep. Some people hang themselves just because they have lost one out of five gold bars. If you seek after education, education may end up hurting you; you may contract tuberculosis while you are seeking after education. If you pursue marriage, marriage may end up hurting you. Whatever you seek after and whatever you gain will eventually put you in bondage and will even harm you.</P><P>But today Jesus is here. When Jesus comes, we will be delivered from everything. I became a Christian at the age of twenty. Once I believed in Him, it was like my whole being was uplifted to the clouds. Jesus will give you the power to be unshackled from all that you could not be unshackled from. Once Jesus comes in, all the burdens go away.</P><P>Now we would ask all the friends who would like to believe in the Lord to stand up.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVENTY-TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>REPORT ON THE WORK</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (27)</H1><P>Date:3:00 p.m., The Lord's Day, May 2, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ARRANGEMENTS CONCERNING<br>THE FUTURE OF THE CO-WORKERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Understanding the Meaning of Handing Over Oneself, and Having the Reality of It</H2><P>Brother Nee: Last night there was one thing that we did not announce, which is the arrangements concerning the future of the co-workers.</P><P>I hope that there is no misunderstanding among us concerning the purpose of handing over ourselves. We have to see that we are all priests before God (1 Pet. 2:5). Both Exodus 19 and Romans 12 tell us that everyone is a servant before God. At the same time, we see that service is not an individual matter, but a corporate matter. This is the reason we ask all the brothers and sisters to hand over themselves. Actually, there should be no need to speak about this matter. As soon as a person believes in the Lord, he is a priest. Originally, many things could be said directly after a person believed. However, due to the captivity of the church into Babylon, degradation came in, and there was the need for a recovery. Today, the church is indeed the community of saved ones. But it is not yet the community of serving ones. If God's children do not serve, the church will merely become a "club house" of saved ones,a place where saved ones come together to sing, preach, and meet. This is to change the basic nature of the church.</P><P>Because the church has become fallen, all the brothers and sisters become free to do whatever they like and to express whatever opinion they have. As a result, many things become optional, and some become lawful. On the one hand, no one likes to meddle with others' affairs. On the other hand, we do not like others to meddle with our affairs. For this reason, among God's children some barriers develop. But God's word says that the church is the institution where men serve God. It is the place where God's children work and labor together in one accord. The church as seen from God's word is very different from the church of today. In God's word, every person, matter, and event are for serving God.</P><P>In the future, we will have to bring everyone up to this standard. Many people who have become Christians today do not know what it means to serve God. But in the future, we will not have to tell the saved ones to hand over themselves; by that time, they will not be able to be a Christian if they do not hand over themselves the first day. If a man does not forsake everything, he will not be able to step into the door. Those who do not forsake everything to follow the Lord cannot be His disciples (Matt. 10:37-38). Outwardly speaking, it seems difficult for a man to forsake everything. But inwardly speaking, this is something that brings us joy. A man must be brought to a point where he is willing to give up everything. Only then will he be able to follow a straight course. Today, when we ask you to consecrate, we have to persuade you to do it. But in the future, we will not need to persuade anyone. A man will either drop the world completely, or he will not be able to be baptized at all. Either you do not come, or you come in an absolute way. Some people have said that the term "handing over" is wrong. We are not arguing about terminologies today. You can call it whatever you like. What matters is the reality. In the past, men thought that serving God was a matter of personal choice. They thought that to be zealous or not was one's own business, and to serve or not was also one's own business. But now this is changed around. If there is the coordination, and you are in trouble, other brothers and sisters beside you will not let you fall. In this way, the church interferes with as well as supports every individual. Many people will be there watching over you as well as helping you and protecting you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Everything Done<br>in the Fellowship of the Church<br>and for the Benefit of the Gospel</H2><P>The brothers and sisters should know that their future, their jobs, occupations, dwellings, businesses, possessions, and everything that forms a part of their living should be put in the fellowship of the church. Formerly, one could make decisions on his own. Now, if he is to take the service of God as his center, everyone has to take one great step forward. From now on, no one can make his own decisions or do things his own way. Many enterprises and occupations do not render much help to the gospel. The responsible brothers will ask you to change these occupations. What we do must be of maximum benefit to the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING MONEY</H2><P>Concerning money, we have the following fellowship. In the coming days, many brothers and sisters will have to leave their jobs. In Shanghai, we have asked two sisters and two brothers to do this. Brother Hsia Hsi-ling has been working in the customs department for many years. We are asking him to leave that job. In addition, perhaps twenty to thirty brothers and sisters will also have to hand themselves over. Perhaps we will need fifty or sixty brothers and sisters to do that. If they give up their jobs and offer up themselves full-time, their support will be on the shoulders of you brothers who are holding jobs. During the past twenty years, we have not mentioned the matter of money. This platform can testify for me concerning this. But today, we are going into business as partners and preaching the gospel as partners. For this reason, the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should work conscientiously, and they should do their best to make money as well as to save money.</P><P>Today we stand on a different ground, and that is why we are not afraid to say something and do something. Today I can pass around my hat to ask money for a brother. If some have misunderstood what we have said and are no longer willing to offer up everything, you can claim back your consecration slip from Brother Witness after the meeting. There is no need to be shy and no need to be ashamed. We do not force anyone to do anything. But when the brothers come together to discuss matters, and when a decision has been reached, you cannot draw back. Today, we are not asking you to save money to such an extent that you will suffer in your physical health. We are not asking for one-tenth, or one-half, or one-hundredth. We are asking you to offer up all you have besides what you need to spend. If you make ten million dollars a month, and you need all ten million, you do not have to offer a cent. If you make only eight million, the church will gladly give up two million to make up enough to meet your need. But if you make eleven million, you can only keep the ten million that you need, and you have to offer up the remaining one million. If you make a hundred million, then the ninety million will all have to be offered up. If you do not do this, you owe these brothers who are giving up their jobs something. We have to learn to bear the responsibility of the gospel together with the brothers. Only by doing this will the gospel spread, and only then will we be able to go on in the way before us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FOUR THINGS CONCERNING THE WORK</H2><P>Concerning the future of the work, there are a few things that we have to pay attention to. In order for God's work in China to be carried out properly, four things are indispensable. The first is that strong messages need to be delivered in the local meetings. The second is that the literature work needs to spread. The third is the need to perfect the young people. The fourth is the need for joint conferences everywhere yearly. If any of these four things are lacking, our work will not be covered adequately. Shanghai and Foochow should maintain very strong message meetings. In this way, when a person wants to be perfected, he has to come to the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED FOR SUITABLE MEETING HALLS<br>IN DIFFERENT PLACES</H2><P>Furthermore, we need suitable meeting halls. Brother Miao said that he has been to many places and that nowhere is the meeting hall as bad as the one here in Shanghai. In the winter it is cold, and in the summer it is hot. When someone gives a message, the audience is spread out over seven or eight different places; the listeners cannot see the speaker, and in some places they cannot even hear the speaking. We have to build a meeting hall that can seat three thousand right from the start and that can hold another two thousand if we add another level to it later. In total, we need a place that can seat five thousand.</P><P>Many people have been stirred up in Nanking already. Hence, Nanking also needs a meeting hall. In addition, we have to consider how to maintain a strong message meeting in Nanking.</P><P>Foochow also needs a meeting hall. At present, the meeting hall in Foochow is very hot in summer, and the windows are on the roof. What the brothers and sisters have offered up in these days is not enough to take care of these three meeting halls alone.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED FOR THE PUBLICATION OF THE MAGAZINES</H2><P>Before the war, we published on an average eighteen thousand copies of The Christian every issue. At its peak, we were publishing twenty-one thousand copies. The publication of one magazine alone requires seven hundred million dollars. This is only one magazine. There are three other kinds of magazines. Do not think that it is a simple thing to put out a magazine. As far as an individual is concerned, it is an embarrassing thing to ask for money. But here we are not afraid of misunderstanding. Every month, we need a lot of money.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED OF THE TRAINING WITH THE HOSPITALITY</H2><P>One other thing needs to be mentioned. Among us, some want to serve the Lord, but there is no place where they can receive any training. This is a shameful thing. In two places, brothers wanted to learn to serve the Lord and were sent to seminaries. At present, the brothers in all the places can surely learn something in their own church regarding how to take care of affairs and how to participate in the work. However, at the same time, they need some specific trainings. At present, we have two hundred mous [Chinese acre] of land in Kuling. There are some houses there, but the preparation work is only half complete; there are still many things that are not yet ready. This time when we had a few dozen co-workers meeting there, the hospitality became a problem. Some had to sleep in the hospital nearby like patients on hospital beds, because the hospitality was not adequate. This is too poor. We have to consolidate the hospitality before we can meet the need.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GRASPING THE BEST OPPORTUNITY<br>TO OFFER UP EVERYTHING FOR THE GOSPEL</H2><P>Today, we have to offer up all our time for the gospel. Once I was at a meeting, and I asked the attendants if there were over fifty young people among them. I discovered that all of them were above middle-age and I could not go on with what I was going to say. Today, if we have six hundred young people raised up among us, we will be busy all day long. Hence, we are short of people. At the same time, we need a few hundred or even a few thousand brothers who are holding jobs to provide the support. If we do not do this, we will have no way to take care of the work. Today, our work has to be done in a corporate way. In the past, we thought that as long as we would find the full-time brothers and would commit to them the responsibility of the gospel work, all the problems would be solved. But this is not the way today. Today, we need to take care of the work together. No other period of time has been as easy as today for the gospel to go out. The opportunity for the gospel will be over in an instant. In Manchuria, only two places are left where the gospel can still be preached. Although North China has not yet fallen completely to the Communists, other than along a few railway lines, all the other places can no longer afford us the liberty to preach the gospel. These days, if there are people who are strong enough, and if we have enough money, we can bring three or five thousand people to the Lord in Foochow within a month. Today, once a person touches the gospel, he is saved. If we want to give our all, now is the best time. Once a person touches the gospel, he is subdued. Why are we not able to send out more people? In these days, we are eager to go on in a fast way. I hope that some would rise up from among us right away. I am not asking a little from you; I am asking everything from you. In the Lord's word, there is no such thing as half-hearted Christians. If a man wants to serve God, he has to offer up everything. If there is a group of people who will rise up to truly offer up everything, the world will see the church. Unless we serve in this way, God will have no way to go on. If we want to serve, we have to be absolute. If we are not absolute, we may as well not serve. What God wants is everything. What the Lord requires is also everything. Today, all those who are in their jobs, in their occupations, in their schools, or in their homes have to offer up themselves. We need all the people and all the money to be spent on China. Today is the best opportunity for the gospel to be preached.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING THE MONEY RECEIVED</H2><P>All the local brothers and sisters can put their offerings into the church offering box. Personal offerings can be given to the co-workers. The rest should be put in the fund for the work. If anyone wants to inquire about the accounting of the money for the work, you can go to Brother Lee and Brother Tang. The accounting of the church can be found in the church business office. The out-of-town brothers should first set aside from their monthly offerings an amount for their local use. If any money is designated for the work, it should be sent to Brother Witness and Brother Tang if the money comes from the north, and should be sent to Brother Chen Keh-san and Chen Si-wen if the money comes from the south.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MAINTAINING A BALANCE</H2><P>Before God, there are principles to everything we do, and we cannot do anything in a loose way. We are not like the missionary societies, who practice corporate faith. For over twenty years, we have not dared to be tough in the matter of money. But today, we see that everything else can be soft, but if we are soft on money, God's word will be softened. If we have a wrong attitude toward money and do not take care of it properly, God's word will be sacrificed. On the one hand, we do not want to see anyone taking godliness as a means of gain. On the other hand, we have to maintain God's standard. We do not want to annul personal faith through corporate moves. But at the same time, we wish to see all the needs met. We hope to see that as long as there is prayer, there is answer to prayer. In this matter, we hope to maintain a proper balance before God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DETERMINING AND ACKNOWLEDGING<br>THE CO-WORKERS</H2><P>I have a few words to say about the co-workers. The basic need in the work is to know people. A doctor can use instruments such as the thermometer and the blood pressure cuff to measure the temperature, the blood pressure, and the pulse. For us workers, our spirit is our instrument. If our spirit has been dealt with, we will know what kind of persons others are as soon as their spirit touches ours. If you are a piece of rough stone, and another rough stone is put on top of you, the roughness of the other stone will not be accented. But if you are a smooth and flat piece of stone, and another piece of rough stone is placed on you, its angles and corners will be accented, and you will feel right away which part is crooked and which part is not flat. You may not be able to pinpoint a person's mistakes, but when you touch such a one, you should be able to sense the uncouth parts in that person. Today in some places some brothers have accepted co-workers on our behalf and have created quite a lot of problems for us. The reason for this is that many of the ones that they have accepted are uneven and uncouth. I hope that we will have a deeper discernment concerning the co-workers. Those workers who work in different places should bring along with them letters of recommendation, without which they cannot be considered as our co-workers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BROTHER WITNESS LEE'S FELLOWSHIP</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Gospel Work in Foochow</H2><P>I have traveled along the coastal regions of China. I have also been to the inland regions. Among all these places, no place is as good as Foochow today. While I stayed in Foochow for forty days, I saw people being saved in a very quick way, and their salvation experience was quite solid. At the end of our work there, and when we were about to leave, God suddenly did a strong work. Originally, we thought that as long as we had ten or twenty that were willing to be baptized, we would baptize them. Hence, we made the announcement on Thursday, and we were going to talk with the candidates on Friday. When the time came, over eighty came, and of them over seventy were accepted for baptism. For some, as soon as they came in and sat down, the brothers were already clear that they were saved. The answers the brothers received far exceeded what they hoped for. The first time we held the baptism, there were one hundred twenty people baptized. The second week there were seventy to eighty. Other than these ones, there were many other ones who were waiting to be baptized.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Campus Work in Shanghai</H2><P>Today, if we send all the co-workers left behind in Shanghai to the campuses, it will not be enough to meet the need of the three universities alone. I venture to say that it is not suitable for the co-workers here in Shanghai to go to Foochow. In Chiao-tung University, National Medical University, and Shanghai Medical University alone, we have enough work to do already. Chiao-tung University has two to three thousand students. Shanghai Medical University has a thousand. In the past, when the Western missionaries came to preach the gospel, they had to build their own houses and hire their own people. But now everything is ready. The ones to preach the gospel are there, and the ones to hear the gospel are also there. The chairs and the lights are all there in the auditoriums already, and everything is so convenient. Today among us, we have seventy to eighty university students. In Chiao-tung University, sixty students are breaking the bread there. In National Medical University, we have a few dozen students. But we are short of people, and we are short of money. We are short of these two things. Recently we bought a car, two passenger vans, and a big bus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Campus Work in Nanking</H2><P>In Nanking, we have not officially started our work yet. But at present, there are five hundred people breaking the bread there already. We notice that in Nanking there are students who come from the remote regions of China. At present, there are some brothers in the church who can speak the native Sinkiang language. Once when I was preaching the gospel there, the dean of a certain school stood up to receive the Lord. After these brothers and sisters receive four years of spiritual education, they can become our "commando" units when they graduate. If we do not let them go, then there is nothing to it. But if we let them go, these ones will go back to their home provinces to preach the gospel. They will go to Mongolia, Sinkiang, and Tibet. The problem is still the lack of money. These schools are in Shia-kwang district. It is a problem for the students to come up with enough money to come to the meeting. Today, God has done much work on the campuses, and the door of the gospel is wide open.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BROTHER NEE'S FELLOWSHIP</H2><P>Brother Nee: Perhaps Brother Lee will say that I have left too few co-workers in Shanghai. But it is not an easy thing to make arrangements. I have opened up my spirit to the brothers, and I hope that the brothers will also open up their spirit to me. At present, the need in Shanghai cannot be met yet. Brother Lee's family cannot move here yet, and Brother David Hsu's family cannot move here either. Brother Chang Yu-tse said that he will have to return home. Brother Kang has quit his job at the China Textile Corporation, and he can no longer live in its dormitory. Brother Tang Shou-ling will also quit his teaching job soon. We have a big need in preparing the outward matters to match the spiritual move. Many people criticize us in a cheap way. In the end, they will not move even a little finger. We co-workers are working with a burden on our shoulders; we are not working in a light-hearted manner. Some people are here only as spectators. Our words are not for you.</P><P>Today in the Northwest, some still have to testify to their faith by their own blood. We can only help them in our prayers.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVENTY-THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A PRAYER FOR THE GOSPEL</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CHURCH PRAYER MEETING (1)</H1><P>Date:7:00 p.m., May 4, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai</P><P>Brother Watchman Nee prayed: Lord, ten years ago the Japanese occupied Shanghai. At that time we did not have the freedom to preach the gospel, and we prayed that if You were to have mercy on us and would give us another opportunity, we would surely preach the gospel properly. Now that problem is gone, and another problem is coming. The condition this time may even be worse than the last time. At that time, we could still meet and serve individually. But if this problem comes, we will not even be able to meet anymore. You have charged us to pray for those who are over us and who are in authority, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life. Now we cannot lead a tranquil life. We pray that the Lord would give the church peace. Lord, we ask You to give us another chance. No matter how much time we will have this time, we will sacrifice everything to preach the gospel. This is the church's prayer. At least, this is a prayer in one accord. We may not be in one accord in a thousand other things, but concerning this, we are in one accord. Although some may kill Stephen, You can still say to the Saul who fell on the ground, "It is hard for you to kick against the goads." May the Lord hear our prayer.</P><P>Brother Witness Lee and Brother Chu Cheng laid hands on Brother Chang Hsing-rong, who was about to return to Manila via Taiwan, and prayed for him: Lord, here is a person whose heart has been gained by You. May that which You have gained in him be expressed out from him. May the Lord grant him peace, and bless all the works that are related to him, so that he can spread abroad what he has received here. May the Lord accomplish this work soon.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVENTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A TALK WITH THOSE<br>WHO ARE ENGAGED IN BUSINESS</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CHURCH CONFERENCE (4)</H1><p>Date:7:00 p.m., Thursday, May 6, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</p><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MEETING GOD BY ASCENDING</H2><P CLASS=HBODY>There is a hymn:</P><ol class="decimal"><li> Hark! ten thousand voices crying,<br>"Lamb of God!" with one accord;<br>Thousand thousand saints replying,<br>Wake at once the echo'ng chord.</li><li>"Praise the Lamb!" the chorus waking,<br>All in heav'n together throng;<br>Loud and far each tongue partaking<br>Rolls around the endless song.</li><li>Grateful incense this, ascending<br>Ever to the Father's throne;<br>Every knee to Jesus bending,<br>All the mind in heav'n is one.</li><li>All the Father's counsels claiming<br>Equal honors to the Son,<br>All the Son's effulgence beaming,<br>Makes the Father's glory known.</li><li>By the Spirit all pervading,<br>Hosts unnumbered round the Lamb,<br>Crowned with light and joy unfading,<br>Hail Him as the great "I AM."</li><li>Joyful now the new creation<br>Rests in undisturbed repose,<br>Blest in Jesus' full salvation,<br>Sorrow now nor thraldom knows.</li><li>Hark! the heavenly notes again!<br>Loudly swells the song of praise;<br>Through creation's vault, Amen!<br>Amen! responsive joy doth raise.<br><br>(Hymns, #127)</li></ol><P>Brother Watchman Nee: This hymn was written by Brother J. N. Darby. Originally, it had thirteen stanzas. Here it is shrunk to seven stanzas. The whole hymn is a praise, and it is also a poem. The first stanza and the last stanza seem to stand apart from the rest of the hymn.</P><P>The first stanza opens with the word "Hark!" It is beckoning us to hear a voice. This hymn starts with a voice.</P><P>The second stanza tells us what one hears. It is the song of the heavenly chorus. The third line of this stanza says, "Loud and far each tongue partaking." It is making reference to the "every tongue" in Philippians 2:11. The voice here is not just the voice of the redeemed, but the voice of the whole heaven plus the heavenly hosts.</P><P>Stanza three mentions "every knee." "Each tongue" in stanza two matches the "Lamb," while "every knee" in stanza three matches "the Father's throne." All the praises are directed first to the Son and then to the Father. This is why stanza four mentions the Father. In stanza five, the Spirit also comes in. With the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the creation can rest in repose. Darby's hymns have one feature: all of them express a yearning for rest.</P><P>Stanza six turns to us. The first few stanzas give a high praise, and the whole creation is sustained in this praise. If others were to write this hymn, they would have stopped at stanza five. But Darby went on to speak about us.</P><P>Stanza seven goes back to the praise in stanza one. In stanza one, the first "Hark!" holds us up in heaven. In stanza seven, there is another "Hark!" The word "again" in the first line of stanza seven is an echo of the first stanza. In lines three and four, there are two "amens." These two "amens" are placed in an excellent place. The second "amen" echos the first "amen," in the same way that the last stanza echos the first stanza. In this way, the hymn reads like a poem.</P><P>Every hymn has to be ascending in its sentiments. There should be a line through which one can trace the thoughts. If it is not ascending, or if the line stops abruptly, it will not be a good hymn. In the Psalms, there are the songs of degrees, which means the songs of ascent. If a hymn is not well written, it will become a song of descent. We can only meet God by ascending all the time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>STILL A HANDFUL</H2><P>Here is another hymn:</P><ol class="decimal"><li>Anxious one, why hold that handful?<br>Let the prophet first be filled.<br>Your finances, if God handles,<br>How can your supply run dry?<br>Fresh necessities come daily,<br>Daily there are fresh supplies.<br>Since you are His own creation,<br>Will He not for you design?<br>Still you're loving, and still giving,<br>Still there is a handful left.<br>For all love and all your giving,<br>Many-fold He'll give you more.</li><li>O believe! He'll not delay you,<br>Ne'er too quick is He, nor slow.<br>O believe! The cruse, ne'er empty,<br>Nor will it be dry, nor filled.<br>Though the lilies lack their clothing,<br>Though the birds may not have food,<br>Yet the widow's little barrel,<br>Always has a handful still.</li><li>Why need worry for tomorrow,<br>When there's now enough to share?<br>Why need borrow next day's trouble,<br>When we have our handful still?<br>Love is living; giving's saving;<br>Those who sow much reap much more.<br>When you think that all is emptied,<br>Look, there is a handful still.</li></ol><P>This hymn is based on the story in 1 Kings 17. In our concept we do not care for the prophets. We think that taking care of the prophet is God's problem, God's business. But here the prophet is put into the hymn, which means that the prophet is also the business of God's people.</P><P>Those who have not handed over themselves will worry what to do next. But once you have handed over yourselves, you will see that God is responsible for the rest. We give the first half to the prophet, and God gives the second half to us. This hymn is God's answer for the second half. Actually, though the widow supplied the prophet first, she herself did not suffer hunger. All she did was to pour the oil a few more times, and to empty the meal a few more times. God said that the first handful should be set aside for His use, and the second handful set aside for her own use. The third handful is again for God's use, and the fourth handful for her own use. The first, third, fifth, seventh, and so forth, are for God, and the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, and so forth, take care of us. If the widow did not have faith, she might say, "Here is a person who has been starving for three and a half years. What if he helps himself to it and eats up all my portion?" However, if we would give the first portion to God, God will give the second portion to us. The same principle applies to our daily living today. God will not allow our cruse to be lacking in oil, or our barrel to be lacking in meal. But neither will He allow us to have an excess. Hence, we see that there is no need to save up anything.</P><P>The second stanza is quite high. It starts out with the word "believe." You should believe. What should we believe in? We should believe that at no time will we be empty, and at no time will we be filled. There is always a handful left. If we have much, we may still worry that we do not have enough. But God gives to us in abundance. Yet He does not give everything to us all at once. Instead He gives to us handful by handful.</P><P>The third stanza tells us that we should look to God concerning what He wants to do tomorrow. For all those who give, the result will actually be saving. When we spend, we think that what is spent is gone. Actually, nothing will be exhausted. No one will find himself giving to God to such an extent that he has nothing left. If the widow had not committed herself to God, she would not have lived through that three and a half years.</P><P>Today, man's eyes are always set on the money in his hands. In 1 Timothy 6, the warning Paul gave was a despairing warning. He exhorted the believers not to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches. The best exhortation tells people to set their hope in God. But when the best exhortation no longer works, we have the next best kind of exhortation, which tells people not to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches. But no matter how much a man sets his hope on the uncertainty of riches, in the end he still has to turn around to set his hope on God. Since that is the case, why not set one's hope in God in the first place?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A TALK TO THOSE<br>WHO ARE ENGAGED IN BUSINESS<br>AND WHO HAVE HANDED OVER THEMSELVES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Being Unequally Yoked<br>with the Unbelievers</H2><P>Tonight, we have something to say to those brothers who are engaged in business and who have handed over themselves. We have gathered together these brothers who have handed over themselves in order to have some fellowship with you. Before you handed over yourselves, there may have been some people whom you had business dealings with. You may at present also have some unbelieving business partners. At a certain time, these relationships will have to be terminated. The reason for this is that your goal and their goals are not the same, and sooner or later there will be conflicts of interests. We hope that you will do your best to separate yourselves from them within a short time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Learning to Coordinate One with Another</H2><P>The second thing is that you have to learn to coordinate one with another. The money you earn is for God, and the money I earn is also for God. We have to learn to be delivered from our individual circles. What I have personally is not a concern of my own, but a concern of the Body. These concerns should be considered within the coordination. Formerly, your goal was for yourselves. Now your goal is changed, and this puts all of us together in the same place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEARNING FROM THE FAILURE OF THE PAST</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee: Concerning going into business, we had some experiences in the past. First, in the beginning everyone shared everything in common. After a while, each one began to have some possessions and works of his own, and some degradations set in with respect to money. Still later, the brothers and sisters began to form partnerships in investments and business enterprises, and the situation became even worse. According to my knowledge, not once did we see a good result when brothers went into business together. Cases of arbitrations and settlements were especially frequent among the brothers. This is why at that time I advised everyone not to go into business ventures together. Instead, it is better that they should engage in business alone.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING DELIVERED FROM RICHES</H2><P>Despite what I said, we saw all the time that some have the capital, but are unable to operate a business, whereas others can operate a business, but do not have the capital. In some cases, a person has both, but does not have the strength to do anything. In the past, we did not have enough light. As a result, when the brothers came together, it was difficult for them to be without opinion. Once opinion came in, the testimony was lost, and what was done was not done to the glory of God. The reason we could not handle the matter properly was that we were not delivered from riches themselves yet. Because of this, there was no coordination among us, and we became poor. As far as the work is concerned, we are the poorest among all Christian groups. Today I sent out fifteen to sixteen hundred letters to the brothers and sisters to fellowship with them about the purchase of the meeting hall. I was not happy in my heart about this matter. Our present meeting hall is already packed to the brim. Our present meeting hall will not meet even a fraction of the present need. All the while, we are telling the saints to bring others to our gospel meetings. Where are they going to sit if they all come?</P><P>Today we are poor. But what is the reason that we are so poor? The reason is that money has been kept back in our own hands. Today, we have become so fallen that all our hands have become empty again. The work has no money, and you have no money. The reason for our poverty is that we have not been delivered from riches yet. When the money goes into your pocket, your heart falls in love with money. The minute we start arguing, all blessings are gone. You said that you have handed over yourselves, and you have listed all your possessions. But when I read the lists over and over again, I find nothing that can be taken up by us.</P><P>Today the amount of spiritual needs should be matched by the amount of material supply. At present, it is still right for us to go into business. But in order to do that, we must first hand over our individualism. Perhaps some brothers disagree with going into business together. But how much can one person's capital do? The move of the gospel must catch up with the need of the age. In order to catch up with the age, there is the need for coordination. In the world, men conduct business by taking an airplane and by doing it on a large scale. But we have not given our time to anything. When we preach the gospel, we do not have any advertisements, and we do not do anything in the newspaper. The reason for this is that we do not have the money. If those brothers who are in business indeed realize the great need in the gospel, they should rise up to do something in an aggressive way. All that the brothers need to do is to keep enough for their own use; the rest they should offer up to the work. If we do not offer up ourselves in this way, there is not much hope that we can go on.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED OF MONEY TO MATCH<br>THE NEED OF THE GOSPEL</H2><P>Brother Nee said: According to statistics compiled by evangelists around the world, the more money a person puts into the gospel work, the more people there are who will be baptized. They calculated that on an average a person has to spend one thousand U.S. dollars on a person before he can be saved. But it takes a very small amount of money to have people saved among us. Although I cannot say that of one thousand people saved among us, every one of them counts, I can say that at least nine hundred ninety-nine of them count. If we have one thousand U.S. dollars, we can save one hundred people. It does not mean that there is no money in Christianity today. It means that people do not get saved as quickly as they do among us.</P><P>The money in Christianity today comes from foreign countries. Let me ask you: Where does that money come from? Does it not come from God's children also? It is better for us to give some money to them than for them to send some money to us. But where does our money come from? It comes from all the poor brothers and sisters. Those who should give do not give, and those who should not give continue to give. Up to a point, when I received the money, I felt unable to take it. That money was like the water of Bethlehem; it is water that we cannot drink (2 Sam. 23:13-17). One student offered four million dollars. Although a person cannot buy even a sack of rice for four million dollars now, this student had to save his bus fare and walk with his feet to come up with this amount for his offering. Do not think that God's worker will take any kind of money that is offered up. We are like David. Although we may be thirsty, we cannot drink that kind of water. That kind of water has to be poured out before God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED FOR A MORE THOROUGH CONSECRATION</H2><P>The difficulty of our work today lies in the fact that we lack both people and money. At present, we have seven brothers who have left their jobs. Among us, we have over twenty widows of former co-workers. I can see two brothers who really should have left their jobs. Yet I cannot help them to leave their jobs, because in the past I have asked some co-workers to leave their jobs, and not long after that, they died. It was as if I had sent them to their graves. Among our co-workers who have died, other than one who died of cholera, one who was killed by the Communists, and two others who died of other diseases, the rest all died of tuberculosis. Even you who are sitting here are saved because we have spent money on you. Even if you were saved in another place and then came to us for perfection, we have spent money on you. Today, even if it means sacrificing your life, you have to give your money away to allow others to hear the gospel and to share the good that you have received. If this generation will give up everything, it will pave the way for the next generation to go on. This is how the way of the gospel is paved. Today, in the north and in the south, a few dozen brothers are ready to give themselves full-time for the gospel. On the one hand, we may say that it is not that easy for the work to go on. On the other hand, we find that it is very simple for men to be saved among us, and the price we have to pay is very little. As soon as a person touches the gospel, he is saved. For this reason, we need to have more thorough consecrations.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVENTY-FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING CONTENDING OR YIELDING</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CHURCH PRAYER MEETING (2)</H1><p>Date:7:00 p.m., May 7, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</p><P>One brother asked: What should be our relationship with our family: Should we contend with them, or should we yield to them?</P><P>Brother Witness Lee: Concerning the disposal of money that you have handed over, you should not insist on doing anything if your wife, children, or parents raise objections to it. You cannot measure others by your own spiritual standard, and you cannot require others to be the same as you are. Whatever others ask for, you have to give to them. If they want better clothing, you should do your best to satisfy them. You should only consecrate what you have when others are motivated to do the same. The more you contend for these things, the more tightly they will hold onto them. The more you yield, the more they will let go. Nevertheless, as long as your heart is delivered from money and fleshly desires, you have done a great thing already.</P><P>One sister refused to go to the movie with her husband after she was saved. The more her husband wanted her to do it, the more she would oppose, and the more she would give her husband a long face. When the husband came home at night, she would not open the door in order to let him know that she was not happy with him. One day, she came to me in tears. I told her, "Your attitude was totally wrong. Your husband has not seen what you have seen. You cannot treat him this way. You should happily accompany him to the entrance of the cinema and say to him, `Sorry, I cannot go in, but I will wait for you at home. You can go in and watch the movie. I will go home and prepare some nice food for you.' In the meantime, you should open the door and wait for him to come home." Let me tell you, this is the proper Christian way.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVENTY-SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TESTIMONIES BY THE SAINTS<br>AND WORDS OF EXHORTATION</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CHURCH MEETING</H1><p>Date:Evening, May 8, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Note:Testimonies by all the brothers and sisters who have handed over themselves. At the end of the meeting, Brother Nee gave a word of exhortation.</p><P>Brother Nee: For over twenty years, God has been taking the way of recovery among us. This way is becoming clearer and clearer. Today, everyone who holds back anything for himself is either a sad person or a weeping person. Within the last few days, I have met some of the happiest people I have ever seen. Many people held my hands tightly, and they were both excited and happy. Praise God, there are many happy faces here today. They have all handed themselves wholeheartedly to the Lord. Tonight, it is as if the last train is about to leave. I hope that no one will miss this train and that no one will be left behind.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVENTY-SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A TRANSPARENT PERSON</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LORD'S DAY MORNING MESSAGE (5)</H1><P>Date:10:00 a.m., The Lord's Day, May 9, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 8:12; 1 John 1:5; Matt. 11:15; Eph. 5:14</H1><P>Prayer: Lord, help us not only to remove the world, sin, and the flesh, but help us not to come with our mind or our will. Turn the darkness within us into light, the foolishness into clearness, so that our spirit can meet You face to face in the Holy of Holies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IT BEING DIFFICULT TO FIND A TRANSPARENT PERSON</H2><P>Two weeks ago, I had a deep feeling that among God's children it is difficult to find many who love the Lord and who are consecrated for Him. But it is more difficult to find a transparent person. No matter where a person goes, you can always find some people who love the Lord and who live for Him. But it is difficult to find one who is transparent. There is a difference between being bright and being transparent. To the Chinese, to be bright means to be good, righteous, moral, law-abiding, and just; brightness to them means cleanliness. But in the Bible, brightness does not refer to this. As far as cleanliness goes, this glass may not be as clean as this table. But as far as transparency goes, the glass is more transparent than the table. The table is hard and dark, but the glass is transparent. Although a handkerchief may be white and clean, light cannot pass through it. Transparency is there when a person lives in the light and when he becomes shining. Every person should be a shining and transparent person before God.</P><P>Revelation tells us that the four living creatures have eyes all over them. You can find people who pray every day. You can find people who are zealous for the Lord and who run around for the Lord. You can find people who have a strong interest for spiritual things. You can even find people who are willing to give up everything, but it is difficult to find one or two persons who are as clear as crystal. Among God's children, there are very few clear and transparent people. Even when many have handed over themselves, it is still difficult to find a few among them who are transparent. Some people are very proper and moral, but they are not transparent. Some people are very nice, but they are not transparent.</P><P>In my daily contact with many individuals, I have come to know all kinds of people. Among them, two are like smoking chimneys; not only are they not transparent, but they are full of foul air and smog. Clearness and transparency here refer to a person's knowledge of spiritual things and his discernment of the spiritual way. A transparent person can give others light. If we are not shining within, it means that we do not carry much weight before God. Today, there are too few transparent persons.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SALVATION BRINGING US THE LIGHT OF LIFE</H2><P>God's word says that He has transferred us from darkness into light (Acts 26:18; 1 Pet. 2:9). Formerly, we were sinful and evil. Now we do not sin any longer, and we have become proper. This is right, but this is not enough. The salvation as revealed in God's word shows us that once we were blind, but now our eyes are open. Now we are no longer in darkness but in the light. On the one hand, salvation opens our eyes. On the other hand, as the Lord Himself is the light, and salvation brings the Lord into us, it also brings light into us. The Lord said that He is the light of the world (John 8:12). Brothers and sisters, what kind of life have we received? This life is the light of men. Whether through God's salvation or through His word, we find that God's children should be transparent. Today, men think that it is normal for God's children to be dark, and when one or two of them are shining, others think that they are abnormal. Actually, to be shining is to be normal, and to be dark is to be abnormal. When we touch the life within the brothers and sisters, we touch light. When we come into the church, we also see light. When a man reads the Bible day by day, there are lights all over the Bible. With a Christian, everything and all things about him and around him are lights. It is therefore a strange thing for a Christian not to touch any light.</P><P>Where are the transparent ones today? Are you transparent? Are the ones sitting next to you transparent? I dare not say if they are.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REASON FOR NOT BEING TRANSPARENT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Not Living by the Spirit</H2><P>What is the reason for God's children not being transparent? Here are three or four problems. Within every saved person's spirit, there is the life of God. The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord (Prov. 20:27); it allows God to shine forth, in the same way that the light bulb allows electricity to shine forth. All the lights are concentrated in man's spirit. If a man does not live in the spirit after he is saved, but instead lives outside the spirit, and if while he is living, he does not live by the spirit, he will not have the light, and he will not be transparent. To live outside the spirit is to live in darkness. A saved person should learn before God to live in the spirit. Today, many people live by many things outside the spirit. For example, when a person prays, his words may be very beautiful, and the words may sound right, but what he says may not be transparent. A person's real prayer should not be one with beautiful words only. A person's real prayer should be one that is uttered from the spirit. The same is true with our preaching. Some words are indeed pleasant, but you do not have the sense that they are transparent. Only words that issue from the spirit are transparent. Once you live in the spirit, you become a transparent person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Remaining in the Soul</H2><P>What are the things aside from the spirit? They are the soul, the flesh, sin, and the world. The soul is outside the spirit, and the flesh is outside the soul. Sin is outside the flesh, and the world is outside sin. These few circles have the spirit as the center, with each circle spreading outward. At present, our biggest problem is our soul. Our soul frustrates us from becoming transparent. The soul is closest to the spirit. Hence, if the soul is wrong and is off, it will be difficult for the spirit to become shining. For this reason, our soul needs to be dealt with and to be cleansed. If a man's heart is wrong, he will forever be in darkness and be veiled within. If a man drops the world, casts aside his sins, deals with his flesh, and turns his heart to the Lord, he will be able to see. The Lord's word says that those who are pure in heart will see God (Matt. 5:8).</P><P>Many believers ought to be shining within. Yet they do not have the light within and are not shining. The reason for this is that they still remain in the soul. Our soul is of three parts, which are the mind, the emotion, and the will. Today, although many believers have dropped the world, cast away their sins, and dealt with the flesh, they have not lived in the spirit. Instead they live in their mind. When they read the Bible, pray, or listen to messages, they will nod their heads, receive everything, and approve everything. But while they are nodding their heads, they never turn to their spirit. The last few days I have read many consecration slips, and I have given many messages. The brothers and sisters passed on these slips to me one after another. Yet when they wrote, they wrote in their mind, and I had to exercise my mind to read them. In the end, they only gave me a headache. At a certain point, I was wishing that I could take a pen and cross out all these slips.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY TO BE TRANSPARENT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Not Trusting in the Mind or the Thoughts,<br>but Exercising the Spirit to Contact God</H2><P>We must always learn to touch God in our spirit. We can never touch Him in our soul. A piece of wood can never conduct electricity; only metal will conduct electricity. Today, God is Spirit, and we have to learn to reject our own thoughts and to exercise ourselves to live in the spirit. If our minds are too strong and our thoughts too active, we will not be able to touch the spirit. Some may wonder if this is a kind of strategy to fool ourselves. But this is absolutely not a kind of strategy to fool ourselves. Only through the spirit can a person touch God. If you try to touch God with your head, you will not touch Him even if you break your skull.</P><P>I have met a few people who are not as intelligent and clever as I am. Although they are not as clever as I am, and although their minds are not as intelligent as mine is, they have learned to touch the Spirit with their spirit. The ugliest thing there is for a person to do is to touch the things of God with his own cleverness. What does it mean to use our mind, and what does it mean to use our spirit? For example, before you go to see a brother, you should learn to have some fellowship with the Lord within you. When that brother speaks in his spirit, you should listen quietly and prayerfully before God. But the trouble with us is that many times when we meet the brothers, we exercise our mind without exercising our spirit. If you go to see a brother and you prepare a speech first before you go, your speaking will surely be from the mind. This kind of speaking from the mind will damage you and will damage others. You are not being wise by doing that. Only those who live in the spirit are the truly wise ones.</P><P>If a man lives in his soul, he will not be able to see God's revelations. What is a babe? A babe is one who has a simple mind. Perhaps a man should be weeping when he touches his spirit. But because his mind is too clever, he ends up laughing instead of weeping. Everything that comes from the mind is deceitful. A child does not act from his mind, but from his feelings only. Hence, everything that he expresses is true and not false. Do not think that you can deceive a spiritual person. Although a spiritual person may look simple, he can read what is in your innermost being. A spiritual person discerns all things (1 Cor. 2:15).</P><P>All those who have smart ears and bright eyes are deceitful ones. Some people are very good at talking, but will good answers justify what a person does? The church is not a law court; it is not a place where we arbitrate cases. Today, we cannot touch others with our mind. We have to learn to touch others with our spirit. Even in reading the Bible, we have to learn to exercise our spirit. We cannot read the Bible with our mind. Day before yesterday I received two letters. Both of them were written from the mind. Today, all our problems arise from our mind. What we need to do is to put our spirit in the forefront and our mind at the back.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Being Full of Emotion,<br>Yet Not Living by our Emotion</H2><P>The second thing is the emotion. All spiritual persons are people with strong emotions, but, at the same time, all spiritual persons are those who do not live by their emotions. On the one hand, those who are dull and have no feelings at all cannot be a spiritual person. On the other hand, although a man may have emotion, he cannot live by his emotion. Those of you who do not have emotion have to learn to have emotion; you have to learn to laugh and to weep. Those of you who have emotion have to learn not to live by your emotion. If your exercise turns you into a man of wood or stone, your exercise is not a spiritual one. I am afraid that some among us never wipe their sweat or their tears. Do not think that such a kind of person is spiritual. In church history, every spiritual person is full of emotion. However, on the one hand, we have to be full of emotion; on the other hand, we must not live by our emotion.</P><P>Some sisters are full of emotion. They are attached to children, old folks, and even to small cats and dogs. All year round they are busy. Today they go to this house, and tomorrow they go to another house. If they become attached to you, they will come to your house at least once or twice a week. A few of such ones may be one in their emotions, but they are not one in their minds. This kind of fellowship is the fellowship of the emotion; it is not the fellowship of the spirit. Where are you living today? In your contact with the brothers and sisters, have you dealt thoroughly with the elements of emotion? Perhaps the reason you are in darkness and are not transparent is that you are too much in your emotion. Before God, and in your contact with the believers, you have to learn to live in the spirit. We have to fellowship with the saints in the spirit. We need an emotion, but our emotion has to be broken, and it must be dealt with. It is not right to be without any emotion, and it is also wrong to live by the emotion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Being Strong, Yet Broken in the Will</H2><P>Moreover, our will needs to be dealt with. Some people's will is like the northern Chinese noodles: if you hold them up by one side, the other side flops, and if you hold them up by the other side, this side flops. If you hold them up by the middle, the two sides flop, and if you hold them up by the two sides, the middle flops. They are too weak. This is the way many people's will is. We have to realize that a man whose will is not firm cannot be spiritual. Only those who have a strong will, yet a broken will, can be spiritual, and only they can receive the light.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Keeping Oneself from Touching<br>Right and Wrong</H2><P>Another thing that makes us opaque is the matter of right and wrong. If we want to be delivered from darkness and be a transparent person, we have to keep ourselves from touching any right or wrong. The fruit of the knowledge of good and evil brings in sin, and sin brings in death. One cannot judge anything by its right and wrong. One cannot act according to right and wrong. You have to learn to judge and to act in your spirit. Many things cannot be determined on the ground of right and wrong. If you make judgments based on right and wrong, you yourself will also fall into the same entanglements, and you will end up being in darkness.</P><P>Today our problems are these four things: the mind, the emotion, the will, and the right and wrong. If we are delivered from these things, we will be a spiritual and transparent person. If we reject these things and learn to be a person living in our spirit, we will become a transparent person.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVENTY-EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE RELATIONSHIP<br>BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND THE WORK,<br>AND THE MEANING AND AUTHORITY<br>OF THE CHURCH AND<br>IDENTIFICATION WITH THE CHURCH</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (28)</H1><P>Date:7:30 p.m., Saturday, May 15, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RELATIONSHIP<br>BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND THE WORK</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Being Local<br>and the Work Being Regional</H2><P>The sphere of the church is a locality, and the sphere of the work is a region. A church is local. That is why we have the church in Ephesus, the church in Colosse, and the church in Corinth. But the work is more than local. The book of Acts shows us that the first group of workers went from Jerusalem to Samaria, and then to all the other places. These workers were not limited to the one locality of Jerusalem, but they were limited to the region of Judea. Hence, this shows us that their work was regional.</P><P>At Antioch, there was a new beginning. There we see Paul and Barnabas going out to start the work among the Gentiles. In the Gentile world there were the churches in Galatia and the churches in Asia. These churches form one region. Hence, in the Bible, there is not only the company of Peter preaching the gospel; there is also the company of Barnabas preaching the gospel. In Philippians, it even mentions another group of people (1:15-17) working in a different region. Paul said that the measure apportioned to him allowed him to reach even as far as the Corinthians (2 Cor. 10:13-14). In other words, Paul had his region of work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Work Being Divided into Regions,<br>but the Fellowship Being One</H2><P>There are regions to the work, and each region includes certain localities. Under normal circumstances, though the regions are different, there is still a oneness between the regions. When the relationship is normal, all the works in the different regions maintain the one fellowship. Jerusalem is one with Antioch. Although they belong to different regions, they still have fellowship before the Lord. When people were saved in Antioch, Jerusalem sent some men over to help (Acts 11:20-28). Jerusalem also sent out Barnabas and Paul (Acts 9:28-30). Antioch was something that came out of Jerusalem and that returned back to Jerusalem. When Jerusalem was short of money, Antioch sent money from the Gentiles to Jerusalem (Acts 11:27-29). Barnabas went from Jerusalem to Antioch (Acts 11:22), and Paul returned from Antioch to Jerusalem (Acts 15:2). Here we see that although regions are different, the fellowship remains one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Elders Being Responsible for the Church,<br>and the Apostles Being Responsible for the Work</H2><P>The elders are responsible for the church in the localities (Titus 1:5), whereas the apostles are responsible for the work in the region. Peter and his co-workers were in charge of the work in Judea, whereas Paul and his co-workers were in charge of Antioch and the work in the Gentile world. The apostles worked within the regions assigned to them by God (2 Cor. 10:13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>How to Handle Finances</H2><P>How should we handle the church finances? All the money that the brothers and sisters designate for a local church should be placed in the church offering box. What is designated for the poor brothers should be marked clearly as such. What is designated for individuals or for the work in another region should likewise be clearly marked. You can separate the offerings for local use and for the work by using two offering boxes, or the two can go into the same offering box. The church has full liberty to distribute these offerings in whatever way it chooses, and individuals have full liberty to give according to their faith.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MEANING AND THE SPHERE OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee asked: What is the meaning and the sphere of the church?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Two Aspects of the Church</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: There are two meanings to the word "church." The first is the universal church, and the second is the local church. The universal church is the general church, which includes the church of yesterday, today, here, and elsewhere. It even includes the church in the future. The local church is the church that appears in each locality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Two Aspects of the Universal Church</H2><P>As to the universal church, there are also two aspects to it. One aspect refers to the church that includes all God's children both yesterday and today, both here and everywhere. However, we have to realize that today we are neither in yesterday, nor in the future. God's children are living on earth today. When all these children of God are added together, we also have the general church. What was there yesterday was past, and what will be there in the future is not here yet. Between the past and the future, there are all the children of God on earth today. God's children must not only practice the oneness in the locality, but they must learn to be one with all God's children on the whole earth today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Maintaining the Local Testimony<br>and God's Testimony on Earth As Well</H2><P>If Nanking develops a problem with Shanghai, that is, if the church in Nanking is at odds with the church in Shanghai, you can only say that they are maintaining a local testimony; they have not maintained God's testimony on earth. Today, we must not only maintain a local testimony; we must also maintain God's testimony on earth. We cannot isolate Shanghai and try to keep it out of trouble. Shanghai belongs to the general church on earth. The Body mentioned in 1 Corinthians is different from the Body mentioned in Ephesians 4. The Body in Ephesians 4 includes all the believers past and present, here and everywhere, but the Body in 1 Corinthians only refers to all the believers on earth at that time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Learning to Be One</H2><P>The church is local, whereas the work is regional. A local church cannot encompass the work of a region, because a region involves more than one local church. However, all the local churches plus all the regional works equal the general church. In order for us to practice the oneness of the church, we must practice the oneness of the general church. This requires that we learn to follow others and learn to be one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee asked: What is the authority of the church, and who can represent the church?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Authority of the Church<br>Being with the Elders, whereas the Authority<br>of the Work Being with the Apostles</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: The authority of the local church is in the hands of the elders, whereas the authority of the work is in the hands of the apostles.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Oneness with the General Church<br>Bringing in Authority</H2><P>Since you are the church, you have the authority. God's authority is with the church. Do not think that an individual believer does not have any authority. As long as such an individual believer is one with the general church, he can have the authority also, and he can even be the authority. Suppose Brother Lee has offended me. While I am with him alone, I point out his mistake, and the matter is taken care of. While I am taking care of the matter, the church is brought in; the reality of the church is brought in. Of course, in terms of the actual procedure, the church is not involved. In the Bible, not only can an individual represent the church; the principle of two or three can also be a principle of the church. When two or three are one, that oneness makes them the church. When these two or three deal with anything, it will be the church dealing with the matter. The only difference between that and the church actually dealing with the matter is that the church has not said anything directly. In actuality, these two or three are one with the church, but the church is not directly involved. However, what they say becomes what the church says. Hence, the two or three become the church.</P><P>Here we can see a unique fact of oneness: An individual can have the authority of the church, two or three can also have the authority of the church, and the whole church can also have the authority of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Authority of the Apostles</H2><P>Other than these authorities, we see before the Lord that God has established some special authorities. These authorities have to give an account before God in the future. First God established the elders as the authority. Other than the elders, God has also established the apostles as the authority. Accusations against an elder should be presented to the apostles (1 Tim. 5:19). The elders are the authorities, and the apostles are also the authorities. Moreover, the elders have to submit to the authority of the apostles. A man should learn coordination before God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Submitting to the Authority<br>Assigned by the Head</H2><P>We believe that a man should submit to the authority of the Head in the church. A believer should learn submission in the church to such an extent that his submission means more than his sacrifice. We should look for opportunities for submission. Every believer should practice submission. If they do this, others will see that here is a group of people who bear a proper testimony in the schools, the hospitals, and so forth. Here is a group of people who have not overstepped and who maintain their proper standing. In the homes, you do not see the children dominating the parents or strong wives dominating their husbands. If we have the light, we will see that God hates confusion (1 Cor. 14:33). Whether or not we like it, we have to recognize authority. Once there is authority, there is submission. This time, when we handed over ourselves, not only do we have to offer up our money, but we have to learn coordination as well. We have to pursue submission, not only to the Lord, but to those whom the Lord has placed in our path. If we do this, we will find grace before God, and we will be able to go on in a proper way. As long as there are four or five brothers living together, some have to learn to exercise headship, and some have to learn submission. Whenever man fails to recognize the sovereign arrangements of the Head, everything falls into confusion. Whenever we find submission, there we find a proper testimony.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MEANING OF BEING ONE WITH THE CHURCH</H2><P>One brother asked: Brother Nee said a while ago that an individual brother can be one with the church, and that once there is oneness, there is authority. What kind of oneness does that refer to?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Not Being<br>a Matter of Number</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: This oneness is an identification. Strictly speaking, not only can one individual not call himself the church; even if all sixteen hundred saints in Shanghai are put together, it is equally presumptuous for them to call themselves the church. In Revelation 7, it mentions that those who are clothed in white and who stand before the throne are countless in number. The largest number in the whole book of Revelation is two hundred million. This means that this countless number is larger than two hundred million. The population of China is only five hundred million, or more precisely, four hundred fifty million. If among all the Chinese, three thousand of them would set up a flag and declare that they are China, is that not a joke? Hence, whether or not one is a church is not a question of number.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>There Being Oneness with the Church Only by Being Dealt With and by Being in the Holy Spirit</H2><P>If I am one who has been disciplined by the Holy Spirit and one who has learned the lesson of fellowship, and if I am one who rejects not only the self, but all individualism, and if I am one who has been dealt with in all these areas, then I will surely be one with the church. No matter how large a number you have, when this number is compared with the whole, it is worth nothing. The question is whether or not you are the same as all the other children of God. If you are, you can say that you are the church. If not, even if you have sixteen hundred people, you cannot say that you are the church. When a man is in the Holy Spirit, he can be one with the church. When a man is not in the Holy Spirit, there is no oneness of the church. If there is no oneness of the church, even if the number is ten times sixteen hundred, there is still no church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Dealt With to Have the Body Consciousness,<br>and Being Identified with the Body</H2><P>God wants our self to be broken. Individualism must go, and we cannot act according to our own will; our outward shell must be broken. The Body is a matter of consciousness. God has to bring a man to the point where he realizes that he is the church. This is what we mean by the Body consciousness. One has to be brought to the point where he feels that he is the Body. When one member of your body moves, the whole body moves as well. This is something very real. The Lord said to Paul, "It is hard for you to kick against the goads" (Acts 26:14). Perhaps Paul only remembered that he persecuted Stephen. He did not realize that while he was persecuting Stephen, he was persecuting the Lord. Later he understood that in persecuting Stephen, he was persecuting the Lord. This is why Paul said later that when one member suffers, the whole Body suffers also (1 Cor. 12:26). When the whole Body is rejoicing, will not each member rejoice? When the whole Body is suffering, will not each member suffer also? Today, we have to stand on the ground of a receiving one, and we should receive the other members of the Body. Pride goes before destruction (Prov. 16:18). Those who sit on the high chair of a judge can surely not be the runners of the race. Only those who receive, who are humble, and who step down from their throne can identify themselves with others and with the church. Otherwise, any oneness is but an outward performance.</P><P>When a man is one with the church, if others are in the flow, he will surely be in the flow. When others receive a certain guidance, he will receive the same guidance. All the brothers and sisters will receive the same grace and will take the same way. If everyone is hot, and you are the only one that is cold, it proves that you are not in the Body. If everyone is going in one direction, I have to follow them. If everyone is burdened for Manchuria, spontaneously I will have the same burden. If everyone is afraid of touching a certain matter, I will not dare to touch the same matter. This is the church. The church is something that issues from within. It is not something that is arrived at by outward consensus. Hence, every child of God is the church. If we follow the footsteps of the flock in this way, God will lead us on. We cannot withdraw ourselves simply because of our unwillingness to submit in certain matters, and we cannot fall behind or draw back. Today among God's children, the most precious thing is this sense of identification. If all God's children see something one way and I feel another way, I should resolve not to fall behind the others, and I should be ready to identify myself with others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IDENTIFICATION WITH THE CHURCH</H2><P>Brother Yu Cheng-hwa asked: Is this identification the result of the work of the Holy Spirit? Why do we not say that we should be identified with the Head, but rather that we should be identified with the Body?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Submission to the Discipline of the Holy Spirit<br>Bringing In Identification</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: Identification is not a oneness of the will. For example, if the feeling within me is different from yours, we will not be the same no matter how much we try to talk things over with one another. Water is water, and wine is wine. One does not see the water turned into wine every day. Whenever we do not submit to the discipline of the Holy Spirit through our circumstances, we will fall behind in the matter of identification. When a platoon of soldiers is marching along, and one of them disobeys the captain, he will automatically become out of step with the rest of the platoon.</P><P>With Christians there is no such thing as circumstances; there is only the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Today, the Lord has given us His Spirit. Everything around us is under His sovereign arrangement, and nothing is a coincidence. What the Holy Spirit is doing within us matches what He has sovereignly arranged outside of us. The discipline of the Holy Spirit is for our good (Rom. 8:27-28). Whatever He sees that we need, He arranges those things outside of us. If a man does not submit himself to the discipline of the Holy Spirit, he will come into conflict with the brothers. If he is not under the discipline of the Holy Spirit, surely there is no possibility of identification, and surely he will not be able to identify himself with the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Identification with the Head Being Mystical, whereas Identification with the Body<br>Being Practical</H2><P>The believers' identification with the Head is a doctrine that has been preached for years, but we have to say that the result is quite abstract. For example, I consecrate myself to the Lord today. Tomorrow, I may take back my consecration, and nobody will know anything about it. This is mystical. Today, everything mystical has to be turned into something practical. Once something is turned from a mystical one to a practical one, it will not be so easy to dispense with the matter any longer. For example, if a person has consecrated himself in a practical way, it will not be easy for him to take back his consecration anymore. If he does, everyone will see that this brother has drawn back.</P><P>We have to realize that the oneness of the Body is something that is visible; it is not empty talk. In fact, if we are identified with the Head, we will surely be identified with the Body. When a person identifies himself with the Body, he is identifying himself with the Head. This is something visible and measurable. John said that if a man cannot love the brothers whom he has seen, he cannot love God whom he has not seen (1 John 4:20). It is impossible to have two persons submitting to the Head, yet fighting with one another. I would rather declare that I am submitting to the Body than to declare in a falsely spiritual way that I have no problem with the Head and that I am submitting to the Head.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Be Identified with the Head<br>without Being Identified with the Body<br>Being to Live in Deceit</H2><P>Today, everywhere we see men living in deceit. These ones should learn to go along with the church. If you go along with the church, you will be blessed. If a man identifies himself with the Body, he will surely be identified with the Head. But if a man says that he is identified with the Head, yet does not identify himself with the Body, he is living in deceit.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVENTY-NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A TRANSPARENT PERSON</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LORD'S DAY MORNING MESSAGE (6)</H1><P>Date:10:00 a.m., The Lord's Day, May 16, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:9, 17; John 9:39-40; Eph. 3:16-19</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RIGHT AND WRONG BRINGING IN DARKNESS</H2><P>Last Lord's Day, at the end of the message, we mentioned the matter of avoiding right and wrong, but we did not explain the matter clearly. Any time we fall into right and wrong, we fall into darkness. Suppose two brothers are arguing, and the matter is brought to you. If you consider the matter from the angle of right and wrong, you will immediately fall into darkness, and you will not be shining and transparent. Immediately you will be veiled. You may not be confusing rights with wrongs, but you will be in darkness.</P><P>The mind is something good in man. The emotion is also something good in man. If a man is void of emotion, he will be a piece of wood. The will is also a good thing. Without the will, a man will be like a ship without a rudder. But if a man lives by these three things, he will be living in darkness. The mind itself is dark, and it is not transparent. The mind, the emotion, and the will can be compared to a metal barrel. If a man is put into a barrel, he will not be able to come out. Although he may not be dirty, yet he is in darkness. All the gentlemen and moral persons are very clean, but at the same time they are very dark. They have a keen sense of right and wrong. Those who do not have any spiritual discernment will say that they are excellent and proper. But those who have spiritual discernment will sigh and will pity such persons. There is a big difference between a man living in his moral behavior and one who is living in the light. Here is a person who is most clean, and he is germ-free, yet he lives inside a metal barrel. Here is another person who perhaps has some dirt or germs with him, but he lives under the sun. Which of the two would you say is living in the light?</P><P>If two persons are fighting with one another, and they come before you, you should not deal with the matter according to right and wrong. You should turn to your inner being and should exercise your judgment before God and touch their spirit with your spirit. A judge is only concerned about the legal arguments of matters; he is not concerned about the matters themselves. However, we must not be concerned with the arguments only, but we must touch the matters themselves, and even more, we must touch others' spirit. Perhaps a person is very justified in his arguments, but his spirit is not proper. Perhaps here is another person who, as far as right and wrong are concerned, may not have as many arguments on his side as the other one, yet his spirit is quite proper. In touching all the various matters involved, our purpose is to touch others' spirit. The purpose of our helping others is to make their spirit clean, proper, and strong. For this reason, many times, the discernment of many who know God becomes the source of misunderstanding for those who do not know God. Those who do not know God will say, "Clearly this one has the argument. Why is he wrong?" He is wrong not because he has the wrong argument, but because he has the wrong spirit. If you agree with him, you will put him into further darkness. Every time someone brings a matter before you, you should bring this person before God and touch God. If you do this, you are transcending, rising above the people, the matters, and the arguments; you are putting yourself into their spirit to touch their spirit. If you want to be a transparent person, you will have to learn to touch others' spirit with your spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RIGHT AND WRONG BRINGING IN DEATH</H2><P>The Bible only tells us that life is light. It never says that right and wrong are light. On the contrary, right and wrong always bring in death. To touch right and wrong is to touch the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Everyone knows that darkness is death. The opposite of good and evil is life. The darkest person is the one who is not transparent, one who is living in death. What brings us into darkness? It is good and evil that brings us into darkness. What we need to do today is to touch life, because life is light. If we touch good and evil, they will bring in death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CRITICISMS BRINGING IN THE POISON OF DEATH</H2><P>Perhaps you think that this is a very small matter, but I do not consider this as a small matter. Whenever you criticize someone, you fall into darkness. All God's children agree that criticizing others is sin. You have to realize that not only is criticizing others sin, but it is something that will lead you into something else; it will lead you into good and evil, and right and wrong. It will bring the shadow of death into your being. When we have sin, we need forgiveness. But when we have poison, we need healing. For you to criticize someone is a sin. However, criticism not only brings you into sin; it brings you into contact with the poison of death. This is why we have to be delivered from good and evil, right and wrong, and darkness and death, so that we can become a transparent person in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING DELIVERED FROM THE STANDARDS<br>OF RIGHT AND WRONG, AND GOOD AND EVIL</H2><P>Many years ago, I was afraid of criticizing others. Once I criticized others, I felt that I had sinned, and I would go and confess my sins. Now also I dare not criticize others. But now I do not criticize because I am afraid that I would come in contact with right and wrong; I am afraid that the poison of good and evil will come into me once more. Today, in order to maintain ourselves transparent before God, we have to be delivered from right and wrong. Years ago, when I did not criticize others, I was doing it to keep myself clean. It was like a child who would not drink the water from the gutter because he did not want to be punished by his father. But now I am different. In the analogy of the boy, I am not doing it now, not for fear of punishment, but for fear of the poison in the water. Once a person argues, he is touching right and wrong. All those who argue may be very "clean," but they are not transparent within. A person can be very right, yet remain very dark within. He is not living, and he is not transparent. Immoral things surely bring us into darkness. But moral things bring us into darkness even more. It is true that the publican was condemned before God, but the Pharisee was altogether blind before God (Luke 18:9-14). A person may have nothing wrong, and he may be right in everything. Yet he is blind, and does not have the light or the sight. Why is this so? It is because he is too good, too clean, and too right; he is a person who lives in right and wrong. As such, he is blinded, and he does not have the light. He is not transparent.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EXERCISING THE SPIRIT TO ALLOW THE INNER MAN<br>TO BE STRENGTHENED</H2><P>Today, just as we condemn the world and evil, in the same way we have to condemn our mind, emotion, will, and the right and wrong. Education promotes these four things. Yet God is calling us out of these things, and He is teaching us to conduct ourselves in the spirit. We should learn to conduct ourselves not according to these four things.</P><P>This is the reason in Ephesians the apostle told us to be strengthened into our inner man (Eph. 3:16). God wants the spirit within us to be renewed, nourished, cleansed, and strengthened. Whenever we come across something, the first thing we have to do is not to exercise our mind, our emotion, or our will. Whenever we come across something, we have to learn to foster our spirit and exercise our spirit. God's salvation has transferred us from darkness into light, so that we would become those who live in our spirit. When we stop exercising our mind and our emotion, and when our will becomes softened, our spirit will grow and will rise in stature. We are most worried about those who have a strong mind or a strong will but a weak spirit, or those who are rich in emotion but poor in their spirit, or those who are morally strong but spiritually weak. We should be a person who is strong in our inner man. If we are such a person, we will be transparent.</P></body></html>
