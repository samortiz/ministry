We are afraid of seeing God because we have not looked at Christ. If we see only Christ, not ourselves, we will be bold every time we come to God. Christ will never fail; therefore, we can never be wrong before God. Thank God that our righteousness is not vacillating; our righteousness is forever unshakable. Our conduct can fluctuate, and our life can rise and ebb, but our righteousness before God can never fluctuate, vacillate, or rise and ebb. If anyone asks us if Christian conduct, zeal, and love can change, we answer yes. If we say no, we are deceiving ourselves. But our righteousness can never change because our righteousness is Christ. It is impossible for Him to change. God's Word is very clear concerning this.</p><p>First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became...to us from God...righteousness." When the Lord resurrected to become the Christ, God put us in Him so that He became our righteousness, and we put Him on as our righteousness. This is why our righteousness before God never changes. Since He is forever perfect and unchanging, we can come to God with boldness daily.</p><p>May God open our eyes to see that just as we could not trust in our conduct for salvation, we cannot trust in our conduct for coming to God after we become a Christian. This does not mean that we can be loose in our conduct. We will speak of this in the next chapter. In this chapter, we are dealing with the means by which we come to God. Our means of coming to God is Christ as our righteousness. We come to God by Christ. This is forever unshakable; it is forever sure. Hallelujah!
