   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LABORING IN THE WORD AND TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have printed thousands of pages of the truth and most of you have bought these pages and put them on your shelves.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all know the terms and the subject areas, but we just do not know how to present them, how to teach them to people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can all add and subtract, yet we do not know how to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we must endeavor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, the leading ones must rise up to become educated, equipped, and prepared by laboring in the Word and laboring in teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They then must bring the saints into these two experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I would encourage all the saints in the Lord s recovery to rise up to diligently seek after the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do have the groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that we have a lot of printed pages, a lot of messages.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Regardless of how busy each of you are every day, I still believe that you could spare thirty minutes every day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You could spare ten minutes in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppose you normally rise up by six in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Could you not rise up ten minutes earlier?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Surely you could.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And you could spare ten minutes at lunch time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Spend ten minutes to get into the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Put a life-study message in your pocket and wherever you are, if you have the time, read a few pages.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The life-study messages are not to replace your Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather the contents of the life-studies are all based upon the verses from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then in the evening before bedtime it is so easy for everybody among us to spare fifteen minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Consider how much you have wasted your time in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brothers and sisters, consider how much time you spend on the phone rather than on the Bible or the life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We always take an excuse saying, I do not have the time, but you do have time to spend ten minutes looking at the newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Would you please, for your education, for your edification, for your growth in the Lord s life, for the Lord s interests, and for His recovery, redeem your time from all those wastes?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not spend that much time on the newspapers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not spend that much time on the phone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as you can answer what they want, do not induce them to talk more.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do everything to save some time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe that it would be easy for everyone among us to spare thirty minutes a day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In addition to the life-study messages, you have the Bible, especially the Recovery Version with the notes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nearly all the hard points have been explained in the notes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The notes will render you much life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you open a life-study to any line, you will get the benefit, but I would rather propose to you that you read the life-study consecutively.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Pick a message and begin to read and consider the verses quoted on the first page.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the most this will take four minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Gradually, bit by bit, you will get yourself properly educated in the truths.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First Timothy 2:4 tells us that God desires everyone to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In addition to this, God desires that every saved one have the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But it bothers me that we are not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the past twelve years, as a farmer I have grown a lot of groceries for all of you, and thank the Lord that you have bought them and stored them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, the only sad thing is that you do not cook them much and you do not eat them much.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have the groceries, but we do not have sufficient cooking and we do not have enough eating.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All the groceries are lying there as a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Learn to handle the word of Christ, which is the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First, we have to let the word of Christ, the living Person, dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we speak by teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Ephesians 5:19 says, Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, but Colossians 3:16 says, Teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Speaking is somewhat liberal, but teaching is with regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We all have to pick up the living word of the living Lord and then teach one another.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Learn this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is a word not only to the leaders, the elders, but to all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Let the word of Christ dwell in you, teaching in all wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is difficult for the Bible students to determine whether the phrase in all wisdom qualifies let the word...dwell in you or qualifies teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to our punctuation it qualifies teaching: In all wisdom teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order to teach in all wisdom, you must first learn the Word in all wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you do not study the Bible with all wisdom, how could you teach it with all wisdom?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In John 6:63 the Lord says, The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whatever we teach, whatever we speak, should be words of life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The elders should be apt to teach and should labor in word and in teaching 1 Tim 3:2; 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All these words should be the healthy words 1 Tim 6:3; 2 Tim 1:13 , and the teaching should be according to godliness 1 Tim 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In 1 Timothy godliness simply means God manifested in the flesh 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that you have to practice the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When you speak, when you teach the healthy words of the Lord Jesus, you must exercise yourself to such an extent that people can see God manifested in you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is to teach, to speak, according to godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This requires much learning and much practice.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should not be that ignorant, remaining in the darkness of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today there is just darkness, but the light is shining here in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should get into the light so that we could be enlightened, rescued, and delivered from our ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I surely look to the Lord that you would take this word and have a turn to practice what the Lord is doing today.</S>
