[1]  The God-ordained Way Revealed in the New Testament
[2]  The so-called new way the Lord has shown us in the past four and a half years is a way that is fully revealed in the New Testament.
[3]  What we have we first received from the Brethren and then from Brother Nee, but we have not yet practiced some of the things which he saw.
[4]  The first step is to preach the gospel as the priests of the New Testament gospel by visiting people in their homes.
[5]  OF THE ELDERSHIP Scripture Reading: Acts 20:17-20, 27, 31
[6]  According to 2 Corinthians 3:5, the Apostle Paul said that we are not sufficient of ourselves but that our sufficiency is in the Lord.
[7]  Then Acts 20:20 says, How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable.
[8]  The things of God s New Testament economy, God s eternal plan, and God s plan for the church are absolutely lacking among them.
[9]  In verse 28 Paul admonishes the elders to take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers.
[10]  Apparently it was Paul that appointed them as elders.
[11]  Paul charged the elders not only to teach but to shepherd the church of God which God obtained through His own blood.
[12]  SERVING ONES, AND SLAVES Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1, 7, 11; 1 Cor 12:28
[13]  In this message we want to fellowship concerning the church service.
[14]  According to my experiences over the past fifty years in the church life, all the problems came out of one source ambition.
[15]  In the church life and church service ambition is a real gopher.
[16]  Not only in the secular government are there power struggles, but even in the church the problem is ambition.
[17]  In 2 Corinthians chapter four, Paul says, For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus sake v. 5 . We preach firstly Christ as Lord, and then we preach ourselves as slaves.
[18]  Whatever we do in the church life as a service rendered to anyone must be done with a proper spirit.
[19]  If so, we will not offer our own service, but the issue of our service, the parts of the corporate Christ, that is, the members of the Body of Christ.
[20]  OF THE FAITH Scripture Reading: Rom 16:1-2; 1 Tim 3:9
[21]  In our last fellowship concerning church service we saw clearly that our need is to serve firstly as a priest, then as a servant, and finally as a slave.
[22]  All of our service must minister Christ to others and build up the organic Body of Christ.
[23]  All of our service must have a definite goal.
[24]  Christ is a mystery, the mystery of God, and the church is also a mystery, the mystery of Christ.
[25]  If we want to understand God, we must understand Christ, and if we want to understand Christ, we must understand the church because God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is embodied in the church.
[26]  As Christ is the embodiment of God, so is the church the embodiment of Christ.
