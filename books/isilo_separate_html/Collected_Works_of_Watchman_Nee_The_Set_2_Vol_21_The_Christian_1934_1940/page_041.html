Every time there is a word of warning in Hebrews, we can find an important teaching immediately preceding or following the warning. An important teaching may appear first, and then a word of warning follows. Or an important teaching may be preceded by a warning. This is the structure of the book of Hebrews. In this book, there are five or six warnings. The passage we read in Hebrews 2 comprises the first warning. This warning is placed in between chapters one and two. What does chapter one cover? Chapter one is on glory. What does chapter two cover? Chapter two is on shame. Chapter one is on God and chapter two is on man. Chapter one is on glory and chapter two is on suffering. Chapter one tells us who Christ is from eternity past to eternity future, while chapter two tells us what He has accomplished in time. Chapter one is on His person, while chapter two is on His work. In between these two chapters, we have a word of warning. What is this warning about? It is a warning for us to give heed concerning the person of Christ and His work. What kind of attitude should we have when speaking of the person of Christ and His work?</P><P>First we must be clear concerning the teaching and the background of this book. Before we study the first warning in Hebrews, we must briefly mention the ones to whom this book was addressed. We know that the book of Hebrews was written to the Hebrews. A group of Jews were saved; they understood the things concerning the Old Testament, the temple, and the worship in the temple. At the same time, they also knew about the New Testament and the worship in the New Testament. They had known Christ and believed in Him, received Him, and were saved. Now they had both of the above things. They were Christians and not outsiders. This letter was not written to the Gentiles, nor to those who had never known salvation. This letter was written to those who knew salvation already. They were not unbelievers, but Christians. The word Hebrews is very meaningful; it means river crossers. The first Hebrew was Abraham. Abraham lived first on the east side of the river. Later he moved to the west side. Because he crossed the Euphrates River to the west side, he became a Hebrew. Hebrews means the river crossers. The book of Hebrews was written to the river crossers. It was written to those who had given up something behind them and were pursuing toward something before them. They left the former world behind, and following God's word, they journeyed on to a new place. God wrote through the apostle to the Hebrews who had forsaken the world and who were standing in a new realm. They were like us who have believed in the Lord Jesus, who have denied the former world, and who are standing today on a new ground and in a new sphere. This letter was written to this group of people.</P><P>It is very interesting that such a warning was given to this group of people: "Therefore we ought to give heed more abundantly to the things which have been heard lest perhaps we drift away." This is the first warning; it was given to the Hebrews, the Israelites. Behind them was one world, and before them was another kind of life. God issued a warning to this group of people through the mouth of the apostle. This warning also tells us what the present danger is. The danger is to drift away. Today we will study this warning in detail. It says that we should give heed, and that if we do not give heed, there is the danger of drifting away. This warning is needed because there is the danger ahead, the possibility, of drifting along with the current. The result of drifting along with the current is to miss so great a salvation. Why do we have to give heed? It is because this great salvation has been accomplished by God already, and we have to give heed lest we lose it. We have to give heed because there is the possibility of missing this great salvation. Who is behind this great salvation? It is God, the Lord, and the Holy Spirit; They have distributed it to us.</P><P>Let us now consider Hebrews 2:1. We cannot study all four verses. We can study only the first verse, using the other three verses as supplements. Verse 1 says, "Therefore,..." This means that this verse is a continuation of what was spoken of before. Because the Lord Jesus, as spoken of in chapter one, is so lofty, glorious, and excellent, because He is such a God, full of glory, and above all men and even the angels, we have to give heed to the things that we have heard. Because the things that we have heard convey such a Jesus to us, we have to give heed. The Bible is a wonderful book. The Gospel of John is different from all the other Gospels, and the things it records are different from those that are recorded in the other Gospels. When one reads Matthew, Mark, and Luke, he can place them side by side. But one cannot put the Gospel of John alongside the other Gospels; it has to be placed in a different category. It does not record the birth of Jesus by Mary, because it starts from the beginning, from eternity past. Everything it says has to do with things that are in glory, at the beginning, far above all, and before the ages. Our gospel today does not merely tell men, either sinners or believers, about a fisherman who walked by the Sea of Galilee nineteen hundred years ago. Nor do we want to show men merely a carpenter from Nazareth who lived nineteen hundred years ago. Neither are we presenting to men a Jesus who is merely human, a son of man born of Mary. Rather, we are presenting One whom God calls His companion. We want men to know the Lord Jesus as the One who was there from eternity past and who is in the glory now. We have to speak about His relationship with us, and about the things we have seen. He is not a bastard. The Jews thought that He was just a bastard born in the land of Judea nineteen hundred thirty years ago. But this is not what we preach. We begin from eternity past; He was there in eternity past. This is why we have to give heed to the things which we have heard.</P><P>Friends, we have to give heed today. But to what do we have to give heed? We have to give heed to the things which have been heard. What have we heard? We have heard the things concerning the Lord Jesus. How much have we heard? I believe those who are sitting here have heard a great deal about the Lord Jesus. We have heard so much. What should we do now?</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
