   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR A PROPER HEART</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This principle applies to unbelievers and to believers as well.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul tells us that one day we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today every word in the New Testament is a word of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But on the day we stand before the judgment seat of Christ, the words of the New Testament may become to us words of condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This will be our situation if during our years as saved and regenerated people we harden our hearts and do not turn them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once again we see that the principle is the same both with the ministry of Moses in the Old Testament and the ministry in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether the ministry is to us righteousness or condemnation, Spirit or death, depends on our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all need to be exhorted to have a proper heart whenever we listen to the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If our heart is right, we shall receive great blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if our heart is hard, we shall not be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are indifferent, we shall not be blessed through the ministry of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, indifference causes hardness of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you are indifferent toward the Lord s speaking, eventually you will no longer care for His word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indifference will become a veil between you and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Moses was speaking to the people, there probably were many who did not oppose him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They simply failed to receive his word with an open heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They were indifferent to what Moses was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This attitude of indifference caused Moses to put a veil on his face as a sign that the people were not willing to receive the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to Exodus 34, when Moses, the servant of the Lord, spoke with the Lord, he took off the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moses heart was neither hard nor indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead of being turned away from the Lord, it was absolutely for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was the reason Moses did not wear a veil in speaking with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Exodus 34 emphasizes the fact that when Moses spoke to the people, he put on the veil, but when he spoke with God, he took it off.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is a very serious matter for any servant of the Lord to be unveiled in speaking to the Lord, but veiled in speaking to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This would be a sign that the condition of those who hear God s word is not healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not believe that Moses was happy when he found it necessary to put a veil on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But he certainly must have been happy when he could remove the veil in speaking with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At such times, he must have had a wonderful enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, when he came out to speak with the people and had to put a veil on his face, his heart must have been heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, he was burdened to speak to the people on behalf of the Lord; on the other hand, he could not speak with joy or happiness, but with heaviness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This may also be the experience of faithful servants of the Lord today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When they speak to God s people, they sometimes may speak without joy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when they go to the Lord to have fellowship with Him, they are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although there is a veil when they speak to the people, there is no veil when they talk with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The veil does not exist on the side of the Lord s servants; it exists on the side of the people whose hearts are hard, indifferent, and turned away from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not think that the law can be a ministry of condemnation and death and that the gospel of grace in the New Testament cannot be such a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To unbelievers and even to believers who are indifferent in heart, the gospel of grace may become a ministry of condemnation and death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This should cause us to be serious about the Lord s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For God to speak to us is a very significant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How dreadful for our hearts to be indifferent when the Lord comes to us to have fellowship with us or to converse with us!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Would you not be insulted if someone you were talking to did not care for what you were saying?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all would be deeply troubled by such an attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How much more serious it is for us to be indifferent toward God s speaking to us in His grace!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The gracious God is the speaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because He cares so much for us, He speaks to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are indifferent toward His speaking, it is a sign that our heart has become hard.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This will cause God to be unhappy; it will also make His servants unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before the Lord s servant came to speak with you, his face was shining.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But after talking to you for a while, he became displeased because of your indifference.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Immediately, you are veiled from seeing the glory of the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This veil is a sign that there is some problem in your heart with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Your heart may be hard, cold, or indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is serious.</S>
