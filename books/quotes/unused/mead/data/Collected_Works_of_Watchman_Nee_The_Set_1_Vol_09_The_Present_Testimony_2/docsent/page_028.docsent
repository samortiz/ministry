   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let us go on to read 2 Samuel 6:1-4 and 6:6b-7.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the Lord of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah...accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark...Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When many people come to this point, they ask, "What is the reason for this?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This should be to his credit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He did not do anything bad."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But God immediately smote him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to know that a principle in the Old Testament is that God's glory depends on the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the ark, God's glory, falters, and you step forth to uphold it, is this not a very good thing?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But God wants man to obey His instructions more than He wants him to help in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God does not need man to uphold His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a man touches the ark, God will slay him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The question is not the seriousness of the consequence of the ark's fall, but whether God has commanded you to do something related to its fall.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You may think that when everything is peaceful and trouble-free, you should naturally not touch the ark for fear of danger to your life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, when the ark is at a critical point of failing, you assume that it is your duty to touch and uphold it, lest it fall.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You assume that you have a way to comply with the necessities of circumstances and, therefore, will not die.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But with God, one rule applies to all; there is no room for change according to circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whoever does anything without God's command will incur either physical death or spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God does not ask whether we have done a good or a bad job.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Neither does He ask whether or not we are helping Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He said that man's hands should not touch the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, whoever touches it will surely die.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God would rather let the ark fall into pieces than to let men help Him without His command.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Too often we identify various needs, and we begin to help God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But we should never do what Uzzah did; our hands should never reach forth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should never step forth to help just because the circumstances beckon our help.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's command is the only thing that we should pay attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who want to comply with the necessities of the circumstances for the purpose of rescuing a situation due to its urgency, without waiting for God's command, never please God in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The work can be left temporarily, outwardly in failure, but God's sovereignty cannot be set aside for a moment, and man's flesh must not be unbridled at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God does not need the flesh to uphold and help His work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, He has to judge all activities of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many people want to do things which God has not given them; they have a craving for many things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They insist on pleasing God according to their own ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What God has not commanded them to do, they, on the contrary, do with all their might.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Little do they know that by so doing, they do not please God, and they also commit a sin in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we were unbelievers, we all conducted our lives according to our wisdom and did many things which were against God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once we are saved, we think that we can use our wisdom to serve and help God according to our perception of what is good.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Little do we realize that, just as it was a sin to oppose God with our wisdom when we were unbelievers, it is also a sin to help God in His work with our wisdom after we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God does not need our wisdom to help Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is not pleased when man uses his wisdom to oppose Him; neither is He pleased when man uses his wisdom to help Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God does not need man to help His work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must take the principle of the cross and reject all activities of the self life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must be willing to put the flesh to death and be ready to forsake our own ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whenever we assume that by doing this or that, we will prosper God's work, we prove to others that we have never forsaken the self and have never known the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Man must be brought to a position of nothingness before God can use him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May we not act presumptuously so that we damage God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should pay attention only to God's command and to nothing else besides.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even if the work collapses before our eyes, we should pay no attention to the collapse; rather, we should persist in our affairs and maintain our position before God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God will not hold us responsible for what He has not commanded.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although everything may collapse around us, God still will not reprove us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Actually, every presumptuous act arises from the fact that man's wisdom has not yet passed through the dealing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today God requires that we would lay hold of this matter: whatever God has instructed, we should do; whatever God has not instructed, we should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have to hold on to our position and should not go beyond our duties to meddle in the affairs of others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Perhaps some consider this way to be too narrow, that if a man takes this way, his work will become too quiet and ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, "that day" will show whether this was the right way or not.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You will know then whether any work outside of God's will was good or worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Let me put it in a blunt way: if the way of undisciplined self-appointment were applied in our human employment, we would definitely be suspended.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we were in an army, we would certainly be court-martialed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is fortunate that we have the overshadowing of the Lord's blood and are spared from the Lord's severe dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But at the judgment seat this kind of work will be shown to be cause for reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Please read 2 Chronicles 26:16-21, in which a king wanted to do things according to his own intention.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God's command said that only the sons of Aaron could carry out the holy service and priesthood; only they were allowed to enter the temple to burn incense.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Besides this class of people, no one else could perform this work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But Uzziah insisted on doing this work.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He went into the temple himself to burn incense.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Consequently, God punished him, and immediately leprosy rose up on his forehead.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This account affords us a great warning.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should never do anything on our own initiative that God has not commanded, lest we be punished by God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Spiritually speaking, leprosy is filthiness and sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All those who presumptuously act without God's command are filthy and sinful before God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In God's work, there is no room for natural enthusiasm.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Man cannot apply natural enthusiasm in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Entering the temple and burning incense is good, but because Uzziah did something that God had not commanded, it became a punishable sin.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The consequence of participating capriciously in God's work was a lifetime of leprosy.</S>
