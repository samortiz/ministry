<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. CHRIST EXECUTING HIS JUDGMENT<br>OVER THE WORLD</H2><P>Psalm 94 reveals that Christ will execute His judgment over the world. Verse 1 says, "O God of vengeance, O Jehovah, /O God of vengeance, shine forth!" Because there is a great deal of injustice on earth today, there is the need for the God of vengeance to shine forth. When Christ reigns He will shine, and this shining will be His vengeance executed over the unjust world.</P><P>Verse 10 says, "He who disciplines the nations,/He who teaches man knowledge, does He not reprove?" When Christ reigns He will discipline the nations. Apparently this is not happening today, for it may seem that God is not doing anything regarding world affairs. Actually, God is reigning and, at least to some extent, He has been disciplining the nations. For instance, in World War II He dealt with Hitler, Mussolini, and Japan. In the coming kingdom age, Christ will discipline every nation much like a father disciplines his children. At that time, the judgment in this world will return unto righteousness (v. 15a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. CHRIST AS A GREAT KING<br>POSSESSING THE EARTH</H2><P>In these psalms the earth, the world, the peoples, and the nations are mentioned again and again. Psalm 95 unveils Christ as a great King possessing the earth. Jehovah as Christ is a great King above all gods (v. 3). In His hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are His also (v. 4). The sea is His. He made it, and His hands formed the dry land (v. 5). Therefore, the psalmist says, "Come, let us worship and bow down;/Let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker" (v. 6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. CHRIST COMING TO JUDGE<br>THE EARTH, THE WORLD, AND THE PEOPLES<br>WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS AND TRUTH<br>AND REIGNING OVER THE NATIONS</H2><P>In 96:3-13 we see that Christ will come to judge the earth, the world, and the peoples with righteousness and truth and that He will reign over the nations. The word "peoples" in verses 3, 5, 7, 10, and 13 indicates that people of every race and color will be judged by Him. In verse 13 the psalmist concludes by saying that Jehovah "is coming to judge the earth;/He will judge the world with righteousness,/And the peoples with His truth." This surely reveals that God will recover His title and right over the earth through the reign of Christ.</P>
