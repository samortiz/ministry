   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ALL DIFFERENCES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REMOVED BY THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The point we are burdened to emphasize in this message is that on the cross Christ has slain all the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These ordinances were related to the differences between the peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many Christians know that on the cross Christ dealt with sin, the flesh, the self, the old man, the world, and the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But not many also realize that on the cross Christ dealt with the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hallelujah, all the ordinances have been slain!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How we thank Him for revealing this to the churches in His recovery!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The cross has dealt with sin so that we may be saved; with the world, the old man, the flesh, and the self, so that we may be sanctified; and with the Devil, Satan, that we may be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we see that the cross has also slain the ordinances so that we may be one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although we are different as far as physical characteristics are concerned, actually there should no longer be any difference among those in the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to Colossians 3:11, in the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only is there no natural person in the new man, but there is no possibility for there to be any natural person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the new man there is only one person Christ who is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The differences between the peoples have been removed by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What a wonderful gospel this is!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The ordinances that once divided the peoples have been abolished, and now we have true peace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are no longer strangers we are fellow-citizens of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are no longer sojourners we are members of the household of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all are citizens of God s kingdom and folks in God s family.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This revelation is made real to us in the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the spirit we are one new man in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if we consider our situation by analyzing in the mind, the natural differences will become apparent once again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those from a certain country or region may regard themselves as superior to others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This will give all the others a sense that they are strangers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The same thing is true whenever those from a particular local church regard their church as superior.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we would be faithful to the vision in this portion of the Word, we need to remain in the spirit where we shall experience the genuine building up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul s concluding point in this chapter is that both universally and locally the church must be built up as God s dwelling place in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>MINISTERING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>IN ALL KINDS OF MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Concerning the meetings, we should not hold on to any ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may enjoy releasing our spirit in a particular way, but we should not insist that others follow that way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even if the meetings in certain localities are very different from those to which we are accustomed, we should still be able to minister life and supply the riches of Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, we should also be willing to receive help from others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way we shall have true fellowship and experience a mutual supply.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not even allow the terminology with which we are familiar to be a hindrance to fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Other Christians may not be familiar with the word economy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In such a case, it may be better for us to speak of God s will than about God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may share with others that God s will is to work Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may prove our point by quoting Ephesians 3:17, a verse which speaks about Christ making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should always focus our attention on Christ and not become involved in disputes over doctrines or practices.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Admittedly, it takes a great deal of learning and experience to know how to minister Christ to others in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nevertheless, it is important for us to learn how to adapt to meetings that differ from our own and how to function in those meetings properly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For example, if those in a certain locality have the practice of offering long prayers or giving long testimonies, we should simply follow their way, not insist on short and quick prayers and testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If, however, we insist on our way of praying or testifying, we may offend others and cause them to think unnecessarily that we are strange or peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is important for all of us to learn to minister life in all kinds of Christian meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should never despise the ways of meeting that are different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the contrary, in any meeting we should be able to dispense into the saints the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If in our experience we have truly slain all the ordinances, we shall be able to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For the sake of oneness and for the ministry of life, we shall be able to adapt to the way practiced by others in their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not think that simply because those in a particular locality emphasize the Pentecostal gifts, they are not a proper local church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As long as they have the standing of the church, they are the church in that locality, even if the meetings are filled with the activities often associated with Pentecostalism.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If they are genuine Christians who have seen the way of the church and have begun to practice the church life, we must recognize them as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Their meetings may differ from ours, but that does not mean that they are not the church in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you insist that they are not a genuine local church, they may say the same thing about the church in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you are involved in arguments about the way to meet, you may claim that your way is right, but they may insist that their practice is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To be entangled in such arguments is to be involved in ordinances once again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we hold on to certain ordinances and insist on certain practices, we immediately become sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, for the proper church life, we must set aside all the ordinances and concentrate on ministering Christ to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>THE CHURCH LIFE WITHOUT ORDINANCES</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We in the Lord s recovery have no intention to form another denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Rather, we need to be rescued from all divisiveness and receive all genuine Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the meetings we may practice pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord, but we should not allow either of these practices to become ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Perhaps in the years to come the Lord will give us something new related to the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Regarding our faith in Christ and our belief in the Bible, we cannot change.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But as far as the way to meet, we should always be open to receive something new and better from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this way we shall practice the church life without ordinances.</S>
