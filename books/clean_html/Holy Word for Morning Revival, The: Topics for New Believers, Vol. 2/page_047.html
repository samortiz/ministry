<h2 class="head2">The New Jerusalem&mdash;Its Basic Structure</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Its Base with Its Street</h2>
<p>In understanding what the base of the New Jerusalem is, it is helpful to see that, according to Revelation 21, the New Jerusalem must be a golden mountain. The city is pure gold (v. 18).<sup>295</sup> [Moreover,] the entire city has one street (21:21; 22:1), yet this one street reaches all twelve gates. Also, the wall is one hundred forty-four cubits high (21:17), and the city itself is twelve thousand stadia high (21:16&mdash;one stadion equals about six hundred feet). These facts indicate that the city proper must be a mountain, a mountain of gold. On top of the mountain is a throne, from which the street spirals down to the bottom to reach the twelve gates. One street, descending from the top to the bottom, reaches and serves all twelve gates.<sup>296</sup> As we consider these matters, we realize that...this golden mountain is the base of the city.<sup>297</sup> In typology gold signifies the divine nature.<sup>298</sup> This indicates that God the Father in His nature (2 Pet. 1:4), signified by the pure gold, is the base on which this organic building is built.</p>
<p>[In addition,] the base of the New Jerusalem and its street are joined as one [Rev. 21:18b, 21b]. The fact that the street is a part of the base indicates that God the Father&rsquo;s nature is the street (way&mdash;John 14:6) which has no turns or corners but is a circling (eternal) spiral, leading up to and joining with the throne of God at the top of the city, out of which issues this organic building&rsquo;s administration and its supply (Rev. 22:1-2).</p>
<p>The golden street signifies that the divine nature should be our way....This is much higher than living according to any kind of teaching or instruction.<sup>299</sup> The inward being of our Christian life must be God&rsquo;s golden nature. We should live, walk, and do everything based upon the golden nature within us.<sup>300</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">Its Gates with Its Availability</h2>
<p>The twelve gates bear the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. This indicates...that the Old Testament saints are constituents of this organic building....Israel is the entry because they were the first ones joined to God. Having been joined to God, they then became an entry for the Gentiles to enter into God&rsquo;s grace.<sup>301</sup> [Furthermore,] Revelation 21:21 tells us that the twelve gates of the New Jerusalem are twelve pearls.<sup>302</sup> Pearls are produced by oysters in the waters of death. When an oyster is wounded by a grain of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the grain of sand and makes it into a precious pearl. This depicts Christ as the living One coming into the death waters, being wounded by us, and secreting His life over us to make us into precious pearls for the building of God&rsquo;s eternal expression. That the twelve gates of the holy city are twelve pearls signifies that regeneration through the death-overcoming and life-secreting Christ is the entrance into the city. This meets the requirement of the law, which is represented by Israel [v. 12b].<sup>303</sup> The law...is useful in proving whether or not we are genuine sons of God. Grace is the mother who produces the sons, and the law checks out these sons to prove that they are genuine and thus entitled to receive the inheritance....Our entrance into the New Jerusalem was altogether legal, lawful, and justified because Christ, by His death and resurrection, completely fulfilled the requirements of the law.<sup>304</sup> Such an entry today is available to all the people on this earth in four directions: east, north, south, and west. This is signified by the twelve gates. Three gates are on each of the four sides [v. 13]. The three gates signify the processed Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.<sup>305</sup></p>
