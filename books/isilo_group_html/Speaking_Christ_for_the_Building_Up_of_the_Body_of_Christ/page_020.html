<h1 class="title">KNOWING THE HYMNS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:26; Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16</h1>
<p>If we desire to be the speaking ones in the meetings, we have to know the hymns. In order for us to enrich, strengthen, enliven, refresh, and uplift our meetings, we need to use the hymns. We have seen that according to 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25, we need both speaking and singing in our meetings. The speaking is not only the speaking of the word of God or the speaking forth of Christ but also the speaking of the hymns. The first item listed by Paul in 1 Corinthians 14:26 is a psalm. A psalm is poetry. In both Ephesians 5:19 and Colossians 3:16, we are charged to speak in hymns. This indicates that the saints in the early Christian meetings used a lot of hymns. Many times we may not be able to find a verse or some verses in the Bible to meet the real need in the meeting, but we can easily find a hymn to meet the need. This is why we have to know the hymns. If we use the hymns adequately and properly in our meetings, they will be uplifted, enlivened, and refreshed. But we have to do everything in a living way, not in a legal way. Legality brings in death and deadness. We must stay away from the legal deadness. We should try to do everything in a very living way that is flexible and applicable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR WORK WITH THE HYMNS</h2>
<p>Brother Nee was the first person to put out a hymnal among us in mainland China. By the time I came into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in 1932, we had a hymnal of one hundred and eighty-three hymns. The majority of those hymns were translated by Brother Nee. Some new hymns were also written by him and one or two others. That hymnal contained many hymns from the Brethren. Brother Nee entitled that hymnal <em>The Little Flock.</em> Many of the missionaries called us &ldquo;the little flock&rdquo; fifty or sixty years ago because of the name of our hymnal. Brother Nee announced a few times that &ldquo;the little flock&rdquo; was just the title of our hymnal and not a name that we adopted to denominate ourselves. Despite this, people still called us &ldquo;the little flock.&rdquo; As a result, Brother Nee made the decision to change the name of our hymnal to <em>Hymns,</em> which is also the name of our present hymnal.</p>
<p>In the early 1940s we in northern China became prevailing in our gospel work, so I began to collect some hymns for the gospel such as &ldquo;Rock of Ages&rdquo; (#1058), &ldquo;Jesus, lover of my soul&rdquo; (#1057), and &ldquo;In tenderness He sought me&rdquo; (#1068). Because these hymns were so popular, Brother Nee did not collect them in his earlier hymnal. But in the early forties, we felt that we had the need to collect these hymns in a small hymnal for the sake of the gospel work. In 1947 and 1948, many young people in Shanghai were brought into the church life through our work on the campus. At that time our hymnal was not adequate to meet the need of these young people, so I prepared a hymnal with short songs that were good for the young people. Thus, when we moved to Taiwan for the Lord&rsquo;s work, we had three hymnals. The first collection of one hundred and eighty-three hymns was compiled by Brother Nee, and the other two hymnals were compiled by me.</p>
<p>From 1960 to 1961, I was burdened to minister Christ as the life-giving Spirit to the saints in Taiwan. By that time we were short of hymns on Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church. In 1961 I spent two months to write eighty-five new hymns on these subjects. A number of these have been translated and are in our present English hymnal. Hymn #499&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!&rdquo;; #501&mdash;&ldquo;O glorious Christ, Savior mine&rdquo;; and #608&mdash;&ldquo;What mystery, the Father, Son, and Spirit,&rdquo; were written in 1961 in Taipei and translated into English in 1964 in Los Angeles. After I wrote these hymns in Taiwan in 1961, the saints there had four hymnals to bring to the church meetings.</p>
<p>When I came to the United States and the Lord&rsquo;s recovery began in this country in 1962, we had the deep sensation that we needed an adequate hymnal which could greatly help our meetings. When I traveled throughout the United States from 1962 to 1964, I looked at various hymnals to see if there were any hymns that would be useful for our collection. When we compiled the hymns in our hymnal, we also looked into the British Keswick Convention hymnal. Most of those hymns were useful to us, so a number of them were included in our present hymnal. From 1963 to 1964, I wrote about two hundred new hymns which were also included in our hymnal.</p>
<p>Many of the hymns that we collected from other hymnals were adjusted, corrected, and improved by us. Some of the lines were not according to the truth of the Scriptures. Hymn #1068 in our hymnal is a good example of this. I love this hymn very much, so I translated it into Chinese. But it was seriously wrong in one point. The chorus said:</p>
<p class="hbody">Oh, the love that sought me!<br />
Oh, the blood that bought me!<br />
Oh, the grace that brought me to the fold,<br />
Wondrous grace that brought me to the fold!</p>
<p>According to the scriptural revelation, the fold signifies the law, or Judaism as the religion of the law, in which God&rsquo;s chosen people were kept and guarded in custody and ward until Christ came (John 10:1-9). The flock, on the other hand, signifies the church as the one Body of Christ (v. 16). At the time this hymn was written, the church was considered as a fold, but the fold in John 10 refers to the Jewish religion. The Lord&rsquo;s desire was to bring the Gentile and the Jewish believers together into one flock to form the church. When the pasture is not available in the winter time or in the night, the sheep must be kept in the fold. When the pasture is ready, there is no further need for the sheep to remain in the fold. All the sheep can be led out of the fold to be gathered together as a flock to enjoy the pasture. The pasture (v. 9) signifies Christ as the feeding place for the flock. Because of this scriptural revelation, we changed the word &ldquo;fold&rdquo; in the chorus of this hymn to &ldquo;flock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By reading the hymns written in the last century, I discovered that many of them had the thought of going to heaven, using the Jordan River as a type of death and Canaan as a type of heaven. When I was young, I sang some of these hymns. One hymn talks about the cold waves of Jordan. When we collected some of these hymns for our hymnal, we changed this thought of going to heaven to the thought of being a victor, an overcomer.</p>
<p>Charles Wesley, the brother of John Wesley, was a great writer of holy songs. He wrote the hymn&mdash;&ldquo;Hark! the herald angels sing.&rdquo; The last verse of this hymn in our hymnal says:</p>
<p class="hbody">Come, Desire of nations, come!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fix in us Thy humble home:<br />
Rise, the woman&rsquo;s conqu&rsquo;ring seed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruise in us the serpent&rsquo;s head;<br />
Adam&rsquo;s likeness now efface,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stamp Thine image in its place:<br />
Final Adam from above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinstate us in Thy love.</p>
<p>In the last line of this verse, Charles Wesley used the term <em>Second Adam.</em> But 1 Corinthians 15 refers to &ldquo;the last Adam&rdquo; (v. 45b) and &ldquo;the second Man&rdquo; (v. 47). To match the truth of the Scriptures, we corrected this to read &ldquo;Final Adam.&rdquo; We studied much to arrive at the word <em>final</em> since we had to have a two-syllable word to fit the meter.</p>
<p>We made these alterations to the older hymns, except where a copyright had been involved, in order to improve their accuracy in truth and enrich their spirituality in meaning. In this delicate and difficult work, we departed from the meaning and words of the original author only where it was necessary.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Speaking Christ for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
