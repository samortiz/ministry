   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Tracts Not Being Affected by Human Factors</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is another advantage to using tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In preaching the gospel, sometimes we feel too shy to use strong words in front of people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Tracts do not have this inconvenience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They can go to anyone and say anything they want.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A living preacher is often restricted by circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the preaching of the tracts is not affected by any human factors.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>New believers should learn to sow seeds with the tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>D. Passing Out Tracts Being a Way of Sowing</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Another advantage of passing out tracts is that one can sow anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Old Testament says that we should sow our seed in many waters Num 24:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It takes a considerable effort to speak to three, five, or ten persons together.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But there is no difficulty in passing out a thousand, two thousand, or three thousand tracts a day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If one person can be saved out of the thousand tracts we pass out, this is wonderful enough.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>New believers should learn to pass out tracts in large quantities.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>E. God Saving Men through Tracts</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has indeed used tracts to save people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I know of some people who slip tracts under doors.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Others drop them into mailboxes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I remember an incident in which a person received a tract and then threw it away on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Another person, who had a nail stuck in his shoe, was looking for something to cushion his foot.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He picked up the tract and stuffed it in his shoe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He returned home and began to mend his shoe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then he saw the tract and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are numerous similar cases of people being saved by tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some of these cases are actually quite marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>F. Much Prayer and Dedication of Heart</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A newly saved brother always should have tracts ready in his pockets, and he should pass them out when he is free.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Like the work of leading men to Christ, we should do this with much prayer and dedication of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While we are passing out tracts, we can speak a word or two to others or we can remain silent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Either way is good.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a new believer practices this, he will receive great benefit from it.</S>
