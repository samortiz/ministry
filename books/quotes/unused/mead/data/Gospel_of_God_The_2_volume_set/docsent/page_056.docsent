   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This is something most precious in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is the only way that Christians can have boldness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Have you ever realized that inasmuch as love is precious, it is never that reliable?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You cannot bring a person to court just because he has not loved you for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no such thing as love in a law court.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if unrighteousness occurs or if sin arises, the law will speak.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God likes to give us a handle, something for us to hold on to.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through such a handle, our faith can be strengthened and the promises of God can be fulfilled in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This handle is the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God knows that we may doubt, so He works faith into us through His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can say to Him, "God, since You have given me Your Son and have allowed Him to die, You must forgive my sins."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sometimes we hear people praying, "O God, I want to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Please save me!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have sinned, but I am determined to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Please be merciful to me and have the Lord Jesus die for me."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When such ones pray, they may cry bitterly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They act as if God's heart is very hard and believe that before God would forgive them or turn His heart toward them they have to cry much.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who pray this way do not know what the gospel is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the Son of God had not come to the earth, their crying and imploring before God might work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the Son of God has come, and the problem of sin has been solved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The redemptive work on the cross has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When people come to God, there is no need for poor begging anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since God has given us His Son, He can forgive sins through His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is faithful to do so; He is not being a liar by doing so.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And He is righteous to do so; there is nothing unrighteous in it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When righteousness is involved, faithfulness is also involved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Most people today are ignorant first of God's righteousness and then of the fact that the Lord Jesus has accomplished God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>People do not know that God's righteousness is manifested apart from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They still try to work up righteousness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They are like the man who owes ten thousand talents of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is absolutely no way to repay the debt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the man still tries to save six cents by getting off at an earlier stop, hoping to save to repay his debt.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is still calculating, hoping to save a little here or there, to do this or that, to generate a little money for the repayment of the debt.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He still wants to say to his creditor that though he owes ten thousand talents, he does have a few pennies with him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He does not realize that the full sum has already been sent to his home.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man has no idea what God has done in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because of this, the apostle Paul tells us what attitude man should have.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Concerning God's righteousness, we need to look at two passages in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first passage is in Romans 10.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verses 3 and 4 say, "For because they were ignorant of God's righteousness and sought to establish their own righteousness, they were not subject to the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to everyone who believes."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I love these two verses.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we read these verses in relation to the gospel, our hearts must be warmed up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These verses say that the Jews did not know that God's righteousness had been established; they were still seeking to establish their own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They tried their best to be good, to exchange their work for their salvation, and to exchange their righteousness for life and all that God has given to them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But Paul said that all those seeking to establish their own righteousness are not subject to the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not to be subject to the righteousness of God is not to be subject to the work that God has accomplished in His Son Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's righteousness is accomplished in His Son Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The cross of Jesus is both a manifestation of God's love and an accomplishment of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the cross of Jesus, God's righteousness was accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If any man wants to establish his own righteousness today, he is denying the sufficiency of the Lord's work on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Never think that we can add something to the work that the Lord Jesus has finished.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Never think that we can help it or patch it up a little.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All those who seek to establish their own righteousness are not subject to God's righteousness at all.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If someone sends a sum of money to my home to pay back a loan he has made to me and I still try to save a few pennies to repay him, I am in reality despising what he has given me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All those who seek to establish their own righteousness are blaspheming God.</S>
