   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Learning to Humble Ourselves before God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brothers and sisters, if you want to continue in the way of Philadelphia, remember to humble yourselves before God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sometimes I hear some brothers say, God s blessing is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s blessing is with us, but we must be careful when we say this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As soon as we are not careful, we have the flavor of Laodicea: We are wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let me say that the day we take this position, we have become Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Please bear in mind that we have nothing that we have not received.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those around us may be full of death, but we do not need to be conscious of the fact that we are full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those around us may be poor, but we do not need to be conscious of the fact that we are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who live before the Lord will not be conscious of their own riches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>May the Lord be merciful to us that we may learn to live before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May we be rich and yet not know that we are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was better for Moses not to know that his face was shining, even though it did shine!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once a person knows himself, he becomes Laodicea, and the result is lukewarmness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Laodicea means to know everything, but in reality to be fervent about nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In name it has everything, but it cannot sacrifice its life for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It remembers its former glory but forgets its present condition before God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Formerly, it was Philadelphia; today it is Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>CHOOSING FOR OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE PATHWAY OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today I present these four churches to us all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The last three came out of Roman Catholicism, and all four will remain until the Lord Jesus comes again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today every child of God has to choose the pathway he should take with regard to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you want to be a Roman Catholic?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do you want to be a Protestant?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you want to follow the oneness of Roman Catholicism?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do you want to follow the many denominations of Protestantism?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Or do you want to take the way of Philadelphia?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Or were you once Philadelphia but are now living in the shadow of history and boasting of your former glory, thus becoming Laodicean?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When a person becomes proud, forsakes the way of life, and neglects reality, while reminiscing on his history and his own riches, the only thing left will be the opinions of many.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Among such ones there can only be discussion and consensus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It appears to be a democratic society but bears no resemblance to the Body relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you do not know the binding, authority, and life of the Body, you do not know brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These four churches will remain with us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must be faithful to continue in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not be curious about Roman Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who are curious will always suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not touch the denominations in Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is not God s way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible shows us clearly that the Protestant movement as a whole had God s blessing, but that there are also many things which the Lord condemns and rebukes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We do not need to delve into these things or ask about them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must learn to stand on the ground of Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Always keep the Lord s word and never deny His name.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hold fast the brotherly stand and never be proud!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not be proud in the face of Catholicism, Protestantism, or the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once you are proud, you become Laodicea and are no longer Philadelphia!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As soon as you show your pride before them, you are no longer Philadelphia but Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Which way do you want to take?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May God bless His children and may the brothers take the upright path with regard to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The God-ordained pathway for the church is the way of Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I may not have tens of thousands of cases to prove that the best of God s children speak the same thing and take this same way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But I have hundreds of cases to prove what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once the general issue of Protestantism is settled, we need not nit-pick the minor issues.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Similarly, once the overall issue of Roman Catholicism is settled, we do not have to be so concerned about its minor issues.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Roman Catholic Church has twenty-one different organizations in China.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is no need to involve ourselves with the Catholic Church, and there is no need to learn about the organizations of its different daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once the overall issue of Roman Catholicism is settled, these twenty-one organizations are no longer a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Likewise, once the general issue of Protestantism is settled, we do not need to deal with all of its fifteen hundred denominations one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord s way is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is the way of Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Walk on this way, but be careful not to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once we take the way of Philadelphia, the greatest temptation is to become proud and say, We are better than you are.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our truths are clearer than yours, and we understand them better than you do!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have only the Lord s name and we are different!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Once we become proud, we fall into Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Those who follow the Lord have no pride.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord will spew the proud ones out of His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>May the Lord be merciful to us!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is a warning to all of us: We must not be proud in our speaking!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A person must live before the Lord continually before he can refrain from proud words.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Only those who live before God continually will not consider themselves rich.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Only they will not be proud!</S>
