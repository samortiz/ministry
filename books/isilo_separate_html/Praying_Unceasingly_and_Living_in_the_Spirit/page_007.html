BY NEGLECTING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>While we strengthened the migration in 1973 and focused on the propagation of the work, we unconsciously neglected and lost the Spirit. Hence, the migrations became a form. Most of what we did in our first ten years in the United States was in the Spirit, but what we did in the four years after 1972 became a form. We had less Spirit and more &ldquo;picture.&rdquo; Because we cared for the propagation of the work, we did not hold to the ground in the Spirit; we wanted to find good places and campuses to propagate the work by gaining people for the Lord. This, however, opened a door to Satan and let some ambitious ones in sheep&rsquo;s clothing sneak in. Although we knew their true condition, we tolerated them for four years because we had unconsciously turned from the Spirit to the propagation of the work; we cared too much for the propagation.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 1978, less than three months after returning to the United States from a conference in Taipei, I discovered that someone was rebelling. Initially, I discussed the matter only with my wife and said nothing to others, not even to the co-workers or the elders. The two of us prayed earnestly because the rebellious one had deceived everyone. During our prayer I realized my mistake of not standing firm in the Spirit and not holding firm to life. By turning to the work and to propagation, I had opened a back door for the enemy. I therefore resolved to do nothing but pray. Because some in sheep&rsquo;s clothing had sneaked in while we were neglecting the Spirit and life, we could not use human efforts to cause them to leave; rather, we had to stand in life. Therefore, I began to live in the spirit and in life.</p>
<p>In March, during a conference in Anaheim, I spoke concerning three keys in Matthew 16. From that point, the Lord began to take His recovery back from the hand of those who were plotting a rebellion. I received an invitation to hold a conference on the East Coast during the spring, and I went as planned. I did not know that some rebellious ones were there when I accepted the invitation. By the time I went, the situation was clear. However, while I was there, I gave messages only on life. I did not care for the outward things; I only cared for the matters of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING RESTORED TO THE SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2>
<p>After I returned to Anaheim, there was a conference in the summer that was followed by a training on Ephesians. That training was a great help. The messages on life restored the sense and the sentiment of the saints, turning us from work and propagation back to the Spirit and life. The saints were also clear that certain ones were taking the lead to rebel. Because I had emphasized the Spirit, not outward matters, with the saints, they also exercised to live in the spirit. This is how the rebellious ones were set aside.</p>
<p>After the training on Ephesians, the saints lost interest in the rebellious ones. When the rebellious ones saw that they could do nothing, they no longer wanted to stay.</p>
<p>On August 6 of that year the rebellious ones disrupted the bread-breaking meeting in the church in Anaheim. The next morning three responsible brothers came to see me concerning a rebellious one and said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, we can no longer tolerate him. He cannot remain in the eldership. We want to have an open talk with him.&rdquo; Because they were firm, I said, &ldquo;Brothers, since you have come to fellowship with me, allow me to say something. I feel that it is best for us not to do anything at present. You are the elders; I am not, so perhaps my feeling does not match yours. But according to my observation, we should not do anything. We should rather let him be.&rdquo; The brothers eventually agreed and also felt it was best not to do anything. Shortly afterward this rebellious one withdrew.</p>
<p>The messages given during the training on Ephesians had such an effect because they were on life. The work of the rebellious ones on the East Coast also reached its peak, and the saints were waiting to hear what I would say. But I did not care about outward matters; I only gave messages on life and focused on the Spirit. As a result, the saints were helped and strengthened. Those messages opened our eyes and made us clear. As a result, the rebellious ones were set aside and could do nothing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HIGHEST POINT OF THE BIBLE BEING<br />
TWO SPIRITS BECOMING ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We must understand that without the Spirit, everything we do is just a picture. Some may have problems that need to be solved, but the only solution is the Spirit. The highest point of the Bible is two spirits becoming one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). The Triune God has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension and has descended as the Spirit. Our former understanding of the Spirit was insufficient. Now we are clear why the Epistles, especially Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, stress the Spirit. The term <em>the Spirit</em> is first used in John 7:39: &ldquo;This [Jesus] said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; The Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit, that is, the Triune God.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15:45 says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; This life-giving Spirit is the Spirit. The Spirit possesses both divinity and humanity. The Spirit is the Triune God, who has passed through incarnation to put on humanity, crucifixion, and resurrection in order to bring humanity into divinity in order to become the all-inclusive Spirit. He is our Redeemer, our Savior, and our life. As the Spirit, He has entered into us to be joined with our spirit. Hence, 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the last book of the Bible, Revelation, the apostle John said, &ldquo;I was in spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day&rdquo; (1:10). At the end of the Bible there is a man in his spirit. The Bible produces such a person in the spirit. The New Testament does not tell us to walk according to the commandments, but it does say, &ldquo;Walk by the Spirit&rdquo; (Gal. 5:16). Such a walk includes our living and activities.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
