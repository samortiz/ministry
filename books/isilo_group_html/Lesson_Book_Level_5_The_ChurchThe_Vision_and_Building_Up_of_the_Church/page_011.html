[As we consider the status of the church, we shall see the reality concerning the church and the real definition of the church. Therefore, we need to get into the depth of each aspect of the status of the church.] We will use four lessons to see the main aspects of the status of the church.<h2 class=head1>I. THE ASSEMBLY OF THE CALLED OUT ONES-EKKLESIA</h2><p>[We all have to admit that since the time of the apostles until at least the sixteenth century the church was going downward. By the sixteenth century the church had fallen to the bottom, into the dark ages. It could not go any lower. At this time the Lord came in to start His recovery. He started the recovery from the very base of the biblical truth, justification by faith. Luther did see something concerning the church as well, but he did not have much time to care for this matter. He saw something of the church, yet he did not see enough.<p>A little more than two centuries later Count Zinzendorf, with so many other brothers, the so-called Moravian brothers, saw something more concerning the church. In Bohemia, on the land owned by Zinzendorf, they started to have the practice of the church. That was the first step of the Lord&#8217;s recovery of the church practice. By reading church history, you could realize that before Zinzendorf, no one was so clear concerning the church practice. Their practice was good, yet it was not complete.<p>One century later, in the early 1800&#8217;s, the Lord went on from Bohemia to England, raising up a group of seekers, including John Nelson Darby and other brothers. They began to practice the church life. Their practice was a great improvement over that which was practiced under the leadership of Zinzendorf at Bohemia. These brothers began to see that the church is the assembly of God&#8217;s called out ones (Eph. 1:22; 1 Cor. 1:2). The church is the gathering of all the dear saints who have been called in Christ out of this world. Thus, they began to drop the English term church, because they realized that it had been damaged through wrong usage. At that time fallen Christianity considered the church to be a physical building, perhaps with a &#8220;high tower&#8217;&#8217; and a bell. Even today, many parents say to their children on Sunday morning, &#8220;Let us go to church,&#8217;&#8217; referring to the wood, the stone, the brick, and the glass. How pitiful that was, and how pitiful it still is today. The Brethren dropped this wrong concept, and they even dropped the term church. They began to use the word &#8220;assembly.&#8217;&#8217; After this the Assembly of God followed them to use the word assembly.]<p>[Because the church has the status of the assembly, the ekklesia, we need to gather together. We must assemble and meet in order to have a congregation for God to work and move among us. When God&#8217;s called out ones meet together, this is the church. Without such a gathering together of the believers in a locality, there is no practical church life. The practical church life consists in the gathering of the saints in a certain locality. If believers live in a particular city but do not assemble, then in a practical way there is no church in that city. The basic concept of the church as the assembly is that the church is a gathering of the called out ones.]<p>[We need to be impressed with the fact that, as used in the New Testament with respect to the church, the Greek word ekklesia indicates that the church is a congregation called out of the world so that God may carry out His purpose. According to Genesis 1:26, man was created by God to bear His image and to carry His authority. However, man fell again and again. Eventually, in the last stage of his fall, man fell into the world, the system of Satan. In the eyes of God, as a result of the fall the entire human race has actually become the world. In John 3:16, human beings as a totality are called &#8220;the world.&#8217;&#8217; Since fallen man is in the world and has even become the world, how can God fulfill His purpose with man and through man? The only way is for God to call out a part of the human race. God has done this very thing. In applying His salvation to us, the first thing God does is to call us. Therefore, the first status of the church is that of the assembly of those who have been called out of the world by God to Himself for the fulfillment of His purpose.<p>Because the church as the assembly is separated from the world, we may say that the church is composed of the real Hebrews. The root of the word Hebrew (Gen. 14:13) means &#8220;to pass over&#8217;&#8217;; it especially means to pass over a river from one region to another and from one side to another. Hence, the word Hebrew denotes a river crosser, one who crosses a river. The church is composed of the believers who, as real Hebrews, have been called by God out of the world and have &#8220;crossed the river&#8217;&#8217; from one realm to another. Now as believers in Christ we are the called out ones, the assembly, the congregation called out by God, the ekklesia in opposition to the world, which is on the other side of the river we have crossed. Just as our forefather Abraham was called out of the land of Chaldea, so we have been called out of the world by God to be His assembly.<p>Whenever we speak of the church as the assembly, the ekklesia, we need to realize that this means that the church has been separated from the world. The first status of the church indicates a thorough separation of God&#8217;s called out ones from the world. There must be a great and thorough separation between the church as the ekklesia and the world as the system, the cosmos, of Satan. As the assembly, the church is separated entirely for God so that He may have a means to carry out His eternal purpose.]<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 5: The Church-The Vision and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
