   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS LIGHT IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although there is no measurement for the lampstand, there are many occurrences of the number three in the description of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Exodus 37:18 says, And there were six branches going out of its sides; three branches of the lampstand out of one of its sides, and three branches of the lampstand out of its other side.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The lampstand had six branches, three on two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Three, here, represents resurrection, while two represents a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On each branch there were three cups shaped like almond blossoms with calyxes and blossom buds v. 19 . The calyx is the leafy green layer of a flower, while the blossom bud is the flower itself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word cup is used to describe the whole flower, including the calyx and the blossom bud.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In addition to a calyx and the blossom bud, an almond blossom also has the almond fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The whole flower, including calyx and blossom, was a cup to bear the oil for shining the light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to Numbers 17:8, Aaron s rod budded, blossomed, and yielded almonds.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a picture of resurrection, life coming out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Aaron s rod was a dead stick, but through resurrection it brought forth almonds.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The almond blossoms with the calyxes and blossom buds depict the issue of the resurrection life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ as light to us is the issue of Christ as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The resurrection life of Christ is for the light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ could be light to us by passing through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The lampstand is full of symbols of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every branch of the lampstand is like a branch of an almond tree.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, the many occurrences of groups of three on the lampstand indicate resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On each branch of the lampstand were three almond blossoms with a calyx and blossom bud.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the flower blossoms, it yields the almond as fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that the resurrection life is the light to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Exodus 37:20-21 says, And on the lampstand were four cups made like almond blossoms, its calyxes and its blossom buds; and a calyx under two branches of one piece with it, and a calyx under two branches of one piece with it, and a calyx under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There were six branches, and at the base where each pair of branches met there was a calyx.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On each of the six branches there were three calyxes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Three branches were on one side, and three branches were on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the base of three pairs of branches were three calyxes, and on each branch there were three almond blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This totaled to seven groups of three blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the shaft of the lampstand there were an additional four almond blossoms v. 20 . It is very meaningful that there is at least one mention of the number four in the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If there had been no number four, the lampstand may have had nothing to do with us as the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, with the lampstand there are the number three and the number six, and with the shaft of the lampstand there is the number four.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The basic number is three, signifying that the entire lampstand is a matter of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But this resurrection is for man, the creature, because Christ as light is a man, that is, a creature, as signified by the four almond blossoms on the shaft.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If He were not a creature, He would be the light, but He would not be light to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because He is a creature, He is light to man, who is signified by the number six, since man was created on the sixth day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The light of Christ is wholly a matter in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is life and light in resurrection, but He is also a creature that He may be light to man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moreover, verse 24 says that the lampstand was of a talent of gold, signifying the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The light of the lampstand is the divine light of the divine nature.</S>
