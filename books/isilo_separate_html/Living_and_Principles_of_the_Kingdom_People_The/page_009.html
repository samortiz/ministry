<p>It is significant that the Lord called the kingdom people the salt of the earth. There are two types of physical salt. There is rock salt, which is dug out from the ground, and there is sea salt, which is extracted from seawater. Hence, the earth and the sea are the two sources of salt. These two sources signify the two conditions of the believers before they were saved. In the Bible the earth refers to the world that God created and desires to gain, and the sea refers to the world that Satan corrupts and occupies. The earth is composed of dust, and the sea is composed of water. Hence, dust and water both signify our condition before being saved.</p>
<p>In the Bible dust often signifies the man whom God created, and water signifies the fallen man corrupted by Satan. Genesis 2:7 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground.&rdquo; First Corinthians 15:47 says, &ldquo;The first man is out of the earth, earthy.&rdquo; This means that he was a man of dust (cf. Gen. 3:19). Therefore, dust signifies the sinless and uncorrupted man created by God. In Revelation 17 the apostle John saw the harlot, Babylon the Great, sitting on the waters. Verse 15 says, &ldquo;The waters,...where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.&rdquo; Here <em>waters</em> signifies fallen men corrupted by Satan. With regard to creation, man is of dust from the earth that God created and desires to gain. However, with regard to the fall, man is corrupted in the world occupied by Satan.</p>
<p>That salt is produced out of the earth and from seawater signifies that the kingdom people were once like people in the world, because they were created and were natural and because they were fallen and corrupted. However, the Lord&rsquo;s salvation delivered the kingdom people out of the earth and the sea. Just as salt is different in nature from dust and water, so the kingdom people are neither earthy and natural nor fallen and corrupted. They are a different kind of people; they are people of the new creation (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>
<p>In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord said that we are the salt of the earth, in order to show that we must be freed from the elements of dust and water so that we may manifest the function of salt. Of course, evil and sin should not be found in us, but even the goodness that is out of our natural being, which people praise, should not be preserved. Such goodness replaces the spiritual reality and prevents us from living in the reality of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Regrettably, many Christians still live in their natural goodness. Some even live in sins. It is difficult to distinguish salt when it is mixed with dust, and salt that is added to water will dissolve and disappear. Some saints are good Christians, but they are not spiritual Christians, for although they may have goodness, meekness, and humility, they do not have God. Because they remain in their natural goodness, they are still dust. Some saints are still mixed with worldly people and have a corrupt and evil element in their living. This indicates that they are still in the sea; hence, they are unable to manifest the function of salt. The kingdom people are the most unique people in the universe. They do not merely have the nature of the God-created man, nor do they have the nature of the Satan-corrupted man. Just as salt does not have the elements of dust and water, we should not possess the elements of natural goodness or corruption.</p>
<p>Salt that does not possess dust or water is not merely clean; it is also pure. Purity is different from cleanness. Something that is clean may still have mixture, but something that is pure has no mixture. Every grain of salt is transparent and clear, and it tastes pure. These characteristics indicate that salt is pure.</p>
<p>As the kingdom people, we should manifest the killing and seasoning functions of salt. On the one hand, we should eliminate corruption and blend flavors; on the other hand, we should deal with the elements of natural goodness and corruption. If we are under the authority of the heavens and allow God to live out of us, we will be delivered from the elements of dust and water to become pure, having no mixture. Then we will spontaneously have a germ-killing and corruption-preventing influence on the world. Both the church and the present corrupted world need such people. Wherever the kingdom people go, they make peace, eliminate discord, and remove factors of conflict. This is the function of the salt of the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Willing to Lose the Self</h2>
<p>In order for salt to manifest its function, it must be lost in the substance in which it is being blended. Likewise, for the kingdom people to manifest the function of salt, they also must be lost among the people with whom they are blending. This requires a great price. This price is perhaps greater than the price of dealing with the elements of natural goodness and corruption.</p>
<p>Some believers have a normal spiritual condition; that is, they seek the Lord and are under His dealings. They have attained the status of being salt. However, they are not able to manifest the function of salt in the church. If we carefully study this situation, we will realize that these believers try to remain whole and are unwilling to be lost among the believers whom they contact. For example, a brother may desperately ask such a believer for help, but the believer replies, &ldquo;I do not have time to talk, because it is my prayer time.&rdquo; This believer cares only for his spirituality and living before the Lord while neglecting the needs of others. As a result, he cannot manifest his function in the church.</p>
<p>The function of salt depends on its being dissolved and lost. If we are willing to lose ourselves, we will become a supply to others. Some believers are excessive in pursuing the Lord. It is right to pursue the Lord, but the purpose of our pursuit is the manifestation of our function. Someone who is unwilling to lose his self will not have any function. The Lord often requires us to lose our spiritual strength in order to help others. If we preserve our spiritual &ldquo;wholeness&rdquo; and our self, we will not be able to manifest our usefulness before the Lord.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
