In preaching the gospel we have to follow these ways to present the good news to men effectively. Throughout church history many evangelists raised up by God have gained sinners through these ways. Here we would like to analyze these different ways of preaching the gospel. The Bible unveils these ways, and God's evangelists have used them again and again in the past. Broadly speaking, there are six ways to preach the gospel. Today we will take a look at these six ways. Those who have had experience in preaching the gospel, as well as those who are about to launch into this work, should pray to God to show them one of these ways. The way you choose should match the kind of person you are. Generally speaking, everyone should choose one way. He may choose more than one way, but he should major in one of them, while treating the others as supplementary ways. Of course, when one moves to a new place, he may take a different way based on the situation of that place. These six ways of preaching the gospel can be classified under two categories. The first is negative, and the second is positive. Three ways are found in the negative category, and the other three ways found in the positive category. On the negative side there are sin, judgment, and the world. On the positive side there are God's love, God's righteousness, and a living faith. Let us first speak about the three negative ways.</p><h2 class="head2">Sin</h2><p>Some put emphasis on the evil and ill of sin. The Bible shows us that sin is both loathsome and evil. Many servants of God often use this way to preach the gospel. An evangelist may use this method to point out the evil of sin, and sinners may feel the sinfulness of sin and be condemned and convicted. The basic goal of this method is to awaken men to a consciousness of their sin. Those who use this method have to do it with skill; they have to be enlightened concerning the matter of sin. A gospel preacher has to have his own style; he has to develop his own specialty. If you take this way, you have to apply yourself to it. You must make others feel that they are sinful. You have to convict them with a sense of sin. You have to show them that sin is filthy. Let them feel the pressure and burden of sin. You should not only talk about sin as a term, but you must let them feel the pain of sin, the repulsiveness of sin. Taking this way requires one skill: You must let people feel sin. There is no need to do too many things. As long as you can make people weep when they think of their sin, the gospel will get into them, and you will have done your job.</p><p>In order to take this way, you must concentrate on convicting men of their own sins. If you choose this way, you must spend time before the Lord. You should ask the Lord to show you how to awaken men to a sense of sin. Of course, you must first have experienced the pain of sin. You must first have confessed your sins before others can pick up a profound sense of sin. If you want to take this way, you must apply yourself to this subject, whether in private meditation, in the study of the Scripture, in listening to sermons, or in research for stories and illustrations. In everything you should ask yourself how you can increase men's sense of condemnation concerning sin. You should take this task to heart. If you do, you will be able to present the evil and ill of sin to men in your preaching in a vivid way. When they see sin, they will be able to know the Lord's salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">Judgment</h2><p>After man sinned, he was sentenced to death by God. The wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23). However, death is not the end of man; after death there is judgment (Heb. 9:27)! An unbeliever will suffer judgment after he dies. The punishment is eternal perdition. He will suffer in the lake of fire forever. The Gospels speak of the Gehenna of fire (Matt. 5:22). Luke 16:19-31 speaks of the story of Lazarus and the rich man. It indicates that an unbeliever will suffer in the fire of Hades after he dies. This shows that the fire of Hades is for now. When an unbeliever dies, he will go straight to Hades to suffer its fire. The Bible is very clear and explicit about death, judgment, hell, and the lake of fire. In preaching the gospel, we cannot be general. General preaching will only produce general results. Every gospel preacher must have something specific and particular. Some preachings specialize in judgment; they make people feel the horror of judgment. Paul was a good example. He knew the terror of judgment, and he made others feel this terror (Acts 24:25).</p><p>A man can receive the Lord through a message on the evil of sin, or he can receive the Lord through a message on the terror of hell. It is hard to find a person who is good in every subject. Do not think that you are a champion in everything. You have to find your specialty. As long as you can develop a specialty, you can save men. Some are good at preaching about hell; they can make people fear and even tremble. Once when Charles Finney was preaching, men held on to the pillars of the chapel for fear of falling into hell. One of his specialties was the terror of hell. In order to pry something open, we have to use a sharp and pointed knife. The same is true in preaching the gospel. All we need is one specialty; there is no need to be too broad. In learning to preach the gospel, you do not need to learn everything. If a man tries to be good in every subject, he will end up not being good in any of them. It is best if some brothers can specialize on judgment.</p>
