   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WALKING IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first three verses we have covered on the Spirit, John 3:6, John 4:24, Romans 8:16, make up one group; and the next three verses, 1 Corinthians 15:45, 2 Corinthians 3:17, and 1 Corinthians 6:17, make up a second group.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we need to consider a third group of verses regarding the Spirit, Galatians 5:16 and Romans 8:4-6.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Galatians 5:16 says, Walk in spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>. If you walk in spirit, everything will be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There will be no need for you to bear the cross, to crucify yourself, or to try to commit spiritual suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many seeking Christians are trying to terminate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They say, I am so bad.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If I could crucify myself, everything would be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But God does not expect you to crucify yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although no one could possibly crucify himself, many Christians are still trying their best to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No one can commit suicide by crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In some respects, the efforts of many Christians in trying to crucify themselves resemble Hinduism.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many say, Oh, we must bear the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>My wife, my children, and all my relatives are crosses.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is today s pitiful Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although it is full of crosses, there is no Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I cannot find a verse in the Epistles telling us to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Epistles it is not a matter of bearing the cross; it is a matter of walking in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The cross is on the hill of Calvary, but the Spirit is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We simply need to walk according to the spirit Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hallelujah for the spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE KILLING POWER BEING IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many Christians are still under the influence of Madame Guyon who asked God to give her more crosses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It seemed that one cross was not sufficient; she sought many of them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the Bible tells us to be filled in our spirit, not with crosses, but with the Lord Eph 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It tells us to be filled in our spirit with His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Forget about bearing the cross in a religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, do not misunderstand me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not say, I personally heard Witness Lee tell us to throw away the cross and forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What heresy!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order for us to be redeemed and justified, we need the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus died on the cross to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now we are justified through the blood of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, we definitely need the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But after we are saved, we need to walk daily in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this we need the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nevertheless, some may still argue and say, Now that we are walking in the presence of God, don t we need to cross out ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yes, we do need to be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the killing element, the power to be crossed out, is not in our mind or in our mental figuration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the past I read some books about reckoning ourselves dead.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After reading these books, I did a great deal of reckoning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the more I reckoned myself dead, the more alive I became.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Reckoning simply did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I believe many of you have had the same experience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It seems that we were dead if we did not reckon.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But as soon as we began to reckon, we became alive, for our reckoning stirred us up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I was young, I sometimes used to lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever I lost my temper, I regretted it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This was especially true after I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Each time I lost my temper, I would feel bad, go to my room, repent, confess, apply the blood, and make up my mind never to lose my temper again.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I prayed, O Lord Jesus, help me not to lose my temper again.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Nevertheless, a short while later, I would lose my temper once more.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Later I read some books about how to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The first thing these books told me was that I had to see that my old man had been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When I read this, I thought it was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But I said to myself, The Bible says that my troublesome old man has been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But in my experience he is very much alive.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then I read further in the book that I had to reckon myself dead.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These books said that I should not believe my feelings, but that I should trust in my reckoning.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No matter how much I felt I was alive, I was to forget my feelings and reckon myself dead.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I thought this was wonderful, and I endeavored to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, this was mere mathematics.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I discovered that the more I reckoned my old man to be dead, the more troublesome he became.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Reckoning did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some may say, In Brother Nee s book, The Normal Christian Life, there is a chapter telling us to reckon ourselves dead.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What would you say about this?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The messages printed in this book were given in Brother Nee s early ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Many Christians just pick up what Brother Nee said in his early ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But in the later years Brother Nee learned much more and discovered many things.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In one of his later messages he said that we can never experience Romans 6 until we come into Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He further said that our crucifixion with Christ can only be experienced in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He told us clearly that mere reckoning will not work; we must walk in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The killing element, the killing power, is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I say again that it is not sufficient merely to reckon.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The experiences of thousands of Christians prove that mere reckoning does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A. B. Simpson has written a hymn about reckoning.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The following is the first verse and chorus:</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There s a little word the Lord has giv n</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>For our help in hour of need:</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Let us reckon ourselves to be dead to sin,</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>To be dead and dead indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Let us reckon, rather than feel;</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Let us be true to the reckoning,</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>And He will make it real.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Please do not try to argue with me about the matter of reckoning.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Anyone who tries to reckon himself dead will discover that it does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Perhaps A. B. Simpson s hymn about reckoning should be revised to read, Spirit, spirit, spirit, in our union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is not a matter of trying to bear the cross or to reckon ourselves dead; it is a matter of walking in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Before resurrection, we must bear the cross and be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But after resurrection, we must walk in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Hallelujah, the Spirit is in our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>SETTING OUR MIND ON THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Now, according to Romans 8:6, we need to set our mind upon the spirit, not upon the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>To set the mind upon the flesh is death, but to set the mind upon the spirit is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Your mind represents you.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>To set the mind upon the spirit means to agree with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Never agree with the flesh or go along with it.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Rather, agree with the spirit and go along with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If you do, you will have life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Today the Spirit of Christ is the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The effectiveness of the cross, the killing power, is included in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>As medical doctors know, in many doses there is both the killing element and the nourishing element.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The killing element destroys the germs in our blood, and the nourishing element supplies our being with nutrients.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The all-inclusive Spirit of Christ is the best dose.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>In this dose there is the killing element, Christ s crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The effectiveness of the death of Christ is now in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Do not try to reckon yourself dead.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Instead, let the Spirit move within you.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If you take this dose, the killing power included in it will kill all the germs in your being.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Our need today is to walk in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If we walk in spirit, we shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>In Romans 8:4 Paul said that when we walk according to the spirit, we spontaneously fulfill the righteous requirements of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This means that if we walk according to the spirit, everything will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>In this message we have covered ten crucial verses regarding the Spirit: John 3:6; 4:24; Romans 8:16; 1 Corinthians 15:45; 2 Corinthians 3:17; 1 Corinthians 6:17; Galatians 5:16; and Romans 8:4-6.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>I would encourage you all to become so familiar with these verses that you are able to recite them.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>If you pray-read these verses, eating them and digesting them, you will have a victorious Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>You will find how glorious it is to walk in the spirit and according to the spirit.</S>
