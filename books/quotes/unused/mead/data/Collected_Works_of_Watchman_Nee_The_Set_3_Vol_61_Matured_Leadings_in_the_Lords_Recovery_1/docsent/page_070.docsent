   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Knowing God's Will</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let me emphasize this: If we want spiritual understanding and if we want to know God's will, we cannot have any contention over our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once we have a problem with our consecration, we will be blind to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We will cover our own eyes and not see many things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Other brothers and sisters will see, but we will not.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people will feel sorry for us, but we will feel no sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What we consider precious will be refuse in the eyes of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is shameful to many Christians will be a glory to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many times we will be more than wrong, but we will feel very proud.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to learn to not trust in ourselves too much.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to constantly ask, "I have been insisting that this and that are right, but is it possible that when I receive more grace and experience deeper consecration, I will find these things to be wrong?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our consecration will greatly affect our understanding of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Shanghai a sister came to me and argued with me about baptism for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She gave one, five, even twenty reasons for not being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After she finished, I remained silent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We sat facing each other speechless.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After a while, she became anxious and asked, "Mr. Nee, why are you not saying anything?" I laughed and said, "You have said everything already.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have nothing more to say."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then I said, "I am not concerned about your reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am concerned that your consecration is not thorough enough.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Can you say to God, Whatever You want me to do, I will do it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whatever You want from me, I will give You'?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What would you do if your consecration was more absolute than today?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She quickly answered, "Of course, I would go and be baptized."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This shows that no Christian has a problem with his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the problems are related to consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once there is a problem with consecration, even the best mind will not get us through.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A halfhearted consecration will affect our judgment, our mind, and even our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everyone who is absolute with his consecration will not be fuzzy about God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whether or not we understand God's will depends on the degree of our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is something very subjective; no one can be arbitrary about it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Bringing In the Coordination of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Romans 12:1 is on consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 2 is on understanding God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Based on an absolute consecration, we understand God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The result of this is the coordination of the Body in verses 3 through 5.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A consecrated person is a coordinated person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 3 says that we should not think more highly of ourselves than we ought to think.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many children of God cannot be one with others; they cannot coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They think this is because they have different views, but this is not the real reason.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God only has one will.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How can different people take different ways?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to God's principle, He only has one will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are many different views among Christians because there are differences in the degrees of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once consecration is not absolute, there are differences in views.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When consecration is absolute, there are no different understandings concerning God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to be absolute with our consecration before we can be thorough in understanding God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once we are absolute in our consecration, we will not be irresponsible in our coordination in the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If I say something is mine, and you say it is yours, there will be no manifestation of God as we argue for our own cause.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the world the most precious things to man are possessions and the self.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the reason God ordains the altar for all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Not consecrating means keeping things in our own hands; it means that we can freely direct them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many people do not want to live corporately because they are afraid that they cannot move about freely.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we live corporately, no one can say that anything is his own.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can readily see that "things" are what separate the brothers and sisters from becoming one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Acts 2 and 4 say that no believer claimed anything as his own.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No one dared to boast to his brother that he was different.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At the closing of this age, the deep ones and the experienced ones before the Lord will ultimately express the life and glory of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Unless we hand over ourselves completely, we cannot coordinate together for the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once we consecrate everything, our mind, our ways, and our plans will not give the appearance of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Spontaneously, we will be the same as other brothers and sisters in outlook and motive.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We will spontaneously understand God's will and spontaneously experience the practical Body life in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I hope that God will speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our only wish today is that no one would keep back anything for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we do this, God will have a way among us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>May the church in this end time live like the first church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>May none of us live our own life any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We only have one occupation preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>No one will try to start a private business within this gospel enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We pray for God's will to be done on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>May He grant us the grace to learn to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He does not want a wavering mind in His service.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>May we all give ourselves for this.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I hope that you will not be discouraged from handing yourself over just because we have not been doing a good job.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I hope that this will not cause you to have a problem with God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God's will is absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the only way to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I hope that no one will be left behind just because he has not done his best.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>May the world be cast out from today onward, and may the Lord be fully exalted through His children.</S>
