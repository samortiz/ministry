   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GENERAL ATTITUDE IN ROMANS 14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is the reason Paul took such a general attitude in Romans 14.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He said that some eat everything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, others who are weaker eat only vegetables vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To these weaker ones all animals are dirty, and only vegetables are clean.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose a believer among us insists to eat only vegetables.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Probably we would contend for the "truth" that today is the day of grace, and we can eat everything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We would insist that he eat some slain animal day by day signifying that the Lord died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet this dear one would say, "I do believe in the Lord's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I thank the Lord that He was crucified for my sins, but my conscience will not allow me to take any meat."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the problem today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christians are divided because they lack a spirit of generality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Romans 14 there is also the matter of keeping days vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some regard one day as special.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These regard the seventh day as the top day of the days.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, some regard all days alike.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To these all days are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I was young, I thought Paul was sacrificing the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I said to myself, "Paul, how could you receive people who feel that today they have to keep the Sabbath?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why didn't you tell us definitely that to keep the Sabbath is wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today is the day of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no need for us to keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How can you say that it is okay?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose a brother of the Seventh Day Adventists begins to meet with us and insists to keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What would you do?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all have to learn the spirit of Paul in Romans 14.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have learned this lesson in a hard way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I was young, I got the best teaching about immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because of this, whenever I met another Christian, the first question I asked was, "By what way were you baptized?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If he said by immersion, I was happy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If he said by sprinkling, I would express my disapproval.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Also, in my early years when I met a Christian, I would check with him, "Do you believe in the Lord Jesus' coming back?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If he answered yes, then I would ask him when he would be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If he said something not in agreement with me, I would show him many verses proving that what I believed was accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a sense, those teachings that I was so fond of were my toys.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE NEGLECT OF ROMANS 14</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today many Christians are talking about the Body in Romans 12, but nearly all of them have neglected Romans 14.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Without Romans 14 we can never have the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Most who are talking about the Body life do not have it; they only have division.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today the Lord's recovery is mainly of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are going to have the oneness, we have to become so general.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When a brother who is a Seventh Day Adventist comes and insists on keeping the Seventh Day, we should say to him, "Brother, if you like to keep the Sabbath, you do it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we have the time, we will come to be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have no problem with you, and we have no argument."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the attitude, the spirit, taken by Paul in Romans 14.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But, this does not mean that Paul was not clear about the doctrine of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was very clear, but he did not insist.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are clearly told by him in Colossians 2 that the Sabbath was a shadow of the Christ who was to come.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Sabbath was a shadow, and now that the Body has come the shadow is over.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, in Romans 14 Paul still tolerated it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Also, when a brother comes and insists to only eat vegetables, we should say to him that we have no problems with it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When he eats only vegetables, we eat vegetables with him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Again, this does not mean that Paul was not clear about the doctrine of foods.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He was very clear, but he did not insist.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Can we be so general?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>THE MARRIAGE PROBLEM</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now we come to another point.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In 1 Corinthians 7, concerning marriage, Paul's attitude was that it is better for the saints not to get married, to keep their virginity vv.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>7-8 , and if they do not have a wife, to remain as they are v. 27 . He also said in verse 26, "I consider then that this is good because of the present necessity, that it is good for a man to be as he is."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This was Paul's attitude in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But if you go to his later writing, he says in 1 Timothy 5:14, "I will therefore that younger widows marry, bear children, rule the house, give no occasion to the opposer for reproach."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In 1 Corinthians 7 he discourages people from getting married; yet, in 1 Timothy 5 he encourages the young women to marry, bear children, and guide the house.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If Paul were here, we might ask him, "Brother Paul, where do you stand?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do you stand with 1 Corinthians 7 or 1 Timothy 5?"</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Was Paul wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We cannot say this.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is up to the circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If the circumstances are such that it is good for you to be single and love the Lord with all that you are, that is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, the circumstances sometimes do not allow this.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Rather, you need a wife or a husband with a family.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If this is the case, then the young ladies should get married.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is the same in principle as with the matter of eating the sacrifices offered to the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is not a matter of yes or no. It is a matter that depends on the circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You should not say yes, neither should you say no. There is nothing legal or definite.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It should not be like what is practiced in the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They have set up a regulation that all the nuns, monks, and priests should not marry.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>That is too legal.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We all have to realize from these cases that in a local church, as far as all the doctrines are concerned, we should not be so specific, but general.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, as far as our Christian faith is concerned, we must be specific.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Concerning the faith, we must be definite.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But as for doctrines such as immersion, sprinkling, head covering, foot-washing, eating, keeping days, marriage, and so many other things, we must be general.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we would not be general, we will surely be divisive.</S>
