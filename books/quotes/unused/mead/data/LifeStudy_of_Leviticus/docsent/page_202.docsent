   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. The Fifty Years That Consummated in the Jubilee Comprising Eight Sabbath Years, Being Sabbath upon Sabbath, to Be an Eightfold Sabbath</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fifty years that consummated in the jubilee comprising eight sabbath years, being sabbath upon sabbath to be an eightfold sabbath cf. v. 8 , signifies the superabundance of the fullness of God's rest with satisfaction to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first and last years of this fifty-year period were eighth years, and in between there were six eighth years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, there was a total of eight eighth years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since the number eight signifies resurrection, this indicates that the jubilee is something that is altogether from resurrection, to resurrection, in resurrection, and with resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The jubilee is a matter of sabbath upon sabbath, an eightfold sabbath signifying resurrection upon resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This eightfold sabbath signifies a superabundance of the fullness of God's rest with satisfaction to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is not simply rest but rest with satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. The Blast of the Trumpet Going Forth on the Tenth Day of the Seventh Month of the Jubilee, on the Day of Propitiation</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"Then you shall cause the blast of the trumpet to go forth on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of propitiation you shall cause the trumpet to go forth through all your land" v. 9 . This signifies that the jubilee is based on the propitiation for sin that the full freedom might be proclaimed to all the people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This type was fulfilled by the full redemption of Christ for the proclamation of the full freedom to all the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Young's Concordance shows us that there are two Hebrew words that are translated jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first of these words bears the denotation of a time of shouting; the second bears the denotation of trumpeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of trumpeting is actually a shouting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jubilee is a matter of joy becoming a shout.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The jubilee, therefore, was a time of excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many of us experienced such joy and excitement when we got saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We were happy and full of rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our salvation was a real jubilee.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today most people are silent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if we proclaim the jubilee, sounding the trumpet, they will begin to shout.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They will learn to say, "Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>C. Sanctifying the Fiftieth Year and Proclaiming Freedom throughout the Land to All Its Inhabitants, That Year Being a Jubilee to the People</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"You shall sanctify the fiftieth year and proclaim release throughout the land to all its inhabitants.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It shall be a jubilee to you" v. 10a . Verse 11a also speaks of the jubilee: "The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee to you."

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is full of responsibility, and everyone bears a great deal of responsibility.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may simply go to the field and eat without any burden or responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead of responsibility, we have rest, enjoyment, and shouting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many of us had such an experience when we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the day of our salvation, we were released, fully freed from all our burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the experience and enjoyment of the jubilee.</S>
