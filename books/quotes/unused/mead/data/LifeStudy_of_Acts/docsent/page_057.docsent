   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verses 9 and 10 continue, But there arose some of those of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, and discussed with Stephen; and they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There were a number of synagogues in Jerusalem composed respectively of the returned Jews according to the languages they had acquired in their dispersion see 2:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word synagogue is the anglicized form of the Greek word sunagoge, composed of sun, together, and ago, to bring; hence, a collecting, gathering, congregation, assembly; by transition, the place of gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is used in the New Testament to denote the congregation 13:43; 9:2; Luke 12:11 and the congregating place Luke 7:5 of the Jews, where they sought the knowledge of God by studying the Holy Scriptures Luke 4:16-17; Acts 13:14-15 .</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Acts 6:13 and 14 go on to say, And they set up false witnesses, saying, This man does not cease speaking words against this holy place and the law; for we have heard him saying that this Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 13 this holy place refers to the temple Matt 24:15; Psa 68:35; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>7:24; 21:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 15 says, And all those sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at him and saw his face as the face of an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fact that Stephen s face was as the face of an angel indicates that it had a heavenly appearance.</S>
