<h2 class="head1">GIVING LIGHT AND LIFE</h2><p>In Psalms 119 and 19 we see at least twenty-six functions of God&rsquo;s law as His living word to those who lovingly seek Him. We have already indicated that the Word of God gives us light. It also gives life (119:25, 50, 107, 154). If you read Psalm 119 carefully, you will notice that the word quicken is used a number of times. The Hebrew word rendered quicken, like the Greek word, means to give life. The Word of God gives us light; then it quickens us, enlivens us, gives us life. Therefore, we live by the living Word; that is, we live by God Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">RESTORING THE SOUL AND REJOICING THE HEART</h2><p>Another function of the Word of God is to restore man&rsquo;s soul and rejoice man&rsquo;s heart (Psa. 19:7-8). We need to be not only quickened by the Word, but also restored by it, especially when we are depressed, suppressed, or oppressed. After working all day at your job, you may be under the oppression of Satan and may be in need of restoration. On your way home from work, take time to read, pray, and sing the Word. You will find that the Word will restore your soul and cause your heart to rejoice.</p><h2 class="head1">BRINGING SALVATION</h2><p>The Word of God also brings us salvation (Psa. 119:41, 170). We need salvation every day, even every moment. The living Word of God brings us God&rsquo;s instant and constant salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">STRENGTHENING, COMFORTING, NOURISHING</h2><p>The Word of God strengthens us (v. 28), comforts us (v. 76), and nourishes us (v. 103). The psalmist said that God&rsquo;s word was sweet to his taste, sweeter than honey to his mouth. This indicates that he was nourished by the Word.</p><h2 class="head1">UPHOLDING, KEEPING SAFE, CAUSING HOPE</h2><p>As the Word of God nourishes us, it upholds us. The Word holds us up. It also keeps us safe and causes us to hope (vv. 116-117, 49). When we experience the function of the living Word, we shall not be without hope. Rather, we shall be hopeful in all things. In Philippians 1:20 Paul could speak of his earnest expectation and hope.</p><h2 class="head1">CAUSING US TO ENJOY GOD AS OUR PORTION</h2><p>The Word of God also causes us to enjoy God as our portion (v. 57). If we would enjoy Christ as our portion in the Word, we should not only study the Word, but receive the Word in a living way by praying, singing, psalming, and thanking.</p><h2 class="head1">CAUSING US TO ENJOY GOD&rsquo;S COUNTENANCE</h2><p>Through the Word we enjoy God&rsquo;s countenance (v. 58) and the shining of His face (v. 135). While the children of Israel were in fear and trembling at the foot of Mount Sinai, Moses was on the mountaintop enjoying the shining of the Lord&rsquo;s countenance. Our situation should be that of Moses on the mountaintop, not that of the children of Israel at the foot of the mountain. We should be on the mountaintop under the shining of the face of God.</p><h2 class="head1">CAUSING US TO ENJOY GOD<br />AS OUR HIDING PLACE AND SHIELD<br />AND TO ENJOY GOD&rsquo;S HELP AND WELL-DEALING</h2><p>Through the Word we may enjoy God as our hiding place and shield (v. 114) and also enjoy God&rsquo;s help and well-dealing (vv. 175, 65). In every way God deals well with us. His care is comprehensive; He meets our every need. Even His rebuke is an aspect of His well-dealing. If we get into His Word in a living way, we shall enjoy His well-dealing.</p><h2 class="head1">MAKING WISE AND GIVING UNDERSTANDING</h2><p>Psalm 119:98 says, &ldquo;Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies,&rdquo; and verse 99 says, &ldquo;I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my musing&rdquo; (Heb.). These verses indicate that the Word of God makes us wise. The more we get into the Word, the wiser we become.</p><h2 class="head1">GIVING DISCERNMENT AND KNOWLEDGE</h2><p>The Word of God also gives us good discernment and knowledge (v. 66, Heb.). Many Christians today are short of discernment. They are like those who cannot discern between their thumb and their fingers. We need to be very discerning. The Word of God gives us the needed discernment and knowledge.</p><h2 class="head1">KEEPING US FROM SINNING<br />AND FROM EVERY EVIL WAY</h2><p>Verse 11 says, &ldquo;Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.&rdquo; According to this verse, the Word of God keeps us from sinning. The Word also keeps our feet from every evil way (v. 101).</p><h2 class="head1">KEEPING US FROM STUMBLING,<br />ESTABLISHING OUR FOOTSTEPS,<br />AND CAUSING US TO OVERCOME INIQUITY</h2><p>The Word of God also keeps us from stumbling (v. 165), establishes our footsteps, and causes us to overcome iniquity (v. 133). No iniquity will have dominion over us. Instead, we shall conquer all evil things, for the Word of God will make us conquerors, overcomers.</p>
