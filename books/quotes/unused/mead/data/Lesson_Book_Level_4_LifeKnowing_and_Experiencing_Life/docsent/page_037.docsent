   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. KNOWING THE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING A. The Anointing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The teaching of the anointing comes from the anointing and is the natural result of our being anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the anointing is moving within us, on the one hand, it anoints God into us, and on the other hand, it reveals God's mind to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, the teaching of the anointing has two aspects: first, through the anointing we gain more of God Himself, more of God's components; second, through the teaching we know His mind and live in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of these two aspects, to have God Himself is primary, and to know God's mind is secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, to have God Himself always comes first, and then to know His mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Each time we experience the anointing within us, we gain firstly more of God Himself, more of God's components; this, then, produces a result it causes us to know what God wants us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is impossible to know His will without having Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the teaching of the anointing is a subordinate function of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>B. The Understanding of the Mind</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although the teaching of the anointing comes from the anointing these two occupy different parts in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The anointing is in our spirit, whereas the teaching of the anointing is in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why is the anointing in our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because the Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit; therefore, the anointing which emanates from the moving of the Holy Spirit is definitely in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When our spirit is motivated by the Holy Spirit, we become conscious of it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such a consciousness is the feeling of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At this time, provided that our mind has been taught, we are able to interpret this feeling from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can understand its meaning and thus obtain the teaching which emanates from the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the teaching of the anointing is in our mind and is entirely a matter of the comprehension of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, if we desire to follow the teaching of the anointing, we should have not only a keen feeling in our spirit, but also an experienced and spiritual mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such a mind includes the renewing of the mind, the exercising of our comprehension in spiritual matters, and the collecting of spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These require that we love the Lord more, seek spiritual experiences, live in fellowship, study the Bible, read spiritual books and listen to messages.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through these, our mind will receive spiritual unveiling and become enriched in knowledge; thus, it will be able to comprehend the meaning of the anointing in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Consequently, we will realize the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without a thorough knowledge of the Word, you will be unable to understand much of what the anointing teaches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Lord's recovery, every saint must be built up with the full knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Gradually your ability to understand and interpret spiritual things will develop.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This will give the anointing the means to speak to you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>C. The Feeling of the Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have said that the normal feeling of the conscience is derived from the Holy Spirit, who is in our spirit, and passes through our mind to enlighten us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This enlightenment is also a kind of anointing of the Holy Spirit as the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the feeling of the conscience and the teaching of the anointing are both derived from the feeling of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The anointing, after having passed through the intuition of the spirit and having been understood by the mind, becomes the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, the anointing, having passed through the conscience and being understood by the mind, becomes the feeling of the conscience; this, then, is their relatedness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are, however, differences between the teaching of the anointing and the feeling of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, the conscience is an organ to differentiate right from wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The feeling of the conscience which is derived from the anointing is also limited to right and wrong, good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the teaching of the anointing, which comes by way of the anointing and is sensed directly in our spirit, is related in scope to God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It surpasses right and wrong and touches directly the will of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we only care for the feeling of the conscience, we can only be a faultless Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must go beyond this to live in the teaching of the anointing; then we can touch the mind of God and live in God.</S>
