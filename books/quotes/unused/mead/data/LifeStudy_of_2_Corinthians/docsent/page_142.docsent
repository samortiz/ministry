   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SOME STRONG WORDS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although Paul is strong in chapter ten, he is even stronger in chapter eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 11:13-15 he says concerning the Judaizers, For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transfiguring themselves into apostles of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And no wonder, for Satan himself transfigures himself into an angel of light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore it is no great thing if also his ministers transfigure themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word rendered transfiguring in verse 13 also means fashioning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The false apostles, being deceitful, fashioned themselves into the appearance of the real apostles, who are true in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 14 indicates that Satan is the source of the false apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They follow him in his deceitfulness to frustrate God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is light, and His angels are of light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the contrary, Satan is darkness, and all his followers are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no fellowship between light and darkness 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The ministers of righteousness in verse 15 are the true apostles, those who carry out the ministry of righteousness 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whatever the ministers of Satan do is altogether unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Righteousness has no partnership with lawlessness 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 11:5 Paul refers to the Judaizers as super-apostles: For I account that I am inferior in nothing to the super-apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By using the term super-apostles, that is, apostles in surpassing degree, Paul is referring ironically to the false apostles, as mentioned in verse 13 and 12:11.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These false apostles surpass the degree of the genuineness of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These are the Judaizers who came to Corinth to preach another Jesus with a different spirit and a different gospel v. 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Corinthians thought that the Judaizers were wonderful and that they did an excellent work in helping the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Actually, the Judaizers did exactly the same work as Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They transfigured themselves as ministers of righteousness, into apostles of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, Paul uses four terms to describe them: false apostles, deceitful workers, super-apostles, and ministers of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul also refers to the Judaizers in verse 4: For if indeed he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different gospel, which you did not accept, you bear well with him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Another Jesus means another person; a different spirit means a spirit of a different nature; and a different gospel means a gospel of a different kind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Judaizers used many of the same terms the apostles used: Jesus, spirit, and gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Claiming that they were apostles of Christ, they preached Jesus and ministered a certain kind of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, they claimed that what they taught was the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, they had another Jesus, a different spirit, and a different gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No doubt, these Judaizers were eloquent and very appealing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They had much knowledge of the Old Testament, and they also knew the New Testament gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in speaking of them Paul was bold, calling them false apostles, deceitful workers, ministers of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He even gave them the nickname super-apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 4 Paul tells the Corinthians that they were bearing well with the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Greek word for well also means beautifully, ideally.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is used here ironically.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 1 the apostle expresses his desire that the Corinthian believers, who were bearing with him, would bear more with him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now in this verse he refers them to their bearing beautifully with the false apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul s idea is this: Since you bear with the false apostles so well, so beautifully, so ideally, please bear more with me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why he uses the word for at the beginning of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>TODAY S JUDAIZERS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you think that the situation we face today is different from that faced by Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our situation is quite similar.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In principle, there are Judaizers today, just as there were at the apostles time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I was young, I thought that the apostolic age must have been excellent, marvelous, and wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually I learned that the situation at that time was the same in principle as the situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we understand this, we shall not be disappointed when we encounter opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some praise the Lord for the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, when they consider the opposition, they may be deeply bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I would encourage you not to be bothered, for the situation we face today is the same in principle as the one faced by Paul during the apostolic age.</S>
