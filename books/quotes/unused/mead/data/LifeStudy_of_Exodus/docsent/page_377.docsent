   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BRONZE, THE BASIC MATERIAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Having considered the appearance of the gate, let us now see what is the basic material used to produce such an appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The basic material here is bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Both the pillars and the sockets for the court of the tabernacle were made of bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Bronze, as we have pointed out, signifies God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to John 16:8, when the Spirit of reality comes, He will convict the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whoever would enter into God s building must be fully judged.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He must pass through the bronze gate, a gate of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although the pillars are covered with linen, linen is not the basic material of the court.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The basic material is bronze, signifying the righteous judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We who would come into the building of God must realize that everything we are, everything we have, everything we do, and everything we are able to do must be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that good things as well as bad things must be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our good behavior and our bad behavior both need to be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In like manner, our hatred and our love, our pride and our humility, along with all of our virtues, must pass through the gate of God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Passing through the bronze gate can be compared to passing through the checkpoint in an airline terminal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anyone who would pass through that point must be examined.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Likewise, if we would come into God s building, we must pass through the gate of judgment and experience God s judgment on everything we are, have, and do.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we heard the gospel and repented, we were not told anything about this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I never heard that I needed to be judged, that my being, my behavior, my speaking, my doings, and my ability needed to pass through God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result, I brought certain good aspects of my natural life and ability into the so-called church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I believe many of us did this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some even came into the church life and brought with them a number of worldly things that had not been judged.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is to have a gate made with something other than bronze as the basic material.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the gate of the court of the tabernacle is a bronze gate, the gate of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we have not experienced this judgment in a thorough way, we must make up this lesson and pass through the bronze gate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>BEARING GOD S RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The expression of the outer court is linen signifying the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After we have been judged, we bear God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, what we bear is not our natural virtue or our outward behavior it is the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This also is a basic truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In preaching the gospel we need to declare, Sinners, people of this world, you need to be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When everything about you, both good and bad, has been judged, you will bear the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How can the righteousness of God be linked to us?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the typology in Exodus 27, it is linked to us by the silver hooks and connecting rods.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that out of God s judgment comes Christ s redemption, and this redemption is the holding power and the linking strength.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How can we, sinners and enemies of God, be linked to God s righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How can God s righteousness be held onto us?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is possible only through the redemption of Christ, which comes out of God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As fallen people, we need to be judged in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But whatever God judges, Christ redeems.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Praise the Lord, God s judgment produces Christ s redemption!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we would enjoy the redemption of Christ, we first need the judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The true meaning of repentance is that we are judged.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To repent is to judge ourselves and condemn ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whenever a person repents, he condemns himself and places himself under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the experience of bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But since Christ redeems whatever God judges, this redemption will link the judged one to God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, this redemption also joins us to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The pillars in the court of the tabernacle each stood separately.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, by the connecting rods they were joined into one unit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hallelujah, whatever God judges, Christ redeems, and whatever Christ redeems is linked by this redemption to God s righteousness!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The redemption of Christ joins us to God s righteousness and to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, with the outer court we have three important matters: judgment, redemption, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s righteousness is for the expression of His testimony.</S>
