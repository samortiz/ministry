   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Leaving Trophimus at Miletus</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Erastus remained in Corinth, and Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Trophimus is one of the famous sick persons in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Epaphroditus was one, and Trophimus was another.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many times sick persons need to obey; they cannot say that they want to move around.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If they are sick, they must stop for a little while.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul said that he left Trophimus at Miletus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was better for him to be left at Miletus and not be occupied with so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Concerning Timothy, Paul said Be diligent to come before winter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul gave him a definite time limit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not decide for yourself when to come.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Be diligent to come before winter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brothers, we should see that this way is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A brother like Paul, who walked before God, should be obeyed by Mark, Timothy, and Trophimus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If so, spontaneously, we will see that there is fellowship in the church, and spontaneously we will also be able to understand what authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Titus Being Left in Crete</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>and Being Diligent to Go to Nicopolis</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning Titus we do not need to say much.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A few verses from the first and the last chapters of Titus are sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Titus 1:5 says, For this cause I left you in Crete, that you might set in order the things which I have begun that remain and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Are we clear?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Titus was a young brother.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 2 Corinthians Paul indicated that he had entreated him to go to Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They went to Crete together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then Paul left Titus in Crete to complete the unfinished business.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul told him how to set in order the things that were lacking, as he charged him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here we can see authority and also fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Titus 3:12 says, When I send Artemas to you or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you see?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the way of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul said, I want to send one of two brothers to you, maybe Artemas or Tychicus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It has not been fully decided; in any case, one will come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When he gets there, you need to come to me quickly in Nicopolis.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here we see how an elderly brother arranged many things and how a young brother listened to his word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Charging Timothy to Keep the Commandment</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Finally, we should say more concerning what Paul said to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First Timothy 6:13-14 says, I charge you before God, who preserves all things in life, and Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate, to keep the commandment spotless.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You see how weighty a matter this is I charge you before God, who preserves all things in life, and Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate, to keep the commandment spotless.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 20 says, O Timothy, guard the deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The commandment that I gave you, you need to guard.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Please remember that the young brothers need to learn what has been entrusted to the older brothers and learn to obey them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then they will be able to walk the way ahead of them in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul Also Needing Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I hope that we can see how the work was carried out in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The work in the New Testament is one that has arrangements, authority, and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I believe you still remember what I told you some days ago.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even though Timothy was a young brother, do you remember what was recorded in the book of Acts concerning what Paul did when Timothy came to him?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ 18:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I feel that in the Bible this verse is the best.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul was one who knew the Lord and was used much by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yet because Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, he was constrained by the word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>With Paul, fellowship was also necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When Timothy and Silas came, it was a great encouragement to him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is what you can see from Acts 18.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Acts 17:14 says, And immediately the brothers then sent Paul off, to go as far as the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here Paul listened to the brothers word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>And Silas and Timothy remained there.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There refers to Berea, which is the name of a city in Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Macedonia is the name of a region, and Berea is the name of a city.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Verse 15 says, And those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as quickly as possible, they went off.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Paul commanded Silas and Timothy to come to him as quickly as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But after Paul went to Corinth, and after Silas and Timothy came to Corinth from Macedonia, Acts 18:5 says that Paul was constrained by the word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You see how good that situation was!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I hope that you brothers can see this principle in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today we are like children learning to walk step by step, slowly walking before God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I hope that all the children of God would know how to have the mutual coordination in the work; then we will be able to do the work in a good way.</S>
