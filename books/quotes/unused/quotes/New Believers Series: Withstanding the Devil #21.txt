Many of the so-called problems among the brothers and sisters come from our imagination; they have no factual basis
Sometimes when you see a brother or a sister, you may feel that he or she has a problem with you or that there is a distance between you
If a person pays too much attention to Satans temptations his mind will become confused and he will easily become a prey to Satans snares
If a person has to reject Satan day and night, something is wrong with his mind; he is heading down the wrong road
If a person's mind is constantly worried about thoughts from Satan, he is in reality giving ground to Satan to enter into him
Once there is a second withstanding, be sure there will be a third, a fourth, even a hundredth, and a thousandth
Once we have withstood him once, there is no need to withstand him a second time because the matter has been settled already
The dumbness and deafness of the child were outward symptoms of his demon possession; they were not ordinary illnesses
The boils on Job's body could not be healed by medicine; they were not medical illnesses; they were attacks from the devil
The complication lies in the fact that Satan does not want us to uncover and expose the illnesses he has inflicted
He always hides behind natural symptoms and makes us think that every sickness is the result of natural causes
The reproach of the Holy Spirit grows stronger and stronger as time goes on; the accusation of Satan is the same from beginning to end
The more we are reproved by the Holy Spirit, the more we are strengthened within to deal with our problem before the Lord
We must realize that the blood of the Lamb is the basis of our forgiveness before God as well as the basis of our acceptance in Him
Those who consider themselves to be good are foolish, and those who are blind to the saving power of the Lord are foolish as well
Those who believe in their own power are foolish, and those who do not believe in the Lord's power are foolish as well
The blood of the Lamb' and 'the word of their testimony' spoken of previously are two conditions for victory over Satan
We must be sure that they have enough strength before the Lord to go on before we give them stronger advice or urge them to move ahead
As long as you have the assurance within that you can help him, a little push may be all that is necessary to bring him through his trouble
We must point out Hebrews 10:22 to those who are under Satan's accusation: 'Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience'
When a Christian is condemned in his conscience, he will be weak before God and will be debilitated in all spiritual matters
There are many things in our environment which, though permitted by God, are the result of Satan's direct and active work
An even clearer example can be seen in Matthew 8, when the Lord Jesus ordered the disciples to depart to the other side of the sea
After He and the disciples stepped into the boat, suddenly a great tempest arose in the sea so that the boat was covered by the waves
The winds and the sea have no personality of their own, yet the Lord rebuked them because the devil was behind them
In conclusion, Satan not only attacks our body, our conscience, and our mind, but also attacks us through our environment
When they humble themselves, and their attitude before God is firm, God will show them that it is not Him but Satan who is doing the work
Whoever desires to withstand Satan must learn to know the difference between the Lord's authority and Satan's power
The manifestation of the Lord Jesus destroyed the works of the devil, and the death of the Lord Jesus destroyed the devil himself
The Lord's death pronounces the greatest defeat for the devil because the Lord's death is not only a punishment but also a way of salvation
Although Satan reigns through death, the more he reigns through death, the worse his lot becomes, because his reign stops at death
When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross for us, the old creation and the old man were both crucified with Him
If a man is still pursuing crucifixion, he is standing on fleshly ground, and Satan has full control over those who stand on fleshly ground
These verses begin with resurrection and end with resurrection, and the verses in between speak of triumphing in the cross
Just as Satan had nothing in the Lord Jesus while He was on earth , so also he has nothing in Him in resurrection
Little did they realize that the Lord Jesus would go into death, come out of death, and overcome the authority of death!
It is a life that transcends death, that is beyond the boundary of death, that comes out of death, and that death cannot hold
Ephesians 1:20-22 says, 'Raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all
Ephesians 2:6 says, 'And raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus'
We are raised up together with Christ and are seated together with Him in the heavenlies, far above all the power of Satan
Ephesians 6:11 and 13 say, 'Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil
To sit is to rest in the Lord's victory, while to stand is to withstand Satan and to stop him from taking away our victory
How great is the difference between a person who tries to overcome and one who withstands by knowing that he has already overcome
