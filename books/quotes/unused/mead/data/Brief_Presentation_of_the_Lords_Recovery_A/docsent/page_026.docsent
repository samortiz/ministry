   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being Uniquely One Universally</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Body of Christ is uniquely one universally Eph 4:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Individually, we are members of the Body of Christ, and all the local churches are parts of this one unique Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As those who are in the Body, we need to realize that we are one with all the saints in the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ephesians 4:4-6 depicts a oneness that is universal: "One Body and one Spirit, as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In these verses we can see that the Triune God is mingled with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Body mentioned here is not local; rather, it is universal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the universal oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Fellowship of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Also Being Uniquely One Universally</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since the Body of Christ is uniquely one universally, the fellowship of the Body of Christ also is uniquely one universally.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. The Fellowship of the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fellowship of the Body of Christ is the fellowship of the apostles the divine fellowship between all the believers and the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The term the fellowship of the apostles is used in Acts 2:42: "And they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then, 1 John 1:3 tells us that the fellowship of the apostles is not merely with us, the believers, but also with the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here John did not mention the Spirit directly, because he was speaking in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit was there already.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship of the Body of Christ, the divine fellowship between all the believers and the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fellowship of the apostles is based upon the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fellowship always comes after teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If there is no teaching, there is no element or realm of the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, the teaching is the element and the realm of the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By the Lord's mercy, today in the Lord's recovery we are under the apostles' teaching and in the apostles' fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fellowship of the recovery which we are in is the recovered fellowship of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This fellowship was lost, but it has been recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today we are in the fellowship of the apostles, which is the fellowship of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you are a Baptist, you are in the fellowship of the Baptists.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the fellowship of the Baptists is narrower than the fellowship of the apostles, so they cannot claim that their fellowship is the fellowship of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to see and have the boldness to say that we are in the fellowship of the recovery which is the recovered apostles' fellowship.</S>
