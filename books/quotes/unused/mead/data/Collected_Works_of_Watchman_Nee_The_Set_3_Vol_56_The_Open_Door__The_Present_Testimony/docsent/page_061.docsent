   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christianity Is Based on Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is Christianity?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christianity is life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christianity is not a matter of asking whether something is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christianity is a matter of checking with the life inside us whenever we do something.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What does the new life which God has given us tell us inwardly about this matter?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is very strange that many people have only seen an outward standard, the standard of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But God has not given us an outward standard.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christianity is not a new set of Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Christianity we have not been brought to a new Sinai, nor has God given us a new set of rules and regulations with "Thou shalt" and "Thou shalt not."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christianity does not require that we ask whether something is right or wrong, good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the contrary, whenever we do anything, there is a life within us which rises up to speak with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we feel right inwardly, when we feel the life inside of us moving, when we are strong within and sense the anointing, we know that we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many times something is right and good in the eyes of man, but strangely the inner life has no response and grows cold and retreats.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Please remember, God's Word tells us that our Christian living is based on an inner life, not an outward standard of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many worldly people, who are not saved, live according to the best standard of living they can attain: the principle of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you or I also live by the principle of right or wrong, we are the same as worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christians are different from non-Christians because we do not live by an outward standard or law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our subject is not human morality or concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not determine whether something is right or wrong by subjecting it to human criticism or opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today we have only one question: What does our inner life say?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the life is strong and active within us, we can do this; if the life is cold and retreating within us, we should not.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our principle for living is inward instead of outward.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the only real principle of living; the others are false.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>People may say that many things are right to do, and I may feel that to do them is right, but what does the sense of the inner life tell us?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The inner life does not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we were to do them, we would not be rewarded, and if we were not to do them, there should be no shame, because they are outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can only see what is really right when the Spirit of God operates within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we feel that there is life inwardly, then that matter is right.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do not feel the inward life, then the matter is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Right and wrong are not decided by an outward standard but by the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Standard of Life Is Higher</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Than the Standard of Good</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once this matter is resolved, we can see that we must not only avoid all that is evil but also all that is merely good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christians can only do that which comes out of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can see that there are evil things, good things, and things of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are not saying that Christians should only do things that are good and things that are of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, we are saying that Christians must not do good things or evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God said, "Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Note that "good and evil" are put together here as one way, while "life" is another way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christians should not just refuse evil, they should even refuse good.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is a standard that is higher than the standard of good; it is the standard of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I have spoken about this matter with many young brothers, but I would like to repeat my story again today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When I first began to serve the Lord, I sought to avoid all that was evil and deliberately set myself to do what was good.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the human point of view, I seemed to be making splendid progress in avoiding evil and doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There was a problem, however.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since I was pursuing right and wrong, I wanted to be clear about what was right and what was wrong in each matter before I did anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At that time I had a co-worker who was two years older than I, and we were always disagreeing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The differences that arose between us did not concern our own personal affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our disagreements were about public matters, and our disputes were public too.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I used to say to myself: That is wrong; if he wants to do things that way, I will protest.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But no matter how much I protested, he would never give way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His only excuse was that he was two years older than I. I could argue with any other reason, but I could not argue with the fact that he was two years older than I. I could not get around this argument, but inwardly I did not agree with him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I told this story to an elderly sister, who had a wealth of spiritual experience, and I asked her to arbitrate.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Was he right or was I?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>She did not say he was right, nor did she say he was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>She simply stared at me and said, "You should do as he says."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I was unhappy inwardly and thought, "If I am right, tell me so; if I am wrong, then say it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why do you say that I should do as he says?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I asked her to give me a reason for her answer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>She said, "In the Lord the younger should submit to the older."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"But," I retorted, "in the Lord, if the younger is right and the older wrong, must the younger still submit?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At that time I was in secondary school and had learned nothing of discipline, so I gave free vent to my anger.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>She still smiled and said, "You had better do as he says."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once some people were going to be baptized, and there were three of us caring for the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I was the youngest, then the brother two years older than I, and finally there was a Brother Wu, who was seven years older than he.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I thought, "You are two years older than I, so I have to submit to you in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is even older; let us see whether or not you will submit."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We got together to discuss this matter, but he refused to accept anything from Brother Wu.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At every point he insisted on having his own way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Finally, he said, "Just leave things to me; I will do it alone."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I thought, "What kind of logic is this?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You insist that I always obey you because you are my senior, but you never need to obey your senior."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Immediately I sought out this sister to ask her about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I was upset that she did not pay attention to right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>She stood up and asked, "Have you not seen what the life of Christ is?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Over the past few months, you have continually come to say that you are right and this brother is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Do you not know what the cross is?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You are insisting on the rightness of the matter, but I insist upon the life of the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I had been insisting upon right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I had not seen the matter of life, nor the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>So she asked me, "Do you think you are right in doing this?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do you think you are right to say these things?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Do you think it is right for you to tell me these things?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They are all right according to reason, but I would ask how you feel inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>What is your inner sense?"</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I could only confess that I had been right according to reason but wrong according to the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The standard of Christian living does not only deal with evil things but also with good and right things.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Many matters are right according to human standards, but the divine standard pronounces them wrong because they lack the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>On the day to which I just referred, I saw this light for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>From then on I began to ask myself if the life I lived before God was according to the principle of life or the principle of what I considered right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I would check, "Am I doing this just because it is right?"</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The key to everything is this point: Others may say something is right.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We also may say that it is right, but does the Lord's life rise up within us or does it recede when we begin to do something?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When we begin to do something, do we sense the anointing or do we feel weighed down?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>As we are doing that thing, do we have an increasing sense that we are on the right track, or is something telling us that we are off?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Please remember that life does not make decisions according to outward standards of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Matters should be decided according to the sense of God's life or the sense of death.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Decisions should be made according to God's life as it rises up or recedes within us.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>No Christian should say that he can do something because it is good or right.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We must ask the Lord within us.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>What is the inner feeling that the Lord gives?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Do we feel joyful inwardly about this matter?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Do we have spiritual happiness and peace?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>These are the matters that decide our spiritual path.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When I was visiting Honor Oak, there was another brother who was also a guest there.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He had many criticisms of the place.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>He had been a pastor and was a good preacher, and he knew that Honor Oak had much to offer spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Still, he disapproved of many things.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Whenever we ran into each other, he would tell me how much better his place was than Honor Oak.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>During the two or three months we were together, his criticism exceeded that of everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>One day he went too far, so I asked him, "You say Honor Oak is bad, so would it not be best if you left?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Why do you remain here?"</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>He answered, pointing to his heart, "The reason lies here; it wants to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Every time I pack my things to leave, my peace of heart leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Once I even left for two weeks, but I had to write and ask to return."</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>I said, "Brother, have you seen these two ways: the way of life and the way of what you consider to be right or wrong?"</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>He said, "Some days I go to my room to pack my bags as many as three times.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>But each time I want to leave, there is an inward forbidding.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Inwardly, I feel that they are doing things wrong, but I also feel that it would be wrong for me to go."</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>God had shown him that if he could receive spiritual help there, he should stay there to meet God.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>We all can see that this is not a matter of what we conceive as right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>God uses His life to control His children.</S>
