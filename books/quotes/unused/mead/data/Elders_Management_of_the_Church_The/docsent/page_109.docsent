   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brothers, do not expect an angel to come to your place to have a week's conference, and the church where you are will be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do not cherish such a hope.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Be subdued to do a slow work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Touch everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Help the saints to live before the Lord and to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When there are practical needs, help them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I would like to say that even when they have financial needs, and you are able, share what you have with them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You do not need to call it a consecration or a supply.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As long as a brother has nothing to eat, and as long as you have a meal, you should take half of it, and share the other half with him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not so much a matter of consecration as it is a mutual sharing in life to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this way, you will have something to eat, and he will have something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you are able to do so, you should earn some money for his use.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the principle of Paul's making tents.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul said that he worked with his two hands to supply the need of himself and those with him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You have to bear the burden of the brothers and sisters who are your members.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you can bear the burden to such an extent, you will find out if God will bless your work or not!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you are willing to do this, you will see the blessing coming; it is useless for you to invite others to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The building of the church is a slow work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It requires strength.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You cannot count on luck, and you cannot put your hope in others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I believe all the sisters who are housewives can testify.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You know how much work there is in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You can never expect another one to replace you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only by laboring, striving, working away at your own home can you expect your house to be in order.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The house of God, the church, has been entrusted to the elders' care.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The elders are the housewives; they can only labor and strive.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The building up of the church depends on the laboring of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It will not work to merely have revival meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You must put yourselves into the hard work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only after you have worked hard will you see the harvest, just as a farmer sees his crop.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I hope that the elders in all the churches would grasp this principle and would invest their energy in all the places.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be good at preaching may not yield a good result.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In some places, this may even make things worse.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The fewer conferences there are, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Save the time to contact the people one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Spend time to deal with them one by one and help them to learn.</S>
