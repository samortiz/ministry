   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST BEING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We first must see the vision of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is God, and He is man; He is the Creator, and He is the creation; He is the first item of the old creation, and He is also the first item of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is also life and everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moreover, this Christ today is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a key point.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , and He is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Regardless of how much power is in electricity, if we do not have the current of electricity, we have none of its power.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the power, function, ability, and capability of electricity is in the current.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even if we do not understand electricity, as long as we have the current and we apply it, we can enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today the all-inclusive Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the current, the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That is why we speak of three matters: the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit is the fellowship, the transmission, the current.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whatever Christ is, is in this current.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must realize that Christ is the life-giving Spirit living in our spirit, and we need to learn the secret of contacting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should forget everything else, never be distracted by anything, and always pay our full attention to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must love Him, contact Him, obey Him, follow Him, and always hold on to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to learn the way to exercise our spirit to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Galatians speaks of the Spirit and our spirit several times.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must walk by the Spirit, live by the Spirit, sow unto the Spirit to reap of the Spirit, and restore a fallen brother in the spirit 5:16, 25; 6:8, 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today God is in Christ, and Christ, the all-inclusive One, is the Spirit, and this Spirit is the very communication, communion, fellowship, and transmission to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is in our spirit, so now we must learn to exercise our spirit to contact this wonderful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we will enjoy Christ, and all the more we will love Him, pray to Him, turn to Him, fellowship with Him, and know not doctrine but Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must know Him and realize Him more not only individually but also corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should spend time with Him alone individually, and also spend time with Him by being with others in the church and in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we will be filled with Christ, learn Christ, and bear the brands of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Spontaneously we will also have the experience of the cross, because the more we contact Christ and have the fellowship of the Spirit, the more we will be put to death by the killing power, the killing element in the all-inclusive Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more we contact Him, the more He will kill all the negative things, such as the flesh, the desire of the flesh, the soulish life, the old nature, and the worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Colossians and Galatians we can see the working of the cross not only in the past but also in the present through the presence, the anointing, of the all-inclusive Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If all the thousands of Christians in this city knew this way to contact Christ to forget about doctrines, gifts, and everything else and simply learn to live by Christ, live in Christ, and come together to fellowship with one another in the way of life what a powerful impact there would be!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The enemy, however, is subtle to distract people by various doctrines, gifts, and functions, as well as opinions, arguments, and even fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, we have the assurance that the Lord will recover the proper realization and experience of Christ, at least with a remnant, a small number of people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With them at least, God's purpose will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to pray that we may know Christ more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is the all-inclusive One who today is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I would suggest that we not only read these messages but even more that we spend two or three months to dwell on the four books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Spend time in these books to read, pray, and seek the Lord through them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This will be a turning point for us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We will be turned from all things to Christ.</S>
