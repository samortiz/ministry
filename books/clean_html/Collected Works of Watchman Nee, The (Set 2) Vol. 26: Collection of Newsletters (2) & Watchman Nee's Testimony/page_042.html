<h2 class="head3">The Believers' Experience<br />of Passing from Death into Life</h2><p>Each believer which the Lord has purchased with the high price of His precious blood has passed through different situations. Some were separated out from the denominations. Some left the sects quietly. Some were disciplined and punished before they turned around. Some were healed and saved from great sickness and difficulties. Some lost their jobs, but gained the Lord. Some were stumbled with coldness, but were revived. Some passed through thirty years of being pastors before they were clearly saved. Some sought the meaning of religion in many different kinds of denominations and were finally willing to obey the truth. Some were enlivened after being dead in sins and transgressions. Some turned from darkness unto light. Some still stand firm despite persecution from their families. Some stand without wavering despite losing their positions. Some have been threatened by teachers, warned by pastors, counseled by evangelists, and advised by co-workers, but they still have not changed. Some have been misunderstood by their relatives and taunted by their friends. There have also been all kinds of attack, opposition, temptation, and shame, which have been overcome by completely relying on the Lord. In conclusion we are what we are today by the grace of God. We thank the Lord and give glory to Him! (1 Cor. 15:10; 10:12).</p><h2 class="head3">The Persecutions and Frustrations on All Sides</h2><p>We know that this truth is blasphemed in every place (Acts 28:22). After we began meeting in the Lord's name, Satan was very unhappy, of course. Therefore, he did his best to oppose us through men. The strongest of this opposition came from the denominations. They opposed us, saying, "These people have come into the sheepfold to steal the lambs. They pull the fish out of our fish baskets." They were afraid that their members who were like sheep would be released by the truth and saved by the gospel. Therefore, they used every method to frustrate people from coming to the meetings. The pastors and people with positions among them also spoke bad things from the pulpits about us. They said that if you want to be scriptural, you should do everything according to the Bible, including wearing Jewish clothing, being baptized in the Jordan River, and breaking bread in that nicely-prepared upper room, etc. This kind of criticism was nothing but Satan's attack through men. We relied on the Lord who loves us, we stood in His victory, and we were not stumbled. "If God is for us, who can be against us?" (Rom. 8:31).</p><h2 class="head3">The End of the History</h2><p>(1) Every Lord's Day, twelve brothers and more than twenty sisters meet together to remember and worship the Lord. Approximately one-half had been baptized previously by sprinkling, smearing, or immersion, but after being saved and receiving the leading of the Holy Spirit of truth, they were all baptized into the Lord's name and into the Lord's death, being buried together with Him and resurrected together with Him. Most marvelously, an old gentleman of more than seventy years of age joyfully obeyed the Lord. There are still some people who are waiting for the leading of the Holy Spirit concerning the matters of baptism and the breaking of bread.</p><p>(2) With regard to the work, we sometimes go out to pass out tracts and preach the gospel to the unbelievers. Sometimes we preach the gospel on the street corners and speak of salvation to the merchants. Sometimes we go to the prisons or work in the hospitals. Sometimes we go to every house and every place looking for people to preach to. In addition, there are many neighboring villages, towns, and cities that we have not yet gone through completely. Oh, in this great wheat field, "the harvest is great, but the workers few." We really sigh about this! We hope that you will all remember to pray for us that the Lord's Spirit would operate greatly in this area to move people's hearts and revive His work!</p><p>(3) It has been two years since the meeting began. Among the believers, one sister has been loved by the Lord and peacefully left this earthly tabernacle to be with the Lord for eternity. The rest have been touched by the Lord's gracious care and strengthened by His power to peacefully pass through these dangerous and confused days. Whatever our case, we all want to praise the Lord for what has passed, and we still want to rely on Him for the future.</p>
