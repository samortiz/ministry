   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In spite of others' advice, one day in the middle of March, Brother Nee asked his brother-in-law, Samuel Chang, to send him to the railway station to depart for the mainland.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He did this without letting any others know.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Soon afterwards, on April 1, I returned to Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That was the last time I saw him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From that time we had no correspondence and, of course, never saw each other again.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We only received indirect news regarding him from his relatives until he went to be with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>IMPRESSIONS OF CONTACTS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through all the twenty-five years I knew Watchman Nee, from 1925 to 1950, I was deeply impressed with certain characteristics of his.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Absolute toward the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He loved the Lord as his first love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To him the Lord came first in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He never compromised regarding the Lord's interest, nor did he sacrifice any truth for the sake of convenience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He also did not follow the Lord halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His commitment to the Lord was absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Well-balanced</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In knowing the Bible and in his church practice, he was very well-balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He did not follow any teaching or any practice in an unbalanced way as so many Christians in denominations do.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He would frequently compare one view of a certain thing with other views that he might be kept from falling into some extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In his daily Christian life, he practiced the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All-inclusive</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From reading many classical Christian books, he picked up all the good scriptural points of many different Christian groups, gathering them all into the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He never rejected a good scriptural point simply because it came from the wrong source.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He even picked up some good items from extreme Pentecostalism.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this way he was able to bring into the present practice of the church all the riches which Christ had given His Body in the past centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through him we are now able to participate in all these riches in the local churches, not in a narrow way, nor in a sectarian way, but in an all-inclusive way.</S>
