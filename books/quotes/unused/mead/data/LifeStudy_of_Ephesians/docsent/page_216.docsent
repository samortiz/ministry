   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A MATTER OF LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eve typifies the church as Christ s Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Eve was built with a rib taken out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After building this rib into a woman, God presented her to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What came out of Adam went back to him and became one with him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the same principle, the church comes out of Christ and will go back to Christ to be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The aspect of the church as the Bride implies love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Marriage is a matter of love, and the life of a marriage depends on love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a husband and wife do not love each other, it will be very difficult for them to remain together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No doubt, Adam and Eve loved each other.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because of this love, they became one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today there is a mutual love between Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only do we have Him as our life and as our person, but we also enjoy this mutual love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ desires to make known His love to the church, and the church responds by telling the Lord how much she loves Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whatever we do for the Lord we do joyfully and willingly out of love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you love someone, you are happy to serve him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You serve not out of necessity, but out of love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the church, we must bear the testimony that we love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whoever contacts us should receive an impression that we love the Lord and, out of our love for Him, serve Him willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the aspect of the church as Christ s Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>OUR REAL FAMILY</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have a genuine love for the Lord, we shall spontaneously be the church in the aspect of God s family.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>So many worldly people today are either orphans or wanderers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They are homeless.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We in the church life are members of God s family.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we are at home.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church is our real family.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We appreciate the natural family life created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But we can testify that this family life is not as sweet as the family life in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How pleasant is the church as God s family!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you stay away from the church life for a period of time, you will realize how precious the church is in the aspect of God s family.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Oh, we in the church are God s family!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>UNDER GOD S RULE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we have pointed out, we are also God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the church we all are under God s government, God s authority and rule.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are not lawless.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the contrary, we are governed spontaneously in a pleasant and loving way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although there are elders in the churches, they do not exercise control over the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, all the saints are willingly under God s rule.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the church as the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If all the people in this country lived like this, the enemy would be completely subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the church we are under divine government.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because of an inward ruling, we cannot cheat others or take advantage of them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This inner ruling is the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today in the church Jesus Christ is King.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is the King on the throne within us and among us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>GOD S DWELLING PLACE IN OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, the church is the dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we are not in our spirit, we do not have the church as God s dwelling place in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But whenever we turn to our spirit, we sense that God has a dwelling place in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This dwelling place is for God s rest.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>DEFEATING THE ENEMY AND</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>PREPARING THE WAY FOR THE LORD TO COME BACK</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Not only is the church the Body, the new man, the Bride, the family, the kingdom, and the dwelling place; the church is also the warrior to fight against God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God s enemy, Satan, is terrified of such a church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Satan is not afraid of individualistic Christians, not even if they number in the thousands.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But whenever the believers come together as the church in the aspect of the Body and in these other aspects, Satan trembles.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By the church in these seven aspects Christ is expressed, the Father has rest, and the enemy is defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>May we all see the vision that the church is not a matter of individual holiness or spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the contrary, it is a matter of being built up together as the Body, the new man, the Bride, the family, the kingdom, the dwelling place, and the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As such a church, we defeat the enemy and prepare the way for the Lord Jesus to come back.</S>
