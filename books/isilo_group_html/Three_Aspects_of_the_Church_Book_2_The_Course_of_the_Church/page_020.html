<p>Some people have asked me to show them where the Bible says that we should leave the denominations. My answer is based on 2 Timothy 2:20-21: &ldquo;...some unto dishonor. If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these...&rdquo; In the denominations there are many vessels unto dishonor and items of mixture; therefore, we must cleanse ourselves from them. We should work with those who are pure in heart. To leave the denominations is to cleanse ourselves from vessels unto dishonor. Although some groups say that they have no particular ground, truth, fellowship, or practice, we can still see the &ldquo;wood,&rdquo; &ldquo;earth,&rdquo; and confusion among them. We see dishonorable things, such as covetousness, human effort, and impurity in service. If we realize that someone does not have a pure heart, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, I cannot participate in what he is doing; I cannot be his co-worker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God is not pleased with those who make divisions over doctrinal issues, such as pre-tribulation versus post-tribulation rapture. The decision to separate from others must be made on the basis of nature and motive. The Bible clearly tells us to cleanse ourselves from vessels unto dishonor. We should be accommodating in other matters, but the Bible does not require us to accommodate anything of dishonor.</p>
<p>Lowliness is different from dishonor. God wants us to go along with the lowly (Rom. 12:16) but to cleanse ourselves from the dishonorable. Lowliness is a matter of situation and position; dishonor is a matter of nature. A piece of gold beneath our feet is not dishonorable; it is just lowly. However, if a clump of mud is beneath our feet, it is not simply a matter of lowliness, because mud is dishonorable by nature. If something is dishonorable, it is mud instead of gold; although we may elevate mud to a high and glorious position, it is still dishonorable. We should cleanse ourselves from what is dishonorable (2 Tim. 2:21). If we leave the denominations merely for the sake of doctrine or practices, our action has little value in God&rsquo;s eyes. If we leave the denominations on the basis of nature and motive, God will be pleased.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that the overcomers will be raptured in separate groups. However, someone else might have the peace to believe that all the believers are raptured at once, either before or after the tribulation; I would not argue with him about this. If his nature is gold and silver, we can work together, but if he is earth and wood, we cannot work together, regardless of our doctrinal positions. The rapture is not a question of doctrine; it is a matter of loving the Lord&rsquo;s appearing. Perhaps a brother gives a message on the doctrine of the rapture while coveting something apart from the Lord; this means that his heart is not pure, which is something that I cannot accept. If we both love the Lord and turn our heart to Him, then we can labor together. If we work with someone who desires something apart from God, we have a problem. We should work only with those whose nature is gold and silver and whose heart is pure.</p>
<p>A brother once exhorted me to be sociable and adaptable in order to be able to deal with all kinds of people. I would ask that brother how many companions he has who are of one heart with him. In the spiritual realm there are no diplomats or politicians. No one can gain companions through diplomacy. In God&rsquo;s house there are only vessels unto honor and vessels unto dishonor; we cannot use politics to gain companions. The more we live before God, receiving the breaking of the cross so that we desire God alone, the more we will be able to find pure-hearted companions. Companions that we gain using our methods, learning, position, and charisma will end up &ldquo;biting&rdquo; us. We should not decide to work with others by looking at their abilities or learning. This will be harmful to us. We have only one realm, that is, God Himself. We need to learn to live in God and take Him as our goal.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 2, The Course of the Church &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
