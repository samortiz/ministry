   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b Realized as the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 14:16-20 reveals that Christ as the expression of the Father is realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Father is embodied and expressed in the Son among the believers, and Christ the Son is realized as the Spirit entering into and abiding in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to abide in us, the Lord had to be transfigured, transformed, from the flesh into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He came in the flesh to be among us, but He had to be transfigured into the Spirit before He could come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How was the Lord transfigured?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit by His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ realized as the Spirit is another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 16 the Lord said, I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This verse shows that the Spirit is another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Greek word for Comforter, paracletos anglicized paraclete , means advocate, one alongside who takes care of our case, our affairs, and all of our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Greek word for Comforter is the same as that for Advocate in 1 John 2:1.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today we have the Lord Jesus both in the heavens as well as the Spirit within us as our Paraclete taking care of our case.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Holy Spirit, the reality of Jesus and the realization of the Lord, is such a One who is alongside us, ministering to us and taking care of all of our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ realized as this Spirit, this Comforter, is the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In John 14:17, the Lord said, Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the Spirit of reality because whatever the Father in the Son is and whatever the Son is, are realized in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Spirit is the realization of what God the Father and God the Son are.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God the Father is light, and God the Son is life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The reality of this life and light is just the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do not have the Spirit, we cannot have the light of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do not have the Spirit, we cannot have God the Son as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The reality of all the divine attributes of both God the Father and God the Son is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verses 16 and 17 of John 14 also reveal that Christ is realized as the Spirit to be with us and in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only does He abide with the believers v. 16 but also in them v. 17 . As we have seen, when the Lord was in the flesh, He was only able to be among the disciples, to be with them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But after becoming the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of reality in His resurrection, He is able now to abide not only with us but also in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is by being the Spirit that Christ enters into us and abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is realized as the Spirit to live with us in resurrection that we may live.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is indicated by the Lord s words to the disciples in verse 19: Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This refers to Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Lord was resurrected, we were resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First Peter 1:3 tells us that Christ regenerated us in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In His resurrection we were made alive together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, because He lives in resurrection, we also live, for we were regenerated in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By His coming as the Spirit, He enters into us and causes us to live just as He lives.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The life He lives is the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After His resurrection, He comes to enter into us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So He lives and we live by Him also Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He lives by the resurrection life, and we live by Him, sharing Him as the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ is realized as the Spirit so that we may realize that He is in the Father, we are in Him, and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord said in John 14:20, In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The day mentioned in this verse is the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the day of resurrection the disciples were to know that the Lord was in the Father, that the disciples were in Him, and that He was in them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is coinherence.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As Christ is in the Father, so the disciples are also.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now where He is, there the disciples are also.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He died to prepare the way that we might get into God and that God might get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then by being in us and by bringing us into the Father, the Lord can build us together in the Triune God to be His eternal abode.</S>
