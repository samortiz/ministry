   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is a most precious portion of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Christ was on the earth, the Holy Spirit, who is the Comforter, lived inside of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After His death, resurrection, and ascension, He lives inside the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Christ was with the disciples on earth, the Holy Spirit was with the disciples already, for the Spirit was inside Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But what happened after those days?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By His death and resurrection, Christ is now in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, He is coming to His disciples by the Spirit, through the Spirit, and in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may say that the Holy Spirit is now in the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But actually it is Christ in the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is why in the first part of this portion it says, "He...shall be in you," but then the latter part changes to "I am coming to you."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The "I" is in the "He."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE HAND IN THE GLOVE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One time I was talking to a friend of mine in Kaifeng concerning Christ's being in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A foreign lady happened to come by.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She greeted me and was about to take off her gloves to shake my hand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I rushed up to her and said, "There is no need to take off your gloves."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I held up the hand with the glove and turned to my friend, asking, "Am I holding the glove or the hand?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may say that I am holding her glove, but I am actually holding her hand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The relationship between Christ and the Holy Spirit is exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When you outwardly take hold of the Spirit, you are actually possessing Christ inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Receiving the Holy Spirit is the same as receiving Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My friend nodded his head and said, "Now I see!"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is similar to what we said earlier about the divinity of Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may say that He is God and also say that He is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When you touch His divinity, you cannot avoid touching His humanity also.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When His humanity is manifested, His divinity simultaneously comes forth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the same way, Christ and the Spirit are one inseparable entity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You may interchange the two terms as synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit is in Him, and He is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>IN THAT DAY</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us read verses 19 and 20: "Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here the Lord tells us about the purpose behind His putting off the flesh and coming as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The goal of this is that the believers may know that "I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you," that a full and perfect union may be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This fact would come about only "in that day," the day that Christ in the Spirit came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only in that day would we know the oneness of having Christ in the Father, us in Christ, and Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This union moreover transmits to us everything that God did in Christ and everything that God is through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All of His becomes all of ours.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God and man, man and God, become fully mingled into one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>ONE SPIRIT WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ died and rose for us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if He had not come to us in the Holy Spirit, salvation could not be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ could not be joined to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He would be like the old tutor of mine, only wishing that somehow He could get inside of me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But now Christ has taken on a spiritual form.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He can come freely into us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have the possibility of receiving Him because He is now in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Bible also says that "he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit" 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All of us also have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When our spirit receives this Christ who is in the Spirit into us, the two become one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the gem of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Without this, our belief is a common religion with no relevance to our life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Without this, there cannot be an inward salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A CLOSER CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Read again John 16:7: "But I tell you the truth, It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Here the Lord is telling us the truth of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As long as He was in His flesh, the Comforter could not come.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When there was the Christ in the flesh, there could never be the Christ in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is why His death was expedient for us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When I was in Shanghai, a friend said, "It is too bad that Christ ascended up to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If He were still on earth today, I would definitely go and seek after Him no matter how far He was from me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>How I wish I could be like the disciples of His day, who had the privilege of walking, living, and eating together with the Master."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As I was listening, I looked intently into his eyes and said, "I would never wish to be like Peter and John and those others!"</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He asked, "What do you mean?"</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>"Do you know," I said, "that the Christ whom I know is far closer to me than the One that Peter knew on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Everyone who has received Christ should be able to say that our Christ is not merely the Christ in the flesh whom Peter touched; our Christ is the Christ in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Their Christ was One who could be separated from them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He could be with them one day and be gone the next.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our Christ, however, abides with us forever.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Wherever we are, there He is also.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I am not afraid even of going to hell, for if I go, God in me will go with me."</S>
