   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>APPENDIX A LETTER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM BROTHER WATCHMAN NEE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO THE COMPILER</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>MARCH 10, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Dear Brother Weigh,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have long been thinking of writing to you, but I have put it off lest my thoughts were not sufficiently mature to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, I think it is now the opportune time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I hope you will humbly place this before God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am afraid the difficulties of the churches in Hong Kong and Canton will be rather enormous, namely a among co-workers and b in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I hope what I am going to say below will, through the grace of the Lord, help towards changing the situation there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1 Those who are leaders ought to learn to love others, to think on their behalf, to take care of them, to deny oneself for their sake, and to give them all one has.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If one cannot deny himself on account of others, it would be impossible to guide people along the spiritual path.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Learn to give others what you have even if you feel as if you have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then the Lord will start pouring down His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2 The inner strength of a worker should measure up to the outward work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There should not be any overstrain, overreaching, uneasiness, scantiness, tension, lack of overflowing, human plans, or going ahead of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All these are undesirable conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If one is inwardly abundant, whatever is emanating from him is like the flowing of a stream, and there is no overstrain on his part.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You must really be a spiritual man; you should not merely act like one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3 Learn to listen to others in connection with your work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The teaching in Acts 15 is to listen, that is, to listen to the views of all brothers because the Holy Spirit may speak through them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Be very careful lest in refusing to listen to the voice of the brothers you may not hear the voice of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the co-workers and elders ought to sit down to listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Give them unrestricted chances to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Be gentle, be broken, and be prepared to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>4 The difficulty with many people is their being unbroken.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They may have heard about being "broken," but its significance eludes them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If one is broken, he will not attempt to arrive at his own decision regarding business matters or teaching, will not claim to understand people or to be capable of doing things, will not venture to assume authority or to impose his own authority upon others, and will not take the liberty to criticize brothers or to deal with them presumptuously.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A brother who is broken will not try to defend himself, and there is nothing he needs to look back to.</S>
