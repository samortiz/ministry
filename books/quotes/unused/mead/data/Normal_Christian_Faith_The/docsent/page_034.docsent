   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRISTIANITY BUILT ON CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But our faith is entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From its outset, Christianity is built on the man Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not built on the doctrines and teachings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is amazing that when you open the Bible, you will not find too many chapters of doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Passages where pure doctrinal issues are expounded are rare and of less concern to people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What concerns one the most is the man Himself and what kind of person He is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All who have read the Bible know that the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth are not outstandingly voluminous.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His person draws our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He alone is the foundation of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word Christ came from Greek, meaning the Anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the Chinese, when a man takes up a task, he is given a letter of employment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Jewish equivalent of this is anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When God summons a person for a work, He pours oil on the person as a seal of commission.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is the very God who was set apart to come to earth to be a man for the manifestation of God, in order that man may know God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the Anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is commissioned to such a task.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>CHRIST DEMANDS OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>TO BELIEVE IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Due to this basic distinction, Christ is different from the founders of other religions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once He asked His disciples, "Who do you say that I am?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Over and over again He demanded that His disciples believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He said that he who believes in the Son has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Again He said, "He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me" Matt 10:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Unless a man loves in this way, he is not worthy to be His disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Words such as these have been uttered only by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No other religious leader ever said anything like that.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Confucius never said to Yen-weh or Tze-lu, "Believe in me," nor did he ever say, "Love me."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Neither did any of the other leaders, such as Sakya Muni or Mohammed, demand of their disciples faith in them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All it takes to be their disciples is to believe in their doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE ISSUE BEING WHO JESUS IS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the true Christian faith is based on a person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is built on Christ and not on some doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The crux of the true Christian faith is a question of who Jesus is!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Is He merely a Jew?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is He only a prophet?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Or is Jesus the Son of the living God?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The whole matter hinges upon who Jesus of Nazareth is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The difference between a genuine Christian and a false one lies not in the knowledge of the doctrines of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, it lies in the knowledge of who Jesus is!</S>
