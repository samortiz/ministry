<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman" start="2">
<li>The life of Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Romans 5:10 says, &ldquo;For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled.&rdquo; This is also a key word of the book of Romans concerning God&rsquo;s dynamic salvation. It unveils to us that the full salvation of God is of two sections:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first is the section of foundation:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>By the redemption of Christ judicially.</li>
			<li>As the initiation of God&rsquo;s salvation.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The second is the section of consummation:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>By the life of Christ organically.</li>
			<li>As the completion of God&rsquo;s salvation.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The accomplishments by the life of Christ in God&rsquo;s dynamic salvation:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Giving the believing sinners life, who have been justified by God in Christ as the righteousness from God to them that they may live in this life before God&mdash;Rom. 1:17.</li>
		<li>Making the God-justified believers the many sons of God (Rom. 8:14; Heb. 2:10), who are the many brothers of Christ (Rom. 8:29) through regeneration (1 Pet. 1:3) by the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2) with Christ&rsquo;s producing and multiplying life.</li>
		<li>Imparting life to the dying believers that they may grow in Christ out of death unto maturity&mdash; Rom. 8:11.</li>
		<li>Moving in them by the Spirit of life that they may enjoy Christ&rsquo;s life with its peace&mdash;Rom. 8:5-6.</li>
		<li>Sanctifying them (Rom. 6:19-20) with the holy nature of God as the holy element.</li>
		<li>Renewing them, by the Spirit of life, based upon the washing of regeneration, from the old element of their old man into the new constitution of their new man&mdash;Rom. 12:2b; Titus 3:5.</li>
		<li>Transforming them metabolically by the Spirit of life with the element of Christ&rsquo;s divine life, from their old constitution to their new constitution, for the building up of Christ&rsquo;s organic Body&mdash;Rom. 12:2b, 5; 2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
		<li>Conforming them to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God that they may be the full-grown God-men for the Triune God&rsquo;s expression&mdash;Rom. 8:29.</li>
		<li>Glorifying them through the redemption of their body that they may enter into the freedom of glory and their full sonship&mdash;Rom. 8:21, 23, 30.</li>
		<li>Making them reign as kings mainly over the negative things such as Satan, sin, the world, the flesh, etc.</li>
		<li>All the above ten items are for the producing and building up of the organic Body of Christ expressed as the local churches; this is covered in the last five chapters of the book of Romans.</li>
