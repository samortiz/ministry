<h2 class="head1">THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>We must learn to enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8). The riches of Christ are not for theological study; the riches of Christ are for our enjoyment. We must learn to enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ as the all-inclusive, bountiful, life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; Phil. 1:19). When we study the Bible with our mind alone, the unsearchable riches of Christ are just words printed in black and white. But when we exercise our spirit to enjoy what is mentioned in the Bible, the riches of Christ get into us. When the word of the Bible gets into us, it becomes the Spirit. In the beginning, it is simply the printed word, but when we exercise our spirit to pray-read this word, taking and receiving it by means of all prayer in our spirit (Eph. 6:17-18), it immediately becomes the life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is all-inclusive and bountiful. When the word is outside of us, it is simply the word; when it enters into us, it becomes the Spirit. When we speak the word to others, it becomes the word again and when others receive the word that we speak, it becomes the Spirit within them. Outside of us it is the word; inside of us, it is the Spirit. This is our experience. If you dwell on Ephesians 3:8 by pray-reading it for only three minutes, this word will become the life-giving Spirit within you, making you so refreshed, happy, and full of peace.</p>
<p>The best way to stir people up and gain them for the Lord&rsquo;s move is not to teach or preach too much to them, but to ask them to pray-read with you. Do not argue or debate with them; pick up some &ldquo;golden&rdquo; verses and simply practice pray-reading with them. At first the practice of pray-reading may seem strange to them. If they do not pray-read, do not be bothered. Let them sit, listen, and watch as you and the others with you pray-read in a living, refreshing, strengthening, and energizing way. Perhaps, after the first or second time, they may be stirred up and say that they would like to enjoy Christ by pray-reading with their family in their own home. This is the best way to help people to pray-read.</p>
<p>We receive Christ as the life supply by eating (John 6:57). The way to eat is by exercising our spirit through the word by pray-reading (John 6:63; Eph. 6:17-18). To merely exercise our mind is insufficient; we need to exercise our spirit in the depths of our heart. When we lose our temper, we often exercise and release our spirit, but in a wrong way. If we do not know that we have a spirit, or we do not know how to exercise our spirit properly, we may simply exercise our mind to pray without touching our spirit at all. As a result of not exercising their spirit, some may even fall asleep while they are praying. In order to exercise our spirit, we need to know that we have a human spirit. The New Testament reveals that we must exercise our spirit (1 Tim. 4:7; Rom. 1:9; 8:4; 12:11; Gal. 5:16, 25; Eph. 5:18; 6:18). Ephesians 6:18 emphatically states that we must pray at every time in spirit. When we pray by exercising our spirit, we are unable to fall asleep. Rather, the more we pray in this way, the more stirred up we become.</p>
<p>When you pray exercising your spirit, you may feel after kneeling down for five minutes that you cannot remain kneeling any longer; you must stand up to shout, &ldquo;Lord Jesus. Hallelujah! O Lord Jesus! Hallelujah!&rdquo; You may simply become crazy with joy. You may stand up or jump up saying, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; The way to enjoy Christ is to enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ as the all-inclusive, bountiful, life-giving Spirit by receiving Him as the life supply. We receive Him as the life supply by eating, and we eat by exercising our spirit through the word by pray-reading.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING CHRIST AS THE TREE OF LIFE<br />
IN THE PARADISE OF GOD</h2>
<p>The enjoyment of Christ for the church meetings includes eating Christ as the tree of life in the paradise of God (Rev. 2:7). The paradise of God refers to the New Jerusalem which will be enjoyed as a foretaste by the overcomers in the coming millennial kingdom. The church life today is a foretaste of the paradise in the millennium. We have the Lord Jesus in the church life today as the tree of life, and in a very positive sense, the church life is a paradise. The church life is a most pleasant place; therefore, it is today&rsquo;s paradise. In this paradise of the church life, Jesus Christ Himself is living as the tree of life for our daily supply. Therefore, we must eat Him as the tree of life.</p>
