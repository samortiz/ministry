DEATH AND RESURRECTION BY SUBJECTING<br />
OUR MIND, EMOTION, AND WILL<br />
TO THE RULING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We all know that our spirit is deeper than our mind, emotion, and will and that many times it is contrary to our mind, emotion, and will. To live in the spirit is to go against our mind, emotion, and will, not to enthrone them or give them the preeminence but to have them under the direction of the spirit. If all the responsible brothers in the various churches would practice to live and walk in this way, they would surely have the one accord because the Spirit is only one. If you would live in the spirit, I would live in the spirit, and all of us would live in the spirit, subjecting our mind, emotion, and will to the ruling and direction of the spirit, then we would all be in resurrection and under the ruling of the spirit. Spontaneously, there would be the genuine one accord.</p>
<p>Our mind, emotion, and will comprise everything that is of us&mdash;our views, our ideas, our opinions, our thinking, and our likes. Everything that belongs to us, besides God, is included in our mind, emotion, and will. If our mind, emotion, and will are under the ruling of the spirit, we will be in resurrection, and we will touch resurrection. We will truly sense that we have God in us, and we will also sense the presence of heaven. This shows us that resurrection is not objective or abstract. Rather, it is subjective and real because it has entered into our spirit in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>If we want to live in our spirit, we must overcome our mind, emotion, and will, go against our mind, emotion, and will, and submit to the ruling of the spirit. When we live in our spirit, we live in resurrection. When we live in resurrection, we enter into God. Then we practically experience death and resurrection. Some saints may have heard the doctrine of our death with Christ, yet they may not live in spirit. They may try to use their own strength to reckon themselves dead, but eventually, the more they reckon themselves to be dead, the more they will live. Hence, they will have no other way but to pray to the Lord and to ask Him to help them and to bind the enemy, to bind the flesh, and to put it to death. Usually, this kind of prayer is never answered, and the Lord never renders such help.</p>
<p>When we learn to live in the spirit, the death of the cross is ours because there is death in resurrection. Where there is resurrection, there is also death. Hence, Paul said, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death&rdquo; (Phil. 3:10). When we live in resurrection, we will experience the Lord&rsquo;s death. We do not need to pay attention to death, because once we enter into resurrection, death becomes our portion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GENUINE CHRISTIAN LIVING BEING<br />
A LIVING OF RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Now we have the way. It is up to us whether or not we will walk this way and live this kind of living. We need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace to show us that everything has been accomplished and is in the Holy Spirit and that the Holy Spirit is in us. Today the question is whether we will live by our mind, emotion, and will or, on the contrary, in our spirit. This is the responsibility that we bear.</p>
<p>May the Lord be gracious to us, that by His grace we would live in the spirit, in resurrection, and see that all the spiritual riches are ours. May the Lord grant us all to taste the resurrection power. We have a treasure in us that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us (2 Cor. 4:7). The excellency of the power enables us to endure hardship and to bear unbearable afflictions. Whether we face persecution or burdens, this power enables us to be more than conquerors. It is this power that enabled Paul to become a special person. He said that he had seen the Lord of resurrection. He became someone special because the grace of God was with him.</p>
<p>The genuine Christian living is a living of resurrection. A genuine spiritual person is a person in resurrection. One who has authority, power, light, and spiritual reality is one who lives in resurrection, because God, the heavens, the Spirit, and everything are in resurrection. May the Lord open our eyes to see how subjective resurrection is in the Holy Spirit and how practical resurrection is in us. May the Lord grant us the revelation, the vision, and the seeing, and may the Lord bring us into resurrection that all our living and work would be in resurrection.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_054.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_056.html">Next</a> </body></html>
