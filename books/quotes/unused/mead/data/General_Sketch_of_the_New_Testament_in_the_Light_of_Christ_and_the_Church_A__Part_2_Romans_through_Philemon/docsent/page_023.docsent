   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the church life these two matters are very basic.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do not have a vision from God that Christ is everything, it is very difficult to understand what the real meaning of the Christian walk and church life are.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is the portion to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God does not intend to give us anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If God has given us other things, those things are not for themselves; they are for us to realize Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All things, such as forms, knowledge, gifts, and functions, are to help us realize Christ, know Christ, partake of Christ, apply Christ, and experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's intention is to give us Christ as our full portion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is both theirs and ours 1:2 , and we have been called into the fellowship, that is, the participation, of Christ v. 9 . Moreover, God has made Christ wisdom to us, including righteousness for our past, sanctification for the present, and redemption for the future v. 30 . In God's salvation, purpose, and plan Christ is everything to us as power and wisdom v. 24 . Now we must learn to know Him in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our daily walk and in the church life, we must learn how to apply Christ as everything and to experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the other side, there are many negative matters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sin, self, the natural life, the old man, the worldly things, Satan, and darkness all must be dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is not Christ only; He is "Christ crucified" v. 23 , that is, Christ with the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To experience Christ today, there must be the application of His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His cross is the only way to prepare the ground for Him to be everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to experience Him, apply Him, and take Him as everything, we must experience the cross of Christ to deal with all the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first main principle in this book is Christ and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After Paul gives us a general sketch of the Christian life in Romans, he gives us the book of 1 Corinthians to show us the main principles for the life and walk of the universal man Christ with His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This Body of this universal man must realize how to take Christ as everything on the positive side and how to experience the cross daily on the negative side.</S>
