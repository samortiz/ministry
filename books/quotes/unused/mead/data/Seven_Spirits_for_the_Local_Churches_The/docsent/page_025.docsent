   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE REVELATION BEING A BOOK OF PRAISE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last chapter we saw that Revelation is a book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will see that it is a book of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Revelation 5:8-14 there are the praises in the beginning of the book; then in 19:1-7 there are the praises again at the end. In between, in 7:9-12; 14:1-3; 15:2-4; as well as in other places, there are also praises.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Revelation is really a book of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>PRAISING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why are there so many praises in the book of Revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is mainly for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ has won the victory, Christ is victorious, and Christ is worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So all things in the heavens, on the earth, under the earth, and in the sea are praising Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If everything in the whole universe must praise, then what about the church?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Should the church be silent?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How poor Christianity is today!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only those in the heavens, not only those on the earth, but even those under the earth and in the sea are praising.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What about us?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to take the lead to give more praises.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We see how wrong Christianity is today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They build up their cathedrals and church buildings with stained-glass windows and make their places of so-called worship so dark.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When you enter these places, it is so dark, and the roof is so steep that you are afraid to open your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That kind of building keeps your mouth shut.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Have you ever been in a Catholic cathedral?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It simply frightens you into silence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Who did this?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So many Christians talk about 1 Corinthians 12, but they have missed the first three verses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 1 says something about being spiritual, and verse 2 says that when the Corinthians were Gentiles, they were led away to dumb idols.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the idol worshippers are dumb worshippers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word dumb in this verse does not mean that they were stupid, but that they made no sound.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Dumb idols have dumb worshippers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the worshippers of idols are silent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once, I saw several hundred people worshipping idols without any voice; all of them were so dumb and silent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have also seen Catholic churches in many places.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I discovered that all the worshippers in the Catholic churches are also dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They go to some of the images and burn candles without any voice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are so dumb and so silent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christianity teaches people that they must be silent when they worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Is there any scriptural ground for this?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Acts 2:47 says that the early church was praising God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Can you praise God silently?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In a sense, you may pray to God silently, but I do not believe you can praise God silently.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Who can praise without uttering something?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you see the subtlety of the enemy?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In a sense, the services of today s Christian churches are almost a dumb worship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They have pastors to give the message, and the audience sits and listens.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everybody knows how to listen, but very few know how to praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They do not have any spiritual praising; what they have are the formal solos and the special numbers by the choir.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to read the book of Revelation again.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If in all realms of the entire universe everyone is praising, why must we keep silent?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am afraid that many Christians will be surprised that so many in the universe can praise, but they are not used to praising.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>TWO KINDS OF MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose we were all to come into the meeting place in such a silent way: everyone sits quietly, waiting for the song leader to call a hymn; then the pastor offers a prayer and gives a sermon; then there is the benediction, and we are dismissed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do you like this kind of meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You may say that you do not know how to praise, but at least you can say, O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At least you can shout, Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everyone can sing that Jesus is the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Of these two kinds of meetings, which do you prefer?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Which do you think the Lord prefers?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do you prefer a noisy kind of meeting, or do you prefer a silent one?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Regardless of how much you simply listen and hear, there is nearly nothing satisfying and refreshing; there is nearly nothing nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But the more you say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah! the more you are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The more you sing it, the more you are refreshed and nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is because you are exercising your spirit to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord is not a thought or doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord is the life-giving Spirit, and the Spirit is the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christ is the intensified Spirit, the sevenfold breath.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He is not waiting for us to understand Him; He is waiting for us to breathe Him in. The more we say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah! O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah! the more we breathe Him in. This is really good for our spirit, and it is really good for Him too.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We can sense the inner satisfying, the inner watering, the inner refreshing, and the inner nourishing.</S>
