   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>According to 2 Peter 1:2-8, partaking of the divine nature issues in fruitfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 4 says that through God's precious and exceedingly great promises, we "become partakers of the divine nature."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then verse 8 says, "For these things, existing in you and abounding, constitute you neither idle nor unfruitful unto the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can all be fruitful by partaking of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A life that is according to the inward divine nature is a fruitful life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Lord's recovery, we do not need any outward regulations concerning the style of our clothes or the length of our hair.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not pay any attention to outward regulations and organization.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord does not want an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He wants a living testimony composed of living witnesses as a corporate testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should only pay attention to the divine nature within us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the young people go to the campus to preach the gospel, the Christ you bear witness to depends upon the life you live.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You need a daily life that matches the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When you partake of the divine nature and are inwardly regulated, you will gain fruit not only by your words but also by your life and living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Philippians 1:27, Paul charged the saints in Philippi to conduct themselves worthily of the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need a life that matches the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, we need to live out the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should live by the gospel and live out the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, our preaching will be our living, and our living will be fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord has touched me many times while I was praying concerning the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As I would pray concerning a certain person, the Lord would respond, "You do not need to take care of that situation now, you need to take care of yourself."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then the Lord would point out several matters in me that were not according to the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>While I was concerned about another person, the Lord was more concerned about matters in my daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the Lord never touches our conscience through prayer, we are not praying in the Holy of Holies in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although we may pray a great deal, we may be far away from the presence of the Lord in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If this is the case, the Lord will never touch our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, if we pray to the Lord in the Holy of Holies, in His holy presence, He will touch whatever we are and whatever we do.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must allow the Lord to touch us inwardly; otherwise, we will be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are serious with the Lord, He will transform us by His life and according to His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should open every part of our being to the Lord in prayer so that He can touch us through His inward regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then our life will match our preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our life will even be our preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Throughout the years, I have seen many different brothers preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some were eloquent speakers, but their preaching often did not yield much results.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Their preaching was just like sounding brass 1 Cor 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have also seen other brothers who were not eloquent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They could not speak well, but they had a life that matched their preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A life that matches the gospel touches and convinces people because most people have a fair conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A fair conscience is like a balancing scale that weighs whatever a person is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It tests where someone is and what someone is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once you preach the gospel, people will start to watch you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While they accept their own unrighteousness, they will not accept any unrighteousness on your part.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Their fair conscience may not make any demands on them, but it will demand a proper daily living from you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, you have to live a life that matches the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Matthew 5 tells us that we are the light of the world and that we must let our light shine before men vv.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must be full of light, shining over people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should shine out Jesus Christ and the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul stressed the same thing in Philippians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He said that we should be "blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The word of life is not held forth only by our speaking but also by our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must have a daily life that holds forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I hope we are impressed with the need for a proper daily living in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to go to the Lord to be fully checked by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to pray, "Lord, I am going to the campus to preach Your gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I open myself in Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I want to be checked and examined by You.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I want to have a full x-ray' of my entire being."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all need to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everything in our life and living should be checked.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Nothing is too small to be checked.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should even check with the Lord about the watch we wear while preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even it should be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is not too legal.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to be checked because even though we think we are okay, we are not.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need the Lord's shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we are a careless, loose person, then we will not be successful in our gospel preaching, and our gospel preaching will not yield any remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Because the early apostles were solid converts in the Lord's salvation, their gospel preaching produced solid, remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I am so glad and grateful to the Lord that I was saved through a young sister who was so solid in her life and living.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The impression she gave me remains today and will never vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>She had a life that matched her preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We also must have a life that matches our preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The young people do not need to check about the length of their hair with others.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Rather, they need to check with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Before you go to the campuses, go to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If the young people are told to have their hair the same length, that would be only an outward form of legality.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Anything, however, that comes out of the inner divine nature is beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you check with the Lord, you may have your hair adjusted, but the adjustment will be according to the inner divine nature, not according to outward legality.</S>
