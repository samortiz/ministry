[1]  CHAPTER ONE THE LAMPSTANDS Scripture Reading: Exo 25:31-39; Zech 4:2-6, 10; Rev 1:12-13, 20; 4:5; 5:6
[2]  In this book we want to see the Spirit and the church.
[3]  Many religious people think that the church is a physical building, perhaps with a high tower and a bell.
[4]  To say that a physical building is the church is absolutely and thoroughly off from the divine revelation of the church.
[5]  How could we be the continuation of Christ, the enlargement of Christ, or the spreading of Christ unless we have Christ in us Col 1:27 , unless we are a part of Christ Eph 5:30 ?
[6]  The church has the life of Christ and the nature of Christ, so the church is the Body of Christ, the continuation of Christ, the enlargement of Christ, and the spreading of Christ.
[7]  If we are not in the Spirit, we are through with the church because the church is the reproduction of Christ and the reprint of the Spirit.
[8]  The church is nothing less than Christ and the Spirit because both Christ and the Spirit are the lampstand and the church is also the lampstand.
[9]  The lampstands are for God s building in three stages: for the tabernacle, or temple Exo 25:31-39 ; for the recovered temple Zech 4:2-6 ; and for the church Rev 1:12-13, 20 .
[10]  CHAPTER TWO THE BAPTISM IN THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 4:24; Matt 28:19; John 14:16-20; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; Matt 3:11; John 1:33; Acts 1:5; Gal 3:27; Rom 6:3; 1 Cor 12:13; Eph 4:4
[11]  We have seen that there are three categories of the lampstand in Exodus, Zechariah, and Revelation, respectively.
[12]  First, God s move was with Christ; then this very Christ became the life-giving Spirit for God s move, for God s building.
[13]  The first lampstand in Exodus signifies Christ, the second lampstand in Zechariah symbolizes the Spirit, and eventually in the last book of the Bible, Revelation, the seven lampstands are the seven local churches.
[14]  Many people talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit, but not many realize that the baptism in the Holy Spirit is a matter absolutely related to the church.
[15]  THE REPRINT OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Zech 4:2-6, 10; 3:9; Rev 1:12-13, 20; 4:5; 5:6; 1:4, 2, 9; 2:7; 3:22; 22:17; 19:10
[16]  If we have not seen the significance of God s economy, we will not be able to get into the real significance of the whole Bible.
[17]  By looking at this picture we can understand that every local church is a reprint of the Spirit, who is the reality of Christ, who is the embodiment of God.
[18]  God is embodied in Christ, Christ is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is reprinted in the church.
[19]  When the church is seen as the testimony of Jesus in Revelation, all the churches are pure golden lampstands because every local church is a reproduction of Christ, and Christ today is the life-giving Spirit.
[20]  The lampstand for the recovered temple emphasizes the Spirit as the seven Spirits of Jehovah for God s building Zech 4:2-6, 10 .
[21]  Zechariah 3 tells us that Christ as the building stone has seven eyes, and Revelation 5 tells us that Christ as the redeeming Lamb has seven eyes.
