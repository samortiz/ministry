   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE REVELATION IN THE INNER CHAMBERS 1:5-7</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 5 says, "I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Who are the "daughters of Jerusalem"?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a poem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the Jerusalem mentioned here does not refer to the earthly Jerusalem, but to the heavenly Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since these daughters are within the realm of the heavenly Jerusalem, they must be saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Calling them "daughters" means that they are begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, they are not very seeking; they are a cold, ignorant, and careless group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Mr. Hudson Taylor said, "They appear to be the saved ones, but are perhaps barely saved."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"I am black, but comely."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first result of being in the chambers is to discover one's own blackness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without the experience of pursuit, there is no possibility of seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now the maiden sees the kind of person she is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This may be the first time she has seen her own blackness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She did not become black.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This blackness was already present; it speaks of everything that is in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, at the same time, she sees that she is accepted in the Son of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, she says, "I am black, but comely."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Comeliness refers to her acceptance in the Son of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"As the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Kedar" means a dark chamber.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Being as the tents of Kedar means being outwardly dark and uncomely.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If "the curtains of Solomon" are made of fine linen, they must refer to Christ's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The righteousnesses mentioned in Revelation 19:8 refers to the saints' righteousnesses which come from the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But this is the Old Testament, and cannot refer to the saints' righteousnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These curtains should be in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"As the curtains of Solomon" refers to inward beauty, that is, one's beauty before God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 6 says, "Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Sun" in the original language has a definite article with it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through God's enlightening in the chambers, she realizes that she is black.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, she does not want anyone to look at her.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is her mental state at the moment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before the Holy Spirit completes His deep work in a man, he may still want to cover himself before others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But after the Holy Spirit has done a deep enough work, a man will no longer try to hide anything from others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At this point, the maiden's appearance before men is the same as it is before God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a result, she is willing to confess, "I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"My mother's children were angry with me."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The verse does not say "my father's children," but "my mother's children," because mother signifies the principle of promise, which is the principle of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Galatians 4:26-28 says that the Jerusalem above is our mother and that we, like Isaac, are children of promise.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"My mother's children" are those who have become God's children according to the principle of God's grace.</S>
