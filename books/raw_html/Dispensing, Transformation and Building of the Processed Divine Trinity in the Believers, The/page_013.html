<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE BUILDING OF THE PROCESSED DIVINE TRINITY IN THE BELIEVERS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:4-6; John 14:23; Eph. 3:17; 4:15-16; Col. 2:19; 1 Cor. 3:12; Rev. 4:2-3; 21:18a, 19a, 11</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The Triune God’s transformation in the believers is His building in the believers—not merely His making the believers the precious materials for the building of the church:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Through the transformation of the believers, the Triune God builds Himself into the believers and with their transformed new man constitutes the Body of Christ.</li>	<li>The Triune God is the life and reality of the Body, and the believers are the frame and expression of the Body.</li>	<li>John 14:23 speaks of God the Father and God the Son coming to those who love Him and making an abode in them, and Ephesians 3:17 speaks of Christ making His home in the hearts of the believers, who have been strengthened through the Spirit—both refer to this divine and mysterious building.</li>	</ol></li><li>God’s building in the believers is the growth and increase of God’s life in the believers—Eph. 4:15-16; Col. 2:19:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>This building of the transformation in life is for the church—the Body of Christ—1 Cor. 3:12.</li>	<li>This cannot be accomplished by the teaching that is based on the principle of forsaking evil and following good; only the revelation that is according to the principle of the divine life can produce the building of the transformation in life.</li>	</ol></li><li>To build all the mature saints to be a corporate duplication of God as the New Jerusalem:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The appearance of God on the throne is like jasper—Rev. 4:2-3.</li>	<li>The wall of the New Jerusalem and its first foundation are also jasper to express what God is—Rev. 21:18a, 19a, 11.</li>	</ol></li></ol>
