I also heard about the publication of Collection of Newsletters. I am very much in favor of it. A few days ago, I received the fourth issue of Collection of Newsletters. I have not received the first three issues. I really thank the Lord that I was among those who attended the recent Overcomer Conference. I was enlightened by God during the meetings, so that my spirit sprouted new life and I learned something of His truth. I was very joyful to be able to fellowship with the brothers in the Lord in the Body. Although this was my first meeting with you, it was a great blessing in my life. Now that I have returned home from Shanghai, I cannot forget what happened there. Please allow me to tell you something of my experience. Since I left the denominations at the start of the year, two years ago, I believe that I have received God's grace and received His sweetness in my living. I began to meet in the Lord's name in my home. There were more than twenty people in the meetings. Not long after we had established the Lord's table meeting, we met with some experiences of suffering. I will not go into detail. Satan took the opportunity to work much in my home. It was something like the situation in Matthew 10:35-36. This occurred because I was weak and could not govern my own house. How can I govern the house of God? Therefore, I ask you to pray for me that I would overcome all the enemies. This is my greatest hope. Unfortunately, the first time we met, we did not have the opportunity to communicate freely, so I am writing this letter to you in fellowship. I also hope that the second time we see each other, my joy will be full. If this letter can be used in Collection of Newsletters, please feel free to edit and correct it. Otherwise, you can discard it. There are other things I want to tell you, but I will do it next time. Peace! May the Lord bless you!</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chun Ju Nih<br />May 27, 1934</p><h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM BROTHER CHANG YU CHIH,<br />CHIA HSING, CHEKIANG</h2><p>Brother Lee:</p><p>I received your letter. It comforted and encouraged me very much because I was struggling, wanting the Lord to give me a meeting while at the same time feeling in my deepest part that I should wait for Him. Your word to pray and be patient caused me to rest.</p><p>The principal here is also a good brother in the Lord. He wants me to bear the responsibility for preaching the gospel with another brother, Lo Yung Tien. The school meets together for a short time to have so-called morning devotions every Friday and Lord's Day. The principal wants us to preach the gospel to the students during this time. Although we feel that this is a good opportunity, we feel a great pressure, as if we cannot bear this responsibility. We are praying that the Lord would give grace. If it is His will, we would be willing for you to come to preach the gospel for a few days at our school. If you are willing to come, please tell us.</p><p>There is not a table meeting in this locality. We are willing to watch the Lord Himself lead His flock step by step in Chia Hsing. "It is sufficient to have the Lord!"</p><p>Last Lord's Day I got dysentery and stayed in the hospital to rest for five days. I am completely well now. The Lord's keeping power got me safely through. Until we meet again. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Yu Chih<br />September 3</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
