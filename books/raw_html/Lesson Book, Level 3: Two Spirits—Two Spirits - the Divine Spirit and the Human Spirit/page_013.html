<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE COMPOUNDED SPIRIT</H2><P>Praise the Lord! The Bible is truly a wonderful book. Those who say that the Bible is not the Word of God have surely never seen the wonderful picture of the compound ointment. By this picture we can more clearly understand why in John 7:39 the Spirit was not yet. Before the Lord's incarnation, human living, crucifixion and resurrection, the Spirit of God was not a compound; He had merely divinity, nothing else. But now, the Spirit is no longer merely the Spirit of God.</P><P>[Today the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ. In this all-inclusive Spirit we enjoy God, the uplifted humanity of Jesus, the sweetness of the death of Christ, the effectiveness of the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the power of the resurrection of Christ. All these elements are included in this one compound ointment. Remember that the Spirit of Christ is no longer simply the olive oil; it is the compound ointment. This is the processed Spirit. Certainly compounding is a process. Whenever something is compounded, it passes through a process. Hallelujah, today we do not have a Spirit simply composed of divinity alone, but the all-inclusive Spirit compounded with divinity, the humanity of Jesus, the death of Christ, and His resurrection. By our experience we can testify that God, the humanity of Jesus, the effective death of Christ, and the powerful resurrection of Christ are all in the all-inclusive Spirit. This is the Spirit of God compounded with Christ`s humanity, death, and resurrection.]</P><P>We have covered many points in this lesson. You should take some time to memorize the different ingredients, their measures, and what they symbolize. Making a chart or diagram might help you. This will help you to experience the wonderful compound Spirit in your daily life. Few Christians have realized the matter of the compound Spirit. Thank the Lord that He has opened this great truth to us in these days!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Summary</H2><P>The compound ointment in Exodus 30 is a type of the "compound Spirit." The olive oil represents the Spirit of God. The four spices symbolize four elements that have been added to the Spirit: myrrh (Christ's death), cinnamon (effectiveness of Christ's death), calamus (Christ's resurrection), and cassia (the power of Christ's resurrection). In the numbers and measurements of the ingredients we also see: 1) the mingling of God and man; 2) the Triune God; and 3) the ability to bear responsibility. All these items are now included in the processed, compound Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Where do we find the type of the compound Spirit in the Old Testament?</li><li>Name the ingredients of the compound ointment. What do they signify?</li><li>How do these ingredients apply to our experience? (Use calamus as an example.)</li><li>How can we see the mingling of divinity and humanity from the numbers and measurements of the ingredients? How can we see the Triune God? The ability to bear responsibility?</li><li>What do we mean when we say the Spirit of God was "processed" or "compounded"?</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Life-study of Exodus, pp. 1689, 1687.</li><li>The Spirit and the Body, p. 32.</li><li>Life-study of Colossians, p. 229.</li><li>Life-study of Exodus, p. 1750.</li><li>Life-study of Colossians, p. 230.</li><li>Life-study of Exodus, pp. 1751, 1688-1689.</li><li>The Spirit and the Body, pp. 33, 28-29.</li><li>Life-study of Exodus, p. 1744.</li><li>The Spirit and the Body, p. 35.</li></ol>
