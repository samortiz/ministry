   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BURNING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then we read that the Christ in Revelation has eyes like a flame of fire and feet like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All this means that He is burning.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is ancient, He is living, and He is burning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the local churches there should be no coldness or lukewarmness, because Christ is the burning One.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is not only living, but He is also burning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Would we be willing to pray-read for fifteen minutes and allow Christ to look upon us with His burning eyes?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must remember that He has seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Revelation 5:6 tells us that His seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The seven Spirits of God are like seven lamps of burning fire 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we allow these seven eyes to look upon us, surely we will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we can pray-read for fifteen minutes and yet be cold, our pray-reading must be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There must be some kind of insulation, insulating us from within; otherwise, we will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is not only living, but He is also burning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all must be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not speak to me too much; otherwise, you will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am burning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every member in the local churches must be so burning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we are burned and burning, we are not always so clear.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The coldest people are the clearest ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we are cold, we will have an exceedingly clear mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But when we are burning, we are somewhat foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must not try to be so clear.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to be a little foolish, because we are burning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is the One who is walking in the midst of the local churches, and He is the High Priest whose work is accomplished but who has a concern of love for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is also the One who is so ancient, so living, and so burning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suppose Christ were here today with His seven burning eyes and His feet like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Would we dare to contact Him?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the local church Christ is walking in the midst as such a burning One.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE SOUND OF MANY WATERS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is something more.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is not so silent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was somewhat silent when He was walking upon this earth, but today He is different.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today He is in the local churches with a voice as the sound of many waters.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all must be living and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are not serving a silent Christ, but One with a voice like the sound of many waters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we come together in the local churches, we need to have the sound of many waters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the local churches Christ is not so silent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must be filled with Him; then our praises will be just like the sound of many waters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to be noisy, because the very Christ who is within us and who is walking in our midst is a Christ with a loud voice.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those in Christianity may say that this is extreme, but the Lord is going to revolutionize Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is even going to revolutionize our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no need for us to keep the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There must be something new and living all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE FIERCE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The first chapter of Revelation is absolutely different from the first chapter of John.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is really good.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But I also admire the first chapter of Revelation, for it tells us something about a Christ who is not so gentle but so fierce.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Look at the picture of Christ in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His eyes are like a flame of fire, His feet are like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace, and His voice is like the sound of many waters.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the end of the age the Lord must be fierce.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is because the days are so dark, so evil, and so dead.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need something fierce.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Dead Christianity needs a fierce Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you exercise your mind to read the Bible day by day, you will be so cold and so silent.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But if you would forget your mind and contact the living Christ who is walking in the midst of the local churches, you will be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Why are you so silent?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is because you read too much.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why are you so silent?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is because you never say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you try, you will see.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You will be burned, and you will jump up and shout.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You can never be so silent if you contact the Christ in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Something will burn within you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the way Christ is today in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must not bring our past impression of Christ into the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must have a new impression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Christ who is walking in the midst of the local churches is very ancient, yet so living and burning.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He has seven burning eyes, His feet are like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace, and His voice is like the sound of many waters.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is absolutely different from the impression of Christ we received in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Praise the Lord that we have seen such a Christ!</S>
