   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Now let me repeat what I have been saying about the nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Any reason to divide the church damages the nature of the church; that is, it turns the unity of the church into disunity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Due to the fact that we are in the human body, geography is the only factor that can separate us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such separation does not threaten the nature of church unity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, God ordained to have locality as the earthly boundary of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God also ordained that in one locality there should be only one church to express the unity of the heavenly church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must see the spiritual reason for separating the church by localities.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once we see this, we will know whether or not the present-day principle of separating the church by houses is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The way to separate the saints at Jerusalem by houses was scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Due to the great number of people a physical reality they were separated into many meetings in the houses.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church, however, was still one, "the church singular number in Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today, man's way to divide the church by houses is to make many churches within one locality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It has nothing to do with physical limitations, geographical reasons, or the inconvenience of coming together from great distances.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It has nothing to do with the fact that the crowd is large and that there is not enough room to sit together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It has nothing to do with the fact that there are so many people and that care for them is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It has nothing to do with the practical problem of handling administration over great distances.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is simply a way of dividing the church into many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Dividing people into many churches because of such an underlying reason is harmful to the nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Separations that are not based on geographical or physical demand are spiritual in nature; they touch the spiritual unity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This kind of separation is not outward and limited, but inward and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Any division that is not for a geographical or physical reason is an intrinsic, real, basic, and spiritual division.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, this kind of division is a division in the very nature and essence of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is damaging to the spiritual unity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since we first saw the light concerning the oneness of the Body of Christ twenty-eight years ago, we have passed through many waves of adversity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But I believe we have never passed through one that is more serious and more ambiguous than the teaching about the "house" church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the first time people have opposed the truth by agreeing with it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since we all are people who serve God, I beg you to seek the light of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not send forth a confusing voice in the church of God; rather get rid of the sectarianism from your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must not push the oneness of the church entirely to the "spiritual" side by saying, "We are one in life!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are one spiritually!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brothers, when we do not live together in the same city, we might be able to cover ourselves with spiritual words and hide our disunity with such "spiritual oneness."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But since we all live in the same city, is it conceivable that we would not express or demonstrate our oneness?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since there are no geographical and physical factors to divide us, is not this the time to show that we are one church?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why at such an opportune time for us to show our oneness should this different teaching related to a "house" church come into being?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Does this teaching related to a "house" church represent unity or separation and sectarianism?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Lord, have mercy on us!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I dare not say from where the teaching about the "house" church comes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But I am afraid that the brother who speaks about this has not seen the sin of sects.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This teaching is a halfway place to sectarianism; it is not a thorough rejection of sects.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A person who has left the denominations is not necessarily one who has left the sects.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am afraid that some who only know their individual movement, individual living, and individual work are not willing to be limited by the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These are the ones who love this kind of talk about the "house" church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who do not desire to listen to the church but desire to establish their own churches value this kind of "doctrine."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>May the Lord's blood cover me for speaking like this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I think humility may be profitable to some people, but not to take our own way is profitable to all of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Finally, this kind of "house" church is not the house that is in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This kind of "house" church is a sect, a disguised sect.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This kind of "house" church causes people to divide, not to unite.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This kind of "house" church hurts the nature of the church while concealing its wound.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This kind of "house" church builds up the individualism, lawlessness, and ambition for leadership in many.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>May the Lord have mercy on me for speaking in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May He have mercy on His churches that they may not be damaged.</S>
