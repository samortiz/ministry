We have to learn to continually touch God's speaking. Every time we gain some experience, we learn something and acquire some spiritual feeling. Every experience will increase our spiritual perception and make us more accurate in touching God's word.</p><p>Only those whose outer man is broken can touch divine things accurately. If the outer man is not broken, a person cannot be entrusted with spiritual things. The outer man is always a frustration. All problems hinge on an unbroken outer man.</p><p>A man of prayer seeks God's will, is broken in the outer man, and is reliable in his spiritual perception. The trouble with us is that we have our outer man&mdash;our thoughts, emotion, and will. The spirit does not have a body of its own; it does not have a mind, emotion, and will of its own. When it needs to express itself, it does not have a mind, an emotion, or physical strength of its own. The spirit depends on the mind, emotion, and will of the outer man to express itself. Hence, the spirit is restricted by the outer man. Our spirit cannot be released apart from the outer man. The trouble often is that our spirit is willing but our flesh is weak. In order for the spirit to come out freely, the outer man must be in subjection. The outer man must cooperate with the spirit in this way. Otherwise, when the spirit calls for the emotion, the latter may spin around in its own orbit and not respond to the spirit. The breaking of the outer man is a fundamental experience of a servant of God. We have to see God's revelation and receive His shining. When the outer man is broken, the spirit will no longer suffer any frustration. Many people speak many words in their prayers, but their understanding falls far short of T. Austin Sparks's prompt answer: "Everything depends on the breaking of the outer man."</p><p>In Matthew 17, the disciples asked the Lord why they could not cast out the demon. They could not understand why the Lord was able to do this in an instant. The Lord answered, saying, "This kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting" (vv. 19, 21). Yet the Lord did not have to fast and pray; He cast the demon out right away. He could do this because His outer man was broken already.</p><p>During one visit with Miss Barber, I heard a loud noise coming from downstairs. It interrupted our fellowship. Miss Barber asked me to listen to the noise and the desperate cry. She asked if I knew what it was all about. I said that it sounded like someone praying. She laughed and said, "There is no need to spend so much energy to force God to do something. What is the use of outward commotion when the inner being is not touched at all?"</p><p>Fasting prayer is a means through which the outer man is put to rest. If the outer man is broken, there is no need of fasting prayer. This prayer merely removes the frustration that is associated with the outer man so that the inner man can be released. Fasting prayer is like crossing the Jordan. Even when water has flooded both banks of the river, we can still ask God to part the water and open up a way (Josh. 3:14-16). If the outer man is broken, there is no need to go through many steps for the inner man to be released.</p><p>Question: Can a man know if he has any amount of brokenness? Is the extent of brokenness the same eventually for every person?</p><p>Watchman Nee: Brokenness is a fundamental experience for everyone, but it is also a progressive experience. There is always a line that we can trace in this process. The main thing in this process is shining and revelation from God. When God in His mercy shines on us and reveals Himself to us, we will know. Is the extent of breaking the same eventually in everyone? Of course not! The amount of breaking mainly depends on the lessons each person has learned before the Lord. On the one hand, the breaking of the outer man depends on our consecration. On the other hand, it depends on the amount of work God has done in us. We must give ourselves to learn the lessons before we can have the proper experience. Only those who learn their lessons are able to render help to others.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 61: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (1) &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
