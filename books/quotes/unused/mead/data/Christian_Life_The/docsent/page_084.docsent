   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR IDENTIFICATION, UNION, AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MINGLING WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Recently, I looked at two books which I purchased in San Francisco twenty-nine years ago in 1963.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One is called Bone of His Bone, and the other is called Born Crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Bone of His Bone is a reference to Adam's word when God presented Eve to him Gen 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Adam was looking for a counterpart, and God presented to him all the animals one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Of course, all of these animals could not match him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Adam named every living creature, but not one matched him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then God put Adam to sleep, opened up his side, and took out a rib.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Genesis 2:22 says that with this rib God built a woman for Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The King James Version says that God "made" a woman, but this is an inadequate translation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Hebrew text says that God "built" a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The rib of Adam was the building material with which God built a female.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then Adam woke up, and God brought Eve to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Adam saw Eve, Adam said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In typology the bone with which Eve was built signifies the resurrection life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Bone of my bones" indicates that we, the members of the church as the Body of Christ, are parts of the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the jacket of the book Bone of His Bone, the publisher says that Christ's death on the cross was not just for redemption but for identification.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Identification here means union.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ died so that we could be united with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He died on the cross not only for objective redemption but also for subjective union, subjective identification.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The book Bone of His Bone says that the Christian life is not an imitation of Christ but a participation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To imitate Christ is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ died on the cross and we cannot imitate that, but we can participate in Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We cannot imitate Christ, but we participate in Him and in all that He has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This union between us and Christ began from incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before incarnation God was merely God, and man was man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God and man did have some kind of relationship and some transactions with each other before the incarnation, but there was no union between them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The thought of union is in the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some call this union a union of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have a life union with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are identified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, even the word identification is not fully adequate, because it does not convey the full thought of the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>An identification card may have our picture on it, but that picture is not the real, living person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This shows that our terminology in human language is always inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to see the revelation of the union of God and man, beginning from the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Incarnation is God in His second person, embodying the entire Divine Trinity, becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In other words, incarnation was the Triune God embodied in Christ becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is God uniting Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John 1 says that the Word, who was God, became flesh vv.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, the identification between divinity and humanity, or the life union between divinity and humanity, began with divinity being joined to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, when God became a man, the union between God and man started.</S>
