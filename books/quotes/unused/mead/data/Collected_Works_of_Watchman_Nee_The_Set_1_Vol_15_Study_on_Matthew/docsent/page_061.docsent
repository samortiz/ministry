   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>These keys of the kingdom of the heavens were given not only to Peter but also to the other disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Moreover, they are also given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Only when we have the keys do we have the authority to bind i.e., not to open and the authority to loose i.e., to open .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matthew 18:18 gives the same promise.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This proves that the keys are given also to others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The "you" in Matthew 18:18 is plural and refers not to Peter alone but to all those who are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, we also have these keys.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since Peter's keys were for preaching and baptizing, ours are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the first one to be regenerated and the first one to confess the Lord, Peter was qualified to receive the keys first and to begin preaching the gospel and baptizing people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have the authority not to preach the word and the authority not to baptize someone if in our consideration such a one is not saved and therefore should not be baptized , because the keys are in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The confession of Christ is the rock petra , the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church and the kingdom of the heavens cannot be separated, though they can be distinguished.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A person may be in the kingdom of the heavens, but he may not be in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Matthew 28 the eleven were only disciples; they were not apostles yet apostleship is a gift in the church .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the entire Bible there are two lines: 1 the church and 2 the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The two are distinct but not separate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 20:"Then He charged the disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord as the Son of God should be mentioned to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the Lord as the Christ should not be mentioned to certain groups of Jews, those who blasphemed the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Son of God is eternal, whereas Christ is for the fulfillment of God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, there is no need to mention this to the Jews who rejected the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This also proves that from the time they blasphemed the Holy Spirit, recorded in 12:24, the Jews were rejected by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 21:"From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here, "from that time" means after Christ was confessed and the church was revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The death that the Lord referred to is not the redeeming death but the death by the suffering of persecutions and the death by being rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the Bible, the Lord's death has two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The conservatives hold to the redeeming death, while the modernists hold to the death of rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many of the Lord's sufferings were not for redemption but were due to His being rejected by men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord prophesied here only concerning His death by rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The same prophecy was spoken three more times in the latter chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From that time on He no longer hinted but spoke plainly concerning His death by rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 13 gives a hint that the Lord would be rejected and would suffer death; the words "from that time" signifies a great turning point, a great backbone in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 22:"And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord! or, God forbid it, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This shall by no means happen to You!"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Peter took the Lord aside, acted according to his old disposition, and without careful consideration he quickly rebuked the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord will not be persuaded by men and will never accept teaching from men.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Peter's persuasion came out of his affection, his love; it is similar to our urging those we love not to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>An unrestrained mind is dangerous, but an unrestrained emotion is even more dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Peter acted impulsively according to his unrestrained emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Apparently it was good, but in reality it was a hindrance that the Lord hated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we try to dissuade people from taking the narrow way, it is just like Peter trying to dissuade the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We also say, "God forbid it!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 23:"But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord would not forgive Peter's mistake, nor would He accept Peter's kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"He turned" shows that Peter was at the Lord's back.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It must have been that Peter came from behind the Lord and took Him aside.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Speaking behind people is usually wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"Get behind Me."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is strange since Peter was already behind Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It means that the Lord would not give Peter the opportunity to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whoever tries to teach or help the Lord is surely wrong, for He is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can give two examples of how the disciples tried to teach the Lord: "You see the crowd pressing upon You" Mark 5:31 and "They have no wine" John 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the Lord's moral glory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Peter had just received the regenerated life, yet immediately he was trapped and utilized by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The victory at Jericho is followed immediately by the defeat at Ai.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, we should be especially on our guard after any victory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Anything that prevents people from going to the cross is from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"Get behind Me!"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This was because Peter was a stumbling block that caused others to be stumbled and stopped from going on.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord considered Peter's frustrating as something of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whoever sets his mind on the things of men is of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Satan is very close to men.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Perhaps he has already been in and out of our mind today fifty times.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Verse 24:"Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we interpret the cross here as redemptive in nature, then we cannot follow the Lord, for how can we have a part in the redemptive work?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Only the high priest can enter the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, redemption is the Lord's work alone.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The cross is not only for redemption but for suffering obedience in persecutions.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord calls us to suffer, not to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Here it is a matter of following Jesus, not of believing in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Believing puts us in the church, and following enables us to be in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>To believe and not to follow is most dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Following is the cheapest price we pay.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The least requirement of the Lord to us is that we deny ourselves, that is, that we follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We need to reject our own mind and seek to satisfy God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>To deny ourselves equals taking up our own cross.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There are two kinds of crosses: 1 the cross of Christ for redemption John 11:50-52 , and 2 the cross of sufferings the cross ordained by God for each believer.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The cross that the Lord arranges for each believer is different.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Although the ways are different, they are the cross just the same.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The cross is the blows we suffer on our way.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After we have been saved, we desire to take one way, but God wants to take another way.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>May God's blows be always upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Lord is teaching us through Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He rebuked Peter for setting his mind on the things of men, that is, for disobeying the blows that come from God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The denial of self is the only condition for following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>To deny the self, which is negative, is to refuse to mind our own things.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>To take up the cross is to endure the pain in our refusing to mind our own things.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>To follow the Lord is to take the Lord's way, to obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we want to save our soul in this age, we will lose it in the coming age; if we lose our soul in this age, we will save it in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The soul includes the mind, the will, and the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>To save our soul is to satisfy our mind, will, and emotion in this age, that is, to not deny the self.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>To lose the soul in this age is to deny the self, which is the opposite of saving the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He who sacrifices for the Lord loses his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Whoever does not want to lose his soul today will lose the satisfaction of his soul in the kingdom, just like the one-talented slave who will be weeping and gnashing his teeth in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Those who enjoy the pleasures in the world, who do not labor for the Lord, and who, instead of wiping their sweat with their handkerchief use it to wrap up their talent, will lose their soul, that is, suffer shame, in the millennium, though they will still have the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>To gain the soul in the future is to have the enjoyment in the kingdom, that is, to receive glory.</S>
