<P>At this point in our fellowship concerning knowing the Body, I would like to add a word concerning those saints whom the Lord used to recover the experiences of the inner life. Madame Guyon was the one who took the lead in this recovery in the seventeenth century. However, although she was so spiritual and in life, she still went to the image of Mary. The preface of her biography said something concerning her doing this. When we translated this biography into Chinese over fifty years ago, a brother among us had the thought of including this preface, but we did not agree with this. Her life with the Lord was very good, but the truth was not that complete to her. We could not publish such a preface in the Chinese version of her biography. I am sharing this to impress us that we should not trust in people's spirituality. Spirituality is conditional. How spiritual is it to be spiritual? If you say that someone is very good, how good is very good? You may be very spiritual today, but how will you be ten years later? Because spirituality is conditional, it should not be taken as a base or as a standard. The base and the standard must be the truth. The truth is not conditional. It is the fact.</P><P>In 1957 Brother T. Austin-Sparks came to us in Taiwan for the second time. We had a few sessions with him to talk about the matter of spirituality and the truth concerning the church. Dr. Chang Yu-lan, who is now with the Lord, pointed out that there were a number of meetings in Taipei all of which claimed to meet in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then he asked Brother Austin-Sparks which one of these meetings could be considered as the church in Taipei. Brother Austin-Sparks said strongly that the ones who have more of Christ are the ones who are more the church. At first I thought I should not be involved in this discussion, since I was the translator. Eventually, I realized that I had to say something; otherwise, the issue would not be resolved.</P><P>I pointed out that Christ is the element, the reality, and the center of the church. Because of this, we might mistakenly think that those who have more of Christ are more the church. Although this seems to be correct, I showed that this was wrong. I pointed out the example of Madame Guyon. She had much of Christ, but she still remained in the Catholic Church. Could we say that because she had much of Christ, she was right concerning the church? Then I pointed out how Brother Austin-Sparks referred to F.B. Meyer in his messages. Although F.B. Meyer was very spiritual, he still remained in a denomination. He worked for and built up that denomination. Could we say that because Brother Meyer had much of Christ, he was right concerning the church? My speaking refuted what Brother Austin-Sparks said. My illustrations showed that we should not say that the more of Christ you have, the more you are the church.</P><P>Brother Austin-Sparks visited us in Taiwan in 1955 and in 1957. He took many pictures during his first visit and he showed these slides to people when he returned to England. He said that in his entire life, he never had such a marvelous congregation as he had in Taiwan. He visited us again in 1957, and this is when the problem with him arose over the truth concerning the ground of the church. When he returned he told people that I was too much for the church ground. I told people, however, that I was not yet enough for the church ground. The church should be measured by the ground of locality and by the reality of the Spirit of oneness. It should not be measured by people's spirituality. Spirituality is relative and conditional.</P>
