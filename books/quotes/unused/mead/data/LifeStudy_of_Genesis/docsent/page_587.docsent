   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FOUR BEING MATURED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE MANIFESTATION OF MATURITY 6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to the last group of Jacob's twelve sons mentioned in his prophecy with blessing, the group composed of Joseph and Benjamin 49:22-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The twelve tribes of the sons of Jacob in the Old Testament are always grouped together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Numbers 2 we see the arrangement of the twelve tribes around the tabernacle: Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun on the east; Reuben, Simeon, and Gad on the south; Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin on the west; and Dan, Asher, and Naphtali on the north.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Among the twelve sons of Jacob, only three were types of Christ: Judah, Joseph, and Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Judah was a type of Christ as the overcoming victorious Lion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Joseph was a type of Christ as the beloved Son of the Father bringing all the riches to feed the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Benjamin was a type of the ascended, exalted Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When he was born, his mother called him Benoni, which means "son of sorrow," but his father changed his name to Benjamin, which means "son of the right hand."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, Judah, Joseph, and Benjamin typify Christ in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although Reuben was the firstborn, he lost the birthright because of his defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, in God's adminis- tration, Judah took the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, without Joseph and Benjamin, the history and significance of the twelve tribes of Jacob would have no conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Joseph and Benjamin provide an adequate, full conclusion of the history of the twelve sons of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The twelve sons of Jacob are a complete type of God's people, including all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have seen that the history of God's people begins with sinners, for we were all sinners like Reuben, Simeon, and Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Reuben was full of lust, and Simeon and Levi were full of anger.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, the history of God's people began with sinners who were full of lust and anger.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then came Christ, typified by Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Later Naphtali appeared as a hind set loose and giving beautiful words.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the history of God's people ended with Naphtali, it would be good, but not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For an adequate conclusion both Joseph and Benjamin are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This history of God's people begins with sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually these sinners are transformed into Levis with the priesthood and even into Judahs with the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then Naphtali, the resurrected Christ, brings forth beautiful words.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that we once were Reubens and Simeons, but we need to be transformed into Levis, Judahs, and Naphtalis.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, we must go on to become Josephs and Benjamins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before we consider the significant aspects of Joseph and Benjamin, I wish to point out that Joseph and Benjamin, two sons born of one mother, Rachel, are two aspects of one person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Jacob saw Rachel, he fell in love with her, and his heart was set on her.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, he did not firstly marry Rachel, but Leah, who brought forth six sons.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although children had also been born to the maids of Rachel and Leah, Rachel herself did not bear any children until ten sons had been born.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only then did Rachel give birth to Joseph, whose very name indicated that another was to be added.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This signifies that in himself there was no completion with Joseph; there was the need of another part.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Benjamin, therefore, was Joseph's completion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, Joseph and Benjamin are one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you read the Old Testament, you will see that it places Joseph and Benjamin together as a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually, Joseph received the birthright and through his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, inherited the double portion of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this way Joseph became two tribes, the tribe of Ephraim and the tribe of Manasseh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, the tribe of Manasseh received two portions of the land: one half of this tribe received land on the east of the Jordan River, and the other half received land on the west.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Joseph and Benjamin are one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The fact that Joseph was the eleventh son and Benjamin, the twelfth indicates that they were close to each other in sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, among the twelve sons, Joseph and Benjamin were the last pair.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Later they became the three tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin, which were encamped at the rear of God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Judah was the leading tribe in the front of the tabernacle, but Joseph was at the rear.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Let us now consider the significant aspects of this group.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Joseph was very faithful, and he was absolutely victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the record of the Old Testament, Joseph was the first perfect person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No one who preceded him, including Noah, was perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But in Joseph we can find no fault; he was utterly perfect in his behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Joseph was perfect because he was altogether victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, the Old Testament likens Joseph to an ox full of strength Deut 33:17, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was not a fierce lion or a threatening wolf, but an ox full of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As an ox, Joseph had two horns: Ephraim and Manasseh.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With these two horns Joseph will push the peoples together to the ends of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This indicates that Joseph is strong in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Joseph also trusted in God and believed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because Joseph was perfect and victorious, and because he trusted in God, God blessed him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No one in the Bible received a blessing greater than that given to Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As we shall see, he was blessed with ten items in time and in space, with everything from eternity past to eternity future and from heaven to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Joseph received everything.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The entire universe became a blessing to him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Benjamin is described as a tearing wolf 49:27, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Also, God's dwelling place is with Benjamin Deut 33:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Thus, Jacob's prophecy with blessing ends with the fullness of the universal blessing and with God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The end of Genesis 49 requires Revelation 21 and 22 for its complete development.</S>
