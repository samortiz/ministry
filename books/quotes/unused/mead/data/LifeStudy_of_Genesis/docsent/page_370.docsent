   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>d To Bring the Bride to Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eventually, the servant brought Rebekah to Isaac vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>51, 61-67 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although it was a long journey, he brought her through and presented her to Isaac as his bride.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Holy Spirit has convinced us and now He is bringing us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although it is a long journey, eventually He will bring us through and present us to Christ as His lovely bride.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>3 The Church's Response</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we must see the church's response.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we have seen, Rebekah responded immediately, being willing to go with the servant to Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although there is within our old, fallen nature a reluctance to follow the Lord immediately, we cannot deny that there is also within us the willingness to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although we are still in this old nature, it is nevertheless easy for us to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is much easier to follow Him than not to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not believe the lie of the enemy that you can easily be frustrated in following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Tell the enemy, "Nothing can frustrate my desire to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Deep within me there is the longing to follow Him."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Satan is a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes he even lies to us through preachers who speak negative things and tell us that we cannot love the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not believe the lies, but declare, "No!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I can and I do love the Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may even lie to ourselves, saying, "I'm so weak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I just can't follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I'd better turn around and go back."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must reject this lie and say, "I will never go back.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I will follow the Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Never believe the lie that you do not love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Tell the enemy, "I love the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My loving Him does not depend upon my ability to love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It depends on His being so lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because He is lovable, I cannot help loving Him."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If I gave you a pair of old shoes, you would reject them, saying, "I don't care for those!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if I gave you some diamonds, you would easily love them, not because you have the ability to love but because the diamonds are lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Likewise, we do not love the Lord Jesus because we are able to love; we love Him because He is so lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Genesis 24, it was not Rebekah who was able to love Isaac and respond to him; it was Isaac who was lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>a Doing What the Spirit Expects</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our response to the Holy Spirit is that we always do what He expects.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Abraham's servant expected that Rebekah would give him a drink of water and then draw water for his ten camels, and Rebekah did exactly what he expected vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>18-20 , satisfying the servant's thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Often we have unconsciously done what the Holy Spirit expected, satisfying His desire, doing it without knowing what He expected.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our doing this was a sign that we were under the moving of the Spirit.</S>
