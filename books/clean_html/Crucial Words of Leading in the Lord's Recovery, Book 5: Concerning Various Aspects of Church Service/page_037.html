<h2 class="head1">REASONS FOR THE PRACTICE<br />
OF THE CHURCH LIFE BEING LIMITED</h2>
<p>Now we would like to fellowship concerning our practice. In order to lead the church and give accurate direction, we must have sufficient knowledge of the Bible. We must know the Bible not merely in theory but more so in practice. To this end I have returned to the Bible many times, and especially the New Testament, to consider the matter of levels in the church.</p>
<p>I have been overseas for more than twenty years. Approximately one hundred churches in America and Canada have been raised up since I went there. There are also approximately one hundred churches in South and Central America that have been raised up by this ministry. These churches and the more than one hundred churches in Europe, New Zealand, Australia, and Africa have all been raised up recently. All these churches are in my heart, and I have been observing and considering their situation. In addition, there are three hundred churches in the Far East. Altogether there are six hundred churches. In all the churches everyone wants to gain a high position. This is true in the West and in the East.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Wanting to Become Great</h2>
<p>Everyone regards the elders very highly. In 1976, during the training on the <em>Life-study of Matthew,</em> we read where the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant&rdquo; (Matt. 20:25-26). During that training I told the sisters whose husbands are elders that they should say, &ldquo;When my husband became an elder, he became a slave&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of Matthew,</em> p. 656). The sisters whose husbands become elders in the church should not consider themselves to be first ladies. They must realize that elders are slaves and that elders&rsquo; wives are slaves&rsquo; wives. In America there are some in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery who travel from place to place looking for an opportunity to be an elder. Such an ambition limits the Lord&rsquo;s spread. Many brothers and sisters who could have been useful have stopped growing in life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Too Much Authority Being a Limitation</h2>
<p>When the elders in the church have too much authority, it becomes a limitation. Ten years ago there were four thousand in the children&rsquo;s meeting. Based on this, I suggested that it would be good to work on the children until there were ten thousand children. Now there are only five hundred fifty in the children&rsquo;s meeting. The functioning saints stopped laboring in the children&rsquo;s work because no one promoted the work and no one sounded the call. At the end of 1980 the total attendance in all our meetings was not very high.</p>
<p>We need statistics in everything. As soon as we look at the statistics, we know where the lack is. The elders&rsquo; administration of the church has unconsciously become a limitation to us, because they do not have a long-term view and do not bring the saints into function. The elders are not aggressive to make arrangements, so the saints cannot do much. If the elders were aggressive to make arrangements, all the saints would be able to function. This limitation comes from the elders having too much authority. Whatever the elders do not decide upon does not get done. It does not seem as though this is the situation, but it is the fact. The root of our sickness is that the elders have too much authority, so there are levels in the church.</p>
<p>Suppose a young person wants to live in a brothers&rsquo; house. The elders do not have to be involved in this matter. They should hand it over to the responsible ones in the brothers&rsquo; house. Whatever decision the responsible ones make should be good enough. There is no need to obtain the approval of the elders. This is the main reason that our work does not spread and advance. This does not mean that our condition is declining or corrupted on the negative side but that we are trying to maintain an orderly condition on the positive side. Therefore, whatever happens, even at the &ldquo;lowest level,&rdquo; has to be approved at the &ldquo;highest level.&rdquo; Such a situation is a hindrance, causes much trouble, and consumes much manpower and time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Co-workers and Elders<br />
Not Being a Special Class</h2>
<p>I stand before the Lord and beg that we would change our way of doing things, especially with the newly appointed elders and deacons. In the past the co-workers and elders among us were treated as a special class of people. Such a flavor, to an extent, still exists among us. For the sake of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony on the island of Taiwan there should not be any special class of people among us, whether in the church or in the work.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, the work here was entrusted to me and has been built up by me with the brothers. The Lord knows that I am often in fear and trembling in His presence, that I would not have a haughty manner when I contact the saints. However, according to my observation, the co-workers have a haughty and lofty manner, and the elders have a bureaucratic flavor. The elders have their responsibilities, but they should not be haughty. The elders are not higher than the deacons, and the deacons are not higher than the saints. There are no such levels in the church.</p>
<p>Leading a church can be compared to leading a country. A country has a constitution, and a church has the Bible, which is our constitution. Everything we do should be according to the Bible. For instance, some of the elders have been serving since they were in their thirties, and they are now in their seventies. Because their physical energy is decreasing, they cannot bear too many responsibilities, but they are still elders. How should we deal with such a situation? How long should an elder&rsquo;s tenure be? I cannot answer this question. Although I am rather familiar with our constitution, the Bible, I cannot find a word that specifies how long the tenure of an elder should be. In practice this is a problem.</p>
