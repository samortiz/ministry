   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN CALLING GOD TO HEAR THE VOICE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF HIS SUPPLICATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psalm 28 shows us the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in calling God to hear the voice of his supplications.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. Asking God, His Rock, Not to Be Deaf and Silent to Him When He Cried Out to Him</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The psalmist asked God, his rock, not to be deaf and silent to him when he cried out to Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot say that this belongs to the tree of life, because there is no indication of life here.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Is it proper to ask God not to be deaf to us?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we asked someone not to be deaf to us, he might not be happy with us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have seen that many portions of the Psalms contain David's words according to his human concept, not God's words according to the divine concept.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We believe that all of the Scripture is God's breath and each book of the Bible is God's revelation with every line and word coming from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit 2 Tim 3:16; 2 Pet 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every line and word of the Scripture is inspired by God, but there are many words in the Bible that are not God's words.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible even contains the words of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Genesis 3 records the serpent's words to Eve vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1, 4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These words are a part of the Bible, but they are Satan's words, not God's words.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This shows that although the entire Bible is God-breathed, not all of the words in the Bible are God's words.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>B. Asking God Not to Drag Him Away</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>with the Wicked, but to Repay Them</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>according to Their Evildoings</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>David asked God not to drag him away with the wicked but to repay them according to their evildoings because they did not regard the deeds and the works of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then he said that God would tear them down and not rebuild them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Surely this speaking is according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As those in the New Testament age, we cannot ask God to repay the wicked ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the New Testament, we are charged to love our enemies and to pray for those who persecute us Matt 5:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>C. Blessing God as His Strength and His Shield</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>David blessed God as his strength and his shield, for God had heard the voice of his supplications v. 6 . Furthermore, his heart trusted in God and exulted with songs and thanks to Him v. 7 . He was blessing God, considering God as his strength within and also as his shield without.</S>
