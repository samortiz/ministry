   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not only so, Christ the Son is God s embodiment because all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, when the Son is glorified, God is also expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God s purpose in creating the universe is that His Son may be glorified and that He Himself may be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. The Means</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Genesis 1:1 the word created is bara in Hebrew, which means to bring something into existence out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, God s original creation was brought into existence out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How then in God s creation did He create?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What was the means through which He created?</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How powerful His Word is!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the other hand, the Bible clearly tells us that God created the heavens and the earth by Christ His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hebrews 1:2 says that God made the universe through His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Colossians 1:15-16 also says that all things were created in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, the Son of God is the Word of God John 1:1, 14 ; the Two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Word of God is the explanation of God; the things created through the Word of God are for the explanation of God, the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>C. The Process</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Job 38:4-7 reveals the process of God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The heavens with all the hosts and angels therein were created first.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The earth, with the living creatures dwelling therein, was created second.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Job 38 shows us that when God laid the foundation of the earth, the stars and the angels the sons of God were there already.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It also shows us that the earth created by God had been measured, with the line stretched upon it; everything was orderly and exceedingly beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not a shadow of sin nor a trace of confusion could be found in the universe then.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was altogether bright and beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This shows us how bright and beautiful the Creator is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>D. Creation Proving the Existence of God</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Psalm 19:1 says, The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth His handiwork.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although God s eternal power and divine characteristics are invisible, man can understand them by the things that were made.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man can understand and is therefore without excuse Rom 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, by looking at creation, we ought to know that there is a Creator.</S>
