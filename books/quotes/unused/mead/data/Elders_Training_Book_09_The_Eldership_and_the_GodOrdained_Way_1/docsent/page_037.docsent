   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Even with three brothers taking the lead in a certain locality there might be some troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can these troubles be resolved?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The only way is to have open, frank fellowship in love without fear.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I do not feel that anyone is doing anything against me, and I am not against anyone, so we can have open, frank fellowship in love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even though I was so busy in Taipei, I believe that if some of the brothers had come to me to let me know about some of their problems, I might have rendered some help to the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This may have required only two or three minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you come to me, you should come without fear.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am not a tiger.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am just your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some may feel that they are afraid of disturbing me and taking away my time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But when the troubles come as a result of not having the proper fellowship, my time is consumed with them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To deal with the troubles takes at least tenfold more of my time than if you would come to me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Your coming to me would save trouble, and to save trouble is to save time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When troubles like this arise, I receive many letters and phone calls.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the questions are concerning the past or the future.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is why I want to stress that the Christian life is not in yesterday or in tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The past is over, and we do not know what will happen in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Christian life is today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should be frank and open, but we may feel in wisdom that we should not touch certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If I need to say something, I say it openly to the person whom it concerns.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If I realize that more troubles will result from my touching a certain matter, then I exercise my wisdom not to touch it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If I have the real concern, I will pray concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I would not even tell my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have always kept this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I exercised myself in this way with Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I was with him for eighteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everyone who knows about our relationship can testify that we did not have the slightest problem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because I practiced this principle, I have avoided becoming involved in troubles throughout the years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I hope that all of us would practice this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we have a real concern about a certain matter involving a certain person, we should firstly pray.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we may have some frank, open fellowship in love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we realize that the by-product, the result, of our touching this matter will not be profitable, then we should exercise our wisdom not to touch it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can leave this matter to the sovereignty of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we have a burden, we can simply pray.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we will never create any problems or any different speaking in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I may have the best heart for the Lord's recovery, but I may come with the best heart to a brother and say something that can still be misunderstood by him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all have to learn from now on to say things carefully and to do things carefully in every way.</S>
