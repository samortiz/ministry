<h2 class=head2>The Law of Life with the Power of Life</h2><p>We also have the law of life. Hebrews 8:10 and Romans 8:2 speak of the inner law, the law of life. Whereas a nature has a taste, a law is for regulating. We have an inner regulation regulating us all the time. By regeneration we have the three of the Triune God and the divine life, divine nature, and the law of life. Because we have the divine life and nature, out from this life with this nature we have the inner law of life.<p>With every kind of life with its nature there is a certain law. To eat mice is according to the law of the cat life, and to bark is according to the law of the dog life. In the same way, for an apple tree to bear apples is according to its law. An apple tree bears apples and a peach tree bears peaches because they have different lives with different laws. Within the life there is the regulating power. There is no need to regulate an apple tree, saying, “Little tree, you must remember you are an apple tree. You must bear apples, not peaches.” Likewise, there is no need to tell a dog, “You must remember you are a dog. Don’t forget to bark; that is a dog’s duty.” In actuality, it is hard to stop a dog from barking because barking is according to its law.<p>A law is not only a regulation but also a power. The law of gravity, for example, is a power according to the natural law. That a tree brings forth apples is not only according to its law; it is according to its power and energy. If we have a certain law, we have both a regulating and a power within us. Oh, we Christians need our eyes to be opened to see these wonderful matters within us! We have the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine law of life within us. There is no need to throw something up and then worry how it will come down. The more we do something out of worry, the more we may hinder it from coming down. We should keep silent and watch the power of gravity. In the same way, we should keep silent and watch the inner law within us. It is not only a regulating factor; it is also a power. Many Christians think that one day power will come down upon us. They do not realize that they have the inner power. Like the atomic power in small atoms, the real and greatest power is the one within us.<h2 class=head2>The Anointing as the Moving of the Triune God</h2><p>By regeneration we also have the anointing (1 John 2:27). This is not only the ointment itself but the anointing as the action, the moving, of the ointment. The anointing is the moving of the Holy Spirit, or we may say, the moving of the Triune God. There is always something moving within us.<p>When we are regenerated, we immediately have God the Father, God the Son, God the Spirit, the eternal life, the divine nature, the law of life, and the anointing. These seven are actually one. God the Father is in God the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the very essence of the divine life. The divine life is nothing other than the Triune God, and the divine nature is something of this life. If we have the life, we have the nature; if we do not have the life, we do not have the nature. We cannot separate these two. The law of life comes from the life with the nature, and the anointing is the moving and acting of the Triune God in the Spirit. Therefore, the three of the Triune God are life to us with His nature, so we have the law of life and the anointing as something so living in us.<p>If we are to know the things of life, we must be clear about these seven items. Otherwise, we will not be able to grow in life in an adequate way. In the early years of my Christian life I was not clear about these matters, so I was not happy at that time. Since I have become clear about these seven items, I have been a happy Christian. I realize that I have God, Christ, and the Spirit in me, and I have the divine life, the divine nature, the law of life, and the anointing. Some men are great, having a high position, high education, and millions of dollars, but inwardly I am greater. I have God, and many of them do not, so they are poor, pitiful people. I have Christ and the Spirit, and they do not. I have the divine life, the divine nature, the law of life, and the anointing, but they do not. All they have is dung, refuse, nothing of any worth. By regeneration the Triune God—the Father in the Son as the Spirit—has wrought Himself into us as our life with the divine nature, so we have a living law within us and the anointing of God Himself. On the one hand, we need to be humble, but on the other hand, we should not look down on ourselves. We must realize that we are big persons, for all the spiritual riches with the fullness of the Godhead are in us.
