   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Offering the Fat and the Blood</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How do the circumcised, faithful, and qualified persons serve the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, they have to offer the fat and the blood of the offerings 44:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The most precious part of the offering is the fat which typifies the precious Person of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The blood signifies the redemptive work of Christ, but the fat signifies His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fat we present to God is the precious Person of Christ, and the blood we present to God is the redemptive work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Please remember that in typology, the fat of all the offerings typifies the precious Person of the Lord Jesus, and the blood typifies the Lord's all-inclusive redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In all our service to God, we must present the precious Person and the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not Wearing Any Woolen Garment</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the priests came in to minister to the Lord, they were not to wear any woolen garment 44:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, while they were in the Lord's presence serving Him, they had to wear a linen garment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the Bible, linen signifies a living and behavior that is pure, clean, and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The linen garment signifies our daily walk, our daily living, in the life-giving Spirit by the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The priests were not to wear woolen garments because they would become too warm and would begin to sweat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to Genesis 3:19, sweat is a sign of God's curse.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because fallen man is under God's curse, he must sweat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Under the curse, man is short of God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, man must sweat to produce something; he must exercise his own energy which causes sweating.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Lord's service there is no need for us to use our own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we use our own strength to endeavor and struggle, it proves that we are not under the Lord's blessing, but rather under the Lord's curse.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Lord's recovery, as we serve the Lord, we need to avoid and even escape from any kind of self-energy, self-struggle, and self-endeavor.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not push anything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If something is from the Lord, surely the Lord will grant His abundant blessing upon it and He will work it out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Himself will work it out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no need for us to push and to endeavor and to struggle and to energize to such an extent that eventually we are fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the church service we all have to be in the life-giving Spirit living by the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not exercise our natural strength and push anything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the contrary, many times we need to back off a little and to give in. This means that we give in to the Lord and then we put the Lord on the spot.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can tell the Lord, "Lord, if this burden is something of You, I will stay back, and You have to come in. You have to come forward.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I will give in and You have to take up the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This will confirm my burden so that I may know it is really of You."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is absolutely no need for us to strive and fight in our service to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not Being Defiled by Dead Persons</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In addition to this, a priest who would serve the Lord directly in His presence cannot be defiled by any dead person 44:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not go to the dead persons.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not touch the dead carcasses.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you realize that some Christians are dead persons?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are dead and stinking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By going to such Christians and listening to them, you will become half-dead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then a lot of stinking and death will come out of your own mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You will have nothing positive to say; you will only speak in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You will say that the elders are wrong, the co-workers are wrong, the young people are wrong, the old people are wrong, everyone is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Your contact with such a dead person has caused you also to be dead and negative.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever you realize that you are with such people, you have to run away; otherwise, you will be defiled by their death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To be defiled by death is more serious than to be defiled by something sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you touch something sinful, you can confess and apply the blood and right away you are cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when you are defiled by touching a dead person, it will take you at least seven days to be cleansed Num 19:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You will need a period of time to be purified and purged from the stinking of death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I believe that you have had this kind of experience in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After talking only a short while with a certain person, you could not pray or function in the meetings for a week.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You became half-dead.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Be careful about spending time with dead persons.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Stay away from them!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not think that you can help the dead persons.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No, rather, their death will spread to you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In some of the churches, a few saints are dead people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They are very alive to movies, to sin, to worldly things, and to negative talk but they are absolutely dead to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As far as the church life goes, they are really dead persons.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Unfortunately, they are not yet buried.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I hope they will soon be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you would serve the Lord, you must keep yourself undefiled.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Always stay away from dead persons.</S>
