   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many believers treat the Holy Spirit's occasional working in their spirit as the most wonderful experiences of their life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They do not expect to have such experiences daily.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They consider these as special occasions, possibly occurring only a few times in a lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If they followed the spirit according to the law of the spirit, they would see their life becoming so transcendent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nevertheless, they regard spiritual experiences as extraordinary and impossible to maintain constantly, not realizing that spiritual experiences should be their ordinary daily experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To depart from this position and live in darkness is what is truly extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes we seemingly receive a certain thought.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we know how to discern, we can tell whether this thought is from our spirit or from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some thoughts are burning in the spirit, but some are merely anxieties in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Believers must learn to differentiate between them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After examination, a believer can easily discern between spiritual and soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, at all times, a believer must know how each part of his whole being is functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When thinking, he ought to know the source of his thought; when feeling, the source of his feeling; and when working, what power to use.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Consequently, we can know what is from the spirit and follow it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can also be kept from working according to feeling, and we can know whether the things that happen to us are of the spirit or the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We know that our soul is our "self-consciousness."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, much of our self-examination and self-consciousness are completely of the soul and harmful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This kind of self-examination and self-consciousness causes a believer to constantly consider himself, resulting in the growth of the self-life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Self-exaltation often comes from this self-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, one kind of self-analysis provides indispensable knowledge for the spiritual journey, enabling a believer to truly know where he is and how he is walking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Harmful self-consciousness includes those proud or discouraging thoughts derived from considering one's own successes or failures.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Beneficial self-analysis concerns itself only with those considerations that investigate the source of thoughts, feelings, and preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God desires that we should get rid of self-consciousness, but He does not mean that we should live in the world brainlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Excessive self-consciousness must be eliminated; but at the same time, we should know, through the Holy Spirit, what is going on within our own inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, it is necessary to carefully observe the activities of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many believers, although regenerated, seem to feel that they do not have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, it is not that they do not have a spirit, but only that they do not feel that they do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One can have the sense of the spirit, but not know that these feelings come from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For every genuine, born-again believer, the real life to live by is the life of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If he is willing to learn, he will see what the sense of his spirit really is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One thing is certain, the soul can be affected by the outward world, but not the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, after seeing beautiful scenery, enjoying peaceful nature, hearing melodious music, or touching many other outward surroundings, the soul can be immediately moved, resulting in a kind of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, this is not so with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the spirit of a believer is filled with the power of the Holy Spirit, it is independent of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Unlike the soul, which depends on outward influences for its activities, the spirit can move on its own.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, the spirit can function in any kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, if a believer is truly spiritual, he can continue to work, whether his soul has any feeling or his body has any strength, because he lives according to the continually active spirit.</S>
