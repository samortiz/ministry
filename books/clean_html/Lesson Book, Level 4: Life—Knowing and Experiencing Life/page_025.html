Between the time we are regenerated till the time we are matured, we will face many situations that we may not be happy about. If we are not clear about consecration and are not consecrated, then we may not be able to finish the course like the apostle Paul (2 Tim. 4:7-8). When we are supposed to run the race, we may run away from situations instead of experiencing life to grow. Therefore, we must be properly consecrated in order to go on and grow properly.<p>[In a normal condition these two experiences, salvation and consecration, are closely related. A saved person should be a consecrated person. Once a person is saved, he should consecrate himself to the Lord. To be saved without being consecrated is a very abnormal condition. Our gospel work must be done strongly to such an extent that people will immediately consecrate themselves as soon as they are saved.]<h2 class=head1>I. THE BASIS OF CONSECRATION</h2><p>[On what basis must we consecrate ourselves to God? On what basis does God require us to consecrate ourselves to Him? We need to have a basis for whatever we do. For example, when we move into a house and live in it, it is because we have paid a price and rented or bought it. This renting or purchasing is the basis upon which we live there. Our God is one who is most legal and one who acts most reasonably. All His doings are legal and have a basis. He cannot obtain something in the universe without paying a price, and He also cannot demand something from us without a basis. When God, therefore, demands that we consecrate ourselves to Him, it cannot be without a basis. In this matter, He has a very solid basis, that is, His purchase. He has already bought us. He can, therefore, demand that we consecrate ourselves to Him.<p>First Corinthians 6:20 says, “You were bought with a price.’’ Our consecration is based on this purchase of God. God has bought us with none other than the precious blood shed by His beloved Son on the cross (1 Pet. 1:19). God used this precious blood as the price to buy us, that we may belong to Him. Galatians 4:5 says, “That he might redeem them that were under the law.’’ Because we became sinners, we fell under God’s law and were kept and retained by this law. If God, therefore, wanted to release us from under His righteous law, He must pay the full price to satisfy the demand of His law. This price is the precious blood shed by His Son. Formerly we belonged to the law, but now we belong to God. The right of ownership over us has been transferred from the law to the hand of God. It is on the basis of this transfer of right that God demands that we consecrate ourselves to Him.]<p>If we are clear about the right of ownership, we would consecrate ourselves to God immediately and continuously. We will never dare to think, speak or do things that are not of the divine life. We will refresh our consecration every morning and every day. It does not depend on our mood, it is based upon the fact of God’s purchase. [Each time something occurs that causes us to argue with God, we must bow before Him and say, “Lord, I am the slave You bought. My right of ownership has been purchased by You. I here and now declare Your right. Even in this matter I will let You be the Lord and decide for me.’’ Every time we depart from the position of consecration, we should feel that we are in a state of rebellion similar to that of Onesimus, the slave who fled from his master, Philemon.]<p>Many of us may still be runaway slaves. We must repent to the Lord right now and consecrate ourselves to Him again or for the first time. When we do this, right away we will experience life and grow.
