   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LOVING GOD Issue No. 37 Scripture Reading: Matt 22:37-38</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Several months ago, a certain Western missionary passed away in Fukien province.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I once remarked that among the people I have known, she was a very deep person in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since I am more knowledgeable about her affairs, I have considered writing a biography for her and have been collecting her lectures, articles, and essays for editing purposes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A package of her belongings arrived several days ago including a piece of paper with the following words written on it: "O God, I thank You, because You have a commandment saying you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind!"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How profound this is!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I do not know how many Christians would say, "God, I thank You because You have a commandment which says you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Indeed, since we are all believers, we ought to love God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No other religion speaks of loving God like ours.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Loving God is unique to Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible says that he who believes in the Son has life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Believing is adequate because it does not say to believe with all your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He that believes will have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are never told to believe with all our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, loving God requires all our heart, all our soul, and all our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the first commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No matter where it is placed, this commandment is always the first.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is also the greatest commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Wherever it may be, it is the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today we must praise God for commanding us to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God desires that we love Him because this profits Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To believe in the Lord and have eternal life are for our profit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God not only wants us to believe in Him, but also to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Loving God profits Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What kind of condition will we enjoy if we love God?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must look at several matters:</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First John 2:15 says, "Do not love the world nor the things in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If any man loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The love of the Father is something that can be put in us or can leave us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we let this love of the Father be placed in us, we are able to love the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many young ones cannot forsake the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When they are stirred by others in a meeting, it seems that they will not love the world anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At a different time they seem to be totally inseparable from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must possess something better within us in order to drop the heart that loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once there was an art exhibition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>While most of the works could be appreciated from a distance, it was necessary to study one of the paintings from close-up in order to understand its meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This particular painting, involving a child who was oblivious to all the lovely toys on the floor surrounding him, aptly illustrates a Christian's experience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The child's attention was focused on the windowsill, and he had up-lifted eyes and outstretched arms.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The scene was perplexing from a distance, yet after careful observation, one could see a beautiful dove on the windowsill.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The caption explained that in order to have the little dove, the child dropped all the toys on the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The moral of the painting was that one only discards the second best for the very best.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God never demands that we throw anything away.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He only places what is better in front of us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to obtain it, we will spontaneously forsake many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A young believer who lived with me for two months once told me that he could not forsake the world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He told an old believer, "You can sacrifice because you have tasted all that this world has to offer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But I cannot."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This young man knew about believing in God, but not about loving God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>While believing in God can save us from sin, only loving God will deliver us from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brothers and sisters, we must allow God's love to enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once the love of God enters, the world simply slips away.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First John 4:20 says, "If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is a familiar verse to many, including unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This verse does not refer to loving the brother in your family, but your brother in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although the attitudes and behavior of many discourage you from loving them, once God's love enters into you, you will be able to love them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not loving the brother whom you love, but all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is also not loving a lovable brother, but all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you do not love all the brothers, the love of the Father is not in you; but if you have the love of God, you cannot help but love them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The father of a man was killed; afterwards, the man was determined to get revenge.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, he was a genuine Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>During the bread-breaking meeting one day, he found himself, along with others around a huge round table, sitting next to his adversary, the one who had killed his father.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He left the table and went out because a battle had risen up within him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Should he kill him, or should he return to take the bread with him?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At that instant God showed him the love of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He saw that though he himself was an enemy to God, Christ saved him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He was melted by God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Wiping his tears, he went in to break bread with his enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When they were leaving, he no longer looked upon the man as his adversary, but his brother in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we truly have the love of God, we are able to love even an unlovable brother.</S>
