   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some may feel that this is an old subject, but I want to fellowship about this matter in a newer way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My thought concerning the way to meet and to serve has been revolutionized.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>FOR PRACTICING THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>VISITING PEOPLE REGULARLY</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For gospel preaching, for feeding the lambs, and for perfecting the saints the first three steps of the God-ordained way the very unique need is to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To visit people is to go to them and stay with them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You have to speak with them face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you were to visit someone every week for ten minutes, you could surely gain that person in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The biblical way for us to gain people is to visit them, to spend time with them face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I hope that you will take my advice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Try to select three persons of your choice, and go to them once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not put them together to have a small meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may visit the first one on Monday, the second one on Wednesday, and the third one on Saturday.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Go to them separately.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Just go to visit them and see them one by one every week, spending ten minutes with each of them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You do not need to speak too much.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Try to do this for half a year.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I assure you that they will be gained by you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They will even follow you to practice the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In addition to bringing this God-ordained way to all the churches, we are burdened for the release of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why we are looking to the Lord to complete our Life-study of the books of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The practice of the church life, however, must match this study of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In my present training of the elders, I do not want to pass on more teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I must stress one thing the elders have to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You should endeavor to contact three people daily or about twenty people a week.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you contact these people, there is no need for you to talk too much.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Just go to see them.</S>
