<h2 class="head1">THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:1-6 is the praise of the great multitude of the saints, the angels, and all creatures. After this, verse 7 says, &ldquo;Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.&rdquo; On the negative side, the praise to God is for the fall of Babylon the Great, while on the positive side, it is because of the readiness of the glorious bride. These two women are the main focus of the prophecy in chapters twelve through twenty-two. In these chapters we see the destruction of the harlot and the readiness of the bride. One woman is brought to an end, and the other woman is made ready for the marriage of the Lamb.</p>
<p>Verse 8 continues, &ldquo;And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints.&rdquo; Strictly speaking, the fine linen is not the righteousness (that is, Christ) that we received for our salvation (1 Cor. 1:30). Rather, it is the righteous acts which are our living out of Christ. In this sense, we may speak of two steps of justification. The first step is to be justified in Christ that we might be saved, while the second step is to be justified in the eyes of God by a daily walk, a living, of righteousnesses. This living, this daily walk, the righteousnesses signified by the fine linen, is the outworking of Christ as life within us. The first aspect of justification is sufficient for us to be saved, while the second aspect is required for us to attend the marriage of the Lamb.</p>
<p>The word <em>righteousnesses</em> in Revelation 19:8 is plural, referring to righteous deeds. The righteousness that is Christ Himself is sufficient for us to be justified and saved; this is righteousness in the singular number. The use of <em>righteousnesses</em> in the plural, however, proves that what is mentioned in verse 8 is not Christ as our righteousness for us to be justified. Rather, it is righteous deeds, the daily walk, the Christian living, which Christ as our life works out through us. This outworking of the inner life is the white linen with which we are clothed. In order to attend a feast, especially a wedding feast, we must dress in a proper way. In the same way, we need the proper clothing in order to attend the wedding feast of the Lamb.</p>
<p>Verse 9 says, &ldquo;And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they who are called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true words of God.&rdquo; This wedding feast of the Lamb will last for one thousand years. The thousand years will be a wedding day, for with the Lord a thousand years is as one day (2 Pet. 3:8). To be invited to attend the wedding feast is to have the privilege of sharing the millennial kingdom as co-kings with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAR AT ARMAGEDDON</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:11 through 13 say, &ldquo;And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. And His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems, and He has a name written which no one knows but Himself. And He is clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and His name is called the Word of God.&rdquo; The One on the white horse is the wonderful Christ Himself. His being clothed with a garment dipped in blood is related to His treading of the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God (v. 15; Isa. 63:1-3). That His name is called the Word of God means that He is the expression, the testimony, and the speaking of God.</p>
<p>Revelation 19:14 says, &ldquo;And the armies which are in heaven followed Him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and clean.&rdquo; These armies are the saints, those spoken of in 17:14, which says that the beast and the ten kings &ldquo;will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and they who are with Him, the called and chosen and faithful, will also overcome them.&rdquo; <em>They who are with Him</em> are the overcoming saints who become the heavenly army. The Lord does not want to fight the battle by Himself. In principle, when the Lord deals with the enemy, He needs the saints as His armies.</p>
<p>The fine linen in 19:14 is the fine linen of the bride of the Lamb in verse 8, indicating that those who attend the wedding feast become the armies to fight the battle.</p>
<p>Verse 15a says, &ldquo;And out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword, that with it He might smite the nations; and He will shepherd them with an iron rod.&rdquo; This is the fulfillment of Psalm 2:8-9, which tells us that Christ will rule the nations with an iron rod.</p>
<p>Revelation 19:20 says that the beast and the false prophet were seized and &ldquo;cast alive into the lake of fire, which burns with brimstone.&rdquo; These two had already died but were raised again, not by God but by Satan. Now they will be the first to go directly into the lake of fire, without passing through further death or resurrection like all the others who perish.</p>
<p>Verse 21 says, &ldquo;And the rest were killed with the sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh.&rdquo; This takes place at the battle of Armageddon which is the treading of the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God. The grapes in this winepress are the kings, armies, and followers of Antichrist. Their intention is to fight against Christ, but God&rsquo;s intention is to bring them together into the winepress so that Christ can come to tread on them and bring them to an end.</p>
