   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Jesus is today's Moses</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Jesus is really wise.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our speech is always so stupid, but the Lord Jesus always speaks in a very simple and pleasing tone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He did not rebuke Peter and tell him that he should not have said yes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord was not so coarse, so rough as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was outside of tradition and religion, but he was nicely outside of them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He asked Peter, "What thinkest thou Simon?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The kings of the earth, from whom do they receive toll or tribute? from their sons, or from strangers?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>17:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He spoke very nicely to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then Peter answered, "From strangers."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus replied, "Therefore the sons are free."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He said in effect, "You have already heard on the mountain top that I am the Son of God; therefore, I am free from this tribute.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This tribute is collected for my Father's house, and I am the Father's Son; so I am free."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then Peter should have said something like this to the Lord: "Oh, I'm sorry, Lord; I should not have said 'yes,' I should have said 'no.'</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anyhow, now what shall I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Peter said yes, the Lord Jesus found a way to convince him that it should have been no. However, after Peter was convinced that he should have said no, Jesus said unto him, "But..." v. 27 . You can never beat the Lord Jesus in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"But lest we cause them to stumble,...take, and give unto them for me and thee."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we say yes, the Lord says no, and then when we are convinced to say no, He says yes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord is really troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually what is right and what is wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Should it be yes or should it be no?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, there is no right or wrong, no yes or no only Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With the same case, when you say yes, he may say no, and when you say no, He may say yes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But whatever He says is right.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Hear ye Him!"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Jesus only!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is today's Moses; He is today's Lawgiver; He is the law today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no more Moses; there is only Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not hear what the Old Testament says; hear Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In any case, whatever you say is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even if you are scriptural, you are still wrong; even if you are fundamental, you are still wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not a matter of being scriptural or fundamental, but a matter of Christ, a matter of the living, up-to-date, present Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everything depends on such a One.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no law, no teaching, no regulations only Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And not a Jesus in doctrine but a Jesus who is so living, so instant, and so present.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some young brothers have been greatly troubled over the matter of a haircut.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How should they cut their hair?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In what style?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I will tell you, go to Jesus and ask Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>See what your living Jesus would say.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no religion, no culture, no regulation, only Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the summer of 1969 there was quite an influx of ex-hippies into the church in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They came in with long hair, long beards, sandals, and corresponding attire.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some brothers came to me at the time and said, "Brother. be careful, we might end up being a 'hippie' church."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I answered them that I do not stand on either side: I am not for the hippies, and I am not against the hippies.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today it is not a matter of right or wrong, but absolutely a matter of the living, up-to-date Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When He says, "Long hair!" then you may leave your hair long.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When He says, "Short hair!" then you must cut your hair.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When you go for a haircut, just say, "O Lord Jesus, how long?"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then you will know how long.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Ask the Lord, "O Lord Jesus, what style?"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then you will know what style.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I would say a word in regard to the sisters and their skirts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I do not know how long is long and how short is short.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You go to the presence of Jesus and ask Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Jesus is within you; see what He says.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You will know; the living Jesus will tell you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you go to the sixty-six books of the Bible, there is not one verse to tell you how long your skirts should be.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You must go to the living Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do not argue and reason go to Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some like to make laws for themselves, and some like to make laws for others.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Immediately they become today's Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do not make laws for yourselves, and do not make any laws for others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hear ye Him!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When it came to the application, Peter not only forgot Christ, but also his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the tribute men came, if I were Peter and had learned my lesson, I would have called the Lord and my other brothers James and John and asked them to deal with the tribute men.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then I would have received the help I needed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You see, this is the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Peter saw the vision, but Peter forgot the whole thing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>With Peter there was no Christ, no Church, no Head, and no Body only Peter himself.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is our problem.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Today, in all our situations, we must remember our Head and also the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Do not say yes or no, do not say anything, do not make any decisions until you have come to the Head and also to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are so accustomed to being individualistic.</S>
